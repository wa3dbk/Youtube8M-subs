00:00:00.177 --> 00:00:01.846
(cosmic ping)

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.538
- We've had a few episodes[br]about comic book characters

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:06.521
who may or may not be rip-offs

00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:08.065
of other pre-existing characters.

00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:09.710
But it seems the comments section

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.977
always boils down into three camps:

00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:15.086
said characters are a rip-off,[br]they aren't a rip-off,

00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:17.138
and does it even matter?

00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:21.309
(driving rock)

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:24.263
Welcome to Comic Misconceptions.

00:00:24.283 --> 00:00:27.461
I am Scott, and you know there[br]are really a few key things

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.446
to get comics fans to[br]fight with one another,

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.251
but it usually has to do with pitting

00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:33.527
two or more characters against each other.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.213
Whether it's who would win in a fight,

00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:38.084
who's the smartest, fastest,[br]strongest, whatever,

00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:39.628
or my favorite, what characters

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:42.151
are just lazy rip-offs[br]of other characters.

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:44.403
And while I believe that[br]the definitive title

00:00:44.403 --> 00:00:46.361
for the smartest, fastest,[br]strongest character

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:49.191
is simply whoever the writers[br]want it to be this week.

00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:51.742
I do think that we can at[br]least address the issue

00:00:51.742 --> 00:00:54.416
of these so-called rip-off[br]characters in comics.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:57.582
I think there's a lot of[br]interesting stuff to discuss here.

00:00:57.582 --> 00:00:59.123
So, by all means, just ignore everything

00:00:59.123 --> 00:01:00.755
I'm about to say and go into the comments

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:02.898
to rant about who ripped[br]off your favorite character.

00:01:02.898 --> 00:01:04.677
Neil Adams once said that within a year,

00:01:04.677 --> 00:01:07.022
you had Superman, who was so powerful

00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:10.174
he could move planets,[br]and then you had Batman

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:11.846
who had no powers at all.

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:13.080
He was the exact opposite.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.660
All other superheroes would fit in-between

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.306
these two characters.

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:20.097
So in that sense, just about[br]every comic book character

00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:21.787
could be considered a rip-off

00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:23.546
of these two in some capacity.

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:25.984
But it's not like the idea[br]for Superman and Batman

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:27.139
came out of nowhere,

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:28.425
Siegel and Shuster were inspired

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:31.333
by Hercules and Sampson[br]when they created Superman.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.935
And his costume drew inspiration

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:36.180
from Flash Gordon and aliens[br]from old pulp magazines,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.456
mixed with a little bit[br]of circus strong man

00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:40.348
thrown in there with the red trunks.

00:01:40.348 --> 00:01:42.821
Batman creators Bill Finger and Bob Kane

00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:46.411
also had a slew of influences,[br]from The Shadow, Zorro,

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.617
The Phantom, Dick Tracy, Sherlock Holmes,

00:01:48.617 --> 00:01:50.580
and the list just goes on.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.028
And everyone of those were inspired

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.442
by something else as well.

00:01:53.442 --> 00:01:55.415
The Shadow, for instance,[br]was partly inspired

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.309
by Bram Stoker's Dracula,[br]which was partly inspired

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:00.312
by Varney the Vampire, which, hey,

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:03.331
also went around and[br]inspired a Marvel character

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.979
named Varney the First Vampire.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.687
It's actually kind of a fun game,

00:02:07.687 --> 00:02:10.157
trying to backtrack[br]influences and inspirations,

00:02:10.157 --> 00:02:13.196
and it happens with[br]everything that people create.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.413
Take a look at this show[br]you're watching right now,

00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:18.084
the always wonderful Comic Misconceptions.

00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:19.952
My influences, probably obviously,

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:22.133
were Variant, Idea Channel, Game Theory,

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.446
Cracked, and a lot of others.

00:02:24.446 --> 00:02:26.353
And maybe that's the idea for creation

00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:28.829
to have lots of influences,[br]instead of just one.

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.721
Perhaps that's what makes a rip-off

00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:32.648
seem less like a rip-off.

00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:33.934
Playwright Wilson Misener once said

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:36.056
that if you copy from one[br]author, it's plagiarism.

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:38.110
If you copy from two, it's research.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.712
Author Austin Kleon said[br]that art is 99% robbery,

00:02:41.712 --> 00:02:43.998
and even outlines what[br]is good and bad theft

00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:45.806
in his book, Steal Like An Artist.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:47.608
One of the key traits[br]is to steal from many

00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:50.912
while also being sure to transform[br]and remix what you steal.

00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:52.485
We've talked before about how the creators

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:53.771
of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:56.566
Kevin Eastman and Peter[br]Laird, were openly copying

00:02:56.566 --> 00:02:58.266
and parodying other comics

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:01.221
like Daredevil, Ronin,[br]New Mutants, and Cerebus.

00:03:01.221 --> 00:03:03.184
They took from many sources,

00:03:03.184 --> 00:03:04.957
while still giving it their own spin.

00:03:04.957 --> 00:03:07.084
And now, we have the[br]heroes in a half-shell,

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.337
so obviously the stealing stuff works.

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:11.902
But why is stealing even[br]necessary in the first place?

00:03:11.902 --> 00:03:14.283
Why don't comic book writers[br]and artists just come up

00:03:14.283 --> 00:03:16.240
with their own 100% original creation

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.312
and avoid stealing altogether?

00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:19.827
Well, to put it frankly,

00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:22.530
there is no such thing as originality.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.159
As Kleon puts it, "Nothing[br]comes from nowhere.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.812
"All creative work builds[br]on what came before.

00:03:27.812 --> 00:03:30.087
"Nothing is completely original."

00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:31.980
Creativity requires influence.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.125
You need a foundation of[br]knowledge and understanding

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:36.755
before you can even begin to be creative.

00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:40.023
Musicians practice scales,[br]and cover other artists' songs

00:03:40.023 --> 00:03:41.666
before they can start making their own.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:44.251
Great authors read a lot, and so on.

00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:46.690
So is it really any surprise[br]that comic book writers

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.370
and artists are often accused of stealing

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.173
from other writers and artists?

00:03:50.173 --> 00:03:52.001
When you think about it comic books,

00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:55.839
at least how we know them[br]today, are fairly new art form.

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.458
Where music dates back many millennia

00:03:57.458 --> 00:03:59.821
and it's had plenty of time[br]to evolve and branch off

00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:01.725
into drastically different genres,

00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:03.525
the comic on the other[br]hand only dates back

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:06.598
to the 19th Century with superhero comics

00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:08.363
seeing a boom in the early 20th Century.

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:10.386
And you really can't argue[br]that superhero comics are,

00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:13.367
by far, the most successful type of comic,

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:16.073
especially during the[br]incredible Silver Age,

00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:18.386
when Marvel and DC[br]started dominating sales

00:04:18.386 --> 00:04:19.642
with their costumed characters,

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:21.792
since the Comics Code[br]Authority helped shut down

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:24.739
other popular genres, like[br]crime and horror comics.

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:27.154
So when you have these[br]comic writers and artists

00:04:27.154 --> 00:04:29.859
who are all reading other[br]comics that predominantly

00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:32.262
feature superheroes, that's where

00:04:32.262 --> 00:04:34.327
they'll pull their inspiration from.

00:04:34.327 --> 00:04:36.678
If you're a musician, and[br]all you ever listen to

00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:38.671
is one genre, like Country music,

00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:40.245
then of course your songs

00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:42.172
are going to sound like Country music.

00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:44.224
You could copy elements[br]from different artists,

00:04:44.224 --> 00:04:45.803
but it's still gonna be Country,

00:04:45.803 --> 00:04:47.829
and the Internet is still[br]probably gonna make fun of you.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.661
When your list of influences is small,

00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:51.711
then your creations start to seem

00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:53.732
like rip-offs instead of remixes.

00:04:53.732 --> 00:04:56.340
Now simply acknowledging[br]that nothing is original

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.421
and we all steal ideas from somewhere else

00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:00.424
sounds like a good idea in theory,

00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:01.522
it's nice in sentiment,

00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:04.001
but what if the tables were turned?

00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:05.595
What if you are the one being robbed?

00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:07.246
In his documentary, Everything is a Remix,

00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:09.439
Kirby Ferguson explains that people tend

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.511
to put a higher value[br]on losses than gains.

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:14.871
So when we steal from[br]others, it's no big deal.

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:16.134
It's just how things work.

00:05:16.134 --> 00:05:18.310
But when we are the[br]ones being stolen from,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.563
then suddenly we're gonna get territorial.

00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:23.515
In the simplest of terms,[br]copying is absolutely fine

00:05:23.515 --> 00:05:25.570
so long as we're the ones doing it.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.954
As we discussed at the top of the show,

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:28.609
Superman was heavily inspired

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:29.863
by others that came before him.

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.101
But when Superman started[br]growing in popularity,

00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:34.481
DC made it a point to sue anyone

00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:36.051
who copied any aspect of the character

00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:37.981
in order to protect their property.

00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:39.746
You'll recall that this is what happened

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:41.865
with the Fawcett Comics[br]and Captain Marvel case.

00:05:41.865 --> 00:05:43.316
And I think this not only applies

00:05:43.316 --> 00:05:45.146
to the creators of comic book characters,

00:05:45.146 --> 00:05:47.110
but also to the fans of these characters.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.929
Fans of Green Arrow can accept

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:51.298
that the Emerald Archer is[br]really just a simple cross

00:05:51.298 --> 00:05:52.592
between Robin Hood and Batman,

00:05:52.592 --> 00:05:54.804
but Hawkeye is totally a rip-off.

00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:56.984
Even though we, as fans,[br]aren't actually losing anything

00:05:56.984 --> 00:05:59.309
when our favorite characters are taken

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:01.680
and remixed by others, it[br]still feels like we need

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.166
to defend and protect them.

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:04.548
Our favorite characters are kind of

00:06:04.548 --> 00:06:06.127
like a part of our identity.

00:06:06.127 --> 00:06:08.698
And maybe when someone[br]say's they're unoriginal,

00:06:08.698 --> 00:06:11.469
we sort of feel like they're[br]calling us unoriginal,

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.065
and that's why we get[br]into these crazy debates

00:06:14.065 --> 00:06:16.526
about whether or not Deadpool[br]is a rip-off of Deathstroke.

00:06:16.526 --> 00:06:17.689
Now I know what is probably

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:19.179
been on your mind since the start,

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:21.754
"Scott, there is a[br]difference between characters

00:06:21.754 --> 00:06:24.389
"who were inspired by[br]others, and characters

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.737
"that were just obviously[br]shameless rip-offs."

00:06:26.737 --> 00:06:27.992
I completely understand what you mean,

00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:29.860
but I personally kind of find

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.724
that distinction to be irrelevant.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.936
I think we just need to[br]accept that everything

00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:36.713
was inspired by something[br]that came before it.

00:06:36.713 --> 00:06:38.728
So it shouldn't really[br]matter if one character

00:06:38.728 --> 00:06:40.464
seems like they're just a carbon copy

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:42.065
of one that came before them.

00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:45.295
It's not important how a[br]character was initially created,

00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:47.629
what's important is what the writers do

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:49.327
with that character that will make them

00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:50.954
even just a little bit different.

00:06:50.954 --> 00:06:53.392
So let's stop being caught[br]up in all these arguments

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:56.405
about who is and isn't[br]a shameless rip-off.

00:06:56.405 --> 00:07:00.056
As Nobel Prize winning[br]author Andre Geim said,

00:07:00.056 --> 00:07:03.027
"Everything that needs to be[br]said has already been said,

00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:05.456
"But since no one was listening,

00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:07.317
"everything must be said again."

00:07:07.317 --> 00:07:08.213
What do you guys think?

00:07:08.213 --> 00:07:10.136
Does it really matter if[br]certain comic book characters

00:07:10.136 --> 00:07:12.785
are rip-offs of other[br]pre-existing characters?

00:07:12.785 --> 00:07:15.277
Do you ever think we'll stop[br]fighting over this stuff?

00:07:15.277 --> 00:07:18.088
Let me know your thoughts in the comments.

00:07:18.088 --> 00:07:20.134
And, just for fun, I would[br]love to see you trace

00:07:20.134 --> 00:07:22.537
the influences for your[br]favorite comic book character

00:07:22.537 --> 00:07:24.052
as far back as you can.

00:07:24.052 --> 00:07:25.840
That might be super interesting.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.283
And if this is your first time hanging out

00:07:27.283 --> 00:07:29.492
with us here at NerdSync, we[br]make new videos every week

00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:32.351
that ask questions and examine[br]comic beyond the surface,

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.457
cause we believe that doing so

00:07:34.457 --> 00:07:37.848
can actually enhance your[br]comic book reading experience.

00:07:37.848 --> 00:07:40.437
And make comics just a[br]little bit more awesome.

00:07:40.437 --> 00:07:42.869
So make sure you hit that[br]big, sexy subscribe button

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:44.584

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.452
I better see you right here on Friday,

00:07:51.452 --> 00:07:54.175
for a tie-in video. Alright, see ya.
