00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:02.790
this is going to be a tutorial

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.140
for the embroidery chain

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.919
I have done it over here

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.449
with my four ply yarn

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:12.780
and I found that

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.939
it was kind of thick

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.519
so what i did was

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.510
I just took

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.039
my four ply yarn and took it apart in to 2 ply yarn

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.420
so that is what I am working with

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.169
I have  just attached it on over here

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.650
I have done a couple of them already

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.749
you just take and you put it

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:38.350
through your previous

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.760
stitch

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.420
you run it up here

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.550
just like that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.460
so you can make stems, or lettering

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.680

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.900

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.650
designs or shapes that you want to make out of this

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.230
whimsical little shapes

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.270
geometrical shapes

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.379

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.660
shape to make your square more interesting

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.830

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.400
