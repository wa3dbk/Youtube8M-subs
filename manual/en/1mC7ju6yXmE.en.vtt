00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.040
This episode of The Basic Filmmaker is brought
to you by:

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.510
Gears!

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.349
Gear envy...(sigh)

00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:22.420
I get a lot of questions about what lens should
I get, how expensive should I go, what's the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.289
next greatest camera, what about my sound...

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.180
And those are all legit questions and I love
answering those.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.550
But the main component on most of the videos
that I'm asked to go see is:

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.690
Is the Story.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.850
You can make a great film and shoot it and
have great sound and have great special effects,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.089
and put it out there, but if you don't have
the story - that's the foundation and it all

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.100
falls down.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.620
Writer's write, painter's paint, and filmmaker's
make films, over and over and over and over

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.639
and over, to get better at it.

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:59.089
Well, as far as the main foundation or component
in your film, everything will fall down without

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.889
a good story.

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:03.679
And that's what you should be practicing.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.220
Grab an iPhone, grab a good story, and shoot
it.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.980
It's going to be more compelling to watch,
than having half a million dollars in gear,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.820
shooting that, and having a crappy story.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.440
Now, what's a good story?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.150
That's a matter of opinion.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.400
But here's what I do know:

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.400
Good stories, with somewhat good film, and
somewhat good sound, are always liked, and

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.650
crappy stories, no matter what you shot it
on, aren't.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.750
If you want other people to like what you're
doing, and that's kind of the point of making

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.060
films, work on your story.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.730
Write stories over and over and over and over
and over.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.760
Film it, shoot it, post it.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760
Write another one.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.970
Film it, shoot it, post it.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.750
Write another one.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.230
Film it, shoot it, post it.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.220
You're only going to get better at it.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.010
But I can tell you, if you don't practice
writing stories, the bedrock of everything

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.140
you make, this isn't going to get better no
matter equipment you get.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.650
Sure.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.940
A couple of guys in an alley, a fight scene,
wow that was great, you shot a fight scene,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.769
it was awesome, good fight scene.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.379
But, there's no story.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.859
There's two guys fighting and you're showing
your chops, and how you can do special effects

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:15.730
and cut things.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.749
That's great, and there's nothing wrong with
that, and that's also practice.

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.689
But the thing you need to work on is your
story.

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:22.829
Write a lot of stories.

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.370
Just keep writing them over and over and over
and over, and filming those, and you're going

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.560
to get better.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.209
It doesn't matter what equipment you have.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.129
In the end, when you technical ability gets
up to the point where it's running into your

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.239
story, sure.

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.489
Go buy a better lens.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.969
Go buy a better camera.

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.209
Go get some more lighting.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.749
But the place where it's going to fail is
the story.

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:50.749
Don't go out and spend $10,000 on equipment
if you can't write a story.

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:55.989
Save you money, practice writing stories,
and when you get really good at it, then go

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.569
buy the equipment, and you'll be a lot happier
that way.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.310
I hope that helps.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.269
Thanks for watching.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.300
(laughing guy) That's a wrap!

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.049
(dog barking)

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.900
See I have this dog out there, and for some
reason, the dog is just...barking at...air particles.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.279
(dog barking)

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.040
TITLE: "Later that day..."

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:38.000
"We hear the dog still barking, and we FADE TO BLACK."
