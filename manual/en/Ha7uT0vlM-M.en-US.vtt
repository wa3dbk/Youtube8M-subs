What a pretty woman, New York women are very sexy! I’m going to invite her for a cocktail. If you watch Sex and the City, you know what the most fashionable drink is in New York.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:31.700
With license, you are very “bonit”. Would you like to take a cocktail with me? A Cosmopolitan? Very “gustose.”

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.320
Cosmopolitan, what is this, 1999?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.800
I didn’t understand what she said. Maybe I need to watch more Sex and the City to learn how to be cool in New York.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:01:04.140
Remember the girls from Sex and the City and their Cosmopolitans? It seems so naïve today. Cosmopolitans are very tacky, so sweet and with uncreative ingredients.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:16.880
They come from the 1980s, and use vodka, a drink that is out of fashion for not adding any taste. How about gin, or bourbon, or a good tequila.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:31.540
Even cachaça is better. These days, the cool cocktails are either quite old, like from the 19th century: a Manhattan, an Old Fashioned, a classic Martini with gin and vermouth.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:48.700
Or they’re house creations with original, artisanal ingredients. A bar offering a Cosmopolitan special during happy hour could be a fun place, but it’s not the best New York has to offer.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.700
The city has many bars with excellent cocktails – I’ll put some links in the description of the video.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:06.840
But to get started, go to the Up &amp; Up in the West Village. Take the A, B. C. D. E or F train.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.200
The Up &amp; Up is new – it opened up in a basement in the middle of Greenwich Village.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.680
Here, the crowd runs from young to old, the $14 drinks on the menu are quite special, and they use top ingredients.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.620
Now you can impress someone.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.320
May I have a Stone Crush please?

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.320
Absolutely.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:06.740
Look at the Stone Crush that Rogério ordered: vermouth, Brennivin, which is a liquor from Iceland, cucumbers and more. Even the ice is prepared carefully so the drink doesn’t get watery.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.720
Other drinks are served creatively.  And better yet, the bartenders are very talented.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:37.100
But they won’t judge you if you really want a drink with vodka. Oh, but I will. Vodka is for fricking idiots.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.900
[New Yorkese class]

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:59.000
Oh, sorry, I was just using the Amigo Gringo app, available in the App Store and Google Play. It has all our videos and the places we recommended are on a map.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.640
But that doesn’t mean you should subscribe to the channel.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:21.520
And now, your New Yorkese class. Why is this place called the Up &amp; Up? It’s sort of a double-entendre. “On the up and up” is an old expression that means legitimate, honest or trustworthy.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:41.140
But just one “up” means a cocktail without ice, the contrary of “on the rocks.” The expressions are totally different, don’t mix them up. Up is without ice. Up and up means legitimate.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.720
Let's practice.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.180
This place is really on the “up.”

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.160
May I have a Manhattan “up and up”?

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.920
