00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:31.666
For MGS4, we decided to travel around the world,

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.302
just like the 007 series.

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:40.008
Previous titles were set mainly in one closed area.

00:00:40.108 --> 00:00:46.581
Instead, this story spans the globe.

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:02.564
I usually choose the locations that I would like to visit.

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:07.769
This time, we traveled to Morocco in the Middle East,

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.504
Peru in South America,

00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:12.274
and Prague in Eastern Europe.

00:01:12.374 --> 00:01:15.343
We chose New York for Metal Gear Solid 2,

00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:20.448
so that we could discover the entire city.

00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:31.192
I traveled with some of key members of the MGS staff.

00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:35.897
Instead of adding sound to visuals,
we traveled to the locations to record sounds

00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:38.600
that will help players get a greater sense of the location.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.371
Since the game is not set on a lonely battlefield or
a place with no people,

00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:45.774
we went to living locations...

00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:50.512
There were people there. They were living their daily lives.

00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:53.915
You could smell the reality, the living presence.

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:58.620
By visiting these places we were able to imagine
what they'd be like in our game

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.123
which is set a few years in the future.

00:02:02.223 --> 00:02:04.826
These villages are filled with beautiful people,

00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:07.228
and I want players to keep that in mind.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.338
Prague was good,

00:02:16.438 --> 00:02:19.841
and I personally liked Morocco
as it had a huge impact on me.

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:22.744
We visited a city called Fez in Morocco.

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:28.650
We focused on the medina,
the center part of the old city.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.821
It's a maze of narrow streets.

00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:36.157
I was really amazed by it.

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:49.471
Areas of ongoing conflict make for obvious theatres of war.

00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:56.144
Therefore I chose the Middle East, South America,
and Eastern Europe.

00:02:56.511 --> 00:03:02.817
We used an original microphone setup
to record in surround,

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:05.053
however, we encountered some difficulties.

00:03:05.153 --> 00:03:09.958
When we went to Yakushima to collect sounds for MGS3,

00:03:10.058 --> 00:03:16.598
it was easy to balance out the quiet jungle areas
because they were fairly similar.

00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:22.103
But with MGS4,
you have quiet Middle Eastern infiltration areas

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:26.274
coupled with villages with crowds of people.

00:03:26.374 --> 00:03:28.710
This required two totally different approaches
to the sound design.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.944
It was extremely difficult.

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:33.515
The field recording this time wasn't as easy as the last.

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:37.685
Though Ryan and Mr. Imaizumi were worried,

00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:41.022
I went out in the middle of the night and early morning

00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:46.194
to avoid people and to record sounds.

00:03:46.294 --> 00:03:51.666
I went to Peru for this research trip.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.139
We wanted to collect materials
from mountains that offered

00:03:58.406 --> 00:04:04.479
a different look
compared to the thick jungles found in MGS3.

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.881
Therefore we chose Peru.

00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:10.718
Since it's at a very high elevation,

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.655
we developed altitude sickness.

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:18.593
I remember that it was really hard for us
to work half of the time because of that.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.297
Since MGS4 is set in many places...

00:04:22.397 --> 00:04:27.402
The Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe...

00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:34.275
I thought it would be a good idea
to change the tone for each locale.

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:36.644
For the Middle East,

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:41.716
I decided to make it dusty
with matted and subdued colors.

00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:45.186
For Eastern Europe,

00:04:45.286 --> 00:04:54.128
it rains often so I made the whole city more shiny.

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.667
I tried to use different color tones for each area.

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:09.644
What did I find amazing...?

00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:13.648
Well, the Inca ruins.
This huge wide-open area appears...

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:19.454
You see the Inca buildings and structures.

00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:24.259
Within this open area, stone steps suddenly appear.

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:28.796
The contrast between natural environments and
man-made structures is

00:05:28.897 --> 00:05:35.370
nicely harmonized and makes for beautiful scenery.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.572
That's what I remember the most.

00:05:37.672 --> 00:05:41.075
Out of the Middle East stages,

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:44.879
I'm proud of the urban ruins area and
the narrow arcade path.

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.751
Those two areas really capture the essence of
what I experienced in Morocco.

00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:55.390
The smell and the atmosphere left a huge impact on me.

00:05:56.324 --> 00:06:00.061
Iâ€™m satisfied that what I've created in the game

00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:02.497
reflects what I saw and felt.

00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:04.165
I was in charge of lighting,

00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:07.869
and I always tried to convey that smell

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.239
into the lighting of the game.

00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:31.259
It might be because I was in the Peru travel group,

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:36.431
but I like what we did with the South American
Naomi tracking part.

00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:40.335
We spent quite a lot of time creating this area.

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:43.071
There's a river that runs through there...

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:45.974
You can feel the purity

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:50.478
and the clean fresh air.

00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:57.852
It makes you wish you were just sitting and relaxing
instead of fighting.

00:06:57.952 --> 00:07:00.555
That's how beautiful it is.
