00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For weeks you ask us one question and we did the same at Canon:

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
When we'll test the EOS 650D?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, there she is. Arrived two days ago by express.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
We wanna show what is improved to the 550D and 600D,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
what is probably worsen and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
how does the new touch display works?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.500
First, we want to have a look on the improved video mode.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's start with the sound quality.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.500
To show you the diiference, we'll switch from the int. Mic

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to the external Mic we typically use.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.500
...jiggle a little bit...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The sound quality is, as far as i can assess,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.500
much better than the int. Mic one.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
An internal Mic can't reach the quality of an dedicated one,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
not at least due to physical limitations.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Especially wind- and "camera noise".

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.500
If you want to take movies a lot, an external Mic is a must have equipment.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
In my opinion the almost bigger difference comapred to former products is

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.000
the movie Autofocus (AF).

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500
Now also continuously during recodring.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
As you can see, if I leave the focused area,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500
the EOS 650D focus very smooth.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Unfortunately the focus isn't perfect everytime.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
Also the AF "pumping" a little.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But if you compare this to the 600D,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.500
which didn't have anything like it,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.500
or the Nikon D3200/D5100 there's much less "pumping".

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
To sum it up: If you want to take movies professional, use manual focussing.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500
No AF can compete with it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's a common DSLR "problem", due to the depth-of-field.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
But if you "only" want to take some unboxing videos or

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
any other YouTube video at home:

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.500
This might be your camera.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
My opinion: The AF works for normal purposes.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
EOS 650D + movie mode = Big improvement!

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.500
As initially mentioned: One other great improvement is the touch display.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
...let me show you...

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
It has a very good response...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
What isn't that good here in the menu:

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500
The icons on top could have been a little bit larger.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Even if you can touch it with thickish fingers quite well,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500
twice the icon size might be a good deal.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Probably easier to use.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500
You can also disable the entire touch control.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Within the Quick-Set menu it works much better.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500
The icons are noticeable larger.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Even complex settings as the exposure control...

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500
over- and under-exposure or bracketing are easy to set up.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
May, the professionals and more ambitious peoply more likely use the button controls on top.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.500
But for the entry-level-user or for a fast access to some settings,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
if you don't want to navigate through some menus,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.000
it's absolutely great.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.500
You've got everything just one click away and change it.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
What's also quiet usefull: The preview mode.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.500
"Smartphone-Controls" like pinch-to-zoom or simply navigate within the image,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.500
this is very usefull for everday use.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.500
If you completely unzoom you're also able to navigate through your movies and pictures.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.500
You can also play movies with a simply touch onto the display.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Very easy to use, so for check images and videos quiet good.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
One big touch display problem:

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.500
They get easily smudgy while using it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So a short tip: Antec Cleaning Solutions 3X.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.000
At least I can recommend.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.500
Just spray one time on the display...

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
there's also an enclosed microfiber cloth...

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.500
So just simply wipe a little bit

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.500
and you're able to clean up nearly every glare surface.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
- so you can even use it for your window -

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.500
I think now it's noticeable cleaner.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Costs between 5 to 7 euro in stores.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.500
Currently available in most PC shops as well as amazon.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Have a look on it.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500
It absolutely worth it if you use devices with touch displays.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Of course there's also somethin new to tell about the burst mode.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.500
Now we dealing with up to 5 fps...

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.500
...let me show you ;-)

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.500
As you can hear, the first 6 images at full speed,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
afterwards with up to 2 fps.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.500
But this depends on your sd-card - much less is possible.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We currently use the brand new Toshiba EXCERIA Type 1,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500
featuring up to 90 MB/s write speed.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.500
Unfortunately the 650D don't reach this speed,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in real world tests we measure about 35 to 40 MB/s.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.000
This isn't worse for sure.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.000
But as we seen at the D3200, it gets possibly better.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.500
Today we've got a first look on the new Canon EOS 650D.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
We'll did a speical review about the image and video quality in the near future.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.500
Even if we know that most of you are much more interested in this, but: Suspense is very important ;-)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.500
The touch display is an innovation, at least in the dslr market.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.500
There it's a unique feature - At least for the moment.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The menu control isn't optimal at this time,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.000
especially some icons and the text could have been larger.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.500
Previewing images and videos as well as the Quick-Set menu: Well Done!

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Anyway, the more important change is the video mode.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.500
Now featuring a continuously autofocus.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Didn't work perfect at the 650D as well,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.500
but may be this won't change on dslr-cameras anytime.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Anyway, it's quite usefull for "everyday use" and therefore it works fine.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Last one: Burst mode.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.500
The Canon EOS 650D can't compete with the Nikon D3200.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It's too bad, but:

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.500
If you want a bust mode-camera you probably buy a 7D oder 5D III instead.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.500
So if you're intrested in a new mid-class dslr camera, the EOS 650D might be your choice.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
All in all a great product without big cons.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.500
If you take the 550D and 600D in mind, a almost consistent evolutionary product with new features.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And I would say ready for 2012/13!

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.500
[[Thanks for watching]]
