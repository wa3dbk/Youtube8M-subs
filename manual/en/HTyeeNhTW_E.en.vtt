00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.080
GOLDEN MSA varnishes are made thicker than what is needed for brush application. In

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.969
this video will show how to properly thin the MSA varnish to our standard brush applied recommendation. To open the container

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.969
firmly press on the sides of the plastic safety cap,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.350
Inside you'll see a metal disc

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.820
That ensures safe shipping of the product. This disc can be rather difficult to remove the easiest way to accomplish

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.820
This is with a screwdriver and a hammer,

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.239
Gently tap the screwdriver through the metal disc and use the hole to pry out the disc.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.379
Be sure to close containers when not in use.

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.589
Cleanly pour the MSA varnish.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.609
Pour the varnish and use the lip of the mixing container to catch any drips,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.179
Wipe the varnish from the threads with a paper towel,

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.539
Allow all varnish for solvent saturated materials to fully dry before disposing.

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.659
After you have poured out the desired amount of varnish mark the varnish level with a permanent marker,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.869
Next divide the varnish amount into three parts,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:36.620
Then make another mark indicating the amount of solvent to add add the solvent to the mark creating a three to one ratio (3:1) [3 parts Varnish to 1 part Solvent].

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.180
Begin stirring with a palette knife a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.429
Slight amount of initial turbidity between the varnish and solvent is to be expected.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.989
Stir for at least one minute or until the mixture clarifies.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.769
Once the mixture is homogeneous cap and label the container you're now ready to varnish.
