00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.770
The highly customisable Adam is proving a
success for Vauxhall, with around 25,000 sales

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.770
in the UK. But, while you’ve always been
able to choose bombastic colours and accessories,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.010
something has been missing from the line-up,
and that’s a quick version.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.580
Well, not anymore, because this Adam S packs
a turbocharged 1.4-litre petrol with 148bhp,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.190
giving it 50% more punch than any other Adam
in the range. With almost three quarters of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.950
Adam’s being bought by women, it’s also
had a makeover to make it more masculine,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.370
to appeal to more people like…well me, and
probably you too.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.880
When I first saw this car’s 18-inch wheels
and 225 width tyres I expected it to ride

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.810
about as well as a skateboard, but actually,
it does soak up smaller bumps with reasonable

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.160
finesse, you’ll just want to take it easy
over speed humps, and there’s a fair bit

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.440
of road noise at motorway speeds.
The reward of having such big tyres is that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.610
they give the S huge amounts of grip. In fact,
despite the eager nature of the engine, you’ll

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.130
rarely trouble the traction control, which
can be switched off by the way. And, because

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.800
the Adam is so short, it’s very agile and
it’s at its happiest diving into corners

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.350
along a winding road like this one.
Tuned for mid-range grunt, there’s no engine

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.540
noise trickery here, but the exhaust emits
a decent burble and the Adam will scamper

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.229
to 62mph in 8.5 seconds. To be honest, it
feels quicker, because this is a car where

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.710
you carry momentum along a road, and enjoy
the chassis. Powerful brakes add to your confidence,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.520
they’re from the last-gen Corsa VXR by the
way, and the steering is the best we’ve

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.080
tried in any Adam, with a lot more weight
than before.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.070
The Adam’s interior is quite a funky place
to be, with bold gauges and air-vents all

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.489
surrounded with chrome bezels. Choose the
optional Red ‘n’ Roll interior package

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.060
and you’ll get red clip-on trims across
the dashboard, while this car has the ‘Red

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.240
your Engine’ interior pack. As we said,
most of the things you can see are customisable.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.360
One box you need to tick is for this IntelliLink
infotainment system, which is good value at

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:47.840
£275, bringing with it a big and bright touch-screen,
with apps and good smartphone connectivity.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.629
This car also has a £215 Winter Pack, with
heated seats and even a warmed steering wheel.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.180
We love these Recaro sports seats – which
give the Adam a special touch – but at £1,040

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.610
we’re not sure how many customers will take
the plunge. And, while the Adam’s interior

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.910
is fun, it lacks the sense of quality which
oozes out of the MINI hatchback, with some

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:18.269
parts bin items like the column stalks, straight
from the sober Insignia saloon.

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:29.879
A bit like the MINI 3-Door, you should almost
consider the Adam as a 2+2, with rear seats

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:37.080
for kids or occasional use. In fact my seating
position means I’m almost in the middle

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.569
of the car, which doesn’t leave much knee
room for those behind. Long doors aid rear

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.550
access, but it’s a bit claustrophobic for
anything more than a short journey. The 175-litre

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.760
boot is small, and there’s a high lip to
lift your shopping over.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.650
But, the Adam S has a bigger problem, Vauxhall
has put a premium on its stylish city car,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.980
so with the options you’ll want, it costs
around £18k. For that, hot hatch fans can

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.060
get a car with more like 200bhp. But, perhaps
that’s missing the point. The S has enough

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.580
power to make it feel alive, and it’s a
cool little car.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.019
When the Adam arrived, its design was applauded,
but it didn’t appeal to drivers enough to

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.770
rival the Abarth 500 or MINI Hatch. But, it
seems the Adam is getting better, first with

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.099
the tougher-looking Rocks Air and now the
S. And actually, I found myself getting rather

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.570
fond of this little car.
It’s not perfect, and it’s rather expensive,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.880
but get a good deal and this Adam is a fun
car to drive, which could even surprise a

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.040
few died-in-the-wool car enthusiasts.
