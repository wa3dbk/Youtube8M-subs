Welcome to the Weekly Flash, where we expose
you to the hottest stuff from around the net.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.599
I am your host, Alejandro in Austin. In this
week’s episode we feature big news from

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.529
mega superstar DJ, highlight an up and coming
Dub producer, and I share a big announcement

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.080
about the week ahead.
First, If you love trance or electronic music,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.969
there is no doubt that you have heard of the
global force known as Tiesto. This week, the

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:32.930
dutch dj reached an epic milestone with the
addition of his 7th million fan on facebook.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.080
To celebrate, as reported on my blog earlier
this week, Tiesto made his Track “Young

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.030
Lions” available for a free download. Referred
to by tiesto as old school inspired trance

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.190
track, it is an absolute can’t miss for
any trance fan and A link to the free download

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.410
can be found in the description box below.
From one of the top djs in the world we turn

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.590
the spotlight to an up and coming producer
on Youtube. Hailing from the UK, grebzdubsteps

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.360
has only been on youtube since September,
but his drum and base beats quickly caught

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.829
our attention a couple of a months ago, and
each track he makes is better than the last.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.869
His latest dub track from last week, oh my
god, can only be explained as hot.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:17.759
With all his tracks available in 1080 hd quality
and with his frequent uploads, Grebz is a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.090
must see artist on youtube. From Trance to
House to Dub, electronic music is some of

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.700
the most exciting music around . Do you like
electronic music? Or electronic music just

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.670
noise to you? Share your thoughts in the comments
section below.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.969

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.569
