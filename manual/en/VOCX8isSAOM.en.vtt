Hi! This is Megan with Beadaholique.com and
today I just wanted to take a minute and

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.449
show you

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.369
our new 1/4lb

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.179
vintage metal buttons assortment

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.269
this is one of those things that when I
saw the box full of all of these

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.349
goodies in the show room I actually squeal 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.079
I didn't know they were coming so it's
very exciting for me. This is right up my

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.670
alley and also you get a lot of
buttons. You get like

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.060
this whole little bag full and that's all
of these

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.020
and I started playing around right away
and making some simple like glue on

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.030
projects. So I have

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.460
like five pairs of post earrings I'm working
on

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.380
a pair of clip on earrings and made this
cool bezel ring

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.090
I've barely made a dent. I've made

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.610
you know I've got the buttons here for

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.620
six earrings and a ring and I barely made a dent
in my giant pile of buttons

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.220
so there's

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.170
all different

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.330
assortment of buttons that you'll get it's
kind of a mixed bag. It is a mixed

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.860
bag literally

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.950
You can't really guarantee what
you're gonna get but there's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.390
I found hair samples most of the buttons
in here I think there is only one or two

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.070
they did have a mate

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.090
and there's lots of sizes on the way
from these

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.930
little bitty

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.310
here at the anchor

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.250
all the way up to some really really
large ones

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.910
you can really find

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.470
an extreme variety in here. You can
use them for so many different things

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.800
another thing that I just want to show
you is how easy it is to cut the shank

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.750
off of these buttons

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.290
the shanks are hollow

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.050
so I'm just using a pair of flush cutters

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.010
and

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.940
you wanna make sure to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.290
where safety goggles though

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.240
because they can fly off of there

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.770
just put the flush cutters all the way
flush against the back of the button

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.560
and snip. It goes right through

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.549
and go to the other side

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.299
the repeat that

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.249
and sometimes you have to

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:18.419
go from the other direction too but they
come off relatively easily 'cause they are

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.639
and then to make sure that it lays flat
against whatever you're going to attach

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.589
it to, I just take

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:27.049
a pair of chain nose pliers, close them up

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.629
push down with the side to try to make sure
that that goes flat

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.389
if you're worried about this sharp-edged,
be careful first of all it's a sharp edge

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.729
but if you're worried about the sharp-edge poking through what you're going to put

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.969
it on, you can use a diamond file to file that
down

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.689
if you're going to glue it onto something

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.919
metal, you're not really worried about it, you can
just

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.369
push down and make sure it lays flat

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:52.579
there's definitely a lot of possibilities
for playing with these

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.839
it's a really awesome assortment. Go to www.beadaholique.com to purchase beading supplies and to get design ideas!
