00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.023
Organic photochemistry
is the subject

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:05.013
of both fundamental as
well as practical interest

00:00:05.013 --> 00:00:08.010
and we’ll try to touch
on both in this lesson.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.077
We’re all familiar with the
example of photosynthesis.

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:13.093
And another important
photochemical reaction

00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:15.027
that affects our daily lives

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:17.027
is shown in the
background of this slide,

00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:19.053
it’s the photochemical
reaction that used

00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:22.027
to fabricate
microelectronic chips

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:24.023
that’s used in the
computer industry.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.030
The pattern that you see
on this computer chip

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.027
was created by shining light in
what’s known as a shadow mask.

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:33.033
That creates a pattern
of light on the surface

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.077
and the surface
contains a thin film,

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:38.013
the main ingredient
in that thin film,

00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:40.007
which is called a photoresist,

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.083
is this organic molecule
that you see here.

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:45.080
When light hits this molecule,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.010
it undergoes a photochemical
reaction that is known as

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.090
the photochemical
Wolf rearrangement,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.093
transforming it from an aqueous
base insoluble material,

00:00:55.093 --> 00:00:59.017
to an aqueous base
soluble material.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.080
Washing the surface
then with base,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.003
exposes selectively those areas
that were exposed to light.

00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:08.063
And by that process,

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:13.003
one can build up integrated
circuits, like you see here.

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:14.053
Besides these
practical examples,

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:16.097
we’ll also see that
organic photochemistry

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:20.047
will help to reinforce some
of the fundamental concepts

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:24.040
that we’ve been learning,
such as the FMO theory.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.043
Let’s use the carbonyl group to
illustrate how energy from light

00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:29.063
is transferred to a molecule.

00:01:31.013 --> 00:01:35.080
In the S0 state, or the ground
state electronic configuration

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.043
all of the filled levels are
occupied by a pair of electrons.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.027
If the molecule
encounters a photon

00:01:43.027 --> 00:01:46.033
whose energy matches the
difference in energy between

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:48.083
a filled level and
an empty level,

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:53.033
that photon can become absorbed
causing and electron to jump

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.060
from a filled level
to an empty level.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.087
So if the energy of
a photon matches

00:01:57.087 --> 00:02:01.023
the difference in energy
between the n and π* state,

00:02:01.023 --> 00:02:03.030
the result is what’s known as

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.013
the lowest excited
configuration

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:08.090
for the carbonyl
group, the S1 state,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.053
which has a singularly
occupied nonbonded level,

00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:14.003
and a singularly
occupied π* level.

00:02:15.063 --> 00:02:18.040
If the energy of light happens
to be a little bit larger,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.023
it will match the gap
between the π level,

00:02:21.023 --> 00:02:25.020
and the π* level, creating
what’s known as the S2,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.010
or the second lowest excited
state of the carbonyl group,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.050
where there is a singularly
occupied π level,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.087
and a singularly
occupied π* level.

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:39.040
Here’s a plot that shows the
wavelength of light in nm,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.083
that’s required to
match the energy gap

00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:44.043
expressed in kcal/mol,

00:02:44.043 --> 00:02:48.073
between the ground state
and the first excited state

00:02:48.073 --> 00:02:51.083
for a variety of
organic molecules.

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:54.000
For the carbonyl group,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.013
absorption of a photon about
360nm matches the energy gap;

00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:03.023
that energy gap is
about 80kcal/mol.

00:03:03.023 --> 00:03:06.060
And that 80kcal/mol
of light energy

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.067
that’s transferred to
the molecule,

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:13.010
is available to perform
photochemical reactions
00:03:13.010,00:00:00.000
that we’ll be studying in
the upcoming webcasts.
