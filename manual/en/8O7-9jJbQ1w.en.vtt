00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.800
Hannah Silverman is entirely ordinary
in every way.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Ordinary height.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.800
Ordinary weight.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.600
Ordinary brown hair, 
match ordinary brown eyes.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.719
She belongs to an ordinary family of four,
with a teacher for a mother and a lawyer

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.020
for a father, and a brother who annoys her
an ordinary amount.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.220
She’s lonely and happy and funny and sad
an ordinary amount of time

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.760
and ordinarily, she’s okay with that fact.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.460
Hannah’s ordinary in every way except that
once at the beach, a seagull stole a bagel

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.380
right out of her hand, and that was a pretty
extraordinary day.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.640
No matter what random thing I’m doing,
I’m definitely enjoying myself.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.920
My name is Razieme Iborra, 
I’m from Massillon, Ohio, and I’m an artist.
