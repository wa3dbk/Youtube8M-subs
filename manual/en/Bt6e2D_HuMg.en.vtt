00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello there. I'm JPiolho and I'm going
to show you development video #2

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500
We have been working on a new testmap

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.000
This one

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If you notice. We have dynamic clouds

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And we're also testing our tree fading
system.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
In big maps, like this one. There is 
a lot of trees.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.300
If they are all rendered at the same
time

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It could break yours FPS

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So instead of rendering a model. We're
rendering them as sprites.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
and when you get close, they change

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.500
We also have merchants

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
[Merchant: Good day to you!]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
[Merchant: Nice doing business with ya]

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.000
[Merchant: Wait till you see what I've got for ya]

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Where you can sell your items

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And at the anvil we have tin
Make weapons...

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm now going to show you our mine

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Remember this is only a testmap

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
None of this will be final

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We want to make much better than this

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.500
[Voice: Inventory is full]

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.000
I've just leveled up on mining

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.500
[Merchant: Good day to you

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
[Merchant: Nice doing business with ya]

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.500
We also have our menu templates

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.500
Right now you can control your tree rendering
distances.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Right now it's... this value.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.000
I'll put it, to 8

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.300
And if you can see we have no model at
all.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.500
We have new sounds.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And.. I want to show our template for woodfire.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.000
Well, that's all for now.
Thank you for watching!
