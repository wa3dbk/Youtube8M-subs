How to Prepare a Traditional Greek Easter
Menu.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.370
In Greece, the Easter holiday celebration
is bigger than Christmas.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.529
Lamb is the typical main course of a Greek
Easter menu.

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:22.410

Baklava Equipment: Heavy roasting pan Meat

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.480
thermometer 13 x 9-inch baking dish and crushed
red pepper (optional).

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.210
Step 1.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.620
Leave the lamb at room temperature for an
hour.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.879
Carve off the fat, leaving only a thin layer.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.490
Rub the lamb with olive oil and season it
with a teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.429
Then put the lamb in a heavy roasting pan
and preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:15.759
Step 2.

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.289
Rub 1/4 teaspoon olive oil onto the head of
garlic.

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.020
Wrap it loosely in foil, and bake it for an
hour.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.130
Then let it cool, cut off the top, and squeeze
the roasted garlic into a bowl.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.429
Mash it into a paste and mix in 1/4 cup extra-virgin
olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1 tablespoon

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:42.020
oregano, the parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and
1/4 teaspoon pepper.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.130
Step 3.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.469
Roast the lamb for 1 hour.

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.149
Then rotate the pan and roast it for another
30 minutes.

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.771
Then slather the roast with the garlic paste,
and roast for an additional 45 minutes, or

00:01:55.771 --> 00:02:00.579
until an instant-read thermometer inserted
at the thickest part reads 160 degrees.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.689
Take it out of the oven and let it rest for
20 minutes.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.689
Step 4.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.890
Peel and cut potatoes into 1 1/2 inch cubes
and lay them in a single layer in the baking

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.890
dish.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.560
Toss them with 1/2 cup olive oil, the minced
garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons oregano, and salt

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.120
and pepper to taste.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.460
Use crushed red pepper as an alternative to
black pepper for a different taste.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.020
Step 5.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.230
Bake the potatoes for 15 minutes.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.500
Then add 1/2 cup of the stock and toss.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.140
Bake for 10 minutes and then add 1/3 cup lemon
juice and toss again.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.710
Bake for another 15 minutes, or until the
potatoes are cooked through.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.230
Put the potatoes in the oven with the lamb
to cook at the same time.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.260
Step 6.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.210
Serve avgolemono soup as the appetizer.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.870
Boil 6 cups of the chicken stock, and add
the orzo.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.790
Cook until it is al dente, adding salt and
pepper to taste.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.440
Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/2 cup of water
and heat the remaining stock until it is hot.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.480
Step 7.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.720
Beat the eggs with an electric mixer until
they're fluffy, and then add the cornstarch

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.540
and 3/4 cup of lemon juice.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.990
Turn the mixer to low, and thicken it by slowly
adding the hot chicken stock.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.070
Put the orzo on low heat and add the egg mixture.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.370
Step 8.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.200
Drink wine with the meal.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.880
A dark, spicy red wine goes perfect with lamb.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.200
Enjoy a slice of baklava for dessert.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.430
Did you know An Easter tradition in Crete
is the burning of a human-sized doll made

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.540
of clothing to represent Judas, the disciple
who betrayed Jesus.
