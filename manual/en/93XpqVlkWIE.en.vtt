00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.040
Hi, guys, and welcome back.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.800
So today we are cooking

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.240
one of my most favourite
desserts, Eton Mess.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.320
And I'm hoping
it's gonna be quite easy.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.840
You basically smash everything up
and put in a bowl, so it's quite fun.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
I don't have a clue
where to start, but here we go.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.200
Where do we start?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.520
Three eggs, I need the yolks
in here and the whites in there.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.840
Easy.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.040
I did just get back from New York

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.200
as well where I ate everything
in the whole city.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.640
I was going to start with like
the healthy Eton cake today.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.720
How's that going for you?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.240
It doesn't look
like that's gonna happen.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.840
Okay, So whisk The egg whites first.
- Yeah.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.360
Until peaks form,
then add the sugar.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.560
So you need to get whisking.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.480
Beat the sugar in,
but we also need to put vanilla.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.720
It says vanilla extract,
but we only have vanilla pods.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.720
So what you have to
do here is cut them,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.800
don't cut your finger off,
and then you open them up...

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.120
Oh, my God, it smells so good.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.680
..and then you scrape it out.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.520
What does it taste like
if you just eat it?

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.760
Vanilla-y?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.400
Just vanilla-y.
Doesn't really...

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.600
It's not too bad.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.240
If you're confident enough,
we need to do this.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.080
Okay. So Mike's actually
quite good at this, apparently.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.360
Let's have a competition.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.120
I'm gonna do this side,
you do the other side.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.880
How do they do this?

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.640
I'm gonna do a heart shaped one.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.520
I think you should do a star.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160
I'm just gonna go for a dollop.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.560
That one looks rubbish.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.480
I'm not gonna say what it looks
like 'cause it's food,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.000
but you know what it looks like.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.600
So these now need
to go into the oven

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.200
for an hour and a quarter,
to an hour and a half.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.440
It's a really long time.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.360
We've got a little bit of a problem
with the meringue, I think.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.760
They are massive
and slightly brown.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760
Meringues don't normally
look like that, do they?

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.480
So, whoopsie.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.400
I think we should ring your mum.
- Yeah.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.280
We have an issue with meringues.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.800
We may have put them
in the top oven.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800
Can we save it?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.560
Can we save it? Is it saveable?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.000
You listen to her this time.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Thanks for the help.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.040
should we make it some more?
- She's not sure.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.120
She said make some more
and put them in the bottom oven.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.440
Oh.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.760
There.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.480
So whilst we're waiting
for the meringues to do their thing,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.880
I'm gonna do the cream.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.040
We actually are meant to have
500 mil of whipping cream,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.600
but we only have 300 mil.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.200
So we're gonna use a bit
of double cream as well.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.720
I don't know what the difference is.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.880
If anyone knows,
maybe leave us comment.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.960
That's one. That's perfect.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.440
- Oh, it's too hard.
- It's perfect.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.360
So because Mike over whips
the cream a little bit,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.360
I'm gonna do a bit
of experimenting.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.480
It might turn out badly,
but let's face it,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.960
we messed up the meringues already.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.360
So I'm gonna pour a little
bit of extra cream in here.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.480
I think this is doable.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.000
You said it's an Eton mess,
so I was just making it messy.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.240
So here are the good meringues,
looking slightly better

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.800
and we promise we did make these.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.160
So whilst we're waiting
for the meringues to cool,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.800
I'm just going to
get a little bit girly

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.560
and make some
heart shaped strawberries

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960
for the top of the Eton mess.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.480
So I'm just going to cut
little triangles out of the top

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.320
and then cut
the strawberries in half

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.080
and then you have
little heart shapes.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.320
So now that the good
meringues have cooled down,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.920
we're going to crumble
them into the cream.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.920
So normally this would serve six,
but we're actually doing it for two.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.560
'Cause we have massive bowls.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.000
And I'm hungry.
So we're having more.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.720
Oh.
- Mix them gently.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.000
It's gone all sloppy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.040
I thought that's the whole point.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.800
It doesn't look quite like
the picture on Sainsbury's website,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.480
but meringue is harder to make
than I thought it would be.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.560
I hope you're hungry.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.120
We're gonna top them off

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.560
with our little
heart shaped strawberries.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.000
So it's time to try them.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.080
I...

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.120
I'm really looking forward to this.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.560
It doesn't actually
look as appetising

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.160
as I think it's gonna taste.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.200
It's good.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.520
Well done, chef.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.680
Yeah, well done, chef.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.440
You're not very good
at whipping cream.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.960
So you can do it next time.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.640
If you want to see
the full recipe for this,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.480
it will be listed
in the information bar below

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.840
and on the Sainsbury's website.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.240
And we will see you next time.
