00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.789
Hey everyone, it's Colin, how's it going. Well, my headphone collection has increased by one

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.340
yet again so that means that you get a
review.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.790
For a while now I've been looking for a
good solid pair of around-ear,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.889
noise cancelling Bluetooth wireless
headphones.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.020
And for a long time I hadn't really found
anything that

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.350
I thought would fit the bill until
recently.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.680
And when I saw these at the store I
couldn't help but pick up a pair

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.950
to check out, so in this video were gonna
do a quick review of the Sony MDR-ZX 770s.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.250
In terms of construction, the ZX770s are well put together though lightweight.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.950
They're largely plastic with metal
inside the headband.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.010
I don't want to call them flimsy but let's
just say that I'd hesitate to put them

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.989
through any significant abuse.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.110
Comfort was obviously a priority to Sony

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.420
as they have big ear cups with soft
leather pads

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.960
and even the headband is wider than most, and also decently padded.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.600
This combined with how light they are
make them perfectly suitable for wearing

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.189
for long periods without fatigue. I think
the main selling point for these

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.869
is their Bluetooth functionality. The
left ear cup has an NFC chip to make

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.259
pairing quick with compatible devices,

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.400
but pairing the normal Bluetooth way
still isn't too tedious.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.540
Their usage range is surprisingly good.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.390
I left my phone playing music on the
kitchen counter, then went upstairs and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.540
there were no hiccups in the signal.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.240
Out of the box the 770s come
set to the SBC protocol,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.920
which has the widest compatibility with
Bluetooth devices

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.000
but also the lowest sound quality. They're
also compatible with the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.159
AAC and AptX formats, and these improve sound quality a decent amount,

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.340
but it's a bit of an involved process
of pressing buttons and counting the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.210
number of times lights flash

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.950
in order to put the headphones in that
mode.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.370
Of course once you have music playing,
controlling it from the headphones is

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.460
straightforward.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.850
On the right earcup is a rocker for
skipping tracks,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.350
pausing and answering phone calls. Next to it is the volume control,

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.550
and Sony thoughtfully put a bump on the
volume up button,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.610
so you don't have to memorize which is
which. One bummer is that on iOS

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.180
devices, the pause-slash-call button

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.240
doesn't activate Siri which would
otherwise be a very handy feature.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.840
The 770s do have a built-in
headset functionality,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.080
and it works about as well as you'd
expect for phone calls.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.290
For those times when you can't or don't
want to use Bluetooth,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.220
the headphones come with an audio cable that connects the left earcup.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.910
This is a completely standard cable and
should be cheap and easy to replace

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.420
should you lose or break it.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.220
One drawback though is that it only
allows for playback,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.910
meaning you can't use the headset
function through the cable --

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.030
that's something reserved for Bluetooth
use only. An upside is that through the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.140
cable, you can use the headphones

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.340
even if they're off or the battery is
dead, and what's more, they sound

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.920
exactly the same. Sony doesn't seem to be doing any sort of active equalization, so

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.450
there's no penalty in sound quality if
the power runs out.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.220
Speaking of power, the ZX770s
have a built-in lithium-ion battery

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.400
that charges through a normal micro USB
port.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.760
With Bluetooth and noise cancelling
turned on,  one can expect

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.730
about 13 hours of life. Turn noise canceling off,

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.680
and that increases to 19 hours, and
frequent flyers should see the best

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.070
battery life of all

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.090
because wired operation with
noise-canceling

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.269
should see about 24 hours between
charges.

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.720
Checking the charge remaining is a
little cumbersome.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.730
You need to tap the power button, then
count the number of times the red LED

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.739
flashes.

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.660
The fewer the flashes, the lower the
charge remaining.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.590
A major feature that drove me to these
is the built-in noise cancelling.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.350
I'll try to keep this concise. It works
decently,

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.560
and it's effective, but there certainly
are other noise cancelling cans out

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.260
there that do the job better.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.290
The 770s focus only on low frequencies;

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.139
it just feels like there's more in the
spectrum that could be blocked.

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.250
In relatively quiet environments the
noise floor from the canceling -- you know,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.480
that hissing sound --

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.450
is nice and low, but it does ramp up
considerably

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.210
if the ambient environment gets loud. I don't think it'll be too much of an issue on a

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.820
train or plane though,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.950
and overall the 770s' noise
cancelling

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.590
is still a welcome feature. For me, the
most important thing about a pair of

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.710
headphones is how they sound.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.600
Sony has been a big name in headphones
for a long time,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.750
and with these cans they definitely have drawn on all that experience.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.850
The lows are tight and robust, but
smooth,

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.919
and the highs are crisp but not overly articulate.

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.160
The mids are interesting on the
770s --

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.890
they sound natural, but their position in
the soundstage

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.870
makes them feel a bit laid-back. While
some headphones make it seem like vocals

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.340
are right in your face,

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.260
these put them at arm's length. It's not
a bad thing by any means, and

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.970
the overall sound signature is engaging,
but in such a way that it never becomes

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.580
fatiguing.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.979
For the scenarios that people are likely
to use the ZX770s,

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.350
I'd say they sound just right. So
overall I think

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.039
the ZX770s offer a really good
balance of features,

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.630
functionality, comfort and sound quality.
Now here's the kicker,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.729
when I found these it was a bit of an
impulse buy,

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.990
because I saw them at my local Costco on sale for only $150.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.289
That is excellent value and

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.350
if you're looking for headphones like
these I don't think you can do any

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.030
better.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.680
Even at a higher price, like $200, I
still think that they're worth the money.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.729
So if you are in the market for
Bluetooth

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.040
noise cancelling headphones,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.050
I think these should definitely be on your
list to check out.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.830
If you like the video, I'd appreciate a
thumbs up, those help quite a bit.
