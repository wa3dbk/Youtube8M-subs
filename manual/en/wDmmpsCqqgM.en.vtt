00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.659
Hello Friends! Today we will do some  plum energy bars 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.819
the plum is a very interesting ingredient, because it provides fiber

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.939
&nbsp;and also, when these energy bars made  with plum, we down a little sugar consumption

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.800
plums are also very interesting for everyone who

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.939
have slow digestion and need to consume plums and nothing more interesting

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.619
and rich you consume these energy bars, they are super easy to make

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.820
with good ingredients easy to find in almost every supermarket

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.500
and it  is also low cost, that's also interesting.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.260

I invite you to see the ingredients, then preparing and say goodbye until the next occasion

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.140
So long! :)

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.280
The ingredients for plum energy bars are:

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:16.590
75 grams of Plums, these plums us we took the pit 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.080
and cut into 3 or 4 pieces, so that the processing work less

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.580
These are 75 grams of almonds

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.240
and finally, 75 grams of golden raisins

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.760
I tell you these 75 grams of each of the ingredients that we will place in a food processor

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.940
is what reaches us for this processing ability, which is very good

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.590
and we will start processing

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.120
and we will begin to see that all the ingredients come together

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.540
and our idea is that a ball is formed, which then we can work

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.020
I recommend that every so often, you open the processing

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.460
can help with a spoon and go down the mixture

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.800
So that we can unite all ingredients

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.569
and you see that and practically consists Ball

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:24.049
and this ball's going to put us in Alusa Plast or plastic

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.399
we will remove all the mix, you see it was really well together

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:33.339
We're going to seal this plastic

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.371
and this has two objectives, namely, 1, we will help to flatten the mixture

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.480
and we will help a uslero

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.280
and we will serve to leave it in the freezer

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:50.119
we flattening, we have left more or less than a thickness of 1/2 inch or slightly less

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:54.449
matching a bit and the mixture, so that it us a square, rectangle

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.649
serve us after cutting

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:58.729
this we seal

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.779
we took it to the freezer for 45 minutes, or  1 hour

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.999
They can also be placed in the refrigerator for about 2 to 3 hours

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:15.519
but the freezer always helps, and serves to make it faster.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.039
We put the bars on a planchette

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:24.329
removed the plastic or Alusa Plast

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.809
and we'll help of a good knife

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.629
cutting

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.909
We do you suggestion may be square, may be rectangles

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.569
can make them smaller, larger. That depends on you

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:45.249
But Make it, because it really is a treat. Super easy to make and very healthy
