00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.470
Hello

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.300
Chr. Hansen is a global bioscience company

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.460
that produces natural ingredients to the food

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.380
health, pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.720
Together with our customers we improve food and health 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.420
by providing innovative natural ingredients 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.000
of the highest quality that can help customers be

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
more efficient

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
more profitable

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and more responsible 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.820
when bringing their products to the market.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.280
In 1874,our founder Christian D.A. Hansen 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.000
revolutionized the production of wholesome dairy products

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.520
by developing the first industrialized enzymes and dairy cultures

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.910
and later natural colors to be used in a rich variety

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.600
of food and beverages.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.250
Today a new idea may quickly find its way to the market through close

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.540
interaction between customers and Chr. Hansen's innovation teams

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.090
at our nineteen local application centers around the world.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.740
Let us give you just three examples.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.970
Take cheese.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.640
This woman works in a large dairy corporation

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.540
and she wants to find a way to make more cheese 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.680
from every measure of milk that she uses.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.250
by combining her own knowledge and insight 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.040
with the knowledge and experience of our experts

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.460
she found out that by adding one of our

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.100
highly specialized Chr. Hansen enzyme solutions she was able to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.540
produce up to three percent more delicious cheese 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.000
from every measure of milk.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.510
Take soft drinks.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.170
This man works for a major global beverage company. 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.960
He wanted to find a natural alternative 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.380
to the synthetic color they use in their

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.210
top-selling brightly-colored soda.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.580
But he needed to make sure that the soda 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.530
would still look attractive to the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.360
consumers, and it was important to choose a 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.500
supplier that could meet the highest

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.280
technical and quality demands.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.050
After all, color is the first 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.650
ingredient that meets the eye. 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.920
He came to Chr. Hansen with his challenge, 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.100
and together we were able to get the formulation just right, 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.100
using our full spectrum of bright and vivid natural colors

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.810
and our superior technologies for application in food and beverages

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.220
Take probiotics. 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.330
Probiotics have been shown to provide substantial health benefits.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.300
This guy wants to develop a new product containing probiotics. 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.810
He wants it to be healthy, and he wants to demonstrate 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.360
responsibility and accountability to his customers 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.590
and making sure the benefits of the probiotic strain he uses 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.490
are well documented.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.140
At Chr. Hansen we were able to help him 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.300
take his product from idea to final product, 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.080
and we were able to provide him with just the right mix 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.960
of some of the best documented probiotic strains on the market.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.260
So that's it,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.610
very briefly.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.040
But it's not all of it. 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.060
We've many more examples of how we help our customers 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.170
improve food &amp; health every day.
