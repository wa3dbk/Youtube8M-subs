00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.830
One thing I was so impressed with when I was
in France, was the color of the flowers, with

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:14.370
the Tulip in particular. We just don't have
those kinds of colors in North America, so

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:25.370
this is sort of my tribute to beautiful tulips
that I saw when I was there in April. So this

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.660
is a really, really simple arrangement you
don't want to go to over the top this is just

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:47.670
a casual welcome home lunch but, just a few
flowers to decorate the tables is always nice.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.820
See this is not really a vase at all, that
sits there so if you want to add a couple

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:09.920
of leaves find some that aren't damage and
put those along, with the tulips see how that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:21.999
looks, sort of depend of which angle you are
at, maybe that one was sort of overwhelming

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:29.880
for the bunch, that will just sit on our table,
to give us a little color and one of the last

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:39.649
things you would want to do, it's a little
bit of an appetizer to have with a glass of

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:55.239
wine, very crusty diet, then I will cut and
put along side some Paiute and if you not

00:01:55.239 --> 00:02:01.920
familiar with that, it's just a meat spread,
it's a Paiute coma pa so a country Paiute

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.009
and I am just going, it's a lot for the two
of us, so I am going to kind of slightly smaller

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:18.129
slices in the middle, fan out the bread see
I am not even using the other dishes or any

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:31.099
thing but, somehow, some kind of arrange your
food to make the dishes look impressive and

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:41.549
slide a little bit of Paiute con pane to serve
with a little spreader and these are the last

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.189
things we need, get set for our French bistro
lunch.
