00:00:01.268 --> 00:00:02.836
- HELLO.

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:08.008
TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
THE CANING OF CHARLES SUMNER.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.476
[chuckles]

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:13.881
- IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 1800s,
KANSAS IS UP FOR WHETHER OR NOT

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.083
IT'S GOING TO BE A SLAVE STATE
OR A FREE STATE.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:19.386
CHARLES SUMNER IS A SENATOR,
AN ANTI-SLAVERY RADICAL.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.589
AND CHARLES SUMNER GIVES
A SPEECH ENTITLED

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.057
"THE CRIME AGAINST KANSAS."

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.194
HE BASICALLY SAYS,
KANSAS IS BEING RAPED BY

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:30.898
THE PERPETUATORS OF SLAVERY
WHO WANT IT TO BE A SLAVE STATE.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.567
THEN HE STARTS MAKING
PERSONAL ATTACKS.

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:37.704
HE SAYS, OH, ANDREW BUTLER,
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA,

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:42.509
WHO NORMALLY SITS NEXT TO ME,
BUT UH-OH, YOU HAD A STROKE.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:43.477
YOU ARE NOT HERE.

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:47.915
GUESS WHAT?
YOU ARE A [bleep] PIMP

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.083
FOR THE PROSTITUTE OF SLAVERY.

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.552
OH, YOU KNOW WHO'S
IN THE CHAMBER THAT DAY?

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:56.323 line:0%
 
PRESTON BROOKS, REPRESENTATIVE,
SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.658
ANDREW BUTLER'S SECOND COUSIN.

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:02.429
HE'S LIKE, THIS DUDE IS [bleep]
SLANDERING MY STATE.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.731
HE'S SLANDERING MY FAMILY.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:09.436
AND HE SAYS, UHHH.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.606
[blows raspberry]

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:13.974
AND THE SOUTHERN
CODE OF HONOR.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.577
I CAN'T LET THIS [bleep] JUST
[bleep] TRANSPIRE.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.178
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:21.882
I CAN'T CHALLENGE HIM TO A DUEL
BECAUSE ONLY GENTLEMEN DUEL,

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.418
AND CHARLES SUMNER'S
IS NO GENTLEMAN.

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:25.919
OH, [bleep].

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.689
I WAS JUST GIVEN
A BRAND-NEW

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.959
11 1/2 OUNCE
GUTTA-PERCHA CANE

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:33.961
WITH A GOLD HEAD.
I'LL BEAT HIM WITH THAT.

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:37.764 line:0%
 
MAY 22, 1856.

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.501
HE WALKS DOWN
THE AISLE OF THE SENATE.

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:45.639
HE'S FIVE [bleep] FEET
FROM CHARLES SUMNER

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.642
AND HE LOOKS UP
AND HE REALIZES

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:49.409
THERE'S A LADY
IN THE CHAMBER.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.645
HE'S LIKE, OH, [bleep].

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:54.014
I CAN'T BEAT CHARLES SUMNER
IN FRONT OF A LADY

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:57.618
AND HE SITS ACROSS THE AISLE.
HE LEAVES.

00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.820
HE'S LIKE,
NO, I'M NOT DOING THIS THING.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.388
AND THEN EVERYONE'S JUST LIKE,
YOU GOT TO DO THE THING,

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.257
AND HE WALKS BACK IN.

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:06.093
[bleep] CHARLES SUMNER,
HE'S NEAR-SIGHTED.

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:09.663
HE'S LIKE, OH,
THAT'S ALL BLURRY AND [bleep].

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:10.898
[bleep] PRESTON BROOKS IS LIKE,

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:12.699
I READ YOUR SPEECH TWICE,
AND GUESS WHAT?

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.135
IT'S A [bleep] LIBEL
AGAINST SOUTH CAROLINA

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.004
AND IT'S A LIBEL
AGAINST ANDREW BUTLER.

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:17.938
AND GUESS WHAT?

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:21.141
HE'S A [bleep] COUSIN OF MINE.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:22.876
AND WHACK!

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.545
BEATS HIM SO HARD
ON THE [bleep] TOP OF THE HEAD

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:25.712
THAT HE GOES BLIND.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:26.713
LAURENCE KEITT COMES IN.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:27.381
LET THEM BE, HE SAID.
