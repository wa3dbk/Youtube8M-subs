00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.259
Actually, the title is
interesting.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.378
It is Materials of Equilibrium.
A lot of people who look at the

00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:20.365
content would think of this as,
you know, this comes out of a

00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:24.086
course that used to be called
Thermodynamics of Materials

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:28.006
which is a standard staple of
students who would do graduate

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.942
materials education.
Almost everybody would have

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:35.467
this as a requirement.
We deliberately changed the

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:39.280
title to Materials of
Equilibrium to make it something

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.654
broader.
We really wanted it to be

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:44.028
Standard Classical
Thermodynamics,

00:00:44.028 --> 00:00:47.697
which is what we do,
but wanted to broaden that into

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:51.223
sort of modern metrics to
understand and study the

00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:55.251
energetics of the materials.
What we do is we essentially

00:00:55.251 --> 00:01:00.000
teach, first of all,
we teach three large segments.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.070
One is classical
thermodynamics.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.011
And the idea is that people
need to see the general frame in

00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:09.751
which you can set up an energy
description for materials.

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.223
How they react with their
environment.

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:14.427
How they react with other
systems.

00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:18.167
So we wanted to teach them
first the general framework in

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.706
which to study energetics of
materials.

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:23.912
And the reason we want it that
general is because

00:01:23.912 --> 00:01:27.452
thermodynamics really has
evolved from being a science

00:01:27.452 --> 00:01:31.393
with a fixed application in
material science that would have

00:01:31.393 --> 00:01:35.000
been used for studying
metallurgy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.776
You know, making steel,
refining of ores and things

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:41.117
like that.
Very standard sort of

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:45.120
application so that you could
almost teach through the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.141
applications.
Now thermodynamics has much

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.296
more evolved to a much broader
range of applications and

00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:55.015
materials.
People use it on polymers.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:02:00.000
People use it on thin films.
People use it in biology.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.318
So we couldn't just teach
through applications anymore

00:02:03.318 --> 00:02:06.699
because there were too many.
And we don't know where it

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:08.828
might go next.
So, because of that,

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:12.397
I feel it real important to
teach the generic framework so

00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:16.279
that a student can go with this
and whatever they meet in their

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.221
research apply it.
So that is about six weeks of

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:20.912
lecturing.
After that, since

00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:24.418
thermodynamics is a macroscopic
description of materials,

00:02:24.418 --> 00:02:27.924
I would teach statistical
mechanics, which is the science

00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:31.055
that teaches you how to relate
microscopic details,

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:35.000
atomic level details to the
thermodynamics.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.837
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]
titanium and another aluminum.

00:02:40.837 --> 00:02:46.894
So that is the second piece.
And then the third piece is

00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:52.841
essentially taking all that and
making it more applied.

00:02:52.841 --> 00:03:00.000
So now we say we are going to
study solutions of materials.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.571
We are going to study thin
films of materials.

00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:06.190
We may study now polymer
mixtures.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.285
So those are the essential
three pieces.

00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:13.730
And so there is an enormous
emphasis on understanding the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.380
concepts behind what we teach.
Because of that,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.714
for example,
I do not assign homeworks on a

00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:24.206
weekly basis.
I feel that the time over which

00:03:24.206 --> 00:03:30.000
things have to sink in is longer
than a week in many cases.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.043
So we have sets of assignments
that go on the Web.

00:03:33.043 --> 00:03:35.279
Students do not have to turn
them in.

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:39.006
A week later the solution is
gone so they can work on this at

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:41.739
their own pace.
Well, the way we evaluate the

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.037
students is in a very classical
sense.

00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:47.329
We have two mid-term exams.
The first one is purely on

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.118
classical thermodynamics so it
would be the first block of the

00:03:51.118 --> 00:03:54.223
lecture, the course.
And there is a second mid-term

00:03:54.223 --> 00:03:57.950
which largely covers statistical
mechanics and some classical

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.461
thermodynamics.
And then there is a

00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:04.000
comprehensive file.
And, actually,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.307
the comprehensive file is
weighted for half of the grade,

00:04:08.307 --> 00:04:11.000
so it is a very extensive
weighting.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.923
And, again, that comes back to
the idea that I feel,

00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:19.000
you know, this is a difficult
subject, thermodynamics,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.461
and students need sufficient
dwell time on it.

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:26.769
So I feel that I can only
really evaluate them in the end

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:31.515
whether they understand it.
If it were up to me,

00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:35.454
I would probably put even more
emphasis on the final.

00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:38.030
And so, the final is
comprehensive.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.893
It covers the whole course,
and also the integration

00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:46.590
between the different sections.
So 3.20 Energetics of Materials

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.757
is a required course for all our
incoming DMSE students.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:55.454
So they would take it typically
in their first semester at MIT.

00:04:55.454 --> 00:05:00.000
It is a recommended course for
master students.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.623
Masters can also take a
shortened version of it.

00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:05.749
But typically what we see is
that most of the students in

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.210
Material Science will take that
course in their first semester.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.559
And the reason it is taken in
the first semester is there are

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.736
a lot of other classes that
build on it.

00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:17.639
You could see this course
really as the kind of basic

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.877
description of how materials
evolve, what their equilibrium

00:05:20.877 --> 00:05:24.226
states are, how they interact
with their environment so other

00:05:24.226 --> 00:05:27.129
classes that talk about phase
transformations between

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.087
materials or mechanical
behavior, the relation between

00:05:30.087 --> 00:05:33.102
mechanical properties and
processing would all build on

00:05:33.102 --> 00:05:36.882
this course.
It makes sense that it is

00:05:36.882 --> 00:05:39.894
taught early.
So the course has a thermal

00:05:39.894 --> 00:05:42.680
help email list which gets
logged now.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.768
That started,
we always had a thermal help

00:05:45.768 --> 00:05:50.286
email, and those emails would
get distributed to the staff in

00:05:50.286 --> 00:05:53.072
the class.
And whoever felt they could

00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:57.439
answer the question would pick
it up and cc everybody so we

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:02.046
knew it was answered.
And then we had a creative TA

00:06:02.046 --> 00:06:05.080
who said, you know,
we have all these really

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.455
interesting answers to questions
and we really should aggregate

00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:11.995
this.
And so, that is how the log got

00:06:11.995 --> 00:06:14.606
started.
And now you can actually look

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:18.840
online and look at the questions
that were asked other years,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.004
the answers that were given.
And the students find that very

00:06:23.004 --> 00:06:25.544
useful.
Thermodynamics is a difficult

00:06:25.544 --> 00:06:28.014
subject.
It is one that is extremely

00:06:28.014 --> 00:06:31.048
difficult to learn in one
setting, you know,

00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:35.000
and in one pass through the
material.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.948
You know, it is not like taking
a course in PowerPoint or

00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:43.179
something where you learn facts.
Thermodynamics is more about

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:46.423
assembling the facts in a
continuous framework.

00:06:46.423 --> 00:06:48.961
And it took me many years to do
that.

00:06:48.961 --> 00:06:51.500
So maybe my advice is to not
give up.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.237
It is a tough subject,
but it is one of these subjects

00:06:55.237 --> 00:06:58.570
that once you get it you wonder
why it was so hard.
