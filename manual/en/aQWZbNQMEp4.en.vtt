00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.900
The Far Cry 4 PvP Team invited 
the entire studio to pitch new DLC ideas...

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500
In the elevator.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.800
If you had an idea for what we could do for a Far Cry 4 DLC,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.740
get in the elevator and share it with us.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500
And it was like, up and down, up and down.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.500
I took a ride, specifically to time it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.600
As soon as I got finished with mine, I went to an elevator,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.240
I rode it down and I rode it back up.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
THE PITCH

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.220
Alright, so the idea for overrun is that 
both teams, the Raksasha and the Golden Path,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.660
are fighting on the frontlines of their war
and they're trying to take over territory.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.000
There is a zone that pops-up in one of 
three locations in the map

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.860
and each team as to fight within it
and occupy it for the right amount of time

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.360
or the most amount of time to take it over.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.500
At the end of the game whoever is...

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.500
That's 45 seconds.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.500
At the end of the game whoever has occupied the zone 
for the most amount of time is the winner.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500
The cool part about this is that 
it shoves both teams togeher

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.000
in an area, but doesn't give 
them something specific to do.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.820
So you get a lot of really fun Far Cry play

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.000
And you get people being able to 
do whatever they want in a certain area.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.360
The end!

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.500
THE BUGGY

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.000
Sweet vehicles are Far Cry.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.100
And one of the sweetest vehicles we dind't get 
to include in our initial offering was, the Buggy.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.100
As the Golden Path you get the chance to 
come in all guns blazing with your dune buggy

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.100
And you get to circle around, 
you're going to fight the Raksasha 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.100
while probably employing the same techniques
you just used to defend your zone.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.100
You have a great idea,
let's hear it.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.000
And if it really is, what we want.
Let's do it, let's make it a reality.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.500
So it was a fantastic opportunity for everyone.
Including us, to be able to do that
