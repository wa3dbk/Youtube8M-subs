00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.550
The Mighty Missouri River is one of Kansas’
three navigable rivers, and many enjoy fishing,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.120
swimming, and floating this public water.
But it is a deep and powerful river, one that

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.230
must always be respected. The navigation channel
is always at least 9 feet deep, and depths

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.619
of 35 feet or more can be found. When boating
this big river, you need to know the rules

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.569
of the road.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:34.310
Kirk Thompson, Public Lands Manager for Kansas
Wildlife &amp; Parks, provides a few tips when

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.960
navigating the Missouri:

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.750
“The Missouri River is a big river system.
It’s a navigable stream, which means it’s

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.980
open to the public below the high water mark
of the river. And on this big river system,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.780
you still need to be very careful when you’re
boating. We have snags in some of the shallow

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.570
water, and all up and down the river, there
are wing dikes that jut out from the banks

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.269
which control the current and keep the current
in the deepwater channel. And these wing dikes

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.960
can sometimes be just under the water. And
if you’re boating, you have to be very careful

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.049
that you don’t run your motor over the top
of that, it can take your lower unit out.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.700
Also, you have to be careful of the snags
that catch on them, and they can also do damage

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.159
to your boat.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:34.359
“Green is on the west bank, and red is on
the east bank. It helps them navigate, so

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:39.719
if you’re r at night and you see a green
one, you know the shallow water is to the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.639
west, and if it’s red, you know that’s
the east bank.

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:48.770
“On the Missouri River, you can use either
fishing license, Kansas or Missouri, on either

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.659
bank. People from Missouri can come onto the
Kansas bank and fish with a Missouri license,

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.439
and people from Kansas can go to Missouri
and fish on their bank with a Kansas license.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.329
“On the Missouri River you’ll catch about
any species that’s in the state of Kansas,

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.220
and there’s probably some species in the
Missouri River that you won’t find anywhere

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.970
else, except maybe the Kansas River up to
Lawrence.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.670
“The biggest catfish that I’ve heard come
out of here was probably just a little over

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.600
a hundred pounds. It was a blue catfish, l;and
it was just south of Atchison where it was

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.810
caught.”

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.760
Special, reciprocal length and creel limits
apply for the Missouri River boundary waters

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.420
between Kansas and Missouri. Check the 2010
Kansas Fishing Regulations Summary for details.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.580
For a big river fishing or boating experience,
give the Missouri a try. Boat ramps can be

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.230
found at Kaw point in Kansas City, Atchison,
St. Joseph, and White Cloud. No matter where

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.120
you float, always wear your life jacket. And
please, help keep our rivers clean.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.591
