00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.920
Rosh Hashana is
coming, and I thought

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.810
it would be a good
time to learn how

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.280
to make the traditional round
challah for the holiday.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.380
Many different cultures
have interpreted it

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.410
in different ways.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.130
So I thought I'd show you
three different ways that you

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.440
can make your challah
special for the holidays.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.400
Right over here,
I've got my dough.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.000
And a lot of times, people
just roll it out and roll it up

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.950
into a tight ball.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.280
But I just take it
and squeeze it first.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.820
And then you let gravity work
with you to actually extend it.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.576
It doesn't have to
be perfectly smooth,

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:42.460
and it will work out just fine.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.430
The only thing you
need to do is decide

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.530
which end you want to be
the top of your crown.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.670
So this is going to
be the top my crown,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.850
and I'm pulling it over to
make it perfectly smooth.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.080
Then I'm right-handed.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.690
So I'm going to hold the
dough, the smooth part,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.330
in my left hand.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.484
And I am going to extend.

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:09.100
Lift up the center
just a little.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.720
And then I'm just going to
turn the dough around my hand.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.550
And then push the end
dough, half squeeze it in,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.800
so it's tucked under.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.270
And pinch so it won't
open up when you bake it.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.020
And that's all there is to it.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.880
Just remember to hold one end
up, and then twirl it around.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.006
Now this is one way of doing it.

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:37.170
Another way is to make
four strands of dough.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.615
And I've made
three, and I'm going

00:01:39.615 --> 00:01:44.600
to show you the fourth, again,
letting gravity work with you.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.630
This dough is very yellow,
by the way, because I always

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.650
put a little yellow
food coloring in to make

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.390
it look like a very rich dough.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.840
But it also, this
particular one I've

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.570
made with a little
orange blossom water,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.640
a little orange
zest, and Craisins.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.460
And I thought it would be fun.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.840
But I added honey to it.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.800
So now I have four
strips of dough.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.180
I don't have to worry
that the ends are perfect.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.870
In this, they're all
about the same diameter.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.250
I'm going to take
two strips that way.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.940
One strip, I'm going to place
like a tic-tac-toe board,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.290
over and under.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.650
The other one, in the opposite
direction, over and under.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.550
See, and you thought
all those potholders

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.720
you made as a child
were for nought.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.620
There you go.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.940
Now, all you need to do, you
have for groupings of two.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.750
Take the one that's under first.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.340
Go over to the left, over to
the left, over to the left,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.430
and over to the left.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.180
Now I still have four,
but they're different.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.250
Now I go to the right.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.030
The one that's under goes over.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.455
The one that's under the
last twist goes over.

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:13.370
Under, over, under, over.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.400
Again, I still have it
spread out a little further,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.830
but I have two to the left,
two to the right, two up,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.320
and two down.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.720
Now, I take-- going
left again, because I'm

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.229
using the under piece of
dough, over, over, over, over.

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.985
And then I do the
other direction.

00:03:35.985 --> 00:03:40.320
Counter clockwise there,
counter clockwise there,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.690
counter clockwise there,
and counter clockwise there.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.550
At this point, you can either
bring the balls of dough

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.180
up and pinch it this way
and turn it upside down.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.930
And I'll show you.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.755
It looks the same.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.170
So we pinched the top
together, flip it over,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.910
and there is your beautiful
braid for your Rosh Hashanah

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.830
round challah.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.930
It looks like the
crown of God, which

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.920
was very traditional
in the Middle East,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.820
as well as in Eastern Europe.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.570
Now last thing I have here,
I made another little round.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.270
But out of a little extra
bit of dough, I made a bird.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.900
Because it's also symbolic.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.610
In Algeria, they
would take a bird--

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.060
I once tried sculpting
a bird out of dough.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.290
That was not going to fly
up to heaven or any place.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.430
So I decided rolling the
dough out and then cutting out

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.300
a piece-- here's my
bird cookie cutter--

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.790
brushing the egg white over
it-- the egg white acts as

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:57.260
the glue-- and then placing
the bird on the challah.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.340
And then brushing that as
well and letting it rise.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.440
And then when you're
finished, your bird

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.725
will be, symbolic of your
wishes, flying to heaven.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.860
May you have a wonderful,
happy, and healthy New Year

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.500
with never ending good.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.025
L'shanah tovah.
