00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.800
My job is fixing peoples pipes. Celebrity
clientele mostly. They have needs, I solve

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.800
problems.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.530
The nature of my job is that I am always on
the move. That means I always have my tools,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.760
and that's why I handle my business with Xero
Touch.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.170
It's the mobile app from Xero and I use it
to get all kinds of things done. At the start

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.230
of the day I do the bank rec.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.539
Every new transaction comes in from the bank
overnight and I clear them one at a time to

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.370
make sure everything is right.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.320
I can easily check the balances of my accounts
to see how the business is doing which is

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.320
pretty good.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.130
And it's not just for checking on my money
it's for real work to, like invoicing for

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:55.100
a job as soon as I finish it.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.120
Xero Touch is always with me so I don't have
to wait until I'm at a computer to do things

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.059
like enter my expenses.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.150
Of course I can't do it all myself, that's
what my accountant is for. I can get in touch

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.210
with him through Xero anytime I need him.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.280
"I'm Charles Green. "

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.560
He can take a look at my cash summery report
and let me know that everything is looking

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.560
good.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.970
"Everything is looking good."

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.490
See.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.799
All my data is in the cloud.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.760
So Charles doesn't need to wait for any files
to do his work.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.130
There are so many celebrity pipes in this
town I have a team of plumbers in the field

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.890
all using Xero Touch.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.740
Which makes it real easy to keep an eye on
the numbers. Everything runs smoothly and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.470
I go on doing what I do best.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.659
Xero Touch, it's a pleasure doing business.
