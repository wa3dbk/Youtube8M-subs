00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.000
In this video, we will show you how to install some fog lights.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.500
It will take 45 to 60 minutes

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.260
We chose some Hella Micro DE.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:22.320
You will need a ratchet-box and a screwdriver, a wire stripper, pliers, some shrink tubing and a 20A fuse.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.660
Here we can see the light right out of the box, with already installed mount.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.880
This kit comes also with some cable, cable lugs and a relay.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.200
First you need to remove some isolation, in order to plug on one cable plug at one end.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.800
Then we push the other end right through the light´s cap.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now you can plug in all the lugs and close the cap safely.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.200
As our next step, we protect our wiring with a cable protection hose.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.200
It is not necessary, but looks way more neat.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.660
And this is, by the way, a pretty shitty work to do...

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:00.796
Well yeah....let´s go on.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.800
Our next step is it to install the lights on the bumper.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.020
Here we can use the already existing holes and the screws, which came with the kit.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.360
We will find some mass at any screw that you can find near the bumper

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.220
All other cables should be lead through the engine bay to your fuse box.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060
In our case, you will only see that protection hose.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.000
Right next to the fuse box, we mount our relay, onto which we plug our wiring like the following:

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.700
The remaining cables of our lights should be plugged onto clamp 87.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.840
Because we do not link the fog lights with our headlights, we will need some mass on clamp 85.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:55.540
You will get your shunt right from the main fuse´s screw. We also add our 20A fuse, that we mentioned before. It should find it´s place between relay and main fuse. This construction has to be plugged on clamp 30.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.640
We still need to install our switch. That one goes to clamp 86.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.300
Here you can see, by the way, our 20A fuse...

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:12.880
The switch´s cable runs along right behind there, right through our engine bay, until we reach a good place to get access to the interior.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.480
Look for a nice place for your switch. We drilled a hole into the dashboard and used a simple toggle switch.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.540
That ist it!

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.180
Don´t forget to ajust the position of the lights and you´re done.
