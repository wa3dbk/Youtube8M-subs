Mark: My name is Mark Hutchinson, and I'm
a extension educator with the University of

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.869
Maine Cooperative Extension. I work out of
Knox and Lincoln County.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.621
So, a lot of times when I'm talking to a home
composter about composting, I relate it to

00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:20.900
actually baking a cake. Knowing what ingredients
that it is you need, getting them all together,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.449
knowing how much of that ingredient you need,
then actually the blending process and mixing

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.909
in the bowl is what you're actually doing
by turning your piles. And then, actually

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.109
cooking the pile.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.220
How long does it take to cook, and knowing
that in your cake, and also with the compost,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.079
you can make compost in as short as four months.
But, most homeowners are more like, 18 months

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.080
or a year. They're not in a hurry to get that
finished compost. And then, the last part

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.670
of it is actually letting those cookies cool,
or the cake cool. That's called the curing

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.940
stage in composting. And then, the finished
product at the end.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.089
What I have here are two buckets of finished
compost. This is a compost that I actually

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.890
made at my own home. So, it's been going for
about 18 months, and you can see it's a nice

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.800
fine material, but it's got a lot of rough
particles in it. So, what I like to do in

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.520
my home composting before I use it is actually
to strain it.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.330
What I've done is, I've actually built a screen
with quarter-inch hardware cloth with just

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.750
a simple wood frame that fits over my wheelbarrow,
and what I do is, I take the finished compost

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.640
and I actually pour it on the screen.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.790
[sound of pouring]

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:35.600
And then, I shake the screen gently. All the
fine particles come down through, and what

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.970
you're left with is all the hard particles--these
are actually roots from things that have grown

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.520
in the pile--and all the bigger particles.
What I do with this is, I would actually throw

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.550
it back into my compost pile and recycle it,
which is a good way to inoculate the new piles

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.810
or to add those microorganisms.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.503
What your end product is, is this nice fine
material, very consistent in the particle

00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:05.560
size, that would work really nicely in your
gardens as a soil amendment.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.250
So, this is a really great way. You're going
to start with a large volume of material,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.890
and by the end, it's going to reduce in volume
by about 50 percent. So, you're not going

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.560
to get a lot of material out of that cubic
yard, but you're going to get enough manure

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.250
to support your small vegetable garden or
a perennial garden. But it's also a great

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.950
way, remember, to recycle your organic materials,
and reduce the material going into the landfills.
