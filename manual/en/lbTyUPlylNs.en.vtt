\f0\fs24 \cf0 To cast on with a ruffle yarn
that has a railroad structure or an open box

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.910
structure, at the edge of the yarn, the first
thing you want to do is because there's a

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.900
little bit of a rough edge is to fold over
these first two boxes so that they overlap

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.019
the second two boxes. That will tuck the edge
of your yarn away into your project, and then

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.410
just treat those as if they were one stitch
each. To cast on, you're actually picking

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.680
up stitches by putting your needle into these
open spaces that are at the edge of the yarn.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.320
You want to go from back to front wrap up
and over, into the back of the yarn and towards

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.920
you up and over, into the yarn and towards
you again so that when you're ready to knit

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.250
these stitches, the legs of these stitches
are oriented in the correct direction. You

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.859
keep doing that until you have the desired
number of stitches on your needle and when

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:13.850
you do you simply turn it around and get ready
to knit. In order to knit with this yarn you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.090
can either knit it very traditionally in through
the front leg wrap the yarn up and over at

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.869
this point you can make the decision do i
want to knit into the next box into two boxes

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.189
away, three boxes away, the choice that you
make will determine how ruffly the end product

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.679
is. Up and over just as you would normally.
If you want to make the product even more

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:44.380
ruffly in the end, you can knit into the back
leg of the stitch. To bind off using this

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:53.409
yarn you can just do a traditional bind off
knitting the first stitch, knitting the second

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:01.189
stitch and using the left needle, pass that
first stitch over the second stitch and then

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.920
continue on knitting one stitch passing the
first stitch over that new stitch and off

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.739
the needle. You want to be sure that you're
doing this loosely so that the edge of your

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.170
scarf or shawl doesn't pull too tightly together.
