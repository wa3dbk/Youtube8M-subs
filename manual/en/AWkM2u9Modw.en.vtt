00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.950
Today we are going to be installing the Prodigy,
part number 90185, on a 2004 Chevrolet Suburban.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.570
We also are going to using the Prodigy adapter
for the Suburban, part number 3015-P. The

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.470
first thing we want to do is to locate the
port that the brake control plug is going

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.470
to plug into.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.689
As you can see, we are in the drivers side
cab area, underneath the steering column.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.189
It will be located on the top row, second
from the left.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.019
So what we are going to do is go ahead and
remove the cover here, and go ahead and plug

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.239
in the brake control plug.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:44.109
And we are going to go ahead and plug in part
3015-P. And it plugs in right there.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.649
And as you can see, the other end of the harness
here has the plug end for the Prodigy itself.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.390
So I am going to go ahead and route these
wires up and over, out of the way.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.019
And then we are going to go ahead and find
a suitable mounting point for the Prodigy

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.390
itself.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.810
OK, I went ahead and routed the harness up
and out of the way.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.930
I have routed it over here to the right side
of the steering column.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.000
On the Chevy Suburban here, there is actually
a lip that is folded under on the bottom side

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.430
of the dash here, which makes a perfect spot
to mount the bracket for the brake controller

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.430
itself.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.189
So I am going to go ahead and mount it in
that location there.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.230
Always make sure you check behind the area
that you are going to be drilling into to

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:35.049
make sure that there are no electrical components
or anything that you are going to damage.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.259
All right, we have got the bracket secured
into place.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:47.520
We are going to go ahead and mount the Prodigy
now.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:02:04.390
And last, but not least, we want to go ahead
and plug in the plug into the back side of

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.720
the Prodigy.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.530
And with our Prodigy plugged in, we just want
to make sure that we put our cover back onto

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.410
the junction box.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:30.760
And this concludes the installation of part
numbers 90185 and 3015-P on a 2004 Chevy Suburban.
