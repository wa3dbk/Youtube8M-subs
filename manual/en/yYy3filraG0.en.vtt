00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.480
Loretta: Hey everybody, what's up?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.480
My name's Loretta.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.480
This is Ava.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.480
Ava: I'm Ava.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.580
Loretta: And Anthony, and right now we're
going to teach you how to dubstep.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.830
Anthony: All right, what we're basically going
to break it down into is two steps and a hit.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.640
On our right foot, we're going to go right,
left, then left.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.760
Left, right and right.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.980
Right, left and left.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.930
Left, right and right.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.620
Now we're going to double time this and speed
it up, so we get the full kind of pace and

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.989
so you guys can see what we're going to be
doing.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:41.989
Ready?

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.710
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.320
Great, so we'll show it to you one more time.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.059
We're going to go right, left and left.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.220
Left, right and right.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.440
One more time.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.809
Right, left and left.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.220
And left, right and right.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.320
Now that you guys have all the feet work down,
we're going to add some arms.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.990
We're going to go right, left and right, and
pulse, left, right and right, and pulse.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.140
And now, when you're grape-vining, your arms
can come kind of down, so it's here and pulse.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.370
Here and pulse.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.649
Here and pulse.

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.090
Here and pulse, and guys that pulse can be
almost a right, left and hit.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.980
Left, right and hit.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.390
Loretta: And done!

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.560
Anthony: And girls, you can even go right,
left and pose.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.390
Loretta: Hair flick.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.950
Anthony: Right, left and pose, right, left
and pose, and that's how you dance the dubstep.
