00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:10.410
One of the youth affiliations in
the country the national FFA

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.530
organization was founded in 1928
as the future farmers of

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.690
America.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.441
Though the name changed during
the Reagan administration, the

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:21.550
group's core commission of
nurturing the next generation of

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:33.100
agricultural leaders has not.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.230
&gt;&gt; Those future leaders are in
good company for the FFA swine

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.230
show.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.450
They lead in pork production.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:50.140
$5 million is dedicated to pork
production alone.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.969
Today's youngsters are
optimistic.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.300
&gt;&gt; With the number of people
growing we have to keep raising.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.530
I'm from Sioux county so we've
got lots of pigs, lots of pig

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.989
barns.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.070
They're still growing and still
building.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.459
&gt;&gt; Some pigs were paraded around
the 2013 Iowa State Fair

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:11.999
showcasing the hard work of FAA
students came their attention to

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:13.599
details.

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:18.340
&gt;&gt; From a profile standpoint
guys, that one's pretty good.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.130
All and all a really solid set
of them.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.159
Let's give them a big round of
applause before we excuse them

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:35.920
back to the barns.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.109
&gt;&gt; Judges from Illinois and
Indiana praise the overall

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.380
quality level this year noting
that such excellence is simply

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.469
par for the course in Iowa.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.689
Let's go back into seven.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.310
&gt;&gt; I was leader in agriculture
particularly corn and soy beans

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.299
and commercial corn production
which is the main meat going

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.029
into supermarkets.

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:08.119
It's been a leader for many many
years.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:17.660
&gt;&gt; FFA strives to fulfill the
superior production knowledge

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.710
coupled with personal skills and
responsibility.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.459
Helping to maintain this way of
life is an important task for

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.459
the organization.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.670
&gt;&gt; There's probably still more
smaller family farms raising

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.200
commercial hogs here in Iowa
maybe than any other state.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.090
The junior programs like we have
here are really really good.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.159
A lot of people just don't
understand what we do.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:47.340
&gt;&gt; This is to keep them going in
the ring so the judges don't

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.570
have to push their pig and to
keep our pigs moving with their

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.150
head up so they can, so we can
get them to the right places in

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.780
the pen, if we do get penned and
make sure the judge says every

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.370
side of the pig.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.590
&gt;&gt; Competitors take pride in
Iowa's legacy as a pork Mecca,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.489
constantly raising the bar for
show pigs.

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.750
Rates turn out year in and year
out, picking a winner isn't

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.189
easy.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.700
&gt;&gt; Only so many people can win.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.290
That's not the main reason why
people do it.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.960
Yet what we do in this is what
makes perfect great.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.569
Competition and yet the kids
along the way, they learn

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.620
responsibility for a lifetime of
effort and work into this.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.670
You can compare it to, you know,
athletics with more

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.010
responsibility.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.639
&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at the
results from this year's FFA

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.680
swine competition.
