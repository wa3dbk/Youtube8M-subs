00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.980
Considering building a pond? Do you have
a lackluster space that needs a little

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
attention? Or do you just want to add the
soothing flow of water in a high-traffic

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.310
area? Incorporating a water feature in
the landscaping is a great way to carve

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.030
out a calm, peaceful setting. (Pond Owner) "We've been
looking at pond for quite a while and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.760
wanted a pond with the waterfall. They're
nice and relaxing, and we added the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.739
little flagstone patio to it so that
we'd have a place to sit and just listen

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.629
to the water falling in the pond." For
years, ponds have been a favorite project

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.230
among outdoor enthusiasts. For
do-it-yourselfers, there are several ways

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.399
to bring water into any setting- whether
it is an above-ground pond that requires

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.129
no digging, or an in-ground pond that
uses a preformed or flexible liner- the

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.159
possibilities are endless. First,
determine how much space is available,

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.560
let that determine your water feature. A
small backyard deck would benefit from a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.390
round preformed pond, a narrow walkway
would house a rectangular pond using a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.340
flexible liner. If space is not an issue,
an organically shaped pond with a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.040
multi-tiered waterfall and a stream like
this one is ideal. When choosing the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.940
location for your pond, there are both
practical and aesthetic points to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.440
consider. Ensure the pond is visible from
many areas- whether from a nearby window

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.940
or an outdoor living area. (Pond Owner) "I was 
very excited to build this pond to spend a

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.190
lot of time in the backyard family and
friends. Until now most of our efforts have

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.350
been in gardening. We decided we'd build
this pond we chose this area's or our

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.360
backyard because it's large enough to
build the pond that we wanted, we could see

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.890
it from several points in pur backyard
and the kitchen window." Also consider

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.780
many plants, such as water lilies, require
six hours of sunlight a day to produce

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.330
blooms. It's best to avoid a location
directly under trees- falling leaves and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.959
matter create debris that can clog
pumps and upset the ponds biological

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.099
balance. For safety reasons, choose a
location that doesn't interfere with any

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.380
underground power lines or gas pipelines.
Also, check your local building codes or

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.180
ordinances related to backyard pools.
Determine the size of the water garden-

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.790
use a water hose or spray paint to
outline the design. Keep in mind- the most

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.020
common water gardener's regret is that
they did not build the pond large enough.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.560
The base of the pond is generally 1.5
feet deep. In colder climates, dig at

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.270
least 2 feet or more to protect fish
against freezing. The base of the pond

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.830
can include several ledges at varying
depths to hold rocks and plants for

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.690
added interest. Make sure the top edges
of your pond are level create an

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.400
elevated 6 to 8 inch ledge around
the perimeter- this will help keep

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.020
unwanted water from flowing into the
pond. Remove any rock or debris from the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.459
base and walls of the pond. Underlayment
is needed to protect the liner from

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.230
punctures. Sand or carpet remnants 
may be used.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.340
Now that you know the size of your pond,
determine the size of the liner and take

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.049
into account all added pond ledges and
allow an extra two feet for edging.

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:34.580
Unfold the liner and cover the pond tuck
the liner tightly in all areas and anchor with stones.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.959
To choose a pump, start with a simple
formula: average length times average

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:49.640
width times average depth x 7.5; this is
how many gallons your pump should

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.840
circulate. This pond utilizes the smartpond®
UV 1300 gallons per hour Waterfall

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.819
Pump. Once the pond liner is covered with
stones, position the pump at the base of

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.349
the pond on top of a brick or a flat
stone- this will keep the pump from

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.940
sucking in debris at the bottom of the
pond. The corrugated tubing and cord of

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.720
the pump should be hidden within a fold
of the liner and run over the edge of

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.269
the pond. To ensure maximum cleaning
efficiency, a smartpond® UV Pond Filter

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.199
was added to improve the pond's water
quality while promoting the growth of

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.539
beneficial bacteria. What does this
really mean? A crystal clear, healthy pond.

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.729
This is the perfect time to add lighting-
this cord can also be tucked into a fold

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.320
of the liner. Continue by adding large
stones around the edge to anchor the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.480
liner, the liner should extend at least
10 inches past the elevated edge. Trim

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.900
and bury the excess liner or cover with
stone or rock. This pond features an impressive

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.460
waterfall. The elevation was created with
cinderblocks and excess dirt from the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.480
pond. Corrugated tubing runs
from the pump to the filter and from the

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.790
filter to the top of the waterfall. The
waterfall pumpforces water to fall

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.710
down multiple levels of slate, meander
the stream, and pass gently into the pond.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.450
To the greatest extent practical,
minimize the number of bends and turns in

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.550
the tubing- this will maximize the flow
of water. For more information concerning
