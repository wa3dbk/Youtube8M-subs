00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.990
The stresses aircraft face have always been
hard on filler putties.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.630
Not one had what it takes to stand up to the
stress.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:20.290
Until now: Until Sherwin-Williams pulled out
the big guns with Fill Bond.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.970
Fill Bond: an advanced formula is the very
first Sherwin-Williams putty designed specifically

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.820
for aerospace use.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.900
What makes it better?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.230
It all starts with its no mess, no waste dispensing
guns.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.930
All you have to do is shake one of these double
barrel cartridges and pop it onto the gun.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.050
Then just squeeze the trigger.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.270
The two materials are mixed automatically
at the exact ratio needed.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.270
The Fill Bond dispensing gun also enables
you to apply the putty exactly where you want

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.270
it.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.140
No other tools necessary.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.260
And when you're finished, there's zero waste.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.649
Just put the cap back on the cartridge and
use it on the next job to save on material

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.400
and disposal costs.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.000
There's no question that dispensing gun takes
a lot of hassles out of the mixing, application,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.460
and storage processes, but paint crews also
really like how easy to Fill Bond material

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.900
is to work with.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.140
The Fill Bond works great.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.270
I like the consistency of it.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.270
Spreads good.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.370
Fill Bond is a lot smoother.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.190
When you lay it on you don't have to worry
about going over it again.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.210
I mean, you can go over it multiple times
without it clumping up and flaking off.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.860
Fill Bond is an epoxy material with great
spread-ability, and a long working time.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:48.520
So it's easy to work Fill Bond into scenes
and rivets before it hardens.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.080
While other putties tend to run when applied
thickly to vertical surfaces, Fill Bond has

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.510
a high degree of anti-slump.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.920
You can apply it to several areas at one time
without it running before you come back to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.240
work and smooth it.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.830
You also shorten the downtime between an application
and sanding with Fill Bond.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.099
It Only need around two to six hours of dry
time before sanding.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.569
The old product we used to use it was inconsistent.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.239
One time be too thick, one time it would be
too thin and we'd mix it the same way every

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.720
time and it would roll up on the applicator
and in it would be inconsistent throughout

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.720
the airplane.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.910
Be thick and thin thick and thin the consistency
was smoother.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.129
It filled better.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.510
It filled the rivets better.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.299
very Easy to spread.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.249
With this it comes out of the tube consistently
every time.

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.840
Simply put, Fill Bond performs.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.219
It isn't just an automotive body putty.

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.700
Fill Bond's formula was developed specifically
for the rigors that an airplane surface must

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.700
endure.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.599
Flexibility is a major component we need on
the airplane.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.279
We have a tube that's constantly pressurized
and depressurizing and you don't have the

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.019
material to be able to do the same thing.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.449
It's pointless putting it in there, a lot
of time effort and costs to do this, and at

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:18.269
the end result is you're going to be back
to square one after six months.

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.269
Why?

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.969
While other putties are extremely rigid, Fill
Bond was engineered to retain a degree of

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:30.999
flexibility, making it ideal for aircraft
seams that are under constant stresses.

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:35.949
Fill Bond was also formulated to have adherence
to all types of surfaces including aluminum

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.849
and composites.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.469
You don't have to worry about high film build
up problems either.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:47.079
You can apply a thick layer of Fill Bond and
it still resists chipping splintering and

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.079
cracking.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.469
Add as an epoxy Fill Bond will not pinhole
when it tries.

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:54.709
To give your operation a perfect fit.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.479
Sherwin-Williams has developed a choice of
Fill Bond dispensing guns.

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.639
Two sizes of manual twin-tube guns.

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.639
And an air-powered twin-tube gun.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.920
It's not as messy.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.199
Usually with other products, you end up with
most of it all over you.

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.209
All over the floor, all of your hands.

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.549
This stuff I've found hardly any.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.900
You're not wasting a lot of product.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.420
I'll tell you right now we zip through this
airplane...and, what?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.400
We've been out here for four hours?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400
Maybe?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400
Tops.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.260
We're practically done with the aircraft.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.400
The consistency is good and it cures a lot
quicker.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.160
We've cut our time and have clean up time
on top of that by you know.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.960
An hour after lunch, we're going to be standing
on this aircraft.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.260
The Other product, we need the next day.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.050
That's a positive thing for me because it
cuts my schedule down.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.400
So, The less we're on the airplane the smaller
and smaller the schedule means at the end

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.100
of the year when you add it all up we can
bring in an airplane.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.660
This is one of the most technically advanced
putties available to the aerospace market.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.350
And Sherwin-Williams has created the delivery
systems that make it easier to apply than

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.610
any other putty.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.750
It's time for you to bring in the big guns.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.690
Ask your Sherwin-Williams representative to
deliver your Fill Bond.
