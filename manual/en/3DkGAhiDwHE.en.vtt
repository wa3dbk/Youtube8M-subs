00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.040
Today I am demonstrating

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.599
the best iPhone 5 and 5s wallet case

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.059
for your iPhone

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.030
as you can see there are a couple of credit card slots here a in the
hard shell case inside. It's also go a 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.820
magnetic buckle

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.949
so it closes securely, nice and neat.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.000
It's the AceCase iPhone 5 wallet case.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.179
it's very handy, very helpful I've tried

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.800
all the other cases out there. I do
technology all day long. I browse Amazon

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.070
all day long a look for this kinda stuff
all day long.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.260
I found that this is the absolute

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.620
best iPhone 5 wallet case that I could find. Let me demo this case for you

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.750
We've got a couple of credit cards here that we can

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.120
slide down into the slots on the case

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.609
Then I've got my iPhone 5 we're just going to pop it in the case

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.300
I've got my driver's license here and a debit card.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.820
The wallet case closes up very nicely. I am going to demonstrate that

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.119
the iPhone can't fall out at all.

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.700
It's securely protected in there so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.130
don't worry about that falling out. All of your card numbers are hidden. It's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.259
not a clear plastic sleeve so that's

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.549
good and secure. The wallet case closes up really nice.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.500
Also has a stand function built into the case

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.890
I'm going to demo the stand function here in a second. If you just prop it up

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.850
on a surface. Like that. The stand

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.390
will allow you to watch videos and

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.680
whatever else you do was propped up in the case.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.090
That is a nice feature while you're sitting in a restaurant

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.479
or waiting for a doctor's office or
facetiming with your

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.140
family. It's a great wallet case. It's got

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.780
all the functionality that I need. It's even got a little hole if you want to have a strap or a carabiner to

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.689
carry it with. And you've got a hole for the camera so you don't have to take it out.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.930
its easy open fluid you can fit about

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.130
two to four cards in the wallet case

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.070
And what I've found is I take this to church
take it other places

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.370
where I just the a card and an ID

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.850
and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.100
my iPhone and can eliminate the wallet and the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.650
bulk in my pocket so it it's very nice
in your pocket.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.810
Slides in and out. It's got soft leather
on it.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.000
It feels really nice in your hand.
It looks really good

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.490
if you take it to business meetings. It's a great all around case.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.360
It's the AceCase iPhone 5 wallet case.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.060
Sadly it doesn't fit the 5c but it is
not the cases fault

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.580
it's actually the 5c's fault because it's got the rounded bevel to it so

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.970
the hard shell case actually doesn't cling to it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.360
So it kind of pops out but the iPhone 5 and 5s

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.540
fit perfectly. It doesn't fall out. Keeps your iPhone secure

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.900
Protects all the way around and so you
don't have to worry about dropping it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.510
and damaging in a really much
anything

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.800
unless you go to ground into an
obviously

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.930
If you throw it hard enough, it probably will hurt the iPhone

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.100
If you have a wallet case like this, it's not meant for

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.870
rough and tough but it does have a
hard shell case to be able to protect

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.430
your iPhone from minor falls and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.360
drops and things like that so anyway this is
the AceCase iPhone 5 wallet case

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.420
It works for the 5 and 5s but not the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.020
5c in it has a 10 out of 10

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.190
review for me it's great case and I take it
everywhere

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.690
You should go get one it's on Amazon

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.740
I think it's http://www.getacecase.com

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.470
or you can also go to Amazon

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.680
The AceCase is the best iPhone 5 wallet case out there and has some really great reviews.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.790
It's the best wallet case hands down.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.550
It's the best case and I take it everywhere.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.880
show you what
