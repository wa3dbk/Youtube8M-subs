00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.069
Hello, this is Bane!

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.099
And we were playing, well, we will be playing

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.540
Five Nights At Freddy's, since it is Halloween

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.540
Eh, the bear's not scary... Alright so let's begin.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.539
Ooh, a new job!

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.800
Okay, I guess I'll work here. You know, just for extra pay.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.800
Eh, first night...em...I don't see anything. This game's kind of stupid-

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.579
Oh, hello. Celebrate! Alright.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.690
Ooh, the phone is ringing! Can I pick up the phone, or-

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.120
-not? Where's the phone?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.670
Power left...alright, they're all there. Oh-

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.739
-hello! 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.440
Aw, how nice. Alright, thank you.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.629
No, I don't know.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.571
Please explain. Uh, it does!

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.360
It does sound rather bad.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.479
Why? Why are they left in that mode?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.630
Oh, I don't like the sound of this.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.520
Oh, that does not sound good.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.009
What is that supposed to mean? Well, don't worry I've got-

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.200
-a mask.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.110
Ah, well they haven't moved yet; it's only Night 1.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.509
Why is it only 1 A.M.?

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.780
Yeah, I don't like the sound of that.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.009
(Humming) That's a lovely song.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.511
I'd like to hear more. (Continues humming)

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.609
(Hums) That's great.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:02.759
Well, screw you!

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.890
Goodnight? I don't really like you anymore.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.229
Alright. They're all still there and they're not causing any trouble. That's good.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.120
They don't appear to moved; they're all right     there. Which, is, you know-

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.480
-that's good.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.200
Let's eat! Are we eating frontal lobe?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.810
You know, maybe I wouldn't be wasting so much power if that fan wasn't running.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.540
Alright; they're all there. Good. That means that Bane is winning, right? Right?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.440
You know what, Bane should draw a picture; I think I'm gonna draw a picture and put-

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.950
-it right

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.410
-up there. Now, isn't that lovely?

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.160
Uh, oh. That's not fair.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.430
Bane's good at making those noises.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.440
(Begins beatboxing)

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.290
I'm Bane, playing- oh, that's not even fair! Where are you?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.290
Hello! Please don't come near me. I'm Bane! Although, I did die by getting shot in-

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.549
-the frontal lobe!

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.870
So, that might seem rather attractive. And, yes, it was the frontal lobe. She shot me-

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.840
-right in the head!

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.040
Alright, did you get closer, because- okay, yep. Now-

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.510
-where are you? Oh, hello.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.459
I mean for some reason for them to get
to me they have to go right-

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.780
in front of the security cameras, but I'm fine with that; that's cool! Now you're-

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.940
-why'd you go back there? That doesn't
really make any sense.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.079
It's 4 A.M. I think we can survive. You still there?

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.709
Oh, you're there. This is just how the game works. Why is my power going down so much?

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.859
That's not even fair! You know-

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.859
-I'm Bane, so I really don't have to deal with this-

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.630
-crappy job. Why are you there? Okay, so
you're right there.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.359
Oh, it's 5 A.M. Lovely. Okay, you are right there...

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.579
I guess they took my picture down; they must not have liked my picture. Peek-a-boo!

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.440
Peek-a-boo! You're still right there. Oh.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.560
Oh, you're screaming. Bane does not like this game anymore.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.660
Bane does not want to play this game. I am the master of darkness.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.520
Good, you're not there. How about you?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.870
Bane's getting scared! Bane really doesn't like this game!

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.720
Where are you? Oh, you're back there. Stupid Bane.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.660
Let's check over here. Oh. No wonder you bit a kid's head off!

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.180
Yay! Bane won!

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.650
Well, that is just- that's splendid! Well, I'm done with this-

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.880
-job, wow! This job sucks- What?

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.860
A second night? Well, that's enough for one day.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.950
And, I guess this is Five Nights At Freddy's, so-

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.100
-what else can you expect? Anyway, if you would like to see more videos-

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.620
-with Bane and other celebrities, even though Bane's most important!

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.880
Make sure you subscribe to CelebGaming for more FNAF videos-

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.680
-and, this is Bane. And-

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.880
-now, this is awkward.
