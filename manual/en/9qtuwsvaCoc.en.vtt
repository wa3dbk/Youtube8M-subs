The Water Cycle: Nature’s Recycling System

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.010
The Sun’s energy warms the water, water
becomes water vapor and enters the atmosphere

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.590
where it forms clouds.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.109
The clouds, carried by winds, release condensed
water back to the earth’s surface as precipitation,

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.079
which accumulates on the surface and as snowpack
in the mountains.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.290
Small amounts of water held by plants, animals,
automobiles and buildings are evaporated back

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.640
into the atmosphere.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.910
Most of the water that returns to the earth’s
surface as precipitation will infiltrate the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.960
soil, percolating into underground aquifers,
or running off the surface into bodies of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.430
water.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.920
Smaller amounts are drawn up by plants, transpired
through leaves, and evaporate back into the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.350
atmosphere.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.120
We cannot control the hydrologic cycle.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.510
And the water supply is fixed.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.580
So water must be conserved and properly managed.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.240
When it rains, each drop of water hits the
earth like a small bomb, loosening particles

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.869
of soil which flow into waterways as sediment.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.010
Riparian buffers, living barriers of tree
and brush, can prevent sediment and pollutants

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.939
from entering waterways.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.180
Contour strip cropping, ribbons of vegetation
between row crops, prevents water erosion

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.579
from taking topsoil.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.679
Crop residue left on fields also helps prevent
erosion.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.770
It lessens the impact of falling rain and
holds topsoil on the land.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.869
Cities and built up areas, where the land
is largely covered by pavement, prevent water

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.229
from soaking into the soil.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.740
In these areas, water runs off in high velocity
through storm drains and sewers, carrying

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.189
pollutants into the water system.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.390
As the earth’s population grows, the demand
for water will grow with it.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.109
Sound management of water will be key to maintaining
a safe, abundant water supply.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.119
