00:00:01.035 --> 00:00:03.095
If you've ever used translation software

00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:07.013
You've probably seen how bad the accuracy can be

00:00:07.013 --> 00:00:11.001
Many times the translation is literal, or possibly even wrong

00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:15.040
Hi, I'm one of the American English voices of myLanguage Pro

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.025
The premiere translation app for iPhone and iPod Touch

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:22.087
Recently featured worldwide on the iTunes App Store

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:27.068
myLanguage Pro has quickly become a must-have travel app

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:32.068
Offering the most diverse language selection of any translation platform

00:00:32.068 --> 00:00:37.018
myLanguage Pro currently translates between 55 different languages

00:00:37.018 --> 00:00:39.055
and that number is rapidly growing

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:41.040
Quanto costa?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.065
To provide the most accurate and appropriate translations

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:48.042
myLanguage Pro asks the user to select a regional dialect

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.027
such as Mexico Spanish

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:52.005
¿Cuánto cuesta?

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.082
What is so special about myLanguage Pro?

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:57.060
The answer is YOU, the users!

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.089
myLanguage Pro is the first translation app

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.090
to provide translations which have been approved by the community

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.077
If you aren't happy with a translation, please help us make it better

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:12.048
First: rate the translation less than 5 stars

00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:14.097
Next: provide a suggestion

00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:17.037
Finally: tap the submit button

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:22.018
All of these ratings and suggestions are worked back into the translation database

00:01:22.018 --> 00:01:25.067
Using our patent pending hybrid translation engine

00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:28.075
Resulting in increasingly accurate translations

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:33.002
In addition to being the most accurate and diverse translation app

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:36.052
myLanguage Pro provides an impressive array of features

00:01:36.052 --> 00:01:41.023
Perhaps the most impressive is the high-quality text-to-speech voices

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:43.068
Как тебя зовут?

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:46.040
One language is never enough!

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.028
You'll surely be amazed by the voice quality

00:01:49.028 --> 00:01:53.060
It doesn't sound like a computer, it sounds like a native speaker of the language

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.015
Allowing you to hear the differences in accent and dialect, like never before

00:01:58.015 --> 00:02:00.042
Ett språk er aldri nok

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:06.025
Another great feature is transliteration, which makes non-latin text more readable

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:10.067
The world seems like it's getting smaller every day

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:15.002
myLanguage Pro is a fun, engaging and practical application

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:19.046
That will give you an edge in conversation, travel, school and business

00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:21.081
