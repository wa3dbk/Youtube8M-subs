00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:11.651
We live in a world where we feel a constant pressure to   achieve success. 

00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:14.748
We wonder, "Are we on the right track?"

00:00:15.174 --> 00:00:18.244
What is true success? And how do we attain it?

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:19.805
Let me tell you a story:

00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:23.180
I had been going to the gym for months, but to tell you the truth, I hit a wall.

00:00:23.597 --> 00:00:26.827
While I put in the time, I didn't see any real results.

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:31.287
Then one day a professional trainer walked into the gym as I was working out.

00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:35.017
I went through my routine, using each machine and smiling with pride.

00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:39.447
I expected him to be impressed but when I looked over, he was literally holding back laughter.

00:00:39.927 --> 00:00:42.376
After watching the rendition of my daily program he said,

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:46.577
"I assume you are not seeing any great results."   Yeah, how do you know? 

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:49.037
"It's easy, you're not pushing yourself."

00:00:49.396 --> 00:00:53.657
  What do you mean? I'm here for an hour and a half, five days a week! I do every machine! 

00:00:54.047 --> 00:00:57.437
  Doing machines doesn't matter; it's the amount of weights that matters.

00:00:57.836 --> 00:01:01.657
You go to a machine and lift the same amount of weight as the person before you!

00:01:02.017 --> 00:01:05.436
You're not working your muscles. You're doing aerobics for your arms and legs.

00:01:05.907 --> 00:01:09.507
Here is the rule: When you do repetitions, the last three have to kill.

00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:11.836
If they don't, your muscles don't grow. 

00:01:12.187 --> 00:01:16.107
  To oversimplify the process, there are micro-fibers in your muscles.

00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:20.277
When you lift weights, you have to lift enough weight to tear the fibers.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.986
With rest and protein, the muscles rebuild stronger and larger.

00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:26.727
Then you lift heavier weights and the process repeats. 

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:29.537
So I said,   So what's the correct weight to lift? 

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:32.708
He said,   That's exactly the point. There is no correct weight.

00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:36.827
It depends on the person. The only thing you need to worry about is

00:01:37.147 --> 00:01:40.897
whether the last three KILL. You can't look to somebody else.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:45.776
It's about you and your muscles. You can't fool your body."

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:51.427
In life, there are two types of success: Horizontal and Vertical.

00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:54.407
Each day we stand at the crossroads of both.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:59.008
Our actions, thoughts, and feelings take us down only one.

00:01:59.397 --> 00:02:01.398
Horizontal Success is more popular.

00:02:01.707 --> 00:02:06.327
It drives most of society and leaves us feeling empty at the end of a long and arduous road.

00:02:06.696 --> 00:02:13.906
It's when we define success based on others, when we measure ourselves relative to those around us.

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:18.066
When we live this way, we look to others to feel successful

00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:22.036
and then we dress, act, work, and talk to impress them.

00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:25.826
But here's the problem. We will never be truly successful

00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:28.957
because we're not lifting the weights to grow our muscles.

00:02:29.317 --> 00:02:33.946
And no matter how hard we try, someone always seems to have more than us.

00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:37.896
True success is when we start to grow vertically.

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:42.797
When our sole focus is bringing out our own unique potential.

00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:46.107
When we go through each day and look for ways to grow,

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:51.266
to be better, to push ourselves to overcome new challenges, that's true success.

00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:56.396
When we come out of our comfort zone and do what's good, not what looks good.

00:02:56.786 --> 00:03:02.497
When we give charity, even when it's hard. When we stay calm when we want to be angry.

00:03:02.908 --> 00:03:06.427
When we volunteer, even when we're tired and busy.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:10.346
When we give love, even if it makes us feel vulnerable.

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:16.897
When we keep an open mind to ideas, even if they go against our preconceived notions.

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:19.516
And like working out, it doesn't happen overnight.

00:03:20.827 --> 00:03:27.197
We grow a little each day, until one morning we look at ourselves and can't believe who we've become.

00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:31.047
We can't believe just how successful we really are.
