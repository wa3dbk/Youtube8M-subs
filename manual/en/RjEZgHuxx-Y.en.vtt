00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.850
2015 has only just begun. And there's no way
of telling what's to come for our beloved

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.609
world of Pokemon. We're currently in the dark
about ANY details, but it wouldn't hurt to

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:21.071
predict what the next game could be. I would
like to ask to please, listen to this video

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.470
with an open mind. I won't be talking about
anything absurd, but there may be some topics

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.130
that you may not agree with. Just please,
remember that opinions are opinions, and I

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.490
hope you'll enjoy this video. Let's jump right
into the details, starting with GameFreak's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.340
pattern of releasing handheld games. As you
may be aware, to start, they typically release

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.489
two games; a new generation of Pokemon into
the series. Followed by either a remake of

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.309
the older games, or a sequel of the newest
generation. The sequel being either legit

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.700
sequels, like Black and White 2. Or a single
game which combines the unique elements of

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.519
both games and polishes it off. They may even
add new story elements to it to make the game

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.110
more appealing to those who have already played
a game in that generation. Pokemon Yellow,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.890
Crystal, Emerald, and Platinum are all examples
of this type of game. In 2012, GameFreak shook

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.350
up the easy-to-predict pattern by releasing
Black and White 2. There has never been a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.970
numeric sequel to the series before this,
with a complete overhaul of the entire region

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.970
and story. Think back to 2010 for a moment.
Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE thought, "Oh

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.180
Pokemon White and Black? Oh my GAWWDDD, if
you mix black and white it makes grey! The

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.180
next Pokemon game's gonna be Pokemon Grey!
YAAAAYYYY!" Aaaaand what happened, exactly?

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.770
Pokemon Black 2, and White 2. GameFreak knew
that the same old formula was getting old,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.310
as their fans were anticipating Pokemon Grey.
Not only that, but sales of Pokemon were slumping.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.950
I'm supposing that they wanted to try something
new to breathe some life into the Pokemon series.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.060
And this leads us to today, with Pokemon
X and Y. I'm sure you've all heard it before.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.849
You know. People saying, "The next game's
gonna be Pokemon Z, because X, Y and Z! Also,

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.499
Zygarde starts with Z, and it'll be focused
around him, YEAH!" Yeah, hey, listen buddy,

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:26.680
I know my ABC's as well as the next guy, but
I'm telling ya, this is exactly what GameFreak

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.779
wants you to think. It's surely what they
made people think about Pokemon Grey, which,

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:36.430
never happened. Besides, Kalos (in my opinion)
had a very lame storyline, dull characters,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.709
and it was just a non-memorable region. It
would be a bad idea to make a single polished

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.730
sequel, like emerald or crystal. So. If I'm
right, and they're not releasing Pokemon Z,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.159
will that mean they'll be releasing X2 and
Y2? The short answer is, maybe. They had just

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.930
done this method last generation with Black
and White 2, and, in my opinion, they were

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.730
better games than the first black and white.
The situation is like Unova all over again.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.339
Many fans, including myself, were not satisfied
with X and Y's story and characters. Creating

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:16.189
an X2 and Y2 could redeem Kalos, kind of how
it redeemed Unova, in my opinion. By adding

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:22.449
a new (and hopefully good) storyline, new
places to explore, and making team Flare return

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.309
with, well, more of a FLARE

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.840
(AIRHORNS)

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.719
But, will this happen? Is this the more likely

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:38.719
possibility than, say, Pokemon Z? Well, in
my opinion, yes. Games like Emerald or Crystal

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:45.290
never actually sold all too much. Yet, Black
2 and White 2 yielded better results in sales.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.419
GameFreak may just stick with numerical sequels,
as it has proven to be more profitable. But,

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.919
you know, there's always a possibility that
they could do something totally unforeseen.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.040
Okay, for all you gen-oners, I just want to
tell you that the gen-one remakes... aren't

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:11.099
going to happen. At least, not this year.
They could be coming in 2016, or hell, 2017.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:15.979
But Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire just came
out last year, and they won't produce two

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:22.979
remakes in two years. But, you know Nintendo.
They will happen, just a matter of... when.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.759
For everyone who are calling for Sinnoh remakes,
well, I don't think those are going to happen

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.580
until the next Nintendo handheld after the
3DS. Truth is, those games are only 8 years

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.539
old. Compare it to Ruby and Sapphire when
they were 12 when they got their remakes.

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:47.099
Unless the 3DS is going to be around in like
3 or 4 years, trust me, Sinnoh will be remade

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:54.099
on the next console. If you look back to 2011,
Black and white were released in North America.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.669
Also, in 2013, X and Y were released. Take
note that this was only a 2 year difference

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.349
between generations. Could this mean that
a new generation may grace our 3DS screen?

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.840
Noooooooooooo.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.700
Sixth gen was developed so close
to fifth, in part, to push 3DS sales, and

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.990
transition the series into a new console.
But we must ask ourselves: is there a possibility

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.039
that no games could come out for handheld
this year? Weeelllll, maybe. There have been

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:28.580
a few years in which no handheld Pokemon games
were released, and frankly, we're kinda due

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.580
for another one of those years. 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.480
You may be
wondering, well, what about the Wii U? Personally,

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.060
I think Nintendo may try to capitalize on
the recent surge of Wii U sales by developing

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.409
a new Pokemon RPG, like Pokemon Coliseum and
Gale of Darkness. (hell, they could even put

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.180
those two games up on the eShop if they wanted
to.) A game like that may push Wii U sales

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.110
even further, and pump more life into the
modern day Pokemon franchise. I know, personally,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.130
I would be hyped for a game like that.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.219
So, to recap, Pokemon Z probably is not going

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:12.219
to happen. Pokemon X2 and Y2 have a better
possibility than Pokemon Z. Generation one

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.770
remakes aren't going to happen this year.
But I'm almost certain that they will happen

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.370
sometime soon. Sinnoh remakes, I think you're
gonna have to wait a while. Again, I could

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.930
be completely wrong about all of these, so
don't take my word for this, as these are

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.490
just opinions. All in all, there will be no
way of predicting for certain what's to come.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.870
Yet, I hope this video shed some light on
some of the possibilities. Feel free to voice

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.150
your opinions in the comments below. Stay
tuned for more videos, and I'll see you next time!

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.240
Oh, and, by the way, I plan on releasing
more pokemon-related videos. If interested,
