00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.933
Do you know there is a great way of cooking that doesn't require heat and it doesnt require equipment.

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:12.643
Except for one piece of aluminium foil and a house brick. What is it?

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:19.642
Of course its curing, a great way of preserving foods that goes back for centuries long before refrigerators were invented.

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:23.933
Curing is a great way of making food better even if it hasn't been poorly.

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:30.552
And I'm going to demonstrate this with a piece of salmon in the Consuming Passions recipe for gravlax.

00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:37.055
What I need for about 8 people is a fillet of salmon and I cut it in half,

00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:42.172
this is beautiful fish that's lovingly farmed in the pristine waters of Tasmania.

00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:47.805
Now I make up a curing mixture which is one part salt to one part sugar.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:51.808
And those are the fundimentals of this curing process.

00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:55.411
I find chunky rock salt or sea salt is best for this purpose.

00:00:55.411 --> 00:01:00.332
and I also use dill, which is chopped up finely.

00:01:00.332 --> 00:01:08.179
Now I mix the dill in with the salt and the sugar, and some pepper, heaps of it, 2 or 3 teaspoons

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.569
and this is all mixed up well. Now I take a piece of aluminium foil

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:21.884
and then place on one piece of the salmon skin side down. The herb, salt and sugar mixture is spread on it.

00:01:21.884 --> 00:01:32.409
The other piece of fillet is up on top, skin side up. Then it's all wrapped up tightly, placed on a tray.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.419
Sorry that's a bit of equipment I didn't mention. Topped with a small chopping board

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:42.641
and topped with a housebrick or 2. The salmon is then put in the fridge for 24 hours at least

00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:45.421
but could stay in like this for up to 3 days.

00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:51.169
Now while it's curing I have plenty of time to make a vegetable salad using potato, beans and carrots.

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:56.210
Which you simply boil until they are just cooked, quickly drained and then put into

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.975
very cold water to refresh them, to keep there color in and there texture.

00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:06.343
Then they are drained again.

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:12.782
Now I make a lemon and mustard mayonnaise with 2 egg yolks into a bowl with some dijon style mustard.

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:20.339
Tiny pinch of salt, and a generous quater teaspoon of white pepper. A greating of lemon rind

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:26.719
and some lemon juice, plus just a pinch of sugar.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:32.551
I put a tea towel under the bowl to stop it spinning off the bench when I haven't got a hand free to hold it.

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:35.887
And I begin making the mayonnaise which of course is an emulsion.

00:02:35.887 --> 00:02:44.140
And it relies on its success on adding oil very very slowly to the mixture. Just a drip at a time

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.093
Once the mixture starts to thicken I can increase the rate.

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:55.306
I'm using Australia's own macadamia nut oil for this but you could use any mild and sweet flavoured oil.

00:02:55.306 --> 00:03:00.773
You could also add dill to this mixture but I think there is enough in the salmon,

00:03:00.773 --> 00:03:02.975
but you can add some capers.

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:07.885
And fold the mayonnaise into the vegetables.

00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:12.641
The moment of truth, now I have never said this on a program before but this is one I made earlier.

00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:16.250
I made this 24 hours ago, so lets see how it shapes up.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.893
It's beautiful, once unwrapped I wipe the fish dry removing the little pieces of rock salt.

00:03:23.893 --> 00:03:28.369
and some of the dill. Then cut into individual servings.

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:38.055
And then I remove the skin by placing a very sharp knife down one end and just taking it back through to the other end.

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:50.305
Then I slice the fish into very fine strips. Time to serve and I put some of that delicate vegetable salad on the middle of a plate

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:58.092
and drape with a sugar and salt cured salmon. Which will taste slightly sweet and not at all salty.

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:01.410
Degree of difficulty, low for the salmon and medium for the mayonnaise.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.305
Keepability, the salmon keeps for several days in the refrigerator.

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:09.054
Preparation time about half an hour plus the curing process.

00:04:09.054 --> 00:04:12.659
A final garnish of dill and a few more capers and the dish is complete.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.026
It's amazing what you can do with a house brick as equipment isn't it.

00:04:17.026 --> 00:04:22.692
Now in northern europe, this would be consumed with passion certainly, but probably with a vodka.

00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:30.935
Instead I'd opt for a very fruity wine, a sauvignon blanc possibly a floral riesling. Australian of course.

00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:33.883
