00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.310
Hello and welcome to ComicDrake where I talk
about comic books and my name is Drake.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.910
Perhaps the biggest mystery from CW’s The
Flash is the secret identity of the Reverse

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.910
Flash.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.530
To better understand where the show’s story
might go, let’s take a look at the history

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.700
of the first villain in the comics to use
this name!

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.930
Born in the 25th Century and with a futuristic
name to boot, Eobard Thawne was absolutely

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.930
OBSESSED with The Flash’s legacy.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.230
Seeking to study the Speed Force at the Flash
Museum, young Thawne was rejected due to his

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.250
poor test scores.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.130
Eobard instead conducted his own independent
research, but not before having his endeavors

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.450
brought to a screeching halt by his brother,
Robern, a member of the Science Police…

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.730
which is apparently a thing in the future.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.510
But this series of events doesn’t last for
long, as a future version of Thawne, the aforementioned

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.150
Reverse-Flash, goes back in time to ensure
that there never WAS a Robern and that Thawne

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.640
grew up as an only child.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.989
And as for any obstacle his younger self might
encounter, the Reverse Flash was there to

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.210
reverse it back in his favor.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.230
This is the key to the Reverse Flash: time
travel.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.540
This is even hinted at in the TV show.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.700
With all of his time traveling hijinks setting
up his path to success, Eobard became a highly

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.330
respected professor at the Flash Museum and
with his massive knowledge of the Speed Force,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.540
Eobard’s colleagues nicknamed him “Professor
Zoom”.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.640
By now, it’s obvious that Thawne is insane.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.960
So insane that he underwent plastic surgery
to look like Barry Allen, stole his cosmic

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.610
treadmill, and duplicated the experiment which
initially gave The Flash his powers!

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.250
Eobard is the ultimate cosplayer!

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.850
Thawne travelled back in time only to discover
that he was destined to become The Flash’s

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.950
arch-nemesis which absolutely BROKE the time-displaced
Thawne’s mind and lead him to fulfill his

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.950
destiny of becoming the first Reverse Flash,
Professor Zoom.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.701
Ultimately, Thawne met his end at the hands
of none other than Barry Allen himself, but

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:36.870
came back to life during the Blackest Night
event.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.670
What set The Flash apart from most other super-heroes
is that he grew up with both parents alive

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.840
and with no real darkness in his life.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.840
No exploding Krypton, no Crime Alley, no test
pilot father…

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.520
The Flash lived a perfect life and never really
had a desire to change it.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.490
So to get back at him, Thawne went back in
time and killed Barry Allen’s mother.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.200
Barry’s father was actually framed for the
murder and sentenced to life in prison because

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
of this.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.130
After realizing Thawne essentially stole his
childhood, a Flash wracked with pain and guilt

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.600
attempted to go back in time and save his
mother from the Reverse Flash’s wrath…

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.420
and completely changed the world into the
world of Flashpoint.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.080
Then Barry undid everything, creating The
New 52.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.930
...Because comics…

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.819
We haven’t seen Eobard Thawne since the
launch of the New 52, but there currently

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.230
IS a Reverse Flash.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.660
However, that’s a completely different character
that we might discuss sometime down the road

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.660
in the future.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.920
Now outside of the comics, Eobard Thawne has
appeared in Batman: The Brave and the Bold,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.590
the animated movie adaptation of Flashpoint,
DC Universe Online, Lego Batman 3, and as

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.410
a Black Lantern skin for The Flash in Injustice:
Gods Among Us.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.180
He also plays a central role in CW’s The
Flash and his identity is still up in the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.120
air, but this Reverse-Flash could POTENTIALLY
be Eobard Thawne, but he could end up being

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.120
any of the OTHER Reverse Flashes from the
comics.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.220
We’ll find though out soon enough!

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.620
Professor Zoom is an interesting villain albeit
confusing and convoluted, but if you want

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.081
to know more about this character, I recommend
reading The Flash: Rebirth, Flashpoint: Reverse

00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:56.490
Flash, and The Road to Flashpoint while you’re
at it.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.390
Be sure to follow me on EVERY social media,
but if you want to know more about comics,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.160
I recommend watching my explanation of EVERY
Lantern Corps or the latest episode of Who

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.489
Is where I talk about Agent Phil Coulson!
