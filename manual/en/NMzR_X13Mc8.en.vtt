00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.100
Hi everybody so here I am in my baby's room
talking to all of you guys and trying to give

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.220
some advice for things that I've learned across
having my 5 kids that have made things easier.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.910
And today what I'm going to talk about is
engorged breasts, every partner's favorite

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.520
topic.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.790
I've had engorged breasts with all 5 of my
kids.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.800
This is a totally normal thing; you have to
hang in there!

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.610
Okay, when you first have your baby at first
your body is going to be producing a substance

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.020
called klystron.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.770
This is a thick gooey yellow liquidly sort
of thing and it's very healthy for the baby.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.250
It helps to immunize the baby and to prevent
gonads'.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.690
Within about two to six days after when you
had first had your baby, your milk is going

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.690
to come in.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.470
And when it comes in, it can come in too fast
and too much.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.250
It's like Niagara Falls but with milk, kind
of gross.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.960
And whereas before you might have had a nice
supple breast like this, nice and soft, this

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.170
is what you're dealing with now, a hard big
apple.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.820
This is very hard for the baby to latch onto
-- think about how hard it is to take a bit

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.999
out of an apple like this.

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:20.960
And it's also very uncomfortable for you.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.859
So what I'm going to do today is talk a little
bit about how to deal with this engorgement

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.909
and also how it can be dealt with in terms
of getting your baby to latch on, those two

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.909
things.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.350
Okay, in terms of getting your baby to latch
on when you have engorged breasts a good thing

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.770
to do is to express a little milk out of your
breasts before your baby nurses.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.289
If you have a pump, you can also put the pump
on just for a few minutes to get out some

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.499
of that extra milk so that your breast is
a little suppler ant it's easier for the baby

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.219
to get a latch.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:56.391
Okay, also in terms of the baby, feed your
baby fully, make sure your baby is full, try

00:01:56.391 --> 00:02:00.079
to do frequent feedings -- you might be feeding
on-demand, you might be following a schedule

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.779
(I'm a big fan of the schedule)- but regardless
of what you choose to do when your baby is

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:10.330
full if you're still very, very engorged you
might want to express out a little more milk

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.130
or use the pump.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.980
There's another debate about over production
of milk so check this out with your doctor

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.820
but this is what I have always done and it
really, really has worked for me.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.060
And I have used the excess just to store it,
which has really been something that has helped

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.690
me in terms of knowing that I have milk down
the line when I need it.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.970
Okay, how do you deal with those very, very
sore breasts?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.640
Number one - warm showers, get in the shower
this is also a nice opportunity to take a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640
break.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.330
Get the water going, get both sides under
there, let it just sort of rain onto you and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.890
this is really, really going to help.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.700
And you can do warm compresses too.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.280
Now you have to be very, very careful with
this but one thing I have done is to take

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.970
a small dishtowel from the kitchen and I've
put water on it and I've heated up the water

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.450
or I've heated this towel in the microwave.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.470
Be very, very careful because you don't want
to burn yourself.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.831
But you can do is put this in a Ziploc sandwich
bag, cover it with another dish towel, and

00:03:09.831 --> 00:03:11.820
put this right into your bra.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.530
And this is good, the Ziploc bag really works
because it helps keep the heat in so it's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.240
a very effective compress and it's manageable,
it will fit into your nursing bra.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.260
So I would definitely give this a try, but
be very safe with it.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.100
Okay, so you're going to do the warm showers,
you're going to do the hot compresses, and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.820
you're going to make sure that you're frequently
feeding your baby.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.190
You do not want to go 4 or 5 hours without
feeding your baby so whether it's on-demand

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.681
or on a schedule make sure that you're doing
those frequent feedings with pumping if you

00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:41.820
follow the Melissa point of view.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.030
And this will really help.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.680
Engorgement is going to go away naturally
overtime.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.890
You'll be dealing with this for a week or
for two weeks but overtime your body is going

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.490
to start to regulate itself and it's going
to start to produce the amount of milk that

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.510
your baby needs.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.040
So these are the key things to do early on,
good luck and hang in there.
