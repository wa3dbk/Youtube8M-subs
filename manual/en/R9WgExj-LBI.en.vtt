[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.950
-Hi y'all.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.910
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.200
And Brooklyn's here with
me today to show you guys

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.210
how to do a box fishtail.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.750
Now, Kendra from Canada
sent this idea in via email.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.340
And everyone once in a
while I come across an idea,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.070
like a fan suggestion,
that just blows my mind.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.940
And this one was one of those.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.820
So it's a combination
of a normal fishtail

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.400
and a reverse fishtail.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.625
And seriously, it
turns out so cool.

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:29.750
So we're going to show you.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.041
And if you don't know how to
do either one of those two

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.715
hairstyles, I'm going to put
the links in the description box

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:35.215
below.

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:36.650
And you can check
them out there.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.140
Now, to the box fishtail.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.344
OK, we started by pulling her
hair up into a high pony tail.

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:43.760
But you can even
do it on the side

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.051
if you're doing it on yourself.

00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:46.000
No problem.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.180
We're going to just part
her hair into two sections,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.410
just like as if you were
going to do a fishtail.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.010
And we're going to begin by
doing a normal fishtail stitch.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.426
So we're going to take a little
bit of hair from one side,

00:00:57.426 --> 00:00:59.560
cross it over the
front, and put it

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.490
into the middle of
the second piece.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.220
Now on this side we're going
to take an outside piece again,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.130
cross it all the
way over the front,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.079
and put it into the
middle of our first piece.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.620
We're going to do
this one more time.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.650
So that was a completed stitch.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.450
Now we're going to
start a second stitch.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.970
So cross over the front.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.000
Grab a side piece.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.570
Cross over the front.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.300
So now we have two
what I call completed,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.190
normal fishtail stitches.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.630
Now we're going to do two
reverse fishtail stitches.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.810
We're going to pick up
a little section on hair

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.190
again, however big you want.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.570
The smaller you go, the
more intricate the fishtail.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.590
And we're going to
go under this time.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.390
So we're crossing in under,
back into the middle again,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.715
just like before.

00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:47.400
We're going to go to this
side, pick up some hair,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.590
cross it under into the middle.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.320
So we have now done one
stitch of a reverse fishtail.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.930
We're going to do
another reverse again.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.910
Grab a piece.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.560
Pull it under.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.400
Make sure you don't pick up the
other pieces when you do it.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.910
Put it in the middle.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.585
And then switch it over.

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:10.710
Now the first couple stitches
are just the hardest,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.770
because the braid hasn't
really formed yet.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.530
After that it gets a lot easier.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.320
So we've done essentially
two normal stitches,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.195
two reverse stitches.

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:19.820
And now we're going
to go back and just

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.280
repeat this over and over.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.176
Now the only bummer
to this is that it's

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.550
a fishtail, which means it's
going to take a few minutes,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.440
because they're
intricate stitches.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.140
So we're going to go again
over the top, into the middle,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.601
and again over the
top, into the middle.

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:36.980
That's stitch one.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.200
Here's stitch two, over the top,
into the middle, over the top,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.720
into the middle.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.850
That's the second one.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.990
Now we're going to reverse it.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.150
So we're going to go over
the back, into the middle,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.580
and over the back,
and into the middle.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.129
OK, now here's my other tip.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.670
When you're taking
the piece of hair,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.030
make sure you're taking
it from the outside edge.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.770
Take it underneath.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.860
And make sure you take
it right to the middle.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.650
And now hang onto that hair.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.390
Don't let this back hair
flip to this outside edge

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.980
and accidentally
pick it back up,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.230
because it won't look as good.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.720
Make sure it goes right to
the middle and stays put.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.880
And make sure you're picking up
new hair from the outside edge

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.050
all the time.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.990
So back across.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.650
That was stitch one.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.900
Here's reverse stitch two.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.254
And back, and we're just
going to continue on.

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:58.455
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:58.455 --> 00:04:00.520
OK, now when you
get down to the end,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.120
where you're having a hard time
hanging onto to things anymore,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.750
and you're just
running out of hair,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.780
then I like to just finish
it off just across the front,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.130
just like with big pieces--
keep the effect going.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.420
And then you can even just
finish it off in a braid.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.035
Take an elastic.

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:23.251
Rubber and it.

00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:25.000
OK now, what I like
to do, to just give it

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.084
a little more polished look
is just take a piece of hair

00:04:32.084 --> 00:04:33.580
and wrap it around the elastic.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.670
And then you can
actually take a bobby pin

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.665
and just go right up
the center of the braid.

00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:51.848
There we go, like this.

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:54.475
Pull some hair out right there.

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:59.570
And give it a little
more polished off look.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.830
And we're done.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.390
Now you can see-- so
we have our fishtail

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.370
here, our front
fishtail-- but you

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.750
can see that all down the
sides we have a fishtail.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.060
On this side we have a fishtail.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.840
And on the back we
have a fishtail.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.060
So we've essentially just
made a giant box of fishtails.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.230
So I like to just tug them.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.530
This makes it just a little
more loose and beautiful.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.520
And you are finished.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.390
Now please show
me all the things

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.160
that you come up with to
do for this hairstyle,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.470
whether it's wrapping it in a
bun-- that would be amazing--

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.640
or wearing it over your shoulder
into a long fishtail in front.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.890
And make sure you hashtag me.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.860
You can use the
hashtag right here.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.250
And then I get to see them.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.380
And I'd be so excited.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.016
So her is the
finished, final look.

00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:50.409
Ta da!

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:51.950
How many compliments
did you get when

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.116
you wore this the other day?

00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:53.750
-A lot.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.560
-Yeah, this is
not one I've seen.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.100
So I'm really excited about it.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.660
And all of her friends noticed.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.640
And they were all
commenting on it,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.700
which is what's going to
happen to you if you wear it.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.670
Now we have also made
a new Disney video.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.120
So we'll put a
link to it up here.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.240
Make sure to check it out.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.010
It's a not so hidden Mickey.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.130
And you guys will love it.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.921
I think it would be
such a clever hairstyle

00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:17.200
to wear if you're going
to the Disney parks.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.820
So cute, because it looks like
Mickey Mouse in the hair--

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.010
adorable.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.810
And we will see you guys later.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.310

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.000
