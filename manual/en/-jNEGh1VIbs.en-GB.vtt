00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.970
It's dubbed The Festival of Cruelty - every
year in China thousands of dogs are slaughtered

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.470
for the infamous Yulin dog meat festival.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.900
The animals, often stolen pets, are transported
over long distances and crammed into cages

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.540
under horrific conditions.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.930
Kept without food or water, they are often
beaten and killed in front of other terrified

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.510
animals for the week long event in the Guangxi province.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.100
Most Chinese citizens reject this practice,
however the event still takes place every

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.820
year.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:46.069
"In China, most people love dogs, and they think that we shouldn't hurt animals or hurt those pets"

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:50.889
Last year, thanks to overwhelming international
pressure, Yulin authorities announced that

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:52.429
they would not support the festival.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.609
The result was a subdued event in which fewer
dogs were slaughtered.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.589
While they claimed it wouldn't go ahead this
year, preparations for the mass killing are

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:02.629
already underway.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.320
Actor and comedian Ricky Gervais is urging
people to support a campaign to shut down

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.840
the cruel meat trade.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.670
In a statement he warned that thousands of
terrified dogs and cats-many of them still

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.630
wearing pet collars - will be brutally killed
for human consumption.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.140
He urged people to sign a petition to be sent
to China's Guangxi Party Secretary.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.840
Up to 10 million dogs are believed to be killed
for their meat in China every year, as many

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.070
as 10,000 alone for the Yulin event.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.070
Often wrongly assumed to be a Chinese tradition,
the festival was in fact invented as recently

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.149
as 2010 by dog meat traders as a way to boost
business.

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.909
Dog meat in China is very much a culinary
sub-culture, not part of the mainstream.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.579
China Specialist Peter Li from the Humane
Society International warned that the festival

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.780
should not be considered part of Chinese tradition.
