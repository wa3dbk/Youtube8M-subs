00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.210
- [Narrator] The name its been given

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.450
is a clear reference to the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.640
celebrated unification of Italy.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.280
And it reminds you of the value

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.433
of made in Italy.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.020
It is pointless to be moderate

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.800
when designing a yacht like this.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.610
Words can't describe it.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.300
It is a super sports yacht.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.460
And even it it weren't particularly fast

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.683
it would still be a lot of fun to drive.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.900
It's similar to the other S models

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.670
but it is so much more.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.880
Observe the beauty of the proportions.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.180
It is just over 19 meters long

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.240
and almost five meters wide

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.340
which makes the length

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.280
four times longer than the width.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.943
It's very fast indeed.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.160
The retractable hard top roof

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.220
is a work of art

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.520
with glass skylights
that curve beautifully

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.290
along the top that are coated with

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.600
an ultraviolet protective chemical

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.240
to reduce the solar flare

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.663
and prevent the interior from overheating.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.230
For this area of the yacht

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.890
a very versatile solution
has been thought out.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.620
A living area that can also be used

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.390
as a dining area for eight people.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.660
And it can also be converted

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.000
into a large sunbed for four people.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.920
There is also a galley

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.750
that's equipped to be used outside

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.930
and despite all this,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.220
there's still a lot of space left on deck.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.110
To achieve this,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.800
some designers reduced the
length of the deckhouse

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.950
or the foredeck

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.620
and this ruins the aesthetics

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.280
that a yacht of this class

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.200
absolutely requires.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.250
The research of the interior living space

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.610
can be compared to that of a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.710
flying bridge model or a ship.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.100
But not that of an open sports yacht.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.070
It is also a good thing that the designers

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.410
decided to include a long bow bridge

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.110
that gives momentum to the vessel.

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:13.450
At the stern there are
a couple of elements

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.570
that are a very interesting addition.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.240
A stern mooring for a tender

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.420
up to 450 kilograms and
3.4 meters in length

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.720
and a comfortable crew
cabin with two beds.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.010
This area is made accessible
by a semi automatic door

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.360
that should always be
checked before embarking.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.740
Azimut was the first manufacturer

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.330
to enhance the side windows

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.860
to make them more stylish and distinctive.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.600
Even the furniture of this model

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.963
invites you to face the sea outside.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.340
The interior design is ethnic

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.670
while the material used for the furniture

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.430
is specially treated magnolia leather.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.840
The master cabin has as much room

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.923
as the other two cabins combined.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.243
It even includes a dressing room.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.190
The wardrobes and bathroom

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.730
are placed between the
cabin and machine room

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.883
acting as a natural
insulator and sound isolater.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.600
Even the double twin bedroom

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.350
has its privacy with its
own dedicated bathroom.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.023
And just look how large it is.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.220
The guest bedroom is situated at the bow

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.863
and is fully equipped to suit any guest.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.400
If you prefer,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.313
the double bed can divide
into two single beds.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.910
The galley is hidden
by a movable bulkhead.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.960
The steel cooker is very professional

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.223
and fully equipped.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.830
There is also a microwave,

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.900
four ceramic hubs with a safety feature

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.040
to stop the pans from slipping,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.293
two sinks and a 230 liter fridge.

00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:20.098
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:20.098 --> 00:04:21.420
Now it's time to try it out.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.630
Here in the cockpit are two

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.400
very comfortable white leather chairs

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.760
that can be regulated into any position.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.253
Even the helm can be
appropriately adjusted.

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:46.446
(speaking foreign language)

00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:51.446
The Azimut 62 Italia has two
Caterpillar C18 ACERT engines

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.720
of 1,150 horsepower.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.560
I've brought the yacht up to planing speed

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.150
without the use of the flaps

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.790
which shows that the angle
of incidence on the water

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.860
is also good at low speed.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.740
The bow allows me to see the horizon

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.040
very clearly from here
including the location

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.320
where we're heading for.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.750
We're at 25 knots

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.080
which is the most common cruising speed.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.550
We've just reached 1,750 revs per minute

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.270
and the decibel meter indicates

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.340
that there is only 75 db of noise up here

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.310
which is very comfortable indeed.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.210
What I particularly like about this yacht

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.210
is that it's large but the power behind it

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.620
is not exaggerated

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.250
and we're traveling at 32 knots

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.300
at 2,100 revs per minute.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.240
Still within the cruising range.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.940
I wonder how fast it can go.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.653
There is only one way to find out.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.350
Let's open the throttle

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.583
and see what it can do.

00:05:49.793 --> 00:05:52.850
35, 36, 37 knots.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.773
This is the maximum speed.

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:03.660
It goes faster than other yachts

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.710
that have the same power to weight ratio

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.210
in the same category

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.890
because it is built
using a fusion technique

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.343
so it is lighter and more robust.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.203
As you have seen,

00:06:24.203 --> 00:06:26.340
the Azimut 62S Italia

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.080
is a very sporty yacht.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.720
Not only in its category

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.933
but also in its performance.
