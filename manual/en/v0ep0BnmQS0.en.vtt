00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:06.040
Hello everyone. In the text, I have been discussing
the standard measurements and views that are

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.570
taken for the routine 18 week morphology scan
to estimate the age and the well being of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.759
the foetus.
Let's have a practical look at how some

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.289
of these measurements are achieved.
Now recall that several measurements of the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.269
head are taken from an axial image at the
level of the thalami and cavum septi pellucidi.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:31.150
Now using this doll as a model, the plane
we are looking at is about here.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.610
Now from this image, we can calculate
the Biparietal Diameter (BPD) which is measured

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.420
from the outer edge of the cranium nearest
the transducer to the inner edge of the cranium

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.940
furtherest from the transducer. We can also
measure the head circumference at this level

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.280
by tracing around the bony outside edge all
the way around the head. From this plane,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.610
if you tilt the transducer slightly posteriorly,
you will be able to demonstrate the cerebellum.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.760
Now note in this example, that the hands of
the foetus are in front of the face, and so

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.930
the fingers and palms keep coming into frame.
So looking at the doll then, turning the transducer

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.600
through 90 degrees from the axial image will
produce a coronal image of the face, which

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.470
is very useful for looking at the lips, the
hard and soft palate and the nostrils. Moving

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.900
down from the head then, the next measurement
we take is the Abdominal Circumference (AC)

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.979
which is measured by tracing the outer edge
of the skin of the abdomen on an axial image

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.010
taken at the level of the stomach and intrahepatic
portion of the umbilical vein. On this doll

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.470
then, it's about here. Remember we know
that fluid is hypoechoic, so we look for the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.330
dark fluid filled stomach below the normally
situated heart on the left hand side.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.470
Back to the doll again, to measure the femur
lengths we place the transducer at about this

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.299
level here.
Then we measure the length of the ossified

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.990
part of the bone so, we look for the bright
leading edge reflector with posterior shadowing

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.720
seen beyond it.
After we've done those measurements, we

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.649
can also assess the heart. The heart, 4 chambers,
and the colour is used to demonstrate the

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.840
position and direction of blood flow coming
out of the right and left ventricular outflow

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.790
tracts.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.499
Colour can also be used to demonstrate the
foetal aorta, and in this example, the correct

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:23.299
presence of the two renal arteries.
