00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.280
Okay bicycle people, this is the unboxing or the  

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.989
unpackaging

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:16.989
of the 'Bike Glow'.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.740
And we're gonna read these instructions now
and put this on my bike and see what happens.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.860
So the first thing the instructions say to do
is to remove the screws from this

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.880
little battery compartment here.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.140
They give you  this little philips screwdriver
here which is kinda nice because a lot

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.780
of times you might have a philips screwdriver
but maybe it's too big and it might

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.390
strip the screws. So anyway they give you
philips screwdriver.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.390
And we're going to use it here and
unscrew these screws.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.010
And this one's starting to come off here.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.010
So we'll try the other one.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.920
Got that one done.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.940
Take the latch off here.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.820
And then it says to

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.500
Put the double a_ batteries in opposite.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.330
So you put one of them in like this.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.310
And the flat side of the other one it
says it's supposed to go like this so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.390
that the spring on the lid touches the flat side of the battery.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.890
And then we put it back in.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.130
Grabs screwdriver again.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.860
Looks like we're gonna have to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.860
play around with this a bit to get it
back in.

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:15.790
You kinda gotta hold the lid down there
to get it back in. But it's not  

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.219
too terribly difficult.

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.839
And with that it should turn on and oh in
fact it does turn on. i'm not sure how

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:27.730
well you can see that.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.080
I don't know if you can see  in the lighting here but it's fairly bright, and it flashes.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.189
We're gonna throw this on my bike now

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.389
and see what looks like at night.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:38.839
Okay we've got our Bike Glow here.

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:42.119
We've got the Bike Glow and the chord, and we got the strap,

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.430
 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.969
and now first thing we do is strap this thing on.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:53.479
So we're gonna take our strap here, and it says in the instructions to put it on a seat tube

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.519
 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.659
I'm gonna put it right here.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.669
On the seat tube sometimes you move up and
down and not too much probably not very

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:05.659
often at all but if someone else rides your bike you might so I'm gonna put it right here

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.629
and there's a little groove here you can see

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.739
 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.950
and basically  

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.949
what you can do now is just

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.179
strap it right here

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:20.789
and I'm going to slide the strap in

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:27.579
Just kinda snug it up here a bit.

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.219
And there you go.

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.209
Now the next thing we gotta do 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.569
it says to be creative in how you want to put it on your frame so I'm gonna 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.569
start looping this around the frame here.

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.769
Well we'll take it out tonight when it gets dark and  

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.769
see what it will look like in the dark.

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.450
Side visibility when you're riding your 
bicycle at night so

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.079
incredibly important.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.479
From studies i've seen your more likely
to get hit from the side than you are from behind.

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.789
So when i put this light the first thing I notice 
is its nice. It's a good lookin'  

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.199
light. It's bright people can see you.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.759
Is it the coolest light out there? I don't know there's so many different side visibility lights

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.440
 out there now,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.719
that it's hard to say but the price tag
I haven't seem too many of them.

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.099
In fact I don't think I've seen any of them in
this price range.

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.520
For about twenty five bucks you're in
there with side visibility.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.410
And so if you're a budget like I am this
one might be worth looking at.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.489
The packaging says it's durable and it works well in the rain and such.

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:54.719
I'm not sure if that's true or not

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.620
I have been ridden my bike

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.099
in the rain with this light yet but i
will likely do that over the next few

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.639
months and after I do so I'll post
a follow up video and let you know how it's going.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.020
In the meantime hope you  found this useful
and ride (your bicycle) safe.
