Hi everyone welcome to our cookie icing video

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.549
for Bing Bong from
disney/pixar's Inside Out

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.740
He's absolutely my favorite
character from the movie

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.440
First let's use a stencil to trace his
face with a food-safe marker

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.580
For details on how to get a copy of the
stencil

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.780
check out our link in the description below

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.820
Let's begin by icing his hat band with black icing

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.760
and then with fuchsia icing, ice his eyebrows

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.480
To ice his inner eyes use
black icing

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.600
With pink icing, ice his nostrils and
then fill his lips with the same icing

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.370
Allow the icing to dry for about 10
minutes

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.400
Next, we'll fill his hat with the dark
brown dicing

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.820
We'll ice the middle of his eyes with a dark green icing

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.180
Now let's ice every other tooth with white icing

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.280
And then, we'll ice his tongue with fuchsia icing, the same one we used for his eyebrows

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.460
Now let's let it dry for 10 minutes

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.100
Let's finish his teeth with white icing

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.560
and then fill the whites of his eyes with that same white icing

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.760
With the pale pink icing, fill his
heart-shaped nose

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.940
And then we'll finish his mouth with dark brown icing

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.790
Finally fill the rest of his face with pale pink icing

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.020
Try to work quickly as the icing can harden surprisingly fast

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.480
