Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen, and in this segment
we're going to talk about how to winterize

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.830
roses. Roses are so beautiful, they bloom
all summer long with these beautiful gorgeous

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.920
blooms that smell so good. And then in the
fall they start turning brown and dying back

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.000
a little bit. So there's a few pointers that
you should follow in helping them make it

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.570
for the winter and how to prepare them for
the winter. So the most important thing that

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.550
you can do for your roses I found is to stop
fertilizing them by mid-summer, cause if you

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.210
keep pumping them with fertilizers, especially
nitrogen based fertilizers, then they get

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.730
all this new growth and they don't bloom very
well. So by giving them lots of nitrogen,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.920
they're getting lots of new growth. And so
when winter hits they're very tender and you

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.950
can lose them. So never fertilize your roses
with high nitrogen based fertilizers at all

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.440
if you have a choice past mid-summer. And
if you still feel that you have to fertilize

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.322
always use high phosphates. Because it's the
phosphates that prepare them for the winter,

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:04.430
not the nitrogen. And if they have a lot of
phosphates in them when winter hits, then

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.850
they will survive much better. So an easy
trick that I found too is make sure and just

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.190
trim it back one third. So I try to trim back
my roses - any of the lanky starts about one

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.100
third. So that's it's cut back about a third
to the size that it was when you started.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.770
And that way next year it'll fill in really
well and make a nice ball. This rose is in

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.869
a pot, so it'll do really well over the winter
'cause roses in the northwest can handle cold

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.990
temperatures. But just to be safe I'm going
to throw it near the eaves or over - under

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.720
a tree a bit because I found any plant in
a pot does better when it's a little bit on

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.250
the dry side in the winter, whereas in the
ground I never lose my roses. Another trick

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.939
is make sure and take all the leaves up when
they lose their leaves and don't leave them

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.580
on the ground, 'cause they'll get less black
spots and less mildew on the roses if you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.920
keep it dry underneath. Putting some mulch
or bark dust underneath them in the fall helps

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.280
a lot too 'cause it gives them a lot of nutrition
for next year.
