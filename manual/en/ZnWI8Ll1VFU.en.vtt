00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.779
it's basically an othello game

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.820
but it has many other interesting parts~

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.480

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.760

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.380

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.200
as it's written here,there're many ways to play this game

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.600
Step 1 is for kids over 3 year-old

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.600
Step 2 is for kids over 4 year-old~

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.380
Step 3 if for bigger kids

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.220
you can choose different game for kids in different age

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.420
Step 1 starts from few squares

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.220
for big children,there's the normal squares

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.380
there's the  4×4 square sheet 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.960
there's also 6×6 square sheet

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.260
There're many ways to play by using these sheets~

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420
let's start then

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.700
this is the sheet~

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.020
there's space to put chess pieces in on both sides

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.960
so you don't need to worry to lost any piece

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.660
Here is two sheets

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.260
looks like this

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.500
there's also an instruction attached

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.560
Firstly,I'll introduce how to play on the 4×4 sheet 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.180
Choose one chess piece you like and put it on the start point

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.260
then flick it with your finger

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.580
it reached 1, so put one piece here

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.060
it reached 1 again,so put another one piece here

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060
keep on adding pieces

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.140
when reach the goal,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.060
this time I have 6 in all

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.560
the one who has most  pieces will win

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.420
then let's play at the 6×6 sheet

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.520
you can see Anpanman and Bikinman on the sheet

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.060
put different pieces onto the place that has the same colour

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:12.240
It's easy to mistake because there're similar colours 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.020
so be careful when decide which one to put  piece on

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.420
there're also other ways to play using this sheet

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.800
Ok let's play real Othello game

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.500
You first,Reonardo

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.720
where do you prefer?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.960
here?so you choose black Bikinman's piece

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.420
then I choose the white ones

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.620
where next?

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.520
I won~~

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.520
Let's learn some English words here

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.840
Othello chess pieces are made of black ones and white ones

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.840
in English,「shiro」means 「white」

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.420
and 「kuro」is 「black」

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.940
can you  remember it?~

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.300
So...that's it for today~

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.820
