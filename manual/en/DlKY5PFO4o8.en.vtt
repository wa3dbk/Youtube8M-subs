00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:02.534
(laughter)

00:00:04.618 --> 00:00:06.476
- [Man] What's he doing?

00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:09.809
- [Man #2] Why doesn't he use his hands?

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:12.737
- [Man] I'm going to start scratching

00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:13.637
my head with my foot more.

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:15.703
- That's some adorable
footage of a baby sloth,

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:16.944
which is great in its own right,

00:00:16.944 --> 00:00:18.772
but we're gonna get down to
one of the big quandaries

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:21.112
about these slow-moving mammals.

00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:21.945
- Poop!

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:26.733
(funky music)

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.279
- [Robert] Generally, one has
to look up into the branches

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.153
to see a sloth.

00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:30.403
That's where they live, after all,

00:00:30.403 --> 00:00:32.491
but as seen in this video
from David Attenborough's

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.047
Life of Mammals, that's
not where they poop.

00:00:35.047 --> 00:00:36.559
- [Julie] They come down
from their leafy refuge

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.762
once a week to do their
business and bury it,

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:40.430
a dangerous move in the jungle.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.561
- [Robert] So why does a
sloth take that long, slow,

00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.799
and dangerous trek down from the branches

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:45.887
to relive itself?

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:47.414
It's one of the great pooping mysteries

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:48.606
of the animal kingdom,

00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:51.248
but we do have a few strong
theories on the matter.

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:52.081
- [Julie] There's always the old

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.631
evolutionary baggage argument that says

00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:55.731
it's just something left
over from when sloths

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:58.569
lived on the ground in
super giant awesome mode.

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.953
But these theories fascinate us the most.

00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:02.646
- [Robert] Number one, stealth pooping.

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.867
If you've ever defecated
from the branches of a tree,

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:06.532
you know that this can cause quite a stir

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:07.671
down below on the ground.

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:10.115
The sight and sound of
falling herbivore poop

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:13.207
sends the unmistakable
signal that something edible

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:14.881
is up there right now.

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.912
So, sloths may climb down
for their weekly toilet

00:01:17.912 --> 00:01:20.185
to avoid drawing such
attention to themselves.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:22.326
- [Julie] Theory number
two, pooping it forward.

00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:24.547
Sloths spend days or even years living in

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:26.160
and eating in the same tree,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.623
so another theory involves
a kind of giving back

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:30.470
on the part of the mossy ones.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.698
By making poop deliveries
to the root system,

00:01:32.698 --> 00:01:35.391
they're helping to nourish
the trees they depend on.

00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:38.215
- [Robert] Theory number three,
visit my feces book page.

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:40.780
As humans, we often forget,
or choose to forget,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.010
you can learn a lot about
somebody from his or her feces.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.134
Some scientists theorize
that sloths carry out

00:01:46.134 --> 00:01:48.957
their weekly poop missions
in order to mark territory

00:01:48.957 --> 00:01:52.635
or even leave a fecal calling
card for potential mates.

00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:54.434
- [Julie] How's that for a valentine?

00:01:54.434 --> 00:01:56.442
- [Robert] Now you might
still be wondering why sloths

00:01:56.442 --> 00:01:57.910
are so slow to begin with.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.224
Well, the creature's
lethargic nature allows it

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:02.969
to make the most of its
surrounding resources.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.869
- [Julie] Imagine if you
ate nothing but salad greens

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.047
for a week without taking
in any fats or protein.

00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:10.266
You probably wouldn't have a
ton of excess energy either.

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:12.779
- [Robert] The sloth's diet,
which may also include fruits,

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.897
flower buds, and branches,
doesn't provide much nutrition.

00:02:15.897 --> 00:02:18.574
To compensate, sloths have
a host of adaptations,

00:02:18.574 --> 00:02:20.649
in addition to their slow pace,

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.757
that allows for them to
survive on such a lean diet.

00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:24.977
- [Julie] A 1983 study
found that captive sloths

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:27.740
slept 16 hours out of a
day, which put them among

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.578
the heaviest snoozers
in the animal kingdom.

00:02:29.578 --> 00:02:32.428
Meanwhile, wild sloths, who
have to do a lot more foraging,

00:02:32.428 --> 00:02:34.077
average ten hours a day.

00:02:34.077 --> 00:02:36.617
Either way, they're all
about slowing their roll

00:02:36.617 --> 00:02:37.809
as much as possible.

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.284
- [Robert] Sloths also conserve energy

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.333
by breaking down their food
at an incredibly slow rate.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:44.655
While it takes humans about
a day to digest a meal,

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:47.228
the sloth digestive system
spends up to a month

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:48.126
on the project.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.250
- [Julie] In addition to lowered
internal body temperatures,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.428
a sloth's metabolic rate
is about 40 to 45% slower

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:55.101
than comparably sized mammals.

00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:57.082
And since they don't need
to run about at high speeds,

00:02:57.082 --> 00:03:00.129
they boast half the muscle mass
of other animals their size.

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.425
- Finally, all that algae
that grows on their fur,

00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:04.498
well, it allows sloths to lick themselves

00:03:04.498 --> 00:03:06.985
for additional nutrition
when times get tough.

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.109
So which of these slothly
attributes would you like

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.035
to incorporate into your own life?
