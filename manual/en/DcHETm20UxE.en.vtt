00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.520
Relativity And Buying A Man's Suit - High
Quality Suits Compared With Lower Quality

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.520
Menswear

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.520
Hi!

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.520
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.539
Today, we're going to be talking about the
theory of relativity and how it relates to

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.700
men's suits, or specifically, buying a men's
suit.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.029

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.250
It's great.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.250

If you want more, I have a premium e-book.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.050
You've probably heard about it.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.280
It's 600 pages, 400 pictures, 14 hours of
audio.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.880
It's awesome and it supports my business here
in Wisconsin, so I would appreciate you checking

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.470
it out.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.890
The question that came in was from a gentleman,
Kevin.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.380
He's out in San Diego.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.420
He's a surface warfare officer transitioning
out of the military.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.230
Kevin wrote me actually a great letter, a
lot of information here.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.890
He's been going and looking at suits in the
San Diego area, but one of the things Kevin

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.109
mentioned was he watched a lot of my videos.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:15.049
"The suits I'm looking at are the Men's Wearhouse's
most expensive suits that they carry."

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.679
Everything else was pretty good, but I wanted
to go to this and I'm not going to knock the

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:21.679
Men's Wearhouse.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:22.679
I'm not going to knock Jos. A. Bank.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.520
I'm not going to knock Brooks Brothers or
any other manufacturer.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.409
These businesses serve a purpose and they're
helping a lot of men dress better, but the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.100
point I want to make is understanding quality
of menswear in relativity.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.100
What do I mean by this?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.810
I mean that whenever you're out there looking
for a good deal in menswear that the highest

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.189
line of any manufacturer is rarely the best
deal.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.039
How I describe value is you're getting the
most for your money.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.189
Usually, the way it's broken up, think of
it like a car.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:07.340
You've got the bare bones, you've got the
mid-sized or basically what most people buy,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.920
and then you've got the luxury.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.360
In the luxury, you're often paying for things
that you don't really need, but you're paying

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.200
for the privilege to have.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.100
Well, in the center area, kind of like the
sweet spot where most people buy is where

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.080
you've got the things that really are going
to pay dividends and that you do want to have.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.750
The bare bones, as you know, that's when you're
getting stuck with the stick shift and you're

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.700
having to shift all over the place in a big
city and it just drives you nuts as your kids

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.860
are screaming in the back.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.510
Don't get me started.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.350
The point, relativity, what does this have
to do with it?

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:52.100
Well, before this gentleman goes out and chooses
a suit and goes with this higher end menswear

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.830
house suit, he needs to go and try on the
best suits out there to really get a feel

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.840
because he may find that a midlevel suit at
Brooks Brothers is going to cost him maybe

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.350
just a little bit more, but he's going to
be at a much higher quality level.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.830
And the only way he's going to know this is
he needs to go to these higher end menswear

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.010
stores and try jackets on.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.200
Any man can do this and I recommend that as
you're going through your journey to dress

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.180
better, you go into higher end men stores
not just for suits, but any type of clothing

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.650
that you're going to be looking to purchase
and see what the best is.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.400
Don't be intimidated by these stores.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.050
Go in there and talk with the gentleman.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.180
You don't want to use people's time unless
they really want to help you look around,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.571
but be very clear, "Hey, I'm not here to buy
today, but I do want to look at it.

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:46.330
I want to feel and I want to try things on
to see if this is the right type of clothing

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.330
for me."

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.710
What you'll find is you'll start to notice
the small details that, "Wow!

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.060
These buttons are made out of horn.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.410
The fit here just feels better on the chest.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.130
I like the way these shoulders are built,"
or if it's a shirt, you'll start to feel the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.530
cotton and think, "Wow!

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.400
This is really nice."

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.100
This is important because you can then go
back to the value stores or to where you normally

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.290
shop and say, "Wow!

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.889
This is much worse quality and it's not worth
paying.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.460
I would rather pay a little bit more and get
much better quality," or when you're down

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.150
there shopping and you're going through the
thrift stores, you're able to identify a great

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.620
deal when you see it because you remember
what you saw at those higher end menswear

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.909
stores and then go back.

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.220
I remember the first high-end jacket I tried
on.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.259
I was in Kiev, Ukraine.

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.090
I went into this Italian luxury store.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.280
This was a $3000 jacket off-the-rack suit.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.590
I put that thing on and I knew I wasn't going
to buy it.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.020
I wasn't going to spend $3000 for a suit at
that time, but I tried it on and I was like,

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.020
"Wow!

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.020
This fit is awesome."

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.860
It just felt like butter.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.909
Well, maybe it didnâ€™t feel exactly like
butter, but I can't really describe it.

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:12.499
I never felt clothing up to that point that
was so smooth and just fit my body the way

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:16.979
this Italian suit did.

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.779
I was in Kiev, Ukraine, so a lot of these
suits are coming out of Russia and places

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:26.599
where the fabrics were not great, so I went
to these others stores and I was like, wow!

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:35.310
There's a big difference between a $3000 suit
and a $300 suit.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.949
Yeah, it may be hard to go back down, but
it will get you thinking and looking for deals,

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.610
and you're going to be able to spot them a
lot easier.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:53.069
That was the point I wanted to hit with relativity
and buying a men's suit, is that you want

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:58.219
to know whatever suit you buy, where it's
at relative to the scale.

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:04.409
And unless you know what the best is like,
you're not going to know how far down the

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.990
scale the jacket you're trying on really is.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.210
This has been Antonio Centeno with Real Men
Real Style.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.520
If you've got a question, if you've got something
you want to add, I'd love to see you in the

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.350
comments, but better yet, go check us out
at mensstyleqa.com and that's where I'm really

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.560
able to allow the best questions and answers
to rise to the top.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.560
YouTube, these comments are broke.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.189
I don't see them half the time, so I hope
to see you over at mensstyleqa.com.

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:34.189
Take care.

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.190
Bye-bye.
