00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.180
Thomas...

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.520
it's okay.

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:13.315
THOMAS!

00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:15.444
Wake up, we gotta go!

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:17.377
Come on!

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.700
The world outside's hanging on by a very thin thread.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.940
It's only a matter of time before The Flare virus wipes the rest of us out.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.960
This entire facility is designed to keep you safe.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.080
Where they takin' her?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.620
They're hiding something...

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.338
These people are not who they say they are.

00:00:40.643 --> 00:00:42.323
Thomas! What did you see?

00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:44.032
We never escaped.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.140
It's WICKED. It's all just been part of their plan.

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.141
I then only have one question.

00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:52.851
Who's side are you on?

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:55.101
Run!

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.880
Thomas!

00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:57.581
The maze is one thing!

00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.283
But you kids won't last one day out in the Scorch!

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520
There's something inside of us that WICKED wants.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.650
So we can't let them find us.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.580
You guys don't have to come with me.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.667
I know we can make it.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.960
Come on! Follow me!

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.820
No one's come out of the Scorch in a long time.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.980
Let's go!

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.380
Go!!

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.460
All those kids that we left behind.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.540
I don't want to end up like that.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.100
Hello, Thomas.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.888
You know me?

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.100
A lot our friends died for us to get this far.

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:45.371
So we can't give up.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.080
This is about everyone WICKED's ever taken.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.520
They'll never stop.

00:01:53.754 --> 00:01:55.274
So I'm gonna stop them.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.480
Don't you want to know why this all happened?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.660
You're so close to the truth...

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.570
Brenda!

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:11.285
Hang on!
