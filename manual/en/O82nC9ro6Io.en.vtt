00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:06.376
&gt;&gt; [Background Music] He was six weeks old when
we were at a restaurant for dinner one night

00:00:06.376 --> 00:00:08.516
when he stopped breathing and turned blue on us.

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:13.266
He spent 10 days in the hospital,
then came home.

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:19.016
Two days later he ended up getting --
turning blue again, stopped breathing on us,

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:20.896
and prayed every night just
hoping that he would pull through.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:27.556

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:32.686
Quite a few of the doctors said that he had
a good chance of not leaving the hospital.

00:00:33.106 --> 00:00:37.196
It was the most devastating thing
that a parent could ever hear.

00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:43.096
At that point I think we were desperate,
anything that would work to make him live,

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:46.236
we pretty much would take it and run with it.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:50.876
No other doctor knew how
to do anything about it,

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:55.326
so luckily Doctor Green came up
and was able to do something.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:59.606
&gt;&gt; Glenn Green: Tracheal malasia is
collapse of the windpipe that makes it

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:01.626
so the child is unable to breathe out.

00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:06.916
It's fairly rare, about 1 in 2,200
children has tracheal malasia.

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:10.056
Kaiba is one of those children
that had severe tracheal malasia.

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.636
Even with the best medical
treatments that are available,

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:17.176
he continued to have breathing difficulties,

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:20.146
and continued to have events
where he was unable to breathe.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:27.056
We obtained imaging of his
defect with a CT scan.

00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:32.386
Scott Hollister instantly and
rapidly went about designing a splint

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:35.226
that could go and meet this need.

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:40.016
This is the first time this procedure
has been done anywhere in the world.

00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:44.056
This is a model of Kaiba's trachea and bronchi.

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:48.336
The splint is designed to slip over the
top of the bronchus, just like this.

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:52.446
&gt;&gt; Scott Hollister: This is really
the first time I think it's been used

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:56.826
on an emergency basis, where there
was no other treatment available.

00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:03.706
So we get the plastic -- the biopolymer in a
powder form with a very small particle size.

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:09.086
We also have a computer file that contains the
information we've designed into the device,

00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:11.196
essentially the geometry
of the device, etcetera.

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:16.866
It's a biopolymer, essentially a plastic
that's biocompatible, and you can use it

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:20.366
in the body, and it reabsorbs over time.

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:23.066
&gt;&gt; Glenn Green: Kaiba was
brought to the operating room,

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.156
the splint was placed over
the top of the bronchus.

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:32.226
This has a process of opening the
bronchus up anteriorly and posteriorly

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.176
to completely widen the bronchus.

00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:35.326
It was amazing.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:42.146
As soon as the splint was put in, the lungs
started going up and down for the first time.

00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:45.046
We knew that he would be okay.

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:50.806
&gt;&gt; It means the world to me, just
knowing that something actually worked,

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:53.326
and was able to save our son's life.

00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:58.116
It just means everything to me.

00:02:58.116 --> 00:03:01.336
&gt;&gt; We both -- when he gets older
he can tell the people his story.

00:03:01.336 --> 00:03:05.566
It's all it's going to be is the
story about his life, how he made it,

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:07.906
how he's doing, and how far he's going to go.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:16.740
