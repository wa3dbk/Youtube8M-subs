00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.566
Before you can edit your screencasts in 
Camtasia Studio, you need to have a solid 
understanding of how the timeline works.

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:14.666
Even if you’ve used Camtasia Studio version 7 
or prior, a lot has changed to give you more 
flexibility and power.

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:19.999
This tutorial will cover the biggest concepts 
and skills you’ll need to understand to be 
successful, 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.666
as well as a few tips to make working on the 
timeline much easier.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:34.932
Digital videos, just like old-style film-based 
movies, are based on a series of images that 
play so fast our eyes see motion instead.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:43.866
In Camtasia Studio, what you see displayed in 
the canvas is the frame (or picture) at the 
moment in time where the playhead is.

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:52.366
The timeline, on the other hand, shows you 
how long things like video, audio, images, and 
callouts will show up in your video.

00:00:52.366 --> 00:01:00.766
Before something appears on the timeline, it 
doesn’t show up in your video…and after it 
ends in the timeline, it also doesn’t show up.

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:07.866
One of the great things about the new timeline 
is that you can use unlimited tracks and that 
there are no media-specific tracks.

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:14.699
This means that you can put your video, audio, 
callouts, and images on any track you want.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.900
However, even though you can put any piece of 
media on any track, 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.966
the track you choose does affect how the 
media appears in your final video. 

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.799
That’s because while the timeline shows 
when your media appears in the video,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.400
it also shows the order in which media is 
stacked on top of each other in the video.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:42.733
You can think of the timeline as almost a side-
ways view of the media…while the canvas is a 
top-down view of the timeline tracks.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:48.533
So, because the timeline shows the stacking 
order— this is sometimes called the “Z”-order 

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:54.433
— placing any media on a higher track on the 
timeline will move it higher in the stacking 
order will move it higher in the stacking order… 

00:01:54.433 --> 00:02:00.599
and thus moving media up in the timeline will 
move it forward on the canvas.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.066
..and moving it down in the timeline will move it 
backward on the canvas.

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:12.266
You may notice that some of your recordings 
have both video and audio in the same clip in 
the timeline.  

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.899
This is to keep them in sync and make them 
easier to work with.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500
However, if you need to edit either separately, 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.500
and choose “Separate video and audio” 
from the menu.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.600
I want to keep them together, so I’ll just undo 
that action by clicking here. 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.700
Also on the timeline, you’ll notice that some of 
the clips have these little triangles.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.933
They’re animations, and if we zoom in using 
this slider, you’ll see that the triangles are 
actually arrows instead.

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:48.166
Now that they’re not all squished up, you can 
see where the animations start...and where 
they end.

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:56.032
If you find that any animations are too fast or 
too slow, just drag an end to stretch it longer – 
which will slow down the animation – 

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:58.633
or shorter – which will speed it up.

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:01.833
Next, let’s make a selection on the timeline.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:08.466
Simply put the playhead where you want the 
selection to start…and drag the red out-point to 
the right.

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:12.232
You can always adjust your selection with the 
green and red handles.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:16.666
Notice how a playhead selection includes all of 
the tracks on the timeline.

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:23.532
If you only want to edit one or two tracks, click 
the locks to the left of the tracks you want left 
alone.

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:31.466
Be sure to scroll up and down to make sure 
you don’t miss any and unlock the tracks 
before trying to edit them again.

00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:40.332
From here, you can do a few different things. 
You can hit the delete key, which will simply 
remove the section of media from the timeline.

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:46.466
You can click here to cut it, which will remove 
the selection and stitch the remaining parts 
together.

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:55.532
Or, you can click here to copy the selection.
Once you’re done with the selection, you can 
clear it by double-clicking on the playhead.

00:03:55.533 --> 00:04:00.433
If you choose to cut or copy the selection, you 
can now paste it… 

00:04:00.433 --> 00:04:05.699
and the clips will be added to the timeline at 
the playhead, above what you 
already have.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.666
You can also split selected clips right at the 
playhead by clicking this button.

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:16.966
Before we finish, here are a few tips to make 
working on the timeline easier.

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:23.666
At times there may be a lot on your timeline, 
both horizontally… and vertically.

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:29.299
You can use the scroll bars, but it’s nice every 
now and then to see everything.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.500
To show more vertically, you can make the 
tracks shorter by moving this slider to the left… 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.066
and to zoom in (horizontally) on the timeline, 
drag this slider to the left.

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:46.232
Many of the most common actions are 
available in the context menus, 

00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:57.466
which appear when you right click on the very 
left of the tracks, clips and empty areas on the 
timeline, and on the playhead.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.666
Well, that wraps up this tutorial. 

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:04.899
In the next one, we’ll dive into some of 
Camtasia Studio’s most useful editing 
features.
