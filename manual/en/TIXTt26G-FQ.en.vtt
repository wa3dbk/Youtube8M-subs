MIKE SPINELLI: Hey.

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:17.959
Welcome to something called
"Dri-vay Cen-trawl." Here's

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:19.136
where you're going to find
out what's happening

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:20.506
on DRIVE this week.

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:23.296
Don't forget, /drive.tv,
@drive on Twitter,

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:27.166
facebook.com/drivetv is where
you'll find us outside of

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:30.486
YouTube, where you probably
are right now.

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:32.266
Anyway, "Tuned" is
off this week.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:37.196
But don't forget, there is a
"Driven" episode this week.

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:39.196
You've heard of Laguna Seca.

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:40.526
Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:43.726
You're going to find out how
Drive shoots videos of Porsche

00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:46.586
IMSA GT3 Cup Challenge
by Yokohama races.

00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:47.511
Let's take a look at a clip.

00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:49.656
-It takes a lot for
us to get here, in

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:51.006
terms of our equipment.

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:54.756
All told, we travel with about
300 pounds of gear to every

00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:56.851
event that we go to,
especially races.

00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:02.776
-There's the other one.

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:04.216
-Oh, yeah.

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:06.616
Everything's perfectly
where it should be.

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:08.556
TV: It's a low grip racetrack
here at Mazda

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:09.520
Raceway Laguna Seca.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.930
Never has--

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.412
-Watch.

00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:15.304
This traffic is going
to cause that pass.

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:16.268
TV: It is never too late--

00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:16.750
-Whoa.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.196
Wipe them up.

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:19.160
Wipe them up.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.175
TV: --now he's going
to try that.

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:23.081
-Whoa.

00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:25.116
-Whoa.

00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:26.706
TV: It's very, very
impressive.

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:27.876
MIKE SPINELLI: That's
"Driven" this week.

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:31.756
Tuesday on "Drive." And it's
the Jaguar F-Type.

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:32.116
That's right.

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:35.846
I said "Jag-u-are," because
Chris Harris on "Cars." Chris

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:38.556
is driving the Jag and a couple
of other convertibles

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:42.356
there at his complex near
Wales, wherever

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:43.236
the hell that is.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.347
Let's take a look at the clip.

00:02:42.556 --> 00:02:43.856
MIKE SPINELLI: That's
Chris Harris on

00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:45.056
"Cars" every Wednesday.

00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:48.426
And this week, a second
"Driven." We went to China to

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:51.896
find out what the billionaires
there are driving, and where

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:54.956
the very secret government
tuning complex is.

00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:55.966
Yes, we found out.

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:57.616
Let's take a look at that.

00:02:57.616 --> 00:02:58.026
There's just a million

00:02:58.026 --> 00:03:00.176
contradictions going on at once.

00:03:00.176 --> 00:03:05.106
We're driving a $300,000
car in a country

00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:07.236
of expanding wealth.

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:15.496
And yet, there are 1.3 billion
people here, that

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:17.726
most of them are poor.

00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:19.966
And so what am I
trying to say?

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:20.746
[BLEEP]

00:03:20.746 --> 00:03:23.638
But you can't deny the
contradiction of driving a

00:03:23.638 --> 00:03:28.296
$300,000 limousine through
these little villages, in

00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:31.906
which people are moving sticks
around by a three-wheel

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:33.156
motorcycle.

00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:38.666
I mean, it just feels off.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.946
That's a "Driven" special
this week on Thursday.

00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:42.776
And also on Thursday, we'll have
another question for you

00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:45.216
guys to answer and for us
to yammer on about on

00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:48.496
"After/Drive." And then on
Friday, it's "ShakeDown" for

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:51.926
the best motor sports news,
analysis, and attitude you'll

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:54.066
find anywhere at any price.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:57.126
That's "ShakeDown" with Leo
Parente Friday on "Drive."

00:03:57.126 --> 00:04:00.416
And that's it for "Drive
Central." Don't forget,

00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:02.866

you're in the US.

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:05.156
slashdrive.tv.

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:07.686
Also, Ian, European
ordering yet?

00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:08.686
Or no?

00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:09.226
Not yet.

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:10.166
Working on that.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.466
Sorry about that guys.

00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:13.216
We're going to have European
ordering for your shirts

00:04:13.216 --> 00:04:13.716
pretty soon.

00:04:13.716 --> 00:04:17.906
Also, @drive on Twitter, and
facebook.com/drive too.

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:19.894
See you guys next week.

00:04:19.894 --> 00:05:17.546
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:18.540
MIKE SPINELLI: Yeah.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.606
-Maybe there's two?

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:20.786
MIKE SPINELLI: Maybe
there's two clips.

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.546
Maybe there are three clips.

00:05:22.546 --> 00:05:25.156
I don't care how many
clips there are.

00:05:25.156 --> 00:05:29.126
As long as there are clips, I
will be sitting in this chair,

00:05:29.126 --> 00:05:32.066
in front of the boomerang
of insanity.
