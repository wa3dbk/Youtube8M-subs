00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.850
Ever heard of people bragging about ''I'm a smurf, my main is 2000 ELO'' when in queue in a ranked game?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.850
That is pure Alistar shit.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.550
If a player is truly smurfing, he should be able to play all roles, no problem!

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.750
But what do we see? Someone that always wants to play the carry role like AP mid or ADC bot...nothing else.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.800
He tells you that he has no runes for the other roles since it's a secondary account? 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.400
Well if he really was a veteran player on his main, he should know that he can't always get the role he wants.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.150
Some will even try to prove that they have a high ELO main, saying stuff like ''check XXX it's my main'', ''add me and I'll message you''.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.820
Dude, you are in a queue, cawlisse!

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.850
You can't do that unless one of you dodge, so there is no way for you to show any proof!

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.700
The only time you can prove that is when your game is done, but no one care since you won't be playing a game together ever again!

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.300
Anyways, even if you let that ''smurf'' play the role he wants, what happens?

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:02.000
He feeds hard, he doesn't play his role properly, he blames others all day long for his own mistakes and so on.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.200
Well at least that is what happened to me almost everytime someone claimed that he was a smurf, but I don't know how it is for anyone else.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.600
I might be mistaken, but whatever. Let's move on.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.500
You could come across two fuckabishes in a duo queue and they will ask anything they want.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.800
Most of the time, one of them will be the first pick while the other one is the last pick.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:29.600
Guess what? The first pick will tell you all that the last pick guy is his friend and that he's a smurf, so ''let him take the role he wants if you don't want to lose''.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.750
And what happens when you don't want to submit yourself? These two will troll you hard by picking unwanted champions and summoner's spells just to make you dodge.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:44.000
What is that? A damn negotiation between police officers and kiddos kidnappers that will kill their hostages if they don't get what they want?

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.050
That's just unbelievable!

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.800
We always say that pick order dominate call order and that is true. 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.800
So you, mister last pick, should fill in if you play accordingly to the meta and not fuck up your whole team.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.500
But still, everyone, even the first pick, must call the role he wants or everyone else will just think that he's a dumb fuckabish.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.000
Next scenario : you could run into a smurf telling you that his main account is banned and that is why he plays on his secondary account.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.850
Dude, if you are banned, it must means that you have many reports.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.450
Why did you get reported? Because you always troll by feeding, leaving, fucking up your teammates and so on.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.900
Well, some are innocents and still get banned, but most are at fault.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.150
So tell me : is revealing that your main account is banned to your allies a good idea?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.800
Hell no! You're explicitly telling them that you are a troller, a toxic player!

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.600
Why would they let someone like you take the pick you want? 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.050
To conclude, I want to tell you all that not because someone might have a main account in the higher ELO bracket that he has more rights than you in picking a role.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.800
Never let a ''smurf'' control the game because right now, he has the same ELO as you.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.500
Also, a true smurf won't brag about his ELO and just fill in so everyone can play at their best.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.750
If you truly want to see if you must leave a role to a smurf, you can just go to www.lolking.net and check out his stats in previous matches.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.400
That's it for today, people!

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.000
And I'll see you next time.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Ciaossu!
