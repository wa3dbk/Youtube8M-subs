00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.500
Oh, but I was there, the other day, I was at a comedy show and I was watching this

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
comedian go on a rant.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.500
He was talking about the Iman’s controversy and Michael Richards and how black people

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.500
scream racism whenever someone else uses the N word

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.200
yet we use it so liberally amongst ourselves.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.800
And you know, it just got me thinking.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.500
I don’t know if that’s right or wrong.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.100
There's no definitive answer, everybody has a different opinion about it

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.500
but it just seemed to me like he was lobbying for permission to use the word.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.500
And...

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.500
you know, my thing is to all the non-blacks out there if you feel left out of this exclusive club,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.500
[laughter]

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
and you’re just dying to say the word,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
[laughter]

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.200
then go ahead and say it but just do so with courtesy.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.500
[laughter]

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000
Like you know how, you know so many people find smoking distasteful

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.500
so they ask permission before they light up?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.500
It would work like that.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.500
[laughter]

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.500
“You know Tyrone,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.500
the other day I was in an elevator minding my own business when all of a sudden, this…

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.600
do you mind if I say nigger?”

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:43.500
[laughter]

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.200
Or say…

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.300
Now, everybody in this room including me has been in a movie theatre

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.800
and been annoyed by black people.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.500
[laughter]

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.800
So, you would go,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.600
“Shhh! Will you two be quiet?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.800
I didn’t spend $10 in tickets to listen to a couple of…

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.500
Now, ordinarily I would ask…

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500
[laughter]

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.200
but for this to be effective, I need something stronger than African-American.” 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.500
[laughter]

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.500
All I’m suggesting is to try it.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.800
[laughter]

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.500
Let’s see how it goes.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.200
[laughter]

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.100
And if the results aren’t what you were hoping, then maybe it’s just wasn’t never meant to be

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.500
and you should just let it go.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
[laughter]
