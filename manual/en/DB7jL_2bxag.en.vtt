00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.700
Small sculptures like this have a little magnetism.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.133
It makes you come close and

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:19.100
admire and imagine things about it.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.133
It’s a group of three males

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:28.734
from about 1340 B.C., the Amarna period. It’s a period famed for naturalism.

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:32.467
You can see that in the slumped bodies and the gestures.

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.834
The man in the middle has his arm around the

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:39.667
boy as if he’s drawing him close to him and kind of protecting him,

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:43.233
and then the two men are holding hands. That’s a very

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:49.367
beautiful holding of hands, with one man’s clasping the other man’s hand lying flat.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:57.767
Every face is different. The man on the left has a rather lined, heavy face, and the corners of his mouth are even drooping.

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:02.000
And the man in the middle looks more equable and calm.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.634
And the boy has a little boy’s small mouth. You start saying, “Who were they, and what are their personalities?”

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:13.600
We actually know these statues were used in domestic contexts,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.634
in little house shrines, to show devotion to an ancestor, and keep on

00:01:18.634 --> 00:01:24.100
asking for their protection in life. After spending time with it, I think

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.533
that the man in the middle is the person who gives us access into what’s going on.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:36.700
The man on his right is probably an esteemed ancestor. He has a fancy wig,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.400
he has very elaborate

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.133
clothes, and

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.367
a handkerchief that he’s holding. From the side

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:46.333
you see he has a wide stride.

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:50.767
On the right, I imagine that is the middle man’s little son.

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:54.734
And he wants that child to receive the blessings that

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:58.200
accrue from his attention to the elder. It might have stood in

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.500
the middle man’s house, and then it might have been kept by

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.967
the son’s family. You know, handed down, taking on different identities through time, too.

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:10.667
That’s a story, but it’s something like that.

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:14.266
It’s really a fascinating statue that just puts all of these

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:17.634
questions in your face. You empathize, you want to

00:02:17.634 --> 00:02:22.600
understand it. It reminds me

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
of the way we relate to old family snapshots.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.400
We cherish them, and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.133
pore over them for some clues to

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:35.567
draw us close to those people.
