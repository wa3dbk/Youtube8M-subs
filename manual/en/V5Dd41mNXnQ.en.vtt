00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.400
- [Translator] The Atlantis
boatyard has a long history.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.530
So it is one of the most well-known.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.550
It has been part of the Azimut
group now for a few years.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.520
So as well as being known
for its fame and tradition,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.980
it has also become synonymous
with the technology

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.773
and experience of this
well number one boatyard.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.630
There are six boats in the series,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.690
all of which have been
designed and created

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.000
in the past two years.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.320
It's quite unique as a range

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.940
because Atlantis wanted
to just concentrate

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.543
on producing open boats.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.473
Lengths of the boat
vary from 34 to 58 feet.

00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:03.230
The 34 is the first in the
series and the smallest,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.063
coming in at under 10 meters.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.470
It comes with four beds.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.840
The master bedroom in
the middle of the boat,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.640
and the dining area which transforms

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.253
into another two berths.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.000
It's an ideal open for daily excursions

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.023
and can easily be used to cruise.

00:01:33.282 --> 00:01:35.460
The swim platform can hold a long cover,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.750
up to two and a half meters.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.750
The cockpit table doubles
up as a sunning area.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.620
And the roof opens up.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.370
There's a comfortable chaise
longue under the sunshade.

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:55.460
And with two 220 horsepower
Volvo Penta D3 engines,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.973
it can reach speeds of up to 32 knots.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.380
On the bridge, the instruments
are all easy to reach

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.313
for the driver and the
controls are in an ideal place.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.380
Most opens are made for life outdoors.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.190
But the models in the Atlantis range

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.450
offer large living spaces below deck

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.313
and the 34 is no exception.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.870
The boat is series produced

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.060
with little scope for personalization

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.453
except for the accessories.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.050
But even so, the internal
areas and furnishings

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.380
are really well done.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.080
The chosen materials and design

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.020
all make for an elegant
style above and beyond

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.763
the other industrial productions.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.990
The great like deck below comes from

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.703
the long windows running
along the sides of the boat.

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.810
The Atlantis 34 is a
totally homogenous project.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.710
Which has one precise objective,

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.453
to make using the boat very easy.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.280
And that's why they've
chosen a sensible engine.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.950
Two Volvo Penta 220 horsepower
turbo diesel engines.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.268
Which means less weight, less consumption,

00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:32.693
and therefore lower operating costs.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.190
Again, with the idea of
making the boat easy to us,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.850
Atlantis have opted for
stern-driven propulsion

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.780
with the two prop acclimatic

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.818
Which means it has a
geared motor to the front

00:03:48.818 --> 00:03:50.290
and the other behind.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.543
Look how quickly the boat turns on itself.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.220
Proof that it really is easy to maneuver.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.653
And if you want, you
can request a joystick.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.520
Let's take a look at the bow of the boat

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.470
without touching the flaps.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.370
I'm going to try to put my
foot halfway down on the pedal.

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:19.320
And then once we've started planing

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.733
I'm going to decelerate.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.190
This makes the boat really easy to use

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.823
even if it is your first boat.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.340
Completely lowering the flaps,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.760
we can see much better from the bow.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.373
Even from close to the boat.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.220
The trail tells us that we are planing

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.730
at a speed of 10 knots
with the flap and trim

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.920
still in the lowest position.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.060
But for the best conditions,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.910
we need to look for something better.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.540
As soon as the speed increases,

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.920
using the flaps is completely useless.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.300
Especially if sailing
conditions are perfect

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.750
like they are here today.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.510
At 15 knots, we are consuming
44 liters an hour in total

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.423
and the trim at this speed
is still completely lowered.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.513
We are now up to 2,900 revs
and going five knots faster.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.220
But consumption has gone up
just five liters per hour.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.790
So maybe this is the best option
when sailing long distances

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.163
to keep consumption low whilst
keeping in the maximum range.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.740
Unlike a car or a motorbike,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.850
you just drive this boat with your hands.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.400
One on the wheel, and the
other on the shift lever.

00:06:27.864 --> 00:06:31.520
If like in this case, the
pickup reactions aren't so fast,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.653
you'll quickly learn to thrust this boat.

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:41.930
The Atlantis 34 can get up to 32 knots

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.143
and nearly 4,000 revs.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.330
But the highest cruising
speed is at 3,600 revs

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.283
and 27 and a half knots.
