00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:02.800
[Narrator] Hello and welcome to the second video

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.740
in the series on Insect Pest Exclusion.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.021
This video describes the
process of making a net house.

00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:11.204
Net house designs can vary greatly

00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:15.454
depending on target insect
and materials available.

00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:18.968
There are three recommended IPM approaches

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:21.130
for sustainable farming systems.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.155
Level 1: System-based
practices like trap crops

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:27.873
and Level 3: Use of
Biorational insecticides

00:00:27.873 --> 00:00:30.334
have been discussed separately
in the training modules

00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:34.403
available on Alabama
Vegetable IPM website.

00:00:34.403 --> 00:00:37.062
Video part 1 in the series
provides basic principles

00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:40.490
of Insect Pest Exclusion in study results.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.039
This video discusses
the construction method

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.191
for a net house. This kind
of protected agriculture

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.963
is suitable for small
organic or natural farms

00:00:48.963 --> 00:00:53.130
with returns on investment
within 2-3 crop cycles.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.068
A net house is a sealed
structure that excludes insect

00:00:58.068 --> 00:01:00.393
pests throughout the growing season.

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.840
It is a semi-permanent
structure big enough to allow

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.896
the use of conventional farm equipment.

00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:08.145
An Alabama study, we
found that the net house

00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:12.302
can effectively reduce, or
eliminate, thrips, white flies,

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:15.831
stink bugs, leaffooted bugs,
and many species of moss

00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.609
using a 50 mesh insect screen.

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.054
Reduction in insecticide
usage was nearly 95%,

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:25.946
resulting in major cost
savings on product and labor.

00:01:25.946 --> 00:01:28.277
Note that farmers can
use high tunnels or other

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:30.680
simpler structures to bring down the cost

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.997
with partial or full netting.

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:35.776
There are many benefits of
net house vegetable production system

00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:39.158
in terms of crop yield and quality.

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:41.497
Our findings related to
the significant reduction

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:44.388
of insect pests and insecticide
usage are consistent

00:01:44.388 --> 00:01:47.259
with past research. The following slides

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.454
will outline the net house
construction process.

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:52.701
Producers are encouraged
to develop their own design

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:57.656
after considering the target
pest and available resources.

00:01:57.656 --> 00:02:01.438
Here is a design for a large
net house that was 150 feet

00:02:01.438 --> 00:02:04.596
by 46 feet. The height
of the structure allowed

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:07.406
conventional farm equipment
to be used for planting

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:10.973
and also kept hot air away
from the plant canopy.

00:02:10.973 --> 00:02:13.257
The side walls were 14 feet tall and

00:02:13.257 --> 00:02:16.360
sufficiently away from the
crop rows. That is, the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.981
plants did not touch the side walls.

00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.373
Wooden poles were used for
building the net house.

00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:24.857
We used wooden poles
for this project since

00:02:24.857 --> 00:02:27.643
the 50 mesh screen was a heavy fabric.

00:02:27.643 --> 00:02:29.617
Holes were made in the ground using

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:32.139
tractor mounted equipment as shown.

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.310
Wooden poles were partially
buried in the ground

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.310
and soil around the poles
was compacted for stability.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.817
Once all the wooden
poles are in the ground

00:02:41.817 --> 00:02:43.954
a hole was drilled on the top 6 inch

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:47.497
and steel cables were stretched
over the top as shown.

00:02:47.497 --> 00:02:50.409
In our experience, frequent
storms and strong winds

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.777
can destabilize a net house.

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:54.626
So the steel cables help in sharing

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:56.379
weight of the structure.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.617
We have also constructed
small net houses and found

00:02:58.617 --> 00:03:01.369
the addition of cable
support a worthwile effort

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:04.852
to anchor the structure to the ground.

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:08.616
Steel cables on both sides
were anchored to the ground.

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:10.541
The large roll of insect netting or

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.118
fabric can be seen on the left.

00:03:13.118 --> 00:03:16.195
A high quality insect net
can last four or more years

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.112
under ideal conditions.

00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:21.033
The fabric pieces were
stitched together using

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.936
a hand held sewing
machine. A double stitch

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:27.857
with reinforcement was
done for all pieces.

00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:30.107
Before putting the fabric
over the cables and

00:03:30.107 --> 00:03:33.056
wooden poles, a trench
digger was used to create

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:35.335
a three foot deep furrow parallel to

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:38.246
the side walls on both sides.

00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:40.951
Insect netting or fabric
was stretched over the steel

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:43.102
cables and wooden poles.

00:03:43.102 --> 00:03:46.373
Some other designs, such as
U frames, may make it easier

00:03:46.373 --> 00:03:49.844
to stretch the fabric
and make a net house.

00:03:49.844 --> 00:03:52.542
Once the fabric was laid
over the poles, the fabric

00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:55.111
was tucked into the
ground, about three feet,

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:58.466
in order to make a tight
side wall on both sides.

00:03:58.466 --> 00:04:00.992
Tight side wall allows
pores to remain open

00:04:00.992 --> 00:04:04.544
and improves airflow within the net house.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:07.006
Net house can be large to allow the entry

00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:10.791
of conventional planting equipment
as shown in this picture.

00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:13.612
End walls and screen doors
can be installed after

00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:16.195
basic soil preparation is over.

00:04:17.327 --> 00:04:18.962
Vegetable transplanting can be done

00:04:18.962 --> 00:04:22.073
after complete sealing of the net house.

00:04:22.073 --> 00:04:24.604
It is important to check
transplants for insect

00:04:24.604 --> 00:04:28.702
infestation if they are
grown outside the net house.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:31.010
Limit traffic entering
the structure to prevent

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.516
accidental pest entry
through the double doors.

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:36.804
Check the entire fabric
frequently to detect

00:04:36.804 --> 00:04:39.471
any tear and repair immediately.

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:43.301
Due to high heat condition in the south,

00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:45.999
a net house will require cooling.

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.748
A retractable shade cloth
can be installed inside

00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:52.057
to reflect heat. In this
case, it was easier to

00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:54.553
install the shading using the wooden poles

00:04:54.553 --> 00:04:57.493
and good quality nylon cables.

00:04:57.493 --> 00:05:00.485
Producers can use fans inside
the structure to improve

00:05:00.485 --> 00:05:03.109
air flow and reduce
the pockets of humidity

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:06.023
that may cause disease problems.

00:05:06.023 --> 00:05:08.519
Net house is not the
silver bullet solution to

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:10.853
all pest problems, but it is a useful

00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:13.790
technology for sustainable
crop production,

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.600
especially high-value
fruits and vegetables.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.839
Insect netting can be
integrated with high tunnels

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.999
and other structures in order to provide

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:25.122
significant relief from insect pests.

00:05:25.122 --> 00:05:27.200
Please check video part three for low-cost

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.764
applications of insect
net or fabric suitable

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:34.038
for small plot intensive cropping system.

00:05:34.038 --> 00:05:36.221
Full results of our net house study is

00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:38.810
available in multiple formats.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.213

bulletins are available

available for those interested.
