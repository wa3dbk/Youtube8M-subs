00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.099
Now what I'm going to do is put the bike on
the floor and stand over it to make sure everything

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:14.540
is where I like it. In this particular circumstance
because I have the grip and brake lever on

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.180
the left side of the handle bars I have something
to work with. Usually that is not the case.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.520
So what I do is I start off by adjusting my
grip with these lock on style grips notice

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.320
I have bolt heads I want to adjust it where
the bolt heads are not anywhere near where

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.980
I'm going to be putting my hands cause that
is not very comfortable. So I take my 3 millimeter

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:44.210
wrench or a 2.5 millimeter wrench if you are
using the ODI brand grips. Tighten this to

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:55.480
a good tork, I'm going to tighten up the other
head so now I have my grips install and I'm

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.489
ready to set up my brake lever. For me brake
lever positioning is a lot more critical then

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.359
shifters positioning because brakes are the
most important tool you have in arms when

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:13.740
it comes to controlling your bike. So I like
to set things up so I have a nice even angle

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.789
down my hand to my wrist to wrap around the
brake lever, I also personally like to be

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.159
able to read ch the brake lever when my hand
is on the handlebars like this. Just one finger

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.170
cause these brakes are good enough that I
won't need my whole hand to brake. Some people

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.779
prefer to use 2 fingers or other fingers to
brake and they may end up sliding there brake

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:40.929
lever out this way so that it is more natural
to have there hand on the end of the bar pull

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.369
the middle finger with 2 fingers but that
is not my preference. So I'm going to find

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.890
the angle it feels good, this feels pretty
good, so I'm going to hold that grab my 4

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:04.240
millimeter wrench and tighten these up sort
of finger tight. This is a really light application

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.840
your still want to be able to reach down and
adjust these cause that means if you crash

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.459
they would move out of the way instead of
braking.
