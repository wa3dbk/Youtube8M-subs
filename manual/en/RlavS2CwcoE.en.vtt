Hi I'm Amelia, and I'm going to discuss with
you how to use a three barrel waver. This

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.599
is a three barrel waver. It's basically two
barrels of a curling iron with a third one

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:21.960
in the center. And what that does is that
creates a nice S-wave. What you want to do

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:32.850
is first section the hair off, and you can
get these at any beauty supply store. Then

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.510
you're going to want to use some some sort
of thermal protectant or curling spray and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.340
that's going to help hold that shape in the
hair. And grab the hair, and with the three

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.940
barrel wavers you really want to use a smaller
section. You don't want to grab a big old

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.390
hunk of hair. I wouldn't use a section any
wider than about an inch. Actually I wouldn't

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.670
use a section any wider than about a half
inch. And you grab the waver, start at the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:19.229
top of the strand, hold it, and then you bring
it down to the beginning of the next wave.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.590
So that way you don't get any strange crimps.
And you continue all the way down to the very

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.029
end of the strand. And it's OK if you only
have the end of the strand poking out. You

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:37.349
just don't want like a little fish hook hanging
out. And that's how you create a wave. So

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:49.310
you do that around the rest of the head. And
that creates a nice S-wave shape. You can

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.439
comb through it if you like to give it more
of a wild crimped or you can even brush through

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.689
it and give it a nice soft wave look, something
very reminiscent of the Nineteen Forties.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.669
And that's how you create a wave with a three
barrel waver.
