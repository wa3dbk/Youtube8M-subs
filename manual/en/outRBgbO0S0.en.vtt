00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The name of our society is

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.000
Zangbeto, from the town of Sigbehoue

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
in the prefecture of the Lakes

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
in the south of Togo

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
It is a village located 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.500
at 50km east from Lome

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.000
close to the border with Benin

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Sigbehoue is a much cosmopolite town

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
People there live from fishing,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.000
from agriculture, cattle farming...

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.180
as in most of the african villages

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Our society has been existing

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.000
Since the 1950s

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Our fathers felt the need

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to have within their societies

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.820
what we call a voodoo which is sacred

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.640
It is is a fetish that can protect the villages against criminals

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.500
When we say Zangbeto, we mean the guardian of the city

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.360
In every society there are people

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.000
who want to threaten your life or what you do

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.000
therefore, there can be other people

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.700
who want to annihilate our powers

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.000
so they can overthrow us or harm us

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.000
Our people went, I mean,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.920
populations circulate a lot

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.940
So somebody from another village went

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980
to Benin and neighboring villages

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:22.680
This is the way our people share the voodoos

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.820
somebody goes there, and notices that the local voodoo can protect the village

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.420
then he contacts the people of this village, he talks with them

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.000
and if they reach an agreement

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.000
these people come to the visitor's village to bring the voodoo

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.000
in his society

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Our Zangbeto, compared to Benin's

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.500
are the same

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.900
Our two people

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
were separeted from each other by the colonizer

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
they have always lived together

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.066
they speak the same language

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.000
the common name of Zangbeto

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.500
is Azu

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but there are different kinds of Zangbeto

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.000
which have specific names

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.000
such as Yagbano,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.000
Yagbadede

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
or even Abagnoke

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.000
we brought Sakote and Heyusu

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.500
when one talks about Zangbeto

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.500
he means the demonstration of their mystic powers

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
For instance, an egg

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
an egg can be laid there

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and someone is given a wood stick

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.200
even a big stick, too break the egg

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
this person can be a strong man, or even ten people

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
even if they want to break this egg

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.000
the egg will not break, he will only bounce

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Men live with its environment 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.000
and their society evolves

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
thus the Zanbgeto will obsiouly evolves as well

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.000
Last time, in a neighbouring society,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I saw a trick where a Zangbeto drove a motorbike!

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
We knew the telephone even before

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.000
the introduction of cellphones

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
because we have this power, with sacred statuettes

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.000
If I take a statuette

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.000
and somebody else, from distance, takes another one

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.000
we can talk and communicate remotely

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
these shows are public

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
people can see this

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Sometimes the Zangbeto is on a lagoon

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and he can move on this lagoon to reach the opposite shore

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
during this you can see how we communicate with the Zangbeto

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
You will see people on the opposite shore

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
who control the Zangbeto

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.200
with their statuettes

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
also you will see, on the shore

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.000
where the priest want the zangbeto to go

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.000
he goes there!

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
What is Voodoo?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
It is a breeze

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
when you repeat incantations

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.000
it comes alive

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
The African man always believes in something

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
knowing this, i personally believe that

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
when God created Men

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
he left something down here to have his power acknowledged.
