00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.570
This is a real thrill for us today because
a year ago we launched this project with the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.590
concept of a 1,000mph car inspiring kids,
but we had a lot of pieces missing. With the

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.449
car last year we had a concept that the research
said could do 1,000mph, it was technically

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.980
possible. In the last year / 13 months we’ve
moved from could to a design that we’ve

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.960
got a lot of evidence to say this car will
do 1,000mph and it will stay on the ground.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.950
A lot of people have commented on the potential
risk of driving a car at 1,000mph. I don’t

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.370
look at it like that. The only thing we need
to achieve is to be able to keep all four

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.080
wheels on the ground all the time. Given the
sort of computing power we’ve got available

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.030
with Intel as a sponsor, we’ve got more
computing power than the met office working

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.120
for us right now. With that kind of technology
we can predict with incredible accuracy what

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.260
is going to happen to the air flow all the
way through the speed range. We’ll know

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.600
that the wheels are going to stay on the ground
and once we do it will be safe to do that.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.240
I suspect that driving this car is going to
be something of an extreme experience. The

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.319
sheer physical demands of actually sitting
just underneath the jet intake where it will

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.859
be very, very noisy. A very small cockpit
so it’s going to be very hot and of course

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.170
we’re amplifying that effect by taking it
to a desert and then the sheer physical g-loads

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.270
of accelerating at up to 2.5g so 50mph per
second of acceleration will pin me heavily

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.959
back into the seat. That will last for about
45 seconds and at that point we will be doing

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:39.859
1,000mph. The measured mile will take 3.7
seconds at just over 1,000mph and at that

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.249
point I shut down the jet and the rocket and
then the drag of the car starts to slow it

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:51.350
down at 3g. If you can imagine driving a car
at 60mph down the road and stopping dead in

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.439
one second, that’s the sort of violence
of deceleration it’s going to feel like.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.560
So I’m going to have my work cut out for
that 100 seconds that it takes from stationary

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.599
to 1,000mph back to stationery covering ten
miles in 100 seconds, but I’m going to have

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.019
to work quite hard during that ride.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.860
We’ve
got four objectives really with all this.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.740
The first is to create a new generation of
engineers. The second one is basically to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.000
provide a project that the students and the
school kids can get into and really understand

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.390
and really learn from. The third one is to
get our 1,000mph record and the fourth is

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.020
to generate a lot of publicity for our sponsors.
So what sort of science are we using? It’s

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.690
physics and its maths so we’re in the area
of aerodynamics. What we are trying to do

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.110
is understand aerodynamics using computational
modelling, so we use big computers to solve

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.310
the complicated equations that describe aerodynamics
and using these big computers we can get numbers

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.120
out that tell us at this speed these are the
forces the car will experience. We’ve a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.900
long process to go through. Before we go to
South Africa and start testing there we’ve

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.790
got testing to do in the UK on a runway which
starts initially with commissioning the car

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.900
in the work shop. We then take the car to
an airfield and do tie down tests, so we tie

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.090
the car to the ground just like aircraft and
run the engines up and check that all of the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.510
systems are functioning and that we are in
control of the car. Once we’ve established

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.510
that the car’s good and we are in control
and it’s performing how we expect then we

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.620
all decamp to the desert in South Africa,
start at the speed we finished at and carry

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.400
on the development. Before running this car
it has to be as good as it can possible be.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.320
But there are questions marks. What will the
shock waves do to the desert floor? We don’t

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.010
quite know the answer to that. What will be
the influence of all the dust that will be

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.540
kicked up into the flow and entrained into
the flow? What’s the influence of that?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.620
We don’t really know the answer to that
question yet so as we go we will be exploring

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.960
and we will be answering some of these questions.
What we’ve developed is a model that tries

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.630
to understand how the dust that gets entrained
into the flow will affect the vehicle. Now

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.380
that has lots of spin-offs, for example aircraft
landing on wet runways kick up a lot of spray

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.069
into the aerodynamic flow around them, so
we can apply this technology to that once

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.150
we have finished working on Bloodhound. There
are lots of interesting little things that

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:19.040
could well spin-off into more real world applications.
We have 160 companies on the programme that

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.190
will grow to about 300 and all of them are
involved in making bits and pieces for the

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.590
car and all those parts arrive here and this
is where we stick it all together. And then

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.560
we’ve got to integrate the sponsors who
are making the parts with the schools. Can

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.980
Bloodhound SSC inspire the next generation
of engineers? I think so absolutely and we

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.250
are already seeing it. Part of the research
funding that we get fromEPSRC is to go into

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.980
schools and do public engagement work. You
go into a school and you tell them about a

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.430
supersonic car and you’ve got the kids engaged,
your teaching them about science and engineering

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.800
and they don’t even know it, so we are seeing
it happen already and certainly once this

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.070
vehicle is built and we run it on the desert
that’s going to be such a spectacular event.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.970
It can’t fail to inspire kids.
