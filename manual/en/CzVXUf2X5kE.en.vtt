00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:24.300
Angel of light, my protector,
here I am so much suffering.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:36.300
It calms down my heart,
broken with pain and disappointment.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.500
I'm here to help you.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.600
I'm your brother in evolution,
who can you count on.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.800
To overcome your lessons,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.300
I will guide you,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.300
I'll speak to you in dreams.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.400
Angel of good, watch over me.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.300
I fear my weeping is endless.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.500
I always repeat the same mistakes
and I end up returning to my exile.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.800
Courage, brother.
Renew yourself in faith.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.500
Keep the effort. For you I always wring.
Stand up.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.000
To comfort you in your trials,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.300
I will enchant you, tell of a new world of love.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.200
Angel of God, in good inspires me.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.500
Keep me from Evil and from lies.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:18.300
If I falter on my way,
remind me that I'm never alone.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.600
You know: I'll never get away

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.500
from your heart that, in prayer, comes to me.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.300
I am your friend, spiritual guide,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.000
to lead you to evolve the soul.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.300
Friends of good, we will always be,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.200
through the storm or in serene skies.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.400
The Greater Angel is the Heavenly Father,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.800
which of us all never forget.
