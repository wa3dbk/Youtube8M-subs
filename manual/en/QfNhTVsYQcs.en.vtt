00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:04.270
(cop show music)

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.474
- You're a naughty little girl,

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.076
and then I get closer to
the golden pot of honey,

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.779
and finally, when you're--

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.748 align:start size:88% position:13%
Finally my partner gives
me the wrap up sign,

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:15.982
so I blow my load in your face

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.917
and leave without
saying goodbye.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.753
- This is car 67,
- This is car 67,

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.121 align:start size:81% position:19%
- we're code five,
- code five,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:25.025 align:start size:97% position:3%
- nothing to report.
- we've got nothing to report.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.360
(saxophone)

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.170
(coughing)

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.514
(sigh)

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:49.983 align:start size:88% position:13%
(heavy sigh)
- What is your problem?

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.751
- I'm kinda having
a rough night here.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.286
- No a rough night is
sitting her for hours

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:54.854
listening to my partner wheeze.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.223
- It's not a wheeze,
it's a sigh, okay.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.658 align:start size:84% position:16%
Denise and I are
having some problems,

00:00:58.658 --> 00:00:59.926
and she said she
was gonna call--

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.194
- Woah, woah woah woah.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.896
You know the rules, Moses.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.165
No lady problems in the
car, this is a cop car,

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.234
this is our office, this
is our place of worship.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.838 align:start size:97% position:3%
- She's my wife, Chance,
it's not just lady problems.

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.039
- Okay, listen.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.541 align:start size:84% position:16%
I know all about
lady problems, okay?

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.644 align:start size:97% position:3%
No one has more lady problems
than me, and real ones.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.512 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You mean which half
Asian half Mexican model

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.047
you're gonna make love to?

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:23.083
- First of all, she's 3/4
Asian, 1/4 Mexican, okay?

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.852
Second of all, I don't tell you
a lot of my dating problems.

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:27.754 align:start size:84% position:16%
But since you're
asking, I was dating

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.456
this chick a few
months ago, okay.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:31.758 align:start size:88% position:13%
I took her to Catalina,
romantic getaway,

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.193
overnight on the boat.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:37.063 align:start size:84% position:16%
I woke up in the
morning, she was gone.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:38.798 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Did you call her?
- Yeah, multiple times.

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.533
- She just didn't want
to talk to you Chance.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.735
- No that's impossible, no,
that's not how it works.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:43.937
- When she got to Catalina, she

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.072 align:start size:97% position:3%
took another ferry, and left.
- No...

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:49.309
- This isn't a hard thing to
figure out, you're a detective.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.144 align:start size:97% position:3%
- She didn't get off the
boat, this is like a mystery.

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.112 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Have you done
anything to solve it?

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.646
- I tried, I sent her a text.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.081
- Okay, you wanna
hear real problems,

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.350
that I really have,
in my real life?

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.618
- What are those?

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.420
- My son calls me
Officer Packard.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.624 align:start size:84% position:16%
Not daddy, not father,
not even Moses.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:05.859
Officer Packard.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.227
- Oh, you mean your
son who loves you

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.828
and respects the fact
that you're a cop?

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.464
- He says if I hurry up and
get shot in the line of duty,

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.366
he can finally stop
lying to his teachers

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:16.569 align:start size:84% position:16%
about take your
parents to school day.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.872
- Okay, how about this?

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:21.708
I lost my virginity at
12 to a six-foot-four

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.176
field hockey chick.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.045 align:start size:88% position:13%
Big, beefy, domineering,
I had no experience

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.547
so I just did what I was told,

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.315 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I assumed that's
how sex worked.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.850
- So you're still?

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.019
- Yeah, I don't do a thing,
unless the girl tells me to.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.687
- I would love that,
I would love that.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:35.889 align:start size:72% position:28%
You know why?
- Why?

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.891 align:start size:88% position:13%
- My shrink tells me
I'm a sexual illiterate.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.159
- What does that even mean?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.227
- It means I can't
read sexual cues,

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.129 align:start size:81% position:19%
resulting in a
confused erection.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.597
- Oh that's just
made up and stupid.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.499
- Why don't you ask my wife
about my funeral boners?

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.501
Then tell me if it's
made up and stupid.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.103 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Why should I ask your
wife, I don't respect women

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.071 align:start size:94% position:6%
anyways because my mother
never taught me to.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:55.241
She was a hypochondriac,
locked herself in her room

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.578
23 hours, 15 minutes a day.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.880 align:start size:97% position:3%
She'd come out for 45
minutes to eat peanut butter

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.049
and banana sandwiches,
and you know what else?

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.651
She never hugged me, not once.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.286 align:start size:84% position:16%
She didn't touch me,
didn't caress me,

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.855
didn't even give me
a handshake, nothing.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.089
What are you doing?

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.357
- I'm trying to
show you my pain.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.194
- Oh you want some pain,
I'll show you some pain.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.196
- You wanna go, you wanna go?

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.597
- Yes!

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:19.299 align:start size:97% position:3%
- My dad used to put
cigarettes out on me, right?

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.633
This time, he used a cigar.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.068
- But that happens
to kids all the time.

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:23.903 align:start size:94% position:6%
- This was last Christmas.
- Wow.

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.171 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He thought I was
acting like a big shot

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.373
because I got a great
deal on a new Taurus.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.076
He felt his alpha status
was being threatened, so,

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:31.377
he did this!

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.112
- Oh, that's good!

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.814 align:start size:97% position:3%
Okay listen to this, I
dropped out of high school,

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.250 align:start size:94% position:6%
and lived on the streets,
I was so delusional,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.019
I thought I was living in
someone else's nightmare.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.190
I had to cut myself to
prove I was still alive.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:46.960
Look, that's for life.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.062
- Cutting? I have
the ultimate cut.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:53.199 align:start size:97% position:3%
I swore I would do anything
for my college girlfriend, so,

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.001
I gave her my kidney!

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.303 align:start size:97% position:3%
Yeah, and when she recovered
from her transplant,

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:58.871
she broke up with
me because I wasn't

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.441
a whole person anymore.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.209
I haven't been able to
trust a woman since.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.878
I even hide a wad of cash and
a passport at the train depot,

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.014
just waiting for my
wife to betray me.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.215
- You've got a bug out bag?

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:11.017 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You don't, what's
wrong with you?

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:11.918 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You wanna know
what's wrong with me?

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.086
- Yeah!

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:13.753 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'll tell you
what's wrong with me!

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.255
- Bring it!

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.924
- Look at this body, look at
this sculpted, muscular body.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.392
You know why I look like this?

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.294
Because I'm alone,
and I have nobody,

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.062
so I spend all my
time in the gym,

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.797
with my friends the barbells!

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.633
- I have an eating disorder!

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:27.767
- I eat my toenails!

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.202
- I resent my children!

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:31.437 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I resent your children,
and my children too!

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:32.705
- You don't have any children!

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.274
- Well I would if that
girl hadn't disappeared

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.975
off the boat in Catalina Island!

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:38.411 align:start size:94% position:6%
One of these days I'm
gonna shot on this street,

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.847 align:start size:88% position:13%
and at my funeral, no
one's gonna take my flag

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:42.315
because I have nobody!

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:45.118 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, I'm gonna take that
flag, I'm gonna take that flag

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.186
and put it on my mantle
in my studio apartment

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:50.089
when my family leaves me, and
I'm gonna look at it proud

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:52.925
when your gunned down
by a useless meth head!

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:53.893
- Is that what you're gonna do?

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:54.827 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Yeah!
- Are you sure?

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:55.628
- Yes!
- Really?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:56.829
- Yes!

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.998
(sobbing)

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.567
- [Radio] Attention all
units in the vicinity,

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.369
700 blocks Franklin Avenue.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.506 align:start size:94% position:6%
We have a 314 in progress,
indecent exposure.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:08.574 align:start size:88% position:13%
We've got reports of
two men, one overweight.

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.877 align:start size:97% position:3%
Suspects are crying and
yelling about crystal meth.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.445 align:start size:88% position:13%
May require
psychiatric assistance.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:15.782
- This is car 67, we got
everything under control.

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.451
We got everything under control.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.920
- Not everything.

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:23.523
- Sorry.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.024
Sexual illiteracy.
