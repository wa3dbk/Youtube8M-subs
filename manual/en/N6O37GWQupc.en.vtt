00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.770
My name is Lesley Neary.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.440
I am head of Performance Intelligence at Liverpool Community Health NHS Trust.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.670
Our business intelligence and data
warehouse solution is called Opera.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.400
And Opera stands for Organizational Performance Electronic Reporting Application.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.870
From the initial design I think the end
product came about really, really quickly

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.710
and that was as a result of me being
able to use annotative features.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.820
I think we use the application as part of the
development

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.270
so that really helped. And those whole process is really nice and quick. From design to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.310
implementation took us about two months.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.900
It's very quick to develop on.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.600
Our Opera Mobile using MicroStrategy has been really well received from front-line staff to board members.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.090
The benefit for the board is they get the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.059
assurance. They don't have to wait for the board meeting to have the papers.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.420
You know it's there, available in their own time.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.800
They can drill down and they're prepared to ask the right questions.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.100
We do want to promote the sustainability agenda so

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.400
to be able to reduce on our printing costs

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.889
the amount of paper that we use. It was fantastic that we could email one pack but

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:14.200
they can have all the information at their fingertips. It's not just information that's

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.310
given to you in a passive way, but you can work with it.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.700
One of the things I'm really keen to do is to get that linkage from

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.689
information that's reported to the board right through to front-line so that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.700
people can see their contributions to achieving organizational objectives.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.300
We have 60 services across 100 sites. 3500 staff.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.270
At LCH we're using transactional services to capture

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.600
real time patient experience feedback.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.100
We're moving towards having

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.990
mobile information for all of our clinical staff.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.919
It will enable the mobile device to become just a part of the tools or equipment, so

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:54.209
them having the right information at the right time

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.200
in the right format will improve the clinical quality they provide to patients

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.400
and avoid them coming back to a base to upload them onto a fixed computer.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.299
Having the app completely fits in with our mobile working.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.700
Nearly all of our clinicians now have some sort of mobile device

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.360
and it is about saving time, so that they can look after patients

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.000
and spend more time face to face with patients. And the app just adds to that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.200
So I've presented this application at a number of conferences

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.800
and I've shown it to colleagues across the NHS and outside the NHS as well.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.900
Lots of feedback is really positive. A lot of organizations have never seen anything quite as

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.760
intuitive. I'm just really proud of the Opera mobile

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.819
development. Not only does it look good, it works fantastically well.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.910
Just for the board

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.400
we recognize that we have less than a
one year payback in terms of the amount of paper

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.940
and the amount of time that we had compared to the cost of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.130
running the mobile devices. When we've looked at

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.100
developing mobile devices across our whole organization

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.600
we're looking at paybacks of less than three years.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.600
Our technology, innovation, and intelligence strategy

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.400
puts information at the heart of decision making. And Opera Mobile allows this to happen.
