Hi, my name is Grant Waite, from Waite Mayo
Golf.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.140
I'm here with my teaching partner Joseph Mayo,
and our student Dan.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.990
In this short little video tip, we're going
to act as though Dan is a slicer of the ball;

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.050
and today he's going to learn to draw the
ball for the very first time.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.460
Dan, if you'll address this ball for us please.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.400
Now guys remember real quickly on the ball
flight laws: remember, the ball's going to

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.890
start basically where the face is pointed,
and curves away from the path.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.230
So for Dan to get this ball to draw back to
the left some amount, we're going to put pieces

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.079
into his swing to push the path to the right.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.809
And the first thing we're going to do, Dan,
is this: I want you to feel like you've got

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.409
your weight extra forward; an inordinate amount
actually.

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.449
Remember guys, this is just a drill.

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.219
So you can see that Dan's hips are forward,
his left knee is flexed forward.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.979
The second thing that we're going to do is
we're going to push the handle gently forward,

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.100
and we're going to raise it up just a little.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.680
And when Dan hits the shot, he's going to
keep his weight forward, he's going to feel

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.431
the handle forward, and he's going to feel
his arms very straight through impact; and

00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:26.329
all of these pieces help push the path to
the right, which is going to help him draw

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.329
this ball.

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.200
Dan, hit a shot for us.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.229
Grant, how many yards did that ball draw?

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.270
That's a good 8 yard draw.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.490
So, right on cue, you did it.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.740
Okay, so remember—we're going to recap—this
is a drill.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.009
But remember, to draw the ball, we need a
rightward path.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.649
So we're going to have the weight forward,
we're going to have the handle forward, we're

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.240
going to raise the handle a little bit, and
we're also going to feel through impact that

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.930
the big thing is he's also going to keep raising
this handle going out; up like this.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.630
That's going to keep throwing the path out.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.080
Now, he's not going to try and draw the ball
by rotating the face, so he's going to keep

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.000
those wrists very stable.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.320
So we know that this drill—if you do that—you're
guaranteed to get a rightward path, which

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.380
is going to help you draw the ball.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.220
Absolutely; for Grant Waite—and for Dan—I'm
Joseph Mayo.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.160
Thank you so much for watching this video;
we know you're going to draw the ball.
