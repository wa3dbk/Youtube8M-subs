00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:10.160
And, now I'm going to teach you how to make
a rotator.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.240
Take your piece of card stock and make a base
page.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.140
Fold it in half.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.630
Match the edges.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.080
Crease down the middle and set it aside.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:36.649
Now we're going to take another sheet of card
stock and cut out a large rectangle.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.750
Fold it down the middle.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.980
Match the edges as close as possible.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.180
And trim them if they're a little uneven.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.379
So, now we have a layer.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.950
And for a rotator, we need a V-fold at the
top.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.510
So what we're going to do is we're going to
fold it back again down the center.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.220
And we're going to fold the top at an angle.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.680
Preferably 45 degrees.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.910
Crease it down.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.910
Unfold it.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.050
Now we've got a V-fold within the layer.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.090
And to fold it back you're going to take your
thumb and you're going to push that V-fold

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.420
back as you fold the layer.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.040
And, crease it down well.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.320
And that's the first step of a rotator.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.180
Now we're going to take the base page.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.120
We're going to line up the center lines.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:48.710
We're going to tape down the edges.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.952
And now we've got our V-fold and layer.

00:01:56.952 --> 00:02:11.820
And, now what we're going to do, we're actually
going to cut a circle out of cardstock.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.959
Make them roughly an inch and a half.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:23.750
So, now what we're going to do is, we're going
to make a cut in the center to the top.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.209
And then, what we're going to do is we're
going to make a fold, roughly at about four

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.209
o'clock.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.629
If you imagine the circle as the clock face,
we've got noon, three, four and five.

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.840
So, we're going to make a fold in between
four and five.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.180
So, let's cut the top half to the center.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.469
We're going to fold this back.

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:59.799
And there we have the second piece of our
rotator.

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.840
So, take your base page with the V fold and
layer.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.730
And, we're going to take a bit of double stick
tape.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:16.930
And, we're going to take the double stick
tape and put it on one half of the V-fold.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.040
Make sure it stays within the v.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.599
Now we're going to take our circular piece.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:33.400
So, the smaller tab that we just folded, we're
going line up the edge and the center with

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.959
the center point and edge of the v on the
layer.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.840
So, let's line that up.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.981
Push it down and close it.

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:50.849
And now you have a rotator.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.469
Mine sticks out a little bit.

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.219
So, if it does, you can just untape it.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:01.060
You can just trim down the edges, really quickly.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.709
That way your popups stay within the base
page.

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.939
And your viewer gets the full element of surprise.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:11.169
That's all pop ups are.

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:19.270
You're surprising people with movement, with
something that literally jumps off the page.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.890
So, there's your rotator.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.750
And that's how we make rotators.
