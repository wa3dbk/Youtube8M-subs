00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.820
Leo and a Helicopter

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.400
Look, there are so many big vehicles in the playground! Do you know who constructed them?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.900
Leo, what are you going to assemble today?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.900
A helicopter!

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.400
Let’s begin with a cabin,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.900
put a seat for a pilot

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.800
a control panel,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.540
And what is this? Ah, I see, a special stick to steer the helicopter,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.700
a cabin window

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.300
and these are skids for the helicopter to land

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.700
a tail boom

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.560
a big propeller

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.220
Leo, what’s missing?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.100
The small propeller
that must be fixed on the tail.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.600
Can you look for it, Leo?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.500
What a mess!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.400
There’s no propeller here.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.700
I think we’ve found it!

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.700
Oh-oh! Leo, it suits you perfectly well!

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.400
But we should put the propeller in its place.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.200
Wonderful! Well done! Where will we fly?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.700
Ah, the helicopter set the slide right! Thank you!

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.900
And thank you, Leo, for constructing the helicopter!
