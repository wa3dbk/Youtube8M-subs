I everyone this is Breanna Rutter from howtoblackhair.com
and in this video I'm going to be talking

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.160
about a very hot controversial topic that
is ongoing in the hair community and the question

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.159
is does prenatal pills help promote and encourage
hair growth so throughout this video I will

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:26.800
first of all you the facts about what prenatal
pills do for your hair and then I'll give

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.490
my opinion as to whether or not it actually
grows your hair so a prenatal pill is basically

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.250
a multivitamin designed for pregnant women
when they take this prenatal pill this is

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.450
helping encourage the babies growth and also
supply nutrients and minerals to the mom so

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.090
when they take prenatal pills it's just a
vitamin giving them what they need and also

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.070
giving them more iron and different things
that will help the baby in the developmental

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.839
process so instead thinking of it as the hair
growth pill or a nail growth pill its just

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.219
simply a multivitamin that's giving a woman
who is bearing a child the nutrients that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.090
she needs so on saw on my stance about whether
or not prenatal pills actually encourage hair

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.189
growth or make your hair grow maybe will differ
from yours because there are some people who

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.740
teeter totter on entire on either side of
the fence and say yes taking prenatal pills

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.390
will help you grow your hair better than what
you can do yourself and then some people will

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.969
say no its just of vitamin and its just giving
extra nutrients to the rest of your boy and

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.289
I seem to agree with the latter I believe
that its simply just a vitamin that is going

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.740
to deliver more nutrients and minerals to
your extremities so if you already have a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.329
healthy lifestyle you eat healthy you are
helping your hair in return will be able to

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.899
have more vitamins more nutrients more water
more of the things that it needs the more

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.819
healthy like to eat you’re the better it
is for your nails hair and skin to be more

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:10.660
vibrant and healthy so in my opinion by taking
a prenatal pill this is giving your body more

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.420
vitamins to work with once your main organs
have received all that it needs the rest are

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.250
simply move onto your outer appearance like
your skin hair and nails so on one side you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.560
can say okay so since there's extra vitamins
and minerals this makes your hair grow I think

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.660
it makes your hair grow and you nothing makes
your hair grow and I hope you're not whoa

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.610
I hope you don't click on the video because
hair growth is nothing you can control it’s

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.680
your body's responsibility in your body's
response to whatever is going on to push out

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.100
cells from your scalp which look like hair
in which hair so there is no magic being that's

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.970
going to make grow your hair your hair is
growing without any help whatsoever so by

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.040
taking prenatal pills or by simply taking
a multivitamin you're able to give more nutrients

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.750
to your hair because you're giving more nutrients
to your body so I think prenatal pills help

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.930
promote hair growth yes and no your hair if
growing to growth your scalp regardless of

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.260
what you do hair going to continue to grow
by taking vitamins this may in some way help

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.810
promote hair grow by delivering more nutrients
to your scalp so of course the topic will

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.800
go on and on about whether or not prenatal
pills are helpful for hair and I don't think

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.940
it's going to make your hair grow a small
way it probably can help further your hair

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.650
growth I hope a this video is helpful please
