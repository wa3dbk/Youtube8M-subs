00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.880
Hi I'm Isabelle

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.900
I'm a makeup artist here at Cirque du Soleil.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.980
I've been working here for about 11 years.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.640
I'm in charge of the makeup team in Montreal

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.220
and we'll be doing some small videos for you

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.640
to show a bit of our techniques.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.300
So hopefully you will enjoy.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.060
Today we'll be showing you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.580
some nice blending techniques.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.640
Here at Cirque we use a lot of colors

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.620
and we always want to make sure

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.480
that they are seamless.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.820
So we'll be working on Kevin today

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.880
and you can follow along.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.000
When you want to do a nice blending

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.260
you want to make sure you start out with creams

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.840
That will make it much easier for you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.320
and have much better results.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.440
We'll start with our sponge

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.640
and since she's very pale

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.280
I'm gonna darken her just a little bit

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.680
so that we have nice contrast.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.020
Make sure you always come down the neck

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.900
to make sure there's no lines.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.140
So we'll start with this.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.240
New color new sponge.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.560
This is super firm, this is just a little bit flimsy

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.040
so I'm gonna have a nice application with this side.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.100
And now since I want something that is super white

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.900
no streaks, I'm gonna dab.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.280
Go all in the nooks and crannies.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.380
Look up.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.080
Kevin has some nice dark eyebrows

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.020
so just to make sure that they're covered

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.740
we will take here synthetic brush

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.440
some of our white will go right in there.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.400
Come back a little bit with my sponge.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.880
Mascara brush.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420
Kinda just lightly coat them.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.060
Ok so we'll start our blending

00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:42.207
So you want to go to the edge of the two colors

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.540
and really just dab along

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.100
and you want to create kind of a mid color.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.320
You always want to have the center of your face

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.440
that is the whitest

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.860
because that's where the light is hitting.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.680
If you want nice, clean, sharp lines

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.900
again we'll get a synthetic brush

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.840
way easier because it's flat.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.920
You load up your brush

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.320
on both sides.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
So we'll start, we'll do a nice cheek.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.140
I want the bottom to be very neat.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.720
For the upper side I will leave it for right now.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.280
Now I will go with some yellow.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.840
I'm gonna blend both colors together.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.920
So try to create a nice orange.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.800
When you're working with creams

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.220
it's very easy to correct if you make a mistake.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.380
So don't be afraid to go over.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.900
So what now you can do

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.720
you take back white sponge

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.977
and you just kinda phase your yellow out.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.260
This is the tricky part

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.020
You just wanna make sure

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.400
turn your sponge around

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.680
and you just wanna kind of finish it.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.154
So now we'll do something around the eyes

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.980
Again synthetic, flat brush

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.380
And now I will use a little bit of a bushy kind of brush

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.860
and I'll go back with my yellow

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.035
very lightly and I'll kinda create a little bit of green.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.300
When there's too much on my brush

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.156
what I do I just wipe it there.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.180
Close your eyes.

00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:35.798
And just come and finish off this line here. 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.480
And that's how we do our blending here at Cirque

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.200
I shall finish it and show you

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.420
what the end result will be.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.160
So now you have it

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.140
this is our final look.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.340
We jazzed it up a little bit

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.180
added some eye shadows

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.600
and some eyeliner.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.040
You can also do this at home for you.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.620
Blending it's quite easy

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.949
you can use it even in beauty makeups

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.860
you can use it for stage makeup

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.180
and theater and anything you want

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.320
even for Halloween.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.480
and the word of the day is dab.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.920
