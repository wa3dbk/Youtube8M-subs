Hi, my name's Gino Sorbillo

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.500
our family history about pizza is 3 centuries old

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
today I'll show you how to make the traditional Neapolitan "calzone"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500
Now let's make the first step of dough making

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for this step I've prepared 6l of tap water

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
10gr of yeast

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
flour 00 - red quality type flour by Molino Caputo

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.500
on 6l of water we are going to use 10kg of flour

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.500
and then we have some natural "criscito" of which we use 200gr

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Once the dough gets compact, we start to cut it in portions

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The second step is the pizza rolling and stuffing

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
let's take the stuffing ingredients, usually the ricotta never misses

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
let's put some cheese, 
in this case half buffalo milk fiordilatte or a plain one

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
then some "salame Napoli" according to tradition

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
As we have put salami that releases sapidity, mind not add any salt

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
then let's add some tomato on top

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
or we can leave it plain just with a drizzle of oil and some grated cheese

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
but in this case, according to tradition,
 I add some San Marzano tomato

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
add a fresh basil leaf wet with tomato to prevent it gets burnt

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The third step is the baking in the traditional wood oven

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.000
As the stuffing ingredients must be cooked inside, 
we need a kind of baking that goes through, less strong, 
different from the traditional pizza kind of baking
