00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.230
Hi. It's Paul Andersen and this
is disciplinary core idea ESS2E. It's on biogeology.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.759
And that's really how the life on our planet
interacts with the planet itself. And so again

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.000
in summary there are four spheres on our planet.
We have the geosphere which is going to be

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.050
the planet itself. We have the hydrosphere
which is going to be the water. And the atmosphere

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.529
which are the gases on the surface. And so
in this diagram, where these three things

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.840
come together, like right where, we're going
to have the biosphere. That's going to be

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.770
where the life is on our planet. It's where
these three spheres come together and allow

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.120
life to exist. And so you can see how these
three things could effect life, but could

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.030
life ever effect the other three? For sure.
And that interaction between the two, especially

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.490
the earth and life is going to be biogeology.
So what's an example of that? Cyanobacteria

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.450
are bacteria. They've been around for billions
of years. And when they started doing photosynthesis

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.790
on our planet, they started producing oxygen.
And that oxygen on our planet started making

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.710
rock that was red. It was rusting. And so
we saw these banded rock found within the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.710
planet. And so the life was actually shaping
the rock itself. Or changing the rock itself.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.740
The carbon cycle is a great example to see
how life is interacting with the planet itself.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.000
And so as we go through photosynthesis, we're
taking carbon from the atmosphere and actually

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.920
making sugar out of it. And as we do respiration,
we're returning some of that into the atmosphere

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.159
as carbon dioxide. As we start to burn fossil
fuels we're taking carbon that was locked

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.870
away in the earth. And we're releasing it
into the atmosphere. And that's going to change

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.440
the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and even the
earth itself. And bacteria are incredibly

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.540
important in this as well. And they're important
in the nitrogen cycle. And so really the message

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.840
I'm trying to get is that we have landforms
on our planet, the geosphere. And we have

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.650
life forms on our planet. And so as the landforms
change, as we change our planet, the life

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.230
has to respond to that. And so what the life
does is evolve. And the land will change again.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.499
And the life will change again. So they're
linked together. And so how do you teach this

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:22.609
progression. Well in the lower elementary
grades we want to talk about life, plants

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:28.260
and animals. And we are animals for sure.
What do we need? Well we need land to live

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.260
one. We need air to breathe. And then we need
water. And so as we take all of these things

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.650
in, we also change them as well. So we're
changing our environment. And we're doing

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:49.669
that by plowing the fields. As we chop down
trees. As we use the water and as we put into

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.859
the atmosphere, we're changing our environment.
And so as we move into the upper elementary

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.450
grades we want to explain to our students
that living things affect the environment.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.900
And so here's a great couple of examples.
And so as plants start to live, the put roots

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.760
into the soil. And that's going to hold the
soil in place. It's going to hold water in

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.239
the soil as well. And so by adding life, we're
actually stabilizing that soil. Beavers for

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.849
example can build dams. And they're going
to change the flow of the water or that hydrosphere

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.040
on the geosphere. And as we build dams we're
going to do the same thing. As you move into

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.809
middle school you want to talk about landforms
changing. And sometimes that's gradual and

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:36.749
sometimes it's dramatic. So meteor impact
like this could be dramatic change to the

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:42.019
landforms. We could have volcanism. So volcanoes
could change the landforms as well. And once

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.419
we have that change then the life forms have
to evolve. And so what's an example of that?

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.340
Well dinosaurs are a great example of that.
They lived on our planet for millions and

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.120
millions of years. And they went extinct relatively
shortly. Why was that? We had changes to the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.510
landforms. We had a meteor impact, an asteroid
impact and that changed the climate. And they

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.120
couldn't adapt. But certain organisms could.
And a group called the mammals did really

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.489
well and started to fill some of the niches
that were at one time filled by the dinosaurs.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.430
And also as we talk about middle school, students
should understand that the life can actually

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.430
change the earth. And so this idea of cyanobacteria
changing the earth. Adding oxygen to the atmosphere.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.379
And adding oxidation to the rock is important.
And I read that bacteria can even help in

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:36.180
the formation pyrite or fool's gold. I think
that's really really cool. And then as we

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.220
get into high school we want them to understand
this whole idea of coevolution. That the landforms

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.870
on our planet will constantly be changing.
As they do, life forms have to evolve in response

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.559
to that. But it's a never ending story. And
I hope that was helpful.
