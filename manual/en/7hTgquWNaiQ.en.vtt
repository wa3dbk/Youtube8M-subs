00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.550
Hello, and welcome to
Gill Street Accommodation.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.924
The great thing
about Gill Street

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:10.800
is that we're centrally
located in the city.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.330
So we have the
best of everything.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.690
As well as that, we
are in a very secured,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.494
gated, community-- sort of like
your LA-style kind of thing.

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:19.660
Why don't you come inside,
and I'll show you around?

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.534
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:26.560
Now that you've
seen the outside,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.800
let me show you where
you could be living.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.286
Come see my flat.

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:32.020
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.020
So, welcome to my flat.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.395
So we have a nifty
intercom here.

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:38.686
So, you know, when somebody
calls you from the outside,

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:40.200
you can just buzz them in.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.476
Let me show you the kitchen.

00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:43.380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.590
There's a nice bit of
cleaning space here, you know,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.334
so you can wash
up all your stuff.

00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:50.000
We've got freezing freezers, and
a nice, little, cooking station

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.375
here-- you know, when you want
to get your chef on--

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:53.965
my friend is here.

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:55.550
You've got loads of cabinets--

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.260
keep your stuff
everywhere here, really.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.214
And even look, you've
got flat mates here.

00:00:59.214 --> 00:00:59.880
What's up, guys?

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.092
[LAUGHS] I won.

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:05.375
Oh, man.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.190
So that's the kitchen.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.350
Let me show you my humble abode.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.000
So this is my room.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.826
Let me show you the en suite.

00:01:12.826 --> 00:01:16.316
So, you've got your shower,
mirror, the works, really.

00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:18.566
So you don't have to be
queuing up in the morning.

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.140
As well as that, you've got
your bed and a nice, little work

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.990
space when you want
to do your work.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.960
WiFi's really quick--
broadband-like, actually.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.800
Saves me time.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.520
Ah, hang on.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.216
I've got something to do.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.560
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.815
So, this is one of our
twin studios-- bigger room.

00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:37.420
It comes with two desks.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.040
You have your own suite--

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.000
a kitchen in your room, as well.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.560
And, you know, it's a very,
very luxurious space--

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.520
great for socialising.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.540
And it's more cost-effective.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.100
What's up, Bill?

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.202
So if you don't want
to share facilities,

00:01:51.202 --> 00:01:52.660
you can opt for
one of our studios,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.990
which comes with your
en suite bathroom.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.900
And hey, look, you even
have your own kitchen

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.140
in your own room.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.640
So you could cook
while you're here.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.139
Nifty, huh?

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.445
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:03.352
Hey, Bella.

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:03.852
Nice room.

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:06.200
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.430
We also have a laundry on-site.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.910
Yes, ladies and
gentlemen, this is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.834
prime, city-centre, real estate.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:14.250
We've come to the
end of our tour.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.347
I hope you enjoyed
it, because I did.

00:02:16.347 --> 00:02:17.930
So when you are
picking accommodation,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.460
I hope you'll pick Gill
Street, because, in my opinion,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.710
it's the best NTU has to offer.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.060
