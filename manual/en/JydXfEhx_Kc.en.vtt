00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.170
Today we are doing a review on the ultimate
bubble that is longer lasting,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:24.110
touchable and you can stack them!

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.130
Mothers corn bubbles are Non-toxic, fun, smart
and eco-friendly bubble blowing toy and solution.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.239
The Bubble solution is unique and made of
natural cellulose, which is extracted from

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.329
trees, that is generally used for medical
or food additives in ice cream or bread.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.190
when you buy Mother's Corn bubbles you get
the solution, you get the Mothers Corn signature

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.350
bubble blowing tool and you also get this
tray.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.289
The tray and the tool are uniquely made of
PLA (poly Lactic Acid which is derived from

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.970
renewable resources like corn start.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.660
and is biodegradable, antibacterial and BPA
free, containing no environmental hormones,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.300
carcinogens or heavy metals yet they are both
really durable.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.140
I'm yet to meet a child who does not love
bubbles so lets show you the Mothers corn

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.690
bubbles in action.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.070
(voiceover) To get started just pour solution
into 1/2 way into the tray, dip your bubble

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.280
blowing tool into the solution, and you puff
lightly.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.300
We found the bubble blowing tool very effective
for our testers to exhale into and create

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.000
quite a lot of bubbles without much effort
vrs some of your traditional bubble wands.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.770
the bubble tool also has a built in liquid
reflux system to prevent liquid back flow

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.099
so if your little one should tilt up their
head whilst blowing they should not get any

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.099
solution in their mouth.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:44.500
Now for a more up close look at the bubbles,
we found these bubbles are really long lasting

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.780
so you will tend to find quite a few un-poped
bubbles for quite some time after you have

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.780
actually blown them.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.730
Now once you have got them blown its time
to have a lot of fun and stack or catch the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.940
bubbles, all you just need to do is wait until
the rainbow coloured bubbles turn white then

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.110
have fun seeing how many you can stack.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.460
Pros:
the Bubble blowing tool makes lots of bubbles

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.550
&amp; is really simple even for your younger children.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.920
Its a great design with the inbuilt liquid
reflux system to stop back flow

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.300
Very long lasting bubbles
The solution does go a long way so is value

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.950
for money and less topping up for the kids.
and the Eco friendly nature of this product

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.870
is really great and safe for your kids.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.030
and the Cons: Its a hard one to have Cons
with Bubbles but lets face it, it gets messy

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.500
when kids are involved and
The solution is very sticky, almost has a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.400
glue like texture once it starts to dry so
be aware where your going to have your bubble

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.050
fun and what the bubbles will be landing on.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.340
