00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.320
MAN [SINGING]: With skin you can
touch, with skin you can feel,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.161
and when you get hurt,
you're skin can heal.

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.180
Skin can stretch,
and skin can grow.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.609

It covers nose, and
it covers my chin.

00:00:20.623 --> 00:00:24.102
I moves when I smile,
and it makes me grin.

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:30.889

Skin can be old,
and skin can be new.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.520
Skin can be rough.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.440
Skin can be smooth.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.592

colors, there's so many shades.

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:48.502

It's how you were made.

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.448
You come in your color.

Butterscotch, bronze,
or a copper glow.

00:01:11.047 --> 00:01:14.041
Skin of alabaster,
skin like peach.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.201
Skin that's golden
as a sunny field.

toffee, skin of ebony.

Skin's got color,
and skin's got tone.

00:01:27.514 --> 00:01:30.508
You put on that cover because
that skin is your own.
