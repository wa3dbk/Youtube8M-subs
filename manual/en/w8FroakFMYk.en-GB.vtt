00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.019
Back in 2011 - June to be exact - I sat down
for dinner with Chris Froome after a British

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.610
National Championships where neither of us
had finished and in fact neither of us had

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.920
a contract for 2012. Since then, our careers
have gone in very different directions. One

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.269
has gone on to become an internationally recognised
global superstar, while the other one, well

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.720
he won the Tour de France.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.199
Anyway, today I've got the privilege on the
final rest day of the Vuelta of going along

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.150
with Team Sky for their rest day ride and
I'm going to catch up with Chris Froome, find

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.510
out how the legs are and just have a bit of
a chat.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.860
Of course, for you the Tour was such a huge
objective which you've been thinking of for

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.600
the 11 months from the preceding one. When
that's over after 5 days, how hard is it to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.350
pick yourself up and make a new goal like
that and work towards it?

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.350
Yeah, it was really tough. Initially when
it happens I almost get this feeling that

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.759
you can just write this season off now. It's
a big step back - broken wrist, broken hand,

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:17.279
I had to take some time off. Even once I got
back into it I had to ride around with a splint

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.620
and stuff, I just...a lot of me thought that
was probably my season done. Then after a week

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.170
of sitting on my arse at the house it felt
like actually no, OK, I can still get something

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.420
out of this season, even if it's just to set
me up for next season.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.390
How important is that? It's something a lot
of riders talk about, getting three weeks

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.100
of back-to-back racing and they miss it if
they don't do that for one year.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:56.880
I think it is pretty big. It is pretty important
to get that big three week race in the legs.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.180
It's been a pretty hard experience coming
to this Vuelta and racing when I'm not 100%,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.560
but I really do think it's going to give me
a lot of base work for next year.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.630
It must almost feel quite nice coming back
to this race though, because it's not exactly

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.580
where it all began but certainly in terms
of...

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:31.800
I do love the Vuelta. The Vuelta is a special
race. It really is for the pure cycling enthusiast

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.870
I think who follows the Vuelta, because of
the harshness of the conditions, the climbs.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:49.730
In terms of the racing I think it really isn't
far off very very top level, so it's best

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.530
of both worlds I think in that respect.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.140
I've got a sub-standard bike, I've got no
numbers to look at - I thought Sky was all

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.860
about numbers!

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.360
And I've got a bottle, I don't know how I'm
supposed to drink anything from that.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.680
Come on Dan, stop whinging!

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.560
How many kilometres have we done?

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.280
About...3!

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.180
All uphill though!

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.500
Right, well we're on the obligatory cafÃ©
stop for a recovery ride. I think I'm going

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.160
to make this a 'no mic' zone, I don't want
to piss them off.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.000
How much time do you spend at home on a time
trial bike when you're training?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.500
I try and do one or two rides a week on it.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.760
Long rides, or short ones with intervals?

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.480
Generally recovery rides, or shorter ones...

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.040
Literally just a case of just getting yourself
in that position?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.371
Yeah, just getting into that position and
being comfortable in that position.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.200
Do you find it easy or are you someone that
has to do stretching to make sure you're comfortable

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.290
in that low position?

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:43.030
I always stretch but not particularly for
time trialling or anything.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.460
I think on the TT bike in general, the more time you
can spend on it, the more comfortable you're

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.160
going to be in that position.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.160
It must be pretty nice when you're on the
back of a train when you look at guys like

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.780
Kosta and Kiri and Deignan and Mikel, all
these guys in the team, that must be quite

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.650
something looking ahead and thinking 'these
guys are working for me'.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.580
I get so excited sitting on the back sometimes,
watching the race getting faster and faster

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.130
and seeing them basically build up to speed...

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.720
...But are you nervous about that? Are you
just concentrating on your job or are you

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.290
thinking 'Christ, I don't want to let these
guys down after all that'!

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.460
Yeah, exactly. I don't want to disappoint
them, I know how hard they've worked to put

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.940
me in this position. I want to think of them
on the bus after the race watching and thinking

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:59.320
'Right, Chris did what he said he was going
to do.' We've got a really cool group of guys

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.080
here, really cool group. Everyone just gets
on with it.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.360
Thanks very much to Chris Froome for your
time on your rest day. Sorry to have disturbed

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.060
your ride, but good luck for the rest of the
race.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.910
Awesome, thanks a lot.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.220
This is Sean, he's the coach from Team Sky
who allowed us to come along today. I just

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.790
wanted to say thank you very much, it's a
real privilege to have joined them on the

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.280
ride. Do you think Dave B will be giving me
a job shortly?

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.120
For sure. I hope Chris didn't give you
too hard a time up the mountains.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.780
To be honest, I felt like I was giving him
a hard time, that's why I'm asking about the job.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.340
That's a worry, isn't it?!

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.120
One last thing, where do I go for my massage?

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.040
Chris Froome's room in 303!

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.060
What are you laughing at?! No seriously, thank
you very much indeed.
