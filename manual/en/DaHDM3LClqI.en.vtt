00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.260
hello everyone welcome to galaxy note 2
tips and tricks episode seven i have

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.559
two quick tips for today so let's get
started

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.109
so the first tip is i'm sure you
probably have seen flashlight apps

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.119
for the galaxy note 2

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.770
or any galaxy devices you could just use it
as a flashlight

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.180
and i wanna show you that you
could have three different intensities

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.369
on this uh... flash

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.839
and you know just in case you may
need it maybe you're a photographer just

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:29.839
needing

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.769
the exact

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.790
amount of light for your photos
who knows

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.660
one is called assistive light and
this is it comes with your phone

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.610
and if you go to widget

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.840
there's an assistive light whidget

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.309
and when you turn this on

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.220
gives you the weakest
LED light

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.650
that is possible

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.760
the other one is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.010
an app from the marketplace
so let me show you how to get it

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.260
so search for a flashlight in the
googleplay store and then you're

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.610
going to see

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.930
Tiny Flashlight + LED

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.720
just install it but don't open
the app

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.940
for example if you open the app
directly

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.160
this is what it's going to look like

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.760
you have to open the app
you have to push this button

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.440
but that's not how you want to use it

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.330
so go to the widgets and you want
to add it as a widget so you're going to

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.549
find

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.710
flish light one by one

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.510
and add that to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.900
to your home screen and just choose one
of these icons doesn't really

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.950
matter

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.560
for the strongest amount of
flashlight

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.620
for the strongest amount of
flashlight

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.010
you're going to

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.480
hit that

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.490
 that widget's installed

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.770
interesting thing happens when you have
them

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.270
both on

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.320
it's kinda produces medium level

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.420
so for example

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.760
this is

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.400
the intensity uh... I guess one
and this is

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.109
intensity

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.989
three

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.199
but if you have both on it's like
intensity two

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.779
that's interesting
maybe there are some uses

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.599
even though it might be very small

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:22.979
just fun to know

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.589
let's move on to the
second one the second one i want to talk

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.510
about

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.230
what is it swipe

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.889
or captain to do a screen capture on
the device

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.889
and let me show you less common
away that you've seen and a lot of

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.929
people seem to have a problem finding
this so i wanted to go over it

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:46.079
but if you want to do a screen capture
to hit this button and this is the home

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.359
button the power in the home but they
simultaneously and then hold

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.679
let me demonstrate

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.259
simultaneously and hold

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.819
there you go
took a snapshot

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.529
people have a hard time
figuring this out because

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.430
if they came from adroid 2.3

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.489
you have to hold the power button

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.939
for like a half second and had to hold

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:13.939
home button

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.680
and then it took a snapshot if you didn't
simultaneously it didn't work

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.139
so people got used to that

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.209
that way of doing it and then they
upgraded to adroid 4.0

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.139
they couldn't hit the screen capture

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.349
so i thought i'd just cover it that the
other way and i'm sure you've seen it in

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.559
the commercials

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:34.390
it's this swip 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.049
you could swip

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.779
or you could swip the other way doesn't really matter

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:44.459
then you could actually do it
landscape mode as well

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.849
probably best use a finger

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.620
I guess just out of curiosity

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.059
you could do it from the bottom using a
finger

00:03:56.059 --> 00:04:00.429
that all seems to work just fine
and actually  i do tend to use that

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:05.039
swip to capture a lot more often now

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.949
and I think it is because

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.519
sometimes you're in a rush to capture
something and

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.099
swip is for some reason
a lot easier to remember so I think

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.739
it is a big improvment

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:20.859
let me just make sure it show you how

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.820
to enable swip just in case doesn't work
for you

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.439
so in the settings

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.729
the home and then go to settings

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.379
scroll all the way down and you'll see

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:32.509
motion

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.030
they make sure you have motion enabled
and then

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.220
i'm going to see on the bottom

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.180
palm swip  to capture so make sure that
it's on

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.779
sure work just fine

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.060
so that is all i have for today

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.729
tomorrow i have a small treat for you guys
I'm going to show you what it looks like

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:49.649
in

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:54.430
inside samsung as service
center it's kinda like

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.860
genious

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.149
in a apple store it said that is 
samsung's

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:02.860
kinda like simpson's version but it is
only for i guess

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.059
