Hi, I am Mary Alexander from Home Instead
Senior Care.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.880
And today I am going to share with you some
tips for senior caregiving during the festive

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.560
and busy holiday season.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.890
But first, let's talk about holidays in general.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.980
Holidays are supposed to be times of joy,
celebration and rest.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.750
But in reality, the holidays can feel like
a roller coaster with emotions running high

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.010
as your gas tank is on low.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190
There are just two many things to do.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.140
There are presents to shop for, decorations
to hang, holiday treats to bake and family

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.070
gatherings to organize, and then we need to
think of our senior loved ones and how to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.760
provide the best care for them over the holiday
season.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.679
With everything we have to do over the holidays,
we can feel stressed out.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:11.910
But according to experts, the main reason
for holiday stress is having unrealistic expectations.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.930
From the time we are children, we build up
expectations of what the holiday should be.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.540
In the media, we see perfect images of family,
friends, food, parties and gifts.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.390
What we fail to see is that these are staged
scenes.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.920
We may all aspire to be Mark Stuart but the
reality will probably be less than perfection.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.140
What we have to realize over the holidays
is that there is nothing wrong with falling

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.390
short of perfection.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.530
So, I would like to share with you a few things
we can do to manage expectations and make

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.580
the holidays fun, all while minimizing stress
for caregivers and their families.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.340
In this video series, we will discuss holiday
travel and shopping, gift giving and family

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.340
gatherings.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.640
In addition, we will talk about specific things
you can do to help your senior loved ones

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.540
to beat the holiday blues.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.150
Home Instead Senior Care, a national leader
in providing home care services for seniors

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.189
is bringing you this video series to help
family caregivers during the holidays.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.739
Helping seniors is something Home Instead
has been doing passionately now for more than

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.550
15 years.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.659
I not only work for Home Instead but I am
a certified senior advisor.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.819
More importantly, I am currently a long distance
caregiver for my dad and I spent several months

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.020
caring for my mom locally.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.569
Let's start talking about some of the best
ways for caregivers to prepare for the holidays.
