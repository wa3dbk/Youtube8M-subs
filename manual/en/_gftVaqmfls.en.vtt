00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.840
Hi Guys! I'm Laura Vitale

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.740
On this episode of 'Laura in the Kitchen', I'm going to show you how I make my chocolate cupcakes

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.780
They are super simple and easy to do

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.620
Um...you should always have one cupcake recipe that's basic. I've showed you how to make a vanilla one. This is my chocolate one.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.160
So before we get started of course we need to go over the ingredients so let's do it!

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.840
Your gonna need some: All purpose flour, some cocoa powder, brown sugar, granulated sugar, unsalted butter at room temperature, buttermilk

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.500
an egg, some salt, baking soda, baking powder, instant expresso powder, and vanilla extract.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.760
That's it super simple and easy. Now first thing you wanna do is get your oven to 350. Get that ready.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.880
Second thing you wanna do is take your muffin liner or your muffin pan and just put in the little liners

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.400
Just like that so nothing sticks and comes out easy

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.600
Now for the butter milk. If you can't find that at your local supermarket, you can make your own

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.640
Just go to my website at www.laurainthekitchen.com and go take a look at my recipe on how to make your own buttermilk

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.300
It's not like how to make exactly exactly butter milk but it's a great substitute if you can't find it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.800
So. Hey there you go. Simple and easy.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.800
Now. The instant espresso powder in this recipe is totally optional. I just think it makes the chocolate taste even better

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.100
But one thing that's very crucial-I know I'm gonna get a lot of questions for this so I'm gonna answer it right now

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:42.480
For the cocoa, it has to be pure cocoa powder. It cannot be the instant or the hot chocolate packet. It cannot be that.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.620
It has to be pure cocoa that's it. So if you wanna ask the question, I've already answered it for you

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.580
So now we're gonna get started. In this bowl, I'm going to add in the butter

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.340
It's really important that it's at room temperature

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.620
And the brown sugar and the granulated sugar

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.020
And using a whisk I'm just gonna cream these together. That looks great!

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.340
Now to this I'm going to add in my egg

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.060
And a splash of vanilla. Bout a teaspoon

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.440
Now if you don't wanna use brown sugar, you can just substitute with just a whole cup of granulated sugar. I'm using 3/4 of a cup of granulated sugar

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.680
and a 1/4 cup of brown sugar because I like that sort of molassy taste it gives to the cupcake but

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.960
that's totally optional. Again just use whatever you have on hand. Just mixing this together.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.180
Now I'm going to add my dry ingredients. I'm just gonna quickly mix them together

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.500
It doesn't have to be perfect at all

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.840
These are gonna go right in

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.020
And I'm just going to start mixing them

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.060
until they're just about incorporated and then we'll add in our buttermilk

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.980
That looks great

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.780
We're gonna add in our buttermilk

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.700
and just mix this whole thing together until it's all combined

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.160
That looks perfect. It has a few lumps in there but that's perfectly fine because a good cupcake is a little lumpy

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.700
Keeps everything really nice and moist

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.360
Just means that you haven't over mixed it and then it will be really tough [incoherent]

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.000
Definitely don't want that

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.440
So (clanks) now that we have this all combined I'm going to take my handy dandy ice cream scooper and I'm going to divide the batter evenly

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.040
until we have everything all filled up

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:35.560
Last one! Now I'm going to put this into the pre-heated oven 350 for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean with no wet batter on it

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.080
And then I'm going to let them cool completely before I start frosting them with some simple butter cream

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.500
My cupcakes have cooled completely and they've baked for about 20 minutes which is perfect for these

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.420
So now I'm just going to decorate two of them just to show you kinda like how I do it

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:01.200
I just take like a regular plastic disposable piping bag. You can use a big ziplock bag if you don't have one of these and just snip off one of the corners

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.240
And now I just-you can start at the center

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.720
and work your way out or vice versa. It doesn't really matter

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.620
I just build like that

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.420
I guess I'll start from the outside in

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.920
Just...

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.520
build and then what I do is I take a piece of chocolate

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.820
and taking a vegetable peeler. What you're doing is creating little chocolate curls

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.640
Just like that

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.940
And once you have plenty-Oops! Or it breaks

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.560
You just take it and I love to just pile some right on top

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.260
Not a whole lot. I just like that way that they look

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.640
Kinda...makes it look a bit fancier

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.980
You can just do it right over the top if you wanted to

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.060
But chances are they'll fall all over the place like mine did

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.580
If you have a really  big piece of chocolate obviously you're gonna get bigger curls

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.160
but this is just really simple and easy

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.960
I'm not a professional decorator. I'm a professional eater

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.360
And this is where I say: "Don't you wish you were here?"

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.660
So cute

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.360
But of course

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.480
The test is always in the taste

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.880
I can see these are really moist though

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.360
That's what I'm talking about

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.000
The moistest chocolate cupcake you'll ever eat

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.840
Wow!

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.420
[muffled]

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:46.280
Now also for the buttercream frosting I do have a recipe on this so if you wanna check that out go right ahead. It's super simple and easy

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.480
A basic got to recipe everyone should know how to make

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.620
So...I hope you enjoyed spending time with me

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.000
And I hope that you go to www.laurainthekitchen.com to get the recipe and make them yourself
