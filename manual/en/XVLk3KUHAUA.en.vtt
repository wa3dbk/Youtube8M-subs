Hello everyone this Danny from creating a
web store dot com and in today's

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.120
tutorial I'm going to talk about how you can make money

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.080
by uh... accepting checkout by amazon uh..
this was actually pretty amazing when i

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.179
uh... found out about this feature

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.250
and i'm surprised that Amazon doesn't talk

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.300
about it

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.080
or advertise it

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.730
uh... but in general if you really think
about it they don't really advertised checkout

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.640
by amazon all that much either

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.890
and i think uh... just checkout by
amazon alone is a pretty amazing

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.189
uh...

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.989
way of accepting payments online. I
mean you know, just think of all the

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.900
people out there that have

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.000
uh... an amazon account

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.200
and uh... how you can get a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.550
ton of business just by uh... accepting
this uh...

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.460
payment method

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.960
now if you don't uh... already have a shopping
cart which uh... if you don't already have

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.370
your own store

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.060
um... there are ways that you can set
one up you can actually check out my

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.020
uh... website uh... creating a webstore dot
com

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.900
which uh... basically compares a lot
of uh... shopping carts that are out

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.680
there

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.469
and uh... you can check out

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.539
uh... which of those shopping carts
actually uh... support

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.430
checkout by amazon

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.500
and uh... you can basically uh...

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.970
open up a store uh... with one of those
shopping carts or if you already have one,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.780
just figure out a way of getting uh...
checkout by amazon

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.190
installed. if you don't already have ii
installed

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.930
so uh... now uh... the way that you can
actually make ah...

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.130
money

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.440
through checkout by amazon is uh... by
up-selling

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.630
uh... products uh... that amazon sells
for example

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.960
uh... i logged into my uh... uh...

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.360
uh... seller central of amazon dot com

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.760
and right now i'm in the marketplace
section um... and what i'm going to do

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.610
is i'm going to go to your checkout website

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.770
and i'm going to click on that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.479
and after i have clicked

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.280
uh... what i'm going to do is i'm going
to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.369
going to integration

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.020
and i'm going to click on up-sell
settings

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.389
and see here you can actually up-sell
amazon dot com products

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.609
um...

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:18.349
you can also sell your own up-sell your own
products uh...

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.109
basically what i did, I
was only up selling amazon dot com

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.260
products

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.349
uh... and uh... because i felt that
people already visited my

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.109
store, if they wanted to something else from
my story they would have probably already

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.059
found it

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.879
because i have an up-sell feature already installed in there but so what i

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.179
wanted to do is i wanted to up-sell amazon
dot com products

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.219
and by doing this if someone actually
uh...

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.339
uh... buys something

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:45.959
um...

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.320
through the amazon up-sell right here

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.649
you actually get commission for every
item sold

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:57.639
so anyone on any of the items that amazon
dot com has to offer

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.789
if someone buys a product off of amazon
dot com

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.739
through this uh... up sell feature
you'll basically get commission

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.599
for it because uh...

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.890
you referred the customer to amazon and
that's how

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.239
they ended up uh... buying something

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.379
uh... now before you can actually
set this up what you will need to do is

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.989
uh... you will need to set up an
associates uh... account with uh...

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.589
amazon

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:29.159
so what you're going to do is you're
going to go to

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.049
affiliate

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.999
dash program dot amazon dot com

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.469
this information will again be in my
uh...

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:42.219
in the description of this video
I think prior to setting up your

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.539
amazon account... right here actually

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.249
it will tell you what the URL

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.270
um... of the associates uh...

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.839
amazon website

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.609
so i already have an account and

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.969
what i'm going to do is, I'm going to

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.589
login

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:05.489
so once you have logged in, you will
see uh... your tracking ID which is

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.269
this ID right here

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.789
uh... you can create a different one by
clicking on manage and then you know you

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:15.289
can basically customise the name of your
tracking ID

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.069
for example you can use your store name
or whatever

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.509
and i believe that all of them have the
dash twenty at the end

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.509
but this part will basically change to
whatever uh... you want to be

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.620
so you copy this uh... string here

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.850
and you paste it where it says uh... if
you already are an amazon dot com

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.520
associate please enter your associates ID
here

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.449
you paste it there

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.379
and then you basically click update
and you can even uh... choose uh... the

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.139
categories

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.129
that uh...

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.159
that you want uh... to be up-sold

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.529
and uh... by clicking edit and then you
just uh... select the categories and

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.229
click confirm and that's that

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.009
and uh... once you set all this stuff up

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.189
uh... people that checkout

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.090
uh... through amazon

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.010
um...

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.240
by uh... through your account through

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.289
that pay you through checkout by amazon will
also be uh...

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.439
offered other items by amazon they
will basically up-sell items to them

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.460
and if someone buys something else, you know you get commission and for my

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.729
experience

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.669
it happens um... it happens often
because amazon has a ton of uh...

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.740
products to choose from so you know,
chances are good of actually

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.009
selling something

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.969
so thanks for watching and stay tuned
for more e-commerce tutorial videos
