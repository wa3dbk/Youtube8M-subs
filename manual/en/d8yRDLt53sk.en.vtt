00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.560
&gt;&gt; I GET THIS ALL THE TIME.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.560
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW....

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.250
&gt;&gt; FIRST IT’S THAT LOOK.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.650
&gt;&gt; THEN COMES THE QUESTION...

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.949
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT ARE YOU?

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:12.740
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT AM I?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.809
&gt;&gt; DEEP DOWN, I KNOW.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.990
&gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT JUST BECAUSE I HAVE CURLY HAIR...

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE MY SKIN TONE IS DARKER...

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.380
&gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE I’M RED HEADED, FAIR-SKINNED,
AND GREEN EYED...

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.250
&gt;&gt; WHAT I LOOK LIKE, DOESN’T TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.720
&gt;&gt; WHAT I AM IS DEEP INSIDE.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720
&gt;&gt; I AM NATIVE.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.790
&gt;&gt; SO AM I.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
&gt;&gt; WE ARE NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.190
&gt;&gt; WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENT
ASSOCIATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL OKLAHOMA.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:50.579
&gt;&gt; TOGETHER WE EDUCATE OURSELVES AND OTHERS
ABOUT OUR UNIQUE HISTORY, RAISE CULTURAL AWARENESS,

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.079
HONOR OUR HERITAGE, AND KEEP TRADITIONS ALIVE.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.390
&gt;&gt; I AM BI-RACIAL, BUT FEEL CLOSEST TO MY
NATIVE ROOTS.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.379
&gt;&gt; I’M A MIX OF SEVERAL TRIBES.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.039
&gt;&gt; RAISED TRADITIONALLY, I KNOW MY NATIVE
CUSTOMS.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.860
&gt;&gt; TO BE NATIVE MEANS A RICH HERITAGE THAT
INCLUDES COLORFUL REGALIA AND CEREMONIAL TRADITIONS

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.659
PASSED DOWN SEVERAL GENERATIONS.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.990
&gt;&gt; IT’S NOW MY DUTY TO PASS IT ON...

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.070
&gt;&gt; I’M LEARNING EVERYTHING I CAN ABOUT NATIVE
PEOPLE.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.810
&gt;&gt; IT’S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO KNOW SO THAT
WHEN I HAVE KIDS, I CAN SHARE THAT WITH THEM.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.340
&gt;&gt; MY WIFE IS A KIOWA-APACHE INDIAN.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940
&gt;&gt; WE BOTH JOINED THE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENT
ASSOCIATION.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.790
&gt;&gt; IT’S ALLOWED US TO PLUG IN TO NATIVE
COMMUNITIES.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.520
&gt;&gt; NATIVE ELDERS ARE GREAT STORYTELLERS, HISTORIANS.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.169
&gt;&gt; IT WAS MY NON-NATIVE GRANDMOTHER ENCOURAGED
ME TO EXPLORE MY AMERICAN INDIAN ROOTS.

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:40.990
&gt;&gt; WHILE AT U-C-O -- I’VE DISCOVERED ALL
SORTS OF THINGS.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.209
&gt;&gt; I’VE GOTTEN TO SPEND TIME WITH OTHER
NATIVE STUDENTS.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.659
&gt;&gt; LEARN ABOUT INDIAN TERRITORY BEFORE IT
BECAME OKLAHOMA.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.950
&gt;&gt; TRAVEL BACK IN TIME AND EXPERIENCE CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES THAT CONTINUE TODAY.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.490
&gt;&gt; I HAVE A BETTER SENSE NOW OF MY CULTURAL
IDENTITY.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.450
&gt;&gt; WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A NATIVE AMERICAN
INDIAN?

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.900
&gt;&gt; FOR ME, IT MEANS FAMILY.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.039
&gt;&gt; NATIVE PEOPLE HAVE SURROUNDED ME MY ENTIRE
LIFE.

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.909
&gt;&gt; I GREW UP IN THE CHEROKEE NATION, IN NORTHEASTERN
OKLAHOMA.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.659
&gt;&gt; MY GRANDMOTHER IS A FULL-BLOOD CHEROKEE
INDIAN.

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:17.849
&gt;&gt; SHE PASSED ON TO ME MANY NATIVE CRAFTS
LIKE BASKET WEAVING AND CLAY BEAD MAKING.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.670
&gt;&gt; NOW AT CENTRAL, I’M EARNING MY DEGREE
TO BECOME A FIRST GRADE TEACHER.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.849
&gt;&gt; I’LL BE ABLE TO GIVE STUDENTS A VALUABLE
NATIVE PERSPECTIVE.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.850
&gt;&gt; I AM NATIVE AMERICAN.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.540
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS A SENSE OF
BELONGING.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.340
&gt;&gt; WHILE GROWING UP, MY NATIVE CULTURE WAS
CENTRAL TO MY LIFE.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.690
&gt;&gt; MY FAMILY AND I WERE ACTIVE IN OUR NATIVE
COMMUNITY.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.970
&gt;&gt; BUT WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER PASSED AWAY, WE
BECAME LESS AND LESS INVOLVED IN CULTURAL

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.680
ACTIVITIES.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.540
&gt;&gt; BEING A PART OF THIS NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENT
ASSOCIATION HELPS ME RE-CONNECT AND CELEBRATE

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.840
WHO I AM.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.329
&gt;&gt; I AM NATIVE.

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.329
&gt;&gt; WE ARE NATIVE

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.580
&gt;&gt; TOGETHER WE ARE PART OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN
STUDENT ASSOCIATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:25.130
OKLAHOMA ... JOIN US!
