00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.510
What's up, guys?

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.040
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.690
Today, look who's with me.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.520
Raymond made it here to the brand new XBOX.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.820
And we're going to show you together why the
Hip Hinge is critically important when you're

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.260
trying to maximize the stability and strength
of your core.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.280
Yes, this is Washboard Wednesday video, and
we're not going to talk really about the abs

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280
at all.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.900
We're going to talk about the functioning
of the joints below in this case,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.180
and also above when it comes to trying to
make sure that we have the optimal performance

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.080
of the area in question in the middle.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.790
So, if we think about a Hip Hinge, why is
a Hip Hinge so important?

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.000
Because we want to be able to maintain the
stability of our low back without compromising

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.210
the stability of our low back, ok.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.081
Because if we lack mobility through a joint
below, as we might with a Hip Hinge, if you

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:52.500
don't have the mobility there, then we're
going to start compromising the stability

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.340
of the low back to do that.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.890
That's when we start to get low back issues
and pain.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.170
Same thing could be said for above, and we'll
cover it in a different video, if you lack

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.780
the mobility through your thoracic spine to
rotate,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.220
again, we need to get that mobility somewhere
else, down here in the core.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.009
Again, compromising stability for mobility
somewhere else, that's a problem too.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.909
The Hip Hinge, though, comes in so critically
important when it comes to all of our big

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:18.909
lifts.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.000
If you're going to do a Bent Row, you need
to be able to have stability and strength

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.979
through your core to perform that exercise
without injuring our low back.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890
Or, the same thing could be said with a Deadlift.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.819
But far too often, that's not the case.

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.549
We see people who lose that stability through
their core.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.099
They can't handle the heavier loads, and it
winds up compromising the safety and health

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:39.490
of their low back.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.909
The Hip Hinge, you have to look at Raymond
first and see what's going on.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.979
You have a natural curvature of your low back.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.990
Most of us have a natural curvature of our
low back.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.649
Some of us have flatter backs than others,
but whatever your natural curvature of your

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.390
low back is, that's what you're trying to
maintain throughout all of your other lifts.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.119
That's your main, one and only goal for your
low back.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.840
So, for me, I have a similar curve here to
Raymond.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.910
It's not excessive.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.869
It's just basically a lumbar curve that follows
this inward pattern.

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.960
Now, when I bend over to do an exercise, like
a Bent Row, if I'm going to lift here, my

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.020
whole one and only goal is to maintain the
position here as I lift.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.710
If the load starts to get too heavy, and I
start to do that, now I'm in trouble.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.500
I'm compromising my lower back at some point.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.500
Same thing with the Deadlift.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.660
If I can get in that position and hold it
and maintain it, then that's good.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.670
Well, the way we do this, and I'll get Raymond
here out of the way, is

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.620
you want to make sure that when you get into
this position that all the movement comes

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.630
from the hips so that you have the mobility
through the hips to get yourself into this

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.630
position

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.050
and still maintain the stability without having
to give it up here through the core and the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.050
low back.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.500
So, the Hip Hinge needs to take place all
the way, until we can our butt all the way

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.540
back.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.910
There's no knee movement here.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.830
I'm not bending my knees to get myself back.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.060
All I'm doing is moving my hips backwards.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.920
Let's see, pushing from here straight back
and going as far back as I possibly can to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.910
then get myself in position to be stable now
to lift, do a Deadlift, whatever else it may

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.910
be.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.620
But, people don't know how to do this, and
there's one big complicating factor that comes

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.960
up that prevents it.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.960
It's hamstring flexibility.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.960
Again, if we look back at Raymond,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.580
we see that the hamstrings will attach right
here to the bottom of the pelvis.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.170
So, if the pelvis is back, this way, into
a Hip Hinge, we've basically lengthened the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.170
hamstrings.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.840
If I do this, the hamstrings now have to get
longer, ok.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.260
Now, the further back I go, the more I'm pulling
that hamstring further away from its insertion

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.980
so there's more and more of a pull.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.670
At some point, I can't get my hips back anymore,
so they kind of try to curl under because

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.930
they want to relieve the tension.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.950
So, if you have a difficult time getting into
the Hip Hinge, you might want to first of

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.130
all, check your own hamstring flexibility.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.610
If that's not a problem for you, you just
don't know the mechanics of it, all you've

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.860
got to do is this.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.340
And I'm not trying to insult you here, and
give you the old DX chop,

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.760
what I'm trying to do is show you what you
have to do to mirror the move or mimic the

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760
move.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.990
You push yourself right here.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.840
Allow your hips to go backwards, and you'll
feel the crease.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.060
There's 2 creases that are made right here
at the top of the hip flexor area, ok.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.210
When you feel those creases, as soon as you
create them, put your hands right in them.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.740
Now, stand upright.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.449
Now, push through the creases as you allow
your butt to travel back.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.419
You should feel immediately that all the motion's
happening right here at the pelvis,

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.580
and the pelvis is traveling backwards.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.990
Again, you might feel a little bit of a stretch
in the hamstrings.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.360
If that's the case, you want to stretch your
hamstrings out of this anterior tilt position.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.620
So that you can actually have a functional
carry over.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.819
We're right here.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:59.699
I go all the way down as far back as I can,
and you'll notice that no stability was compromised

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.389
from the low back.

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.430
That was maintained from here all the way
back, all the way back, all the way back.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.509
I didn't have to move my back to get myself
back there.

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.509
That's the key difference.

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.379
If I had to go like this and round my back,
give up some stability to allow myself to

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.590
get back, and now I can get way further back,
and I'm starting to look vulgar here with

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.590
my boy Ray.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.759
Sorry about that, Ray.

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.169
But we just basically want to make sure that
we're getting the motion where we want to

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.689
get it, and that's through the hips.

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:32.689
Master this.

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:33.689
Try this.

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.870
Stretch those hamstrings out from the anterior
position if you have to, but most of all,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.259
practice the Hip Hinge.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:39.809
Do this a little bit, and

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:44.199
you'll see that you're able to get your body
in the position you need it to be and then

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.150
therefore allow your abs to be as strong and
powerful and protective as they possibly can

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.150
be.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.169
Guys, if you found this video helpful, make
sure you leave your comments and thumb's up

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.169
below.

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.430
And head to ATHLEANX.COM if you're looking
for a training system that puts the science

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.629
back in strength,

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.761
that lets Ray do a little bit of the talking
to help us understand why we want to do the

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:05.580
things we do in the gym, and not just what
we're doing, ok?

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.130
That's the difference here with ATHLEANX.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.969
I'll see you guys back here in just a couple
days.

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.849
If you're happy that Rays' back, leave a thumb's
up for him too.

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:12.710
I'll see you guys back here in a couple days.
