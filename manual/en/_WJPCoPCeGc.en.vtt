00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.837
So why do you keep
getting in my way, Ryu Ki-woo?

00:00:00.837 --> 00:00:02.129
Cheers!

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.255
Goodbye, Kyung-pyo.

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:05.837
I'll miss you, Kyung-pyo.

00:00:05.837 --> 00:00:07.837
Thanks, I'm going to miss everyone.

00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:11.837
This is a top quality Korean beef.

00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:16.213
Don't eat too much LA beef in America.
And think of me as you eat this.

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:19.588
Must you shove meat in my face
even until the end?

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:24.837
By the way, I'm going to Hawaii,
not America.

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:26.672
Wait, isn't Hawaii in America?

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:29.837
Oh no, Hawaii is in Southeast Asia.

00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:32.837
Jeez, Hawaii is part of America,
you dummies!

00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:33.837
What?

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:35.547
It's not in Southeast Asia?

00:00:35.547 --> 00:00:38.838
Oh well, it's not important.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:42.837
All you need to do is just leave.

00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:46.837
Who will run errands for me now?

00:00:46.837 --> 00:00:48.213
I know.

00:00:50.837 --> 00:00:54.837
Oh, you two were here?
Come join the farewell party.

00:00:54.837 --> 00:00:57.547
That's okay.
I need to go look for a place to live.

00:00:57.547 --> 00:00:58.837
A place to live?

00:00:58.837 --> 00:01:04.837
The boss caught her
sleeping here at the restaurant.

00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:08.837
Let's get out of here, So-min.
You need to find a place by tonight.

00:01:08.837 --> 00:01:10.505
Goodbye, Kyung-pyo.

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.837
Su-hyun, why don't you let
So-min live with you?

00:01:13.837 --> 00:01:15.837
What, live with So-min?

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:19.837
Why don't you sublet Kyung-pyo's room?
The house will feel empty without him.

00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:22.421
Besides, you said you needed
someone to run your errands.

00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:24.838
Yes, I'm good at errands.

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:26.879
I don't wanna brag, but I'm good
at household chores, too.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:29.171
Well, I haven't really thought about it.

00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:32.837
Yeah, do it, sis.
It'd make me feel better you aren't alone.

00:01:32.837 --> 00:01:37.837
I'm not sure she's up to it,
but will you do your best to fill my place?

00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:39.088
Of course.

00:01:39.088 --> 00:01:41.963
I'll do my very best.
I really need a place to stay.

00:01:41.963 --> 00:01:45.255
- That solves it then.
- Yeah, do that.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:46.837
Should I?

00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:49.380
Fine. Let's do it.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.837
Really? Thank you.
I've been saved, Shi-wan.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.879
- Come on in.
- Okay.

00:01:59.837 --> 00:02:02.380
It's a really nice house, Su-hyun.

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:06.004
Wow!

00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:07.837
So soft.

00:02:07.837 --> 00:02:10.837
It's the softest I've felt in awhile.

00:02:12.837 --> 00:02:14.837
Wow, how cool.

00:02:14.837 --> 00:02:18.921
It's the first double door fridge
I've encountered ever.

00:02:20.837 --> 00:02:25.837
Wow, strong firepower.
It turns on so fast.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.630
Why do you seem so moved?
It's not that nice of a house.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.837
I haven't been inside a normal house
since I moved to Seoul.

00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:36.088
I'm just very happy.

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:38.837
I agreed to the living situation
so I wouldn't feel lonely.

00:02:38.837 --> 00:02:41.837
So the rent will be cheap.
Let's have a nice time living together.

00:02:41.837 --> 00:02:42.838
Okay.

00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:46.088
And please be casual with me.
That would make me more comfortable.

00:02:46.088 --> 00:02:50.837
I'll treat you like my younger sister then.
Be casual with me, too.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.837
Okay, Su-hyun.

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:55.088
Here, take this.

00:02:55.837 --> 00:02:57.046
What is it?

00:02:57.046 --> 00:02:59.837
It's a list of rules to abide by
as you live here.

00:02:59.837 --> 00:03:00.879
Rules?

00:03:01.837 --> 00:03:06.547
My sister likes to use her toes
to grab onto things.

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:15.837
So please always leave tissue
and the TV remote within reach.

00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:17.837
If you don't, she'll kick you.

00:03:20.837 --> 00:03:24.837
And when watching comic shows,
laugh with her.

00:03:27.837 --> 00:03:29.046
Oh?

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:31.505
Squirrel-squirrel.

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:32.837
Squirrel-squirrel.

00:03:33.837 --> 00:03:40.837
Thank you-squirrel is a common game
she likes to play with someone.

00:03:45.838 --> 00:03:53.296
If sis acts sensitive,
get her some female products.

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:56.837
Make sure to get the one with wings.

00:03:59.837 --> 00:04:01.837
Come here, you...

00:04:02.588 --> 00:04:05.837
You should've stayed out of trouble.
