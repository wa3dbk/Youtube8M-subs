00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.650
Mark Wahlberg talks turning down a role in
JJ Abrams's Star Trek -- but is he game

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.250
for Star Wars 7?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.270
Hey guys, I'm Melana Scantlin. ENTV has
the details.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.930
Mark Wahlberg isn't one to shy away from
the science-fi genre. He's been in Planet

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.460
of the Apes and he's starring in Michael
Bay's upcoming Transformers 4. Yet, when

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.670
it came to one of the biggest franchises in
Hollywood -- he wasn't feeling it.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.870
In an interview with Total Film, the actor
revealed that he was offered a role in JJ

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.520
Abrams Star Trek reboot in 2009. It was to
play Captain Kirk's father, a role which

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.880
ultimately went to Avengers' star Chris
Hemsworth.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.630
So what happened? Wahlberg explains, "I
tried to read the script and I didn't understand

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.210
the words, the dialogue or anything,"

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.210
He recalls turning down the part... only to
be blown away by the end result, saying, "I

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.680
was like 'Holy sh*t, he did a great job.'"

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.579
Wahlberg goes on to say he thinks Abrams will
do a "something spectacular" as the director

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.680
of the new Star Wars film, Episode 7.... and
even seems to hint at a desire to be in the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.680
film, saying, "I probably wouldn't pass
up an opportunity to work with J.J. again.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.750
So, if he wanted me to do something that I
couldn't fully understand, I'd probably give

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.860
it a shot."

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.420

Wahlberg enter the Star Wars galaxy? Let us
