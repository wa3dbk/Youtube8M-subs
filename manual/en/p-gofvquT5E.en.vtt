00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.580
Hello my name is Grant Davis, your
general manager of the Sonoma County

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.300
Water Agency. On January 17th, Governor
Brown declared a statewide drought, and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.240
this includes our region of Mendocino,
Sonoma and Marin Counties. In his

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.630
emergency declaration, he asked everyone
in California to reduce their water use

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.920
by twenty percent. The Sonoma County
Water Agency fully supports this call to

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.790
action. We asked that our water
contractors, which includes the cities of

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.480
Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park, Petaluma, Cotati,
Windsor, Sonoma and the North Marin

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.589
Valley of the Moon and Marin municipal water
districts to implement a voluntary

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.300
twenty percent conservation program
immediately. I applaud those water

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.199
utilities in our region that have
already taken this step. Our two water

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.579
supply reservoirs that we co-manage with
the US Army Corps of Engineers, Lake

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.640
Sonoma and Lake Mendocino, are at historic
lows due to three dry years. Not to

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.470
mention last year was the driest on
record; only seven inches of rain fell in

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.969
Ukiah Valley when we're normally
receiving 33 inches. The amount of

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.409
rainfall we receive is important because
our reservoirs and groundwater aquifers

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.909
rely on the rainfall to fill up. This means
that drinking water we provide to the

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.579
Sonoma-Marin Saving Water Partnership is
in limited supply. Over 600,000 residents

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.289
from the town of Windsor to the city of
San Rafael, including all communities

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.460
that rely on Lake Mendocino and the
Russian River for water supply, should

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.899
take immediate action to reduce their
water use. As the Sonoma-Marin Saving

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.490
Water Partnership's education campaign
says: there's a drought on, turn your

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.079
water off. The Water Agency has taken
immediate action to save every drop of

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.670
water by reducing reservoir releases
from Lake Mendocino, helping the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.869
Partnership enact a new public education
campaign, and working with stakeholders

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.070
throughout our region seeking
conservation action. Since reducing

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.090
reservoir water releases from Lake
Mendocino in January, we've been able to

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.740
keep 3,000 acre feet of water in that
reservoir. That's a lot of water since

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.330
that reservoir only has 25 thousand acre
feet remaining. We're also working

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.440
closely with our natural resource
agencies to balance the need

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.550
for water for our local fisheries,
including endangered Coho and threatened

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.020
Steelhead and Chinook salmon. As your
regional water managers, you should know

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.920
that we are working around the clock in
response to these drought conditions.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.730
I want to thank you for your time and your
help during this drought. We greatly

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.230
appreciate it and we will provide more
updates as this drought develops.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.920
The bottom line is that we're in a drought.
Simply turning off your outdoor

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.300
irrigation system, taking shorter showers,
turning the faucet off while brushing

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.860
your teeth, fixing leaks, and not washing
your car you can make a difference

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.910
during this period of drought. And for
