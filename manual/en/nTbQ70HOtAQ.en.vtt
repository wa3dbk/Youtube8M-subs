Steve: Hi, its Steve from PartSelect, today
we are going to show you how to change the

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.000
oven sensor on your range, really easy job,
all we are going to need is a Philips screw

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.709
driver, let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.990
Now the first step in this repair will be
to disconnect the power to the appliance,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.590
if it has a cord on simply unplug it, if it’s
hard wired we’ll need to find a breakthrough

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.470
and turn that off.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.980
Now the temp sensor is located in the upper
left hand corner of the oven, I am going to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:49.409
open the oven door, and locate the two Philip
screws and hold that oven sensor in place,

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:57.569
next we want to very carefully pull that oven
sensor in it’s harness forward, harness

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:01.929
is coming through a small hole in the oven
wall, we want to make sure that, that stays

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:21.170
connected if at all possible.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.020
Disconnect the harness connector in a moment
to compare that with the connector on our

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:40.890
new temp sensor, and if it is different, they
can supply some harness adaptors, and we can

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.940
figure to make it the same as the original.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:58.659
Now you just simply reconnect that harness,
then we’ll push that harness back through

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.970
the oven wall, and you are pushing this through
some insulation, so we have to wiggle it around

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:23.370
a little bit to get it to slide through, now
we have got the harness all the way in, and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:38.940
we are ready to reinstall the two Philip screws,
now we are ready to reconnect the power and

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.360
our repair is complete.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.410
That’s just how easy it is to change the
oven sensor on your range, thanks for watching,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.549
and good luck with your repair.
