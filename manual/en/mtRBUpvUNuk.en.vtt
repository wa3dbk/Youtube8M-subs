00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.410
In this video we're going to take a closeup
look at three popular decreases so you can

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.410
compare them side-by-side.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.789
And next week I'm releasing a video comparing
increases, and once that sister video is out,

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.230
I'll give you a link here on-screen to that
video so you can watch it as well, cause they're

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.140
both pretty important.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.880
And this idea came to me through email from
a viewer.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.929
Thank you very much.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:29.929
Keep them coming.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.780
I get a lot of ideas for videos that I'm shooting
from people giving me suggestions.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.000
And the reason that this video's important
is sometimes a pattern will tell you, especially

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.180
older patterns, will just say Decrease, like
Decrease 10 times the cross-throw.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.690
And I get emails from people saying, "What
decrease should I do, they don't specify."

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.910
And really at that point, it's knitter's choice.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.489
If the designer hasn't given you specific
instructions for which one to use, you can

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.300
really use whichever one you want.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.969
Which is why it's a good idea to see how they
look next to each other.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.310
Or you might decide to do a different decrease
than the pattern recommends, and so I want

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.740
to show you what they look like so you can
make a good choice.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.710
First, I'm gonna quickly run through the different
decreases.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.200
In the video description field below, I will
give you links to slow videos, not slow videos,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.990
slow demonstrations that show you exactly
how to work these decreases very carefully.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.650
I'm going to run through just to remind you
of how they're worked as we talk about what

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.650
they look like.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.310
Let's go ahead and take a look.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.780
Look at this weirdo piece of knitting I have
here with the different decreases.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.710
I'm gonna run through this real quick so you
can see how they're worked.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.640
There are three basic decreases.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.900
I'm sure a lot of you already know how to
work these.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:55.360
This here is a knit border.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.909
And this first one, knit up two stitches before
the marker.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.430
It's knit two together.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.250
And I find that just about every knitter learns
knit two together as a beginner, because they

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.790
find that it's an easy way to get their stitch
count back down to where it's supposed to

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.790
be.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.790
They figure it out on their own.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.820
This next one is SSK.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.510
So I slip one stitch as if to knit, slip the
second stitch as if to knit, and knit those

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.400
two together through the back loop.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.209
And this next one is PSSO.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:38.090
I'm going to slip one stitch as if to purl,
knit one, and then bind one stitch off over

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.090
the other one.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.519
That's passing the slip stitch over.

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:48.319
Just let me finish up this row real quick,
and we'll take a look at these.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.510
Okay.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.450
Now as you're trying to make a decision for
what decreases you're going to use, we'll

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.180
take a look at these.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.019
The first one that I did here was a knit two
together.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.120
And if we isolate this stitch, you'll see
it is a right-leaning, single decrease.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.849
Definitely leans to the right.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.930
And as we move over here to the SSK, you'll
see that it's a left-leaning decrease.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.330
And that's why these two look really good
mirrored together.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.040
If you need a double decrease and you have
like a center marker, what I've done here

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.470
is knit two together, knit two, SSK, and it
gave me kind of this wide column of mirrored

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.410
decreases, which ends up looking pretty good.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.080
These are probably the most inconspicuous
decreases you can make, the knit two together

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.630
and SSK.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.989
And then we move over here.

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.189
There are a lot of older patterns, I think
SSK is something that's come more into use

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.060
in the past 20 years or so.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.130
And a lot of older patterns will have you
do PSSO, instead of SSK.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.579
And depending on how you want your work to
look, you may want to substitute SSK when

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.799
it calls for PSSO.

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.210
Because this is a left-leaning decrease and
it has a really strong line leaning to the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.210
left in it.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.989
You can see it is almost a decorative decrease.

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.250
It used to be, in my experience in older patterns,
they'll have it paired with knit two together

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.680
for mirrored decreases.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.450
But you can see SSK and knit two together
look far better and closer to each other than

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.450
PSSO.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.310
But it's a pretty decrease and can certainly
look good, like if you are doing lined up

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.410
decreases in a hat or something.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.440
It's definitely a choice you have to make
because it is a pretty strong statement.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.630
And this piece, this crazy piece, and no one's
ever going to want to copy what I've done

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.630
here.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.750
But I did the decreases and the wrong side
of the work is just knitting the knits and

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.130
purling the purls.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.280
And then every right side row was the decreases.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.040
So this is every other row decrease, every
other row decrease, every other row decrease.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.550
That might help you make a decision, as well.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.550
That's it.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:21.360
Comparing three popular decreases and next
week we will compare increases.
