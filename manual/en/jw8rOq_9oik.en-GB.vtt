Hi I'm Kelsea Kelsea Brennan-Wessels

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.410
and welcome back to Earth from Space on the
European Space Agency Web TV.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.640
The freshwater Lake Constance in Central Europe

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.269
is pictured in this image from the Sentinel-1A
satellite.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.640
Formed by the Rhine Glacier during the last
Ice Age,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.140
it covers an area of about 540 sq km

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.750
and is an important source of drinking water
for southwestern Germany.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.670
This image was acquired on May 10th in 'interferometric
wide swath mode' and in dual polarisation.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.390
The radar instrument gathers information in
either horizontal or vertical radar pulses,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.600
and colours were assigned to the different
types.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.130
In this image, buildings generally appear
pink, while vegetation is green.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.130
Areas with lowest reflectivity in all polarisations
appear very dark, like the water.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.440
Lake Constance has shorelines in three countries:

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.490
Germany to the north, Switzerland to the south
and Austria at its eastern end.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.479
Over the water body, however, there are no
borders

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.079
because there is no legally binding agreement
on where they lie.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.119
In the lower-right corner we can see where
the Rhine river flows into the lake from the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.020
south,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.579
which then flows out of the lake to the west
(left).

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.079
This and other rivers carry sediments from
the Alps,

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.180
extending the coastline and decreasing the
lake's water depth.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.939
The runways of Germany's Friedrichshafen Airport
are visible in the right section of the image.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.750
The Aviation &amp; Aerospace Museum is nearby.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.399
Sentinel-1A's radar is still being calibrated
following its launch on April 3rd,

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.280
but early images like this give us a glimpse
of the kind of operational imagery

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.280
that this mission will provide for Europe's
Copernicus environmental monitoring programme.

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.600
Well that brings us to the end of this edition
of Earth from Space.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.269
Remember that we broadcast online every Friday
at ten o'clock Central European Summer time.

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.820

App on your mobile device
