00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:03.604
Thanks for stopping by Cross Allegiance.

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:09.610
I have a very simple message for you -- it's that God loves you, and He wants a relationship with you.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.381
I want to highlight a few passages of Scripture (very briefly) that show us God's love for us,

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:17.752
as well as the application for our own lives.

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:25.326
Genesis 3.  Adam and Eve disobeyed God -- they sinned, and thus sin has entered upon all mankind.

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:30.331
In our shame, we tried to cover ourselves with fig leaves -- not a very good solution!

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:34.001
So for us, God performed the first animal sacrifice.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.170
This was a 'shadow of things to come', as Hebrews states,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.976
that this animal sacrifice which had to be done over and over again, temporarily covering our sins,

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:49.016
would be the shadow of Jesus, who was the ultimate and final payment for our sins.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:55.656
God is always about reconciliation.  2 Corinthians 5 talks a lot about this.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:59.326
In Christ, God is reconciling the world to Himself, not charging us with the sins that we're guilty of,

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:05.499
and we can be reconciled through faith in the reconciliation brought through Jesus.

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.769
This whole message of reconciliation is rooted in love.

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:13.941
John 3:16.  You've probably seen it at a football game, on some placard, or at a boxing match.

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:18.279
John 3:16 states -- "For God so loved the world...

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:23.417
...that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him will not perish,

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.120
but have everlasting life."

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.858
Another aspect of God's love is that He did not leave Jesus in the grave.

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:37.564
Jesus was victorious over the grave.  1 Corinthians 15 calls Jesus the 'Firstfruits of those who will be raised.'

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:42.336
The Resurrection was also a symbol, not just that He had victory over sin and death, but also

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:46.940
that we will one day rise to meet Him if we have put our faith in Jesus.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.248
The chapter continues and says, 'In Adam, all die.  But in Christ, all shall be made alive.'

00:01:54.248 --> 00:02:02.089
God is patient with us.  2 Peter 3:9 states that 'God is willing that none should perish, but for all to come to repentance.'

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:05.492
And maybe you're watching this video and you haven't committed your life to Jesus.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.995
I would advise you -- definitely do so!

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:14.201
God's love is there, and He is waiting for you to come to Him, because He loves you.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:24.278
1 John 4:10 states, 'Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and provided His Son as a propitiation for our sins.'

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:29.884
And this big word, 'propitiation,' just means, 'a sacrifice appeasing the wrath that we deserve,

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:37.157
and bringing us to grace' -- to the blessings or unmerited favor that God so lavishes on us.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:44.164
Paul continues the message of reconciliation in 2 Corinthians 6, stating, 'This is the appointed time.  Today is the day of Salvation!'

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:51.805
God has so many blessings in store for us.  Does it make sense to wait or to neglect so great a salvation?

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:57.811
We need to follow Jesus and to enjoy this life (not just the one to come), living a life pleasing to Him,

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:02.383
doing His will, and being guided by the Holy Spirit.

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:10.757
We must turn 180 degrees away from our rebellion against God.  We must turn toward Jesus and follow Him.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:13.760
Finally, I want to leave you with an invitation.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.932
If you have not been reconciled to God through Jesus Christ, be reconciled!

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:24.572
Put your faith in Jesus, trust in Him, follow Him, and love Him.

00:03:24.572 --> 00:03:29.977
And in a response of prayer, it's not how eloquent you are -- it's not how you address God semantically --

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:35.716
Faith in Jesus is the important part -- believing that God raised Him from the dead,

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:40.520
and confessing (testifying) with your mouth that Jesus is Lord -- He is the master of everything!

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.560
If you would so desire to follow Jesus, pray and ask God to forgive you of your sins,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.168
admit that Jesus is Lord!  Believe in Him, put your faith in Him and His Sacrifice for your sins!

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:57.838
He died and He rose again for you, because He loves you!

00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:01.275
And so again, if you want to pray along (remember, it's not your exact word choice),

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:04.945
but if you really mean this from your heart, pray it along with me:

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:09.649
Father, in the Name of Jesus, I come to you,

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.420
asking Lord: Please forgive me of my sins!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.022
Help me follow You!

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:23.396
I acknowledge that Jesus is Lord, He is the Son of God, and He is the Savior of the world.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:29.236
I accept His Sacrifice and His Resurrection for my life.

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:34.642
I thank You God for the gift of grace that You've given us --

00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:38.512
that You've shown Your love in providing Jesus,

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:42.749
and that You can reconcile us back to Yourself through Him.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:51.458
So God, I commit my life to You.  Help me follow You faithfully and obediently all of my days.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:56.664
I pray all of this in Jesus' Name, Amen.

00:04:56.664 --> 00:05:01.335
If you prayed that and you meant it from your heart, then Amen!  It's great news!

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:05.906
Angels rejoice when you commit your life to the Lord!

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:09.777
So if you've made a decision to follow Jesus, or if you have a prayer request,

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:14.748
Send us a message.  We'd love to help you grow in your walk with Jesus and encourage you.

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:19.386
You can visit our website at http://www.CrossAllegiance.org or send us a message on YouTube,

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:23.089
but regardless, God loves you and wants a relationship with you!

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:28.562
May that develop, may that be blessed in Jesus' Name, and may you go in peace.  Have a great week!

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:29.000
