00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:12.111
I'm going to show
you how to photograph

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.514
two-dimensional artwork
for your portfolio.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.649
You only need a
couple of basic tools,

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.585
such as the piece that you're
going to be photographing,

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:24.557
something to hang that work
with, such as pushpins, Velcro,

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:25.824
or even tape.

00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:27.327
Then you need your camera.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.330
I have a digital
SLR that I'm using.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.899
You'll also need clip lamps.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:35.368
You can get these at
any hardware store.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.270
They're relatively inexpensive,
plus the dome shape

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.306
makes it great for
directing light.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:43.209
And I'm using daylight-balanced
bulbs with these

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.578
so I get a nice, natural color.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:48.047
You'll also need something
to clip the lamps on to,

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:50.416
such as a table or chairs.

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:52.818
I put pushpins into
the wall, making sure

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.620
that my image will be secured.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.756
When hanging artwork,
you want to make sure

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.291
that it's level on the wall.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.631
I set up my clip lamps and
chairs at a 45-degree angle

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.301
so I get evenly dispersed
light throughout the artwork.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.069
When turning on your
clip lamps, make

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:12.405
sure to turn off
all other lights so

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.673
that you have complete
control over the lighting

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:15.908
of your image.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.410
The distance of the
lights will vary,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.178
depending on the
size of the artwork

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.046
and the brightness of the bulbs.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.383
All that's left to do
now is shoot the image.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:26.419
Most auto settings on
cameras will work just fine,

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.388
but you want to make sure
that your flash is turned off.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:30.957
You want to make
sure that you're

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:33.960
eye level with the artwork so
that when you take the image

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.096
the artwork doesn't
get distorted.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.768
For basic editing, such as
cropping, color balance,

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:45.938
and file resizing, there's
plenty of free software

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:48.508
and apps that you can download.
