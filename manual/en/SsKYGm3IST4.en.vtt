00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.370
 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.370
 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.990
Hello, my name is Anthony Bacon and
I'm an instructor here at Schoolcraft College.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.990
I've been here since the 2003.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.220
I work with the liberal arts department.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.759
As an instructor I teach art classes
and humanities classes.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.809
I also work with the continuing ed
Department.

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.470
I teach watercolor, drawing,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.960
and experimental art. In my basic drawing
class

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.199
I take students with all types of levels of
expertise.

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.640
From beginners to those students who
have a lot of experience.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.309
And I can work with students on the level on which they come to me.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.020
I teach a variety of lessons

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.600
but we were primarily in pencil.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.670
All semester, I do  give one charcoal assignement. I also go around from student to student and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.420
give everybody individual help.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.280
We try to have a real good time my classrooms.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.080
Behind me you see a variety of artwork
which is all mine.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.460
Often you'll find artists work in one
subject area with maybe one media that they

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.720
really like to work with. Well I like to
work with all media

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.900
and all subject matters. Behind me you'll see some

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.860
scenery. You'll see some music music oriented themes.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.530
I even do dogs, cats, and people and
superheros.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.840
So I'm kind of all over the board with my
subject matter.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.150
And I just really enjoy working with
mixed media.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.420
Here at Schoolcraft we teach a variety of classes, from ceramics

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.970
to figure drawing. From sculpture

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.320
to design. We also have a life drawing
class.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.509
I'm looking forward to seeing you
sometime in the spring, summer, or fall

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.430
as one of my new students. Thank you.
