00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.570
The HP Compaq Elite 8300 and the HP Compaq Pro 6300 are equipped with either a tilt/swivel

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.130
stand or with a height adjustable and reclining stand.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.140
With the tilt/swivel stand, you can tilt the computer away from you and toward you, and you

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.369
can swivel the computer left and right.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.990
With the height adjustable and reclining stand, you can adjust the height, the swivel, the

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.050
tilt, and you can rotate the computer from landscape to portrait.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.050
This video describes how to use each type of stand.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.600
To prevent computer cables from interfering with the stand, you can route them through

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.100
the cable guide attached to the stand.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.489
With the computer turned off, remove the rear port cover located on the back of the computer.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.670
Put your fingers inside the open edge of the cover and place your thumbs on the ridges.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970
Pull down with your thumbs and out with your fingers.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.640
Locate the opening on the bottom of the stand.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.000
Put the cables together, route them through the stand opening, and plug them into the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.340
ports.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.949
A cable management cover hooks to slots on the stand and holds the cables in place.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.939
Make sure the cables are between the cable management cover and the stand. Align the

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.170
cover hooks with the slots in the stand, and then insert the cover and slide it down into

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.939
place.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.059
You can swivel your computer up to 360 degrees left or right.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.310
To swivel your computer, hold each side of the computer and press left or right until

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.850
the computer is at the best viewing angle.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.600
You can set your computer at a comfortable angle by adjusting the tilt.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.360
To tilt the computer, hold the top and the bottom and push to adjust the computer until the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.360
tilt is where you want it.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.990
To keep the computer cables out of the way, you can route them through the cable guide

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.640
designed for this stand.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.810
The cable guide is attached to the side of the stand.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.810
Put the cables together and route them through the guide.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.610
Pull the cables along the lower front of the stand and plug them into the rear ports.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.680
You can swivel your computer up to 360 degrees left or right.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.010
To swivel your computer, hold each side of the computer and push left or right until

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.720
the computer is at the best viewing angle.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.340
You can adjust the height of your computer up to 110 millimeters.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.890
To lower the computer, hold the sides of the computer and push down.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.870
To raise the computer, hold the sides of the computer and lift up.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.390
You can set your computer at a comfortable angle by adjusting the tilt.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.710
To tilt the computer, hold the top and bottom, and push to adjust the computer

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.120
until the tilt is where you want it.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.140
You can lock the position of the computer.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.000
Start with the computer in an upright position.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.120
Hold the top left and right sides. Lift the computer to the maximum height, push the top

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.280
of the computer away from you, and then push down until the position

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.090
locks.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.030
To unlock from this position, hold the top of the computer and pull until it stops. Now

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.000
the tilt is unlocked.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.400
You can also tilt your computer to a reclining position.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.070
Start with the computer in an upright position and lift it as high as it will go.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.190
Place your hands on the top left and right side of the computer.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.250
In one smooth motion, begin pushing the top of the computer away from you and downward

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.919
until the computer is in the reclining position. The bottom of the computer will recline toward

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.620
you as the stand folds down.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.150
You can adjust the tilt to get even closer to the table. To do this, place one hand on

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.550
the bottom of the computer and push the computer downward toward the table until it stops.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.150
To return to the previous recline position, place your hand on the bottom of the computer

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.490
and pull upward.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.490
To release the recline position, pull the computer upward out of the recline.

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.199
You can rotate your computer from a landscape orientation to portrait.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.180
For most computing tasks, the landscape view works well.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.699
However, some tasks are easier to perform when the computer is in portrait view, such

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.030
as when viewing long documents.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.400
To rotate your computer from landscape to portrait, raise it as high as it will go.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.719
Slightly tilt the computer to keep it from hitting the base of the stand as you rotate

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:29.409
it. Then, rotate the computer counterclockwise until it is in the portrait position.

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.400
The image on the screen will automatically adjust to the new orientation.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.069
To return to landscape, rotate the computer clockwise until it is in the landscape position.

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:46.439
