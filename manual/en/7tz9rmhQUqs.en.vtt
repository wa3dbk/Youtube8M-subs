Hi I'm Robert Rogers and I'm Mike Ballosonie
and on behalf of expertvillage.com. In this

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:11.780
clip we are going to be talking a bout plyometrics.
Plyometrics are a form of activity to help

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.570
your everyday basic running. It is a good
change up of going out there and putting miles

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.189
on your shoes. Plyometrics has many different
forms. We are going to go over a few of them.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.779
There are a lot of different forms of plyometrics,
we are going to go over a few basic ones.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.220
Why is plyometrics important? It is going
to help your form by increasing your muscles

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.059
mass. It is going to help your heart, lungs,
breathing, and it also going to help just

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.449
basic running skills. We are going to start
off with a basic butt kicker. What you want

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:50.230
do is physically feel your feet kicking your
butt. Go ahead and give me your side view.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.210
Mike is demonstration a good butt kicker by
being sure that his feet are all the way to

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.359
the top. This also helps extend your stride.
Making sure your feet are picked up all the

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:07.180
way. You do a count about thirty seconds and
the switch to the next plyometric and give

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.750
yourself a rest. And go back to it. The next
one we are going to do is called a high step

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.880
or a high knee. High knee are exactly what
it sounds like. Try to get your knees as high

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.560
as possibility as you can. You can get them
up to your chest then get them up to your

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.250
chest. It should hurt and it should make you
sweat and breathe heavier. Go ahead get side

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:42.070
a view. Cherry picker of a ? is going to increase
your calve muscles and just help your basic

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:50.490
stride. Cherry picker who's named after jumping
out of a tree making it look like you are

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:00.220
picking cherries running through a orchard.
You can also do the trick when you pick a

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:09.000
telephone pole if you are in city of course,
and do each plyometric different one between

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.370
each set of telephone poles. So pick a plyometric
and pick you a telephone pole. Do it until

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.090
you hit the telephone pole and then pick your
next plyometric and your next telephone pole.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.500
So A and B telephone pole you may be doing
butt kickers. Between B and C telephone poles

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.470
you may be doing high knees. Between the next
telephone poles cherry pickers. These are

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.000
some very effective methods of plyometrics.
