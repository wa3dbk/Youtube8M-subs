00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.950
Today on this 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, we
are going to install part number 13581 from

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.950
Curt.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.740
This is what the hitch looks like when it
is installed on the vehicle.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.962
Next we will give you some measurements that
will help you out in selecting some accessories.

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:15.160
From the top of the receiver opening down
to the ground on this particular vehicle is

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.720
going to be 13 inches, and from the center
of the hitch pin hole to the outside edge

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.980
of the bumper is going to be 2 inches.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.590
Now we will go ahead and show you how the
hitch is installed on the vehicle.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.660
0:22
The first step is to go ahead and lower the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.660
exhaust.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.120
There are three exhaust hangers that we need
to remove.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.749
We will spray them down with some lubricant
and then we can go ahead and remove them.

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.579
There is one behind the bumper and two behind
the muffler.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.360
We just use a pry bar to remove the rubber
hanger.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.370
Then do the same thing with the remaining
two.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.020
Before we disconnect the last hanger, we will
go ahead and put a strap onto the exhaust

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.809
to help hold it up and then we can lower it
as we need.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.460
Now we can show you where the hitch is going
to mount up to the frame of the vehicle.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.840
These three holes here, they are threaded
and since they have been out in the elements

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.000
for a while, we are going to have to clean
them out.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.030
Also, on the passenger side, the hitch uses
this tow hook.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.830
Okay, we will spray it down with some lubricant
first, and we will take a hitch bolt and run

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.220
it in and out a few times to help clean it
out.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:23.939
Now the older the vehicle is, the more trouble
this is going to be, so you may have 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:02:10.570
to use 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:48.920
a tube brush.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:08.100
