00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.120
As we entered the 21st century,
we were told

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.000
that it would be fantastic,
we will have it all.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.400
We will have three robots on Mars.
Which we have.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Up there, they are safe from us.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.000
To use the language of poetry:
What is going on on this planet

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is like being in the 12. century
and not in the 21.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.000
TOMO KRIZNAR - HUMANITARIAN RIGHTS DEFENDER, ACTIVIST

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.340
I feel a crisis. A complete crisis.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.820
ERVIN HLADNIK MILHARCIC - REPORTER FROM THE CRISIS AREAS

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You can write the most radical nonsense
about the Middle East and nobody denies it.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.700
ERIK VALENCIC - JOURNALIST, TRAVELLER, ACTIVIST

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.940
I want to discover stories,
which are hidden in statistics,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
which are not presented
by the mainstream media etc.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.000
I came to the conclusion
that nobody can understand me.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They all had their fixed ideas
and perception which are mostly untrue.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.000
And we all take it for granted;
Yes sure, we saw this on Youtube.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The situation is actually far more terrible.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We have the impression of knowing,
but we don't know.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What kills you spiritually,
socially and culturally here,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
exterminates those below you.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Because of your never-ending hunger
for more, for better and better things.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.500
I mostly blame the media
for the Zeitgeist of our time.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.000
And most information comes from
the same source, 2 or 3 agencies.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And from the Internet.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.240
Journalists are being reduced to working
as translators and not journalists.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
News translators from English to Slovenian.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.000
In short, what AP, Reuters
and others wrote etc.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If you want to understand the world,
you have to see and know.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Actual people and organizations
dictate the tempo of thinking.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They also tell us how to think about
the world and how to understand it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We should instead open our hearts
and try to understand them with our hearts, too.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Then, our mind cannot mess around.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.760
CHAOS OF THE WORLD
