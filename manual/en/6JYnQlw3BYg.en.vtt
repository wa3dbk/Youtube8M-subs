00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
(The family lake at ACE in West Virginia’s 
New River Gorge is a great - and free - way to spend your time.)

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
(This video shows you why free doesn’t mean cheap at ACE.)

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.114
ACE lake is great

00:00:11.114 --> 00:00:14.861
because even though ACE offers all kinds of fun activities

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:16.904
for adults and children individually,

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:20.016
the lake is a place that they can 
 come together and have a good time.

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:22.262
There's so many things the lake offers.

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:24.567
There's great inflatable toys to play on,

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:27.307
fishing, a water slide, zip-line,

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:29.675
It just has so many things to offer you.

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:33.205
- We certainly picked this place because we wanted to do something outside

00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:35.445
and active because we have three little boys.

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:37.915
And we wanted something that would keep us all very busy

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:40.651
and it certainly has been that and more.

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:43.096
- The scenery out on ACE Lake is great.

00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:45.929
The water temperature is awesome during the summer

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.669
because it gets heated up and stays warm all the time.

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:51.932
So we've just got this really tepid, great water.

00:00:51.932 --> 00:00:53.685
- I've got a four year-old and a five year-old

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:55.960
and they love to come out here and swim all day

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.003
and do the zip-line and the slide.

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.186
We can't get them off the trampoline.

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:01.440
- The blob is the best part.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.901
You put one guy on the end and then the adult jumps off

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:05.817
and the kids fly off the end of the blob.

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:08.034
So the blob is a big favorite.

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:09.567
- I like the iceberg.

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:14.211
I like the climbing up and when you get 
 to the top I love sliding down it.

00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:16.719
- My favorite thing is probably the slide

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.412
because it's just fun diving down the slide headfirst

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.827
and then just diving into the water.

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:27.214
I also like the zip-line because it's like dropping off a cliff

00:01:27.214 --> 00:01:30.697
and not dying so it's fun to fall down, I guess.

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:33.344
- At first I didn't want to get in the water

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:36.038
but then I got used to it and it was nice.

00:01:36.038 --> 00:01:38.406
The water was really clear and I wasn't scared at all.

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:39.474
It was really fun.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:42.680
For the first time, I liked it a lot.

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.400
- People really love to end their day here at the ACE Lake

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:49.670
because it's really a great place to unwind and have fun.

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:53.920
It's just a relaxing time to play around with your family and friends.
