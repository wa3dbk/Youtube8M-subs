00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:23.940
Hi! Just a few days are left till the Championships kick off in Kazan. And we still have more water sports to tell you about. Lets focus on diving today.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:46.240
The most important thing in diving is to win. And in order to win, you have to get the maximum points. While to get the maximum points, it requires the most complicated dives to be included

00:00:46.360 --> 00:01:00.120
into your programme. Sure, without any mistakes. There is a great number of different dives: forward dive, back dive, hand-stand dive, running dive, straight position dive, dives with somersaults and pikes

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:09.600
There are around 90 different dives from 10-meter platform in total, and around 60 dives from springboard

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:31.260
Lets mention apparatus as well.around 60 dives from springboard. Lets mention apparatus as well. 5-meter-long springboard has a lot of secrets, for example, its not made of plastic, but of aluminum, the same type that is used in air crafting

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:42.340
Special holes are located at the edge of the springboard to decrease the air resistance. The whole surface is quite rough to avoid slipping. And that’s not all.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:52.780
A special wheel is located on the side of the springboard, to change stiffness from 1 to 9 for maximum dive range.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:09.420
As for the 10-meters platform, its width shall be not less than 2 meters, and not less than 6 meters in length. Now its time for our sports pro to tell you more about diving.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.960
* Hi! Im Ira Chernykh. I do diving from 7 meters.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.120
You shall first climb 10 meters, sit there for like 10-20 minutes and look down. After that nothing can scare you

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.320
I have been diving since the age of 3, and im not afraid because its very deep in the pool and you cant hit the bottom

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.660
And in order not to hit the springboard or platform, you gotta listen to your coach.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:58.220
This is Vika. She is with another coach, but we are very good friends. She is diving 2.5 backward from 10 meters.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.200
It was a bad dive, because she didn’t twist it well and didn’t fold the body well.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:28.900
And she spanned as well. I know this girl too, we play together. I poured water on her from the bottle. You can already see that this will be a bad dive, because her legs are apart. Yes, she crossed.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.500
Now lets talk about diving at the Championships.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.140
For the past 20 years, only 10 medal events have been held traditionally.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:58.280
But this year team diving competition and mixed synchronized dives will be added into the programme.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.460
Last two World Championships saw Chinese divers winning all the way.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:25.600
China got 19 golden medals out of total 20. Our team only managed to get 5 silver and 1 bronze medals in Shanghai 2011 and in Barcelona 2013.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:39.500
However, our divers will be doing their best to oppose the long-time favorites. Recent European championships has put our team to the first place in total team ranking. And this fact definitely gives hope to our fans.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:58.300
Diving competitions will be held from july 24th till august 2nd at the Aquatics Palace. Tickets price range from 100 to 1000 rubles for finals. And its high time to purchase them right now.
That’s all for today! See you at the championships!
