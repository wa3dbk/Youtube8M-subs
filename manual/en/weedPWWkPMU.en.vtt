Hey everyone welcome back, today we'll be making "Minions" cupcakes inspired in the new movie

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.600
Use a cookie cutter that is the same size as the cupcake to cut out 6 circles of yellow fondant

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.300
Take one of your circles and place it on top of your cupcake to cover it

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.000
Repeat the same step for the remaining 5 cupcakes

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.880
To make the first cupcake, use an x-acto knife and a piece of black fondant

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.360
to cut out the shape that is shown in the video

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.460
Use a very thing brush and white food colouring to write the word "BANANA"

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.460
and to draw a border to the shape

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.540
Use a small amount of water to stick it to your cupcake

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.680
For the eyes, cut out different sized circles using round piping tips

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.820
You will need a big circle for the minions with one eye, and two small circles for the minions with two eyes

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120
For the goggles,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.240
cut out circles out of black fondant using a slightly bigger piping tip than you used for the eyes

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.340
The next step is to use the same piping tip that used for the eyes, to cut out a circle

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.940
This will ensure that the eyes fit perfectly inside the goggles

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.040
You will need a big goggle for the minions with one eye and two small goggles for the minions with two eyes

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.540
To make the goggles silver you will need a big brush and some edible silver luster dust

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.020
You can find them in any cake decorating shop

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.780
Put some water around the eyes and stick the goggle on top

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.860
For the minion with one eye, stick a big circle on top of your cupcake

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.580
Stick a semicircle of yellow fondant for the eye lid and a small brown circle for the eye using a bit of water

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.300
Use a black edible marker to draw the pupil

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.060
Paint a white dot to bring the minion to life

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.360
Finally use the edge of a round piping tip to indent the smile

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.160
For the minion with two eyes, stick to small circle on top of your cupcake

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.420
Stick two small circles of brown fondant for the eyes using a bit of water

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.820
Stick a semicirlce of black fondant to make the mouth

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.620
and use a very thing brush and some white food colouring to draw the teeth

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.520
The design for each minion is basically the same, you only have to change the eyes and the mouth

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.280
So you can do any face expression that you want

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.320
I will now show you other minions I made

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.180
Finally you will need to cut out strips out of black fondant

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.620
Use a ruler to make an indent in the middle of each strip

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.700
and stick them to each side of the eyes

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.300
This is the final result, if you've liked this video make sure to give it a thumbs up
