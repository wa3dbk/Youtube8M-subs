00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:14.500
It is 12 o'clockish and The Elder Wand has finally
arrived and I am...well I'm opening it really.

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:21.549
I ordered it from Play.com which took about a
day to arrive with the next day delivery thing.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:55.367
So first we've got the official Harry Potter Logo that
everybody on YouTube have been saying so I've known about it.

00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:03.947
I'm left-handed but there it is...

00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:06.524
The Elder Wand

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:10.809
It's very nice. I really like it umm...

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:22.133
It's very long actually, it's
umm...quite long, yep, very long.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.163
I shall uhh, I'll not do a review on it
because I don't know how I would do that.

00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:37.342
But ye, I really like this.

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:43.120
I'll probably bring it along when I go to
see The Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2.

00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:45.248
But ye...

00:01:45.274 --> 00:01:51.116
I'm really enjoying this and this is
my first wand from Noble Collection.

00:01:52.411 --> 00:02:06.362
So I plan on getting some more wands like this, I want to get Snape's
one or possibly Harry's wand as well and maybe Voldemort's Wand but yeah.

00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:08.220
Very Nice

00:02:08.293 --> 00:02:11.505
So I'll see you in the next video.
