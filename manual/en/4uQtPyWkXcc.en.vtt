bjbj Mike Chang: What's up Youtube! Mike Chang!
I have got a workout for you today, 5 minutes,

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.100
that s all it takes. So no excuses this time!
If you don t have time to workout, you ve

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.800
got 5 minutes, and if you don t have 5 minutes,
then something is wrong with you man, you

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.630
ve got to restructure your life. Just kidding!
But, 5 minutes, this is how we are going to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.230
do it today. We re going to do 30 seconds
of every single exercise, three exercises

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.960
total, nonstop if you can. What I am using
to keep track of time is catch my laptop right

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.950
here. This is actually the website here. It
s really hard to see, but it s www.online-stopwatch.com.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.800
s free. Go to Google, you type-in Online Stopwatch,
and this is how I keep track of time. Sometimes,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.970
if I don t have my laptop, I can also use
my cell-phone, or if you ve got a stopwatch,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.480
that will work also. So all you do is just
start it and let it run for 5 minutes. The

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.360
first exercise we re going to do is going
to be mountain climbers. We re going to do

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.590
30 seconds of that, followed by plank. And
after that, we re going to do knee to elbow

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.889
crunches; 30 seconds, 30 seconds, 30 seconds,
nonstop for 5 minutes. So killer for your

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:19.329
core, and pretty good for abs, and cardiac
because the amount of time is going to be

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.329
killer; so let s do that. If you re first
time doing this, you want to be patient with

00:01:20.329 --> 00:02:00.340
yourself, but it s going to be a tough one.
And I slow this one, as I mentioned both,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:47.049
this is working your abs and your core here,
little abs. Then up to your shoulder. Knee

00:02:47.049 --> 00:03:13.870
to elbow crunch, up here, elbows! Now, switch!
This is going to hurt tomorrow. Okay, you

00:03:13.870 --> 00:04:08.720
need rest guys? Take rest. Really good for
cardio, my abs are burning. Now, I am going

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:33.510
to try this whole thing without rest. If you
are doing this, you are probably burning calories.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:05:01.730
You guys, if you want, you can do this to
make it a little bit easier. Do this everyday

00:05:01.730 --> 00:06:32.260
if you can. You re working on floor; you re
doing cardio, so it s a little different than

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.740
working with weights. You can do this pretty
much everyday. Trust me, if you have got 5

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.000
minutes; that was pretty quick, right? So
it s really good, really good for your cardio.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.060
I am actually pretty proud of myself I didn
t rest, so really tough though, and you guys,

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.440
if you are doing this, and you feel like it
s a little easier, extend it another minute,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.170
or do another two minutes. The longer you
push yourself, the more calories you burn,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.150
the more core muscles you work, the more abs
you develop, and the better you re going to

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.100
look, better you re going to feel. Check out
the website sixpackshortcuts.com. I ll see

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.100
