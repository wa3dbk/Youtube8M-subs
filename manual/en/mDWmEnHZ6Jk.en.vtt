Joe: Today we&amp;#39;re going to install and
review part no.

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.100
GU11000 from Steadyrack.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.670
This is a vertical bike storage rack.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:29.460
This is all fine and dainty the way it is
but we can actually save some room by rotating

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:55.680
it to 
the side.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:09.939
As you 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:26.140
can 
see 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:02:00.060
we can go ahead and rotate it one side 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:15.860
or 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:38.600
the other.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:03:12.680
This saves us 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:42.880
a lot 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:58.480
of space.
