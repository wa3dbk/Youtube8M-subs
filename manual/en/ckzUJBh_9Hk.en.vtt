00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.040
Today on our 2012 Ford F350 well be installing
the Bargman Fifth Wheel and Gooseneck ninety-degree

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.550
wiring harness with 7-pole plug nine foot
long, part number 51-97-410.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.400
To begin with we will locate a position in
the bed that we will mount the wiring plug.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.669
In this case we went ahead and chose an area
on the side of the bed on the drivers side

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.509
just in front of the wheel well, and went
ahead and made sure that there was pretty

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.810
of clearance behind the inner bed wall.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.750
We went ahead and used a inch bit and put
a pilot hole.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.800
Next well go ahead and use a two-inch hole
saw to drill our hole.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.969
Now well go ahead and feed the wires from
the wiring harness through the hole pushing

00:00:44.969 --> 00:02:58.010
all the wiring through so that the plug will
sit flush against 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:21.950
the side of the bed.
