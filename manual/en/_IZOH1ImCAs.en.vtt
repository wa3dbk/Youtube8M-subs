00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.230
 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.300
Hi, welcome to the Daily Spin.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.500
I'm Steve, the owner of inlineskates.com, and with me today is the expert

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.650
with K2 skates, Mike Powell - the skate guru flown in

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.750
from Seattle specifically just to talk about this skate.
Yes.
And a couple

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.810
dozen others.
No, just this one, Steve, because this one's exciting.
Well then, what about those other

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.010
48 videos we've already been shooting today?
I don't even remember them.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.190
All right. I don't know what this skate's got but it looks fast. Look at the

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.310
colors on this thing. So, we got Boa, we got venting,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.380
we've got straps, we've got carbon fiber lower, carbon fiber upper, aircraft aluminum frame,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.570
the wheels are so big it actually sticks right through the brake, they got to make a hole in the brake

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.740
for this thing. We've got a different sized wheel in the back then a different sized wheel in the front.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.920
We've got the pro-bearing on it, this thing is the beep.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.010
Yep, nice beep there.
All right, talk about it.
So, Steve, like you said

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.190
I mean this skate is all that and then some. It's an exciting skate

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.400
from K2. You can see just in the colorway of this skate, you know what it's all about. It's about

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.590
the podium, it's about going first or finishing first.
Going fast.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.910
Going really fast. Yeah, that's why we have the cowbell. So, I'm going to start with closure first

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.070
on this skate. As you can see, you have a Powerstrap. That's going to 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.210
help engage this low-cut carbon fiber cuff which is the lightest cuff in the K2 line.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.400
It's also one of the stiffest cuffs in the K2 line. And then you have your Boa closure system.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.530
How does Boa work? Well, let me show you. You take your

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.650
Boa dial, you disengage it and you're able to pull forward and get your foot in the skate.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.720
When you want to close the skate up, you just push this Boa dial and twist,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.920
and this pulls from the bottom so you're getting an even

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.090
closure throughout the whole skate and getting a nice, snug fit. It's quite amazing

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.250
and then you latch up this Powerstrap and you are ready to go.
Mike, I'd just like

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.340
to say something. So, we've talked about Boa in other skates and I think the fact that K2 puts

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.540
this in their high-end, top-of-the-line performance skate proves that Boa

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.740
is not a gimmick and it's not just a recreational feature, it's a 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.970
performance-fitting product.
Yeah, I mean, if I could have Boa on pretty much

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.090
everything I own shoe-wise, I would. They are that good and they are that easy

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.160
to work with. I know you have them on your K2 snowboarding boots from what I heard earlier

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.350
and you're a big fan of them and I think anybody that's used Boa really, really believes in it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.510
and swears by it and we've seen that with customers who bought a K2 skate with Boa

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.650
they come back and back for it. So, when you look at this skate, some of the key features

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.780
here, you got this carbon fiber cuff so super light, super-rigid. It's going to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.970
give you the support you need. Carbon fiber base which is really going to transfer that energy

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.180
from your foot to this milled-aluminum frame and it's a performance Hi-Lo frame,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.340
so you get 110mm wheels in the back...
Which is the the biggest wheel out there,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.480
I believe.
Yes, it is the biggest wheel out there. You get 100mm up front 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.560
and what it does, it's, you know, it's speed with the back wheels maneuverability with the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.760
front wheels and you've got a big wheel set up here so you're going to go faster

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.940
than you're going to go on any other K2 skate. You're going to be hearing those bells as you start flying with it

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.050
and we've also got the ILQ 9 Pro bearing and this is the best

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.110
bearing that ILQ, which is made by Twin Cam, it's the best bearing they make and it's the only

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.320
bearing engineered for inline skating. So, you have the total package here not just the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.520
look but the fit, the speed, it's the best skate in the K2 line.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.690
Now, would you call this...the what's the top-of-the-line Ferrari?

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.790
I can't even make a monthly payment on one of those so I don't know.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.880
Well, I think you're going to have to put your glasses on and make your Ferrari noise here.
Oh, okay. Well, we do have a 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.060
Ferrari set of glasses her from '86 and whenever we pull out a Ferrari looking

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.250
skate, we pull out these glasses and there we go. So, this is the Ferrari

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.410
of skates.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.510
And I will say I think BMW's are better.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.700
Well, thanks for joining us. It's been a long day. We're sorry we're a little slap-happy on this video

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.890
We've been shooting a lot of videos today.
Lots of videos!
Mike, thanks very much for coming into town and helping

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.010
us out with these videos. Thank you at home for watching. This has been the Daily

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.050
Spin. Have a great day.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.833
