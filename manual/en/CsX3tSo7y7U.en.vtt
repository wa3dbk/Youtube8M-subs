00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:31.960
Saint Sarah, my protector, cover me with your
heavenly mantle.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.540
Move away the negativities that may want to
approach me.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:49.220
Saint Sarah, patroness of gypsies, we are
always on the roads of the world, so protect

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.120
us to illuminate our walks.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:10.670
Saint Sarah, by the power of the water, by
the power of Mother Nature, be always with

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.180
us through your mysteries.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:25.940
We, the sons of the winds, sons of the stars,
sons of the full moon and sons of the Father,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.070
we only ask your protection against the enemies.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.220
Saint Sarah, illuminate our lives with your
heavenly power, so that we have a present

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.659
and a future as bright as are the sparkles
of the crystals.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:51.939
Saint Sarah, help those in need, give light
to those who live in darkness, give good health

00:01:51.939 --> 00:02:01.920
to those who are sick, give repentance for
the guilty men, give peace to the people without

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.920
tranquility.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:14.180
Saint Sarah, by your ray of peace, health
and love, it can enter into every home at

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.230
this time.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.739
Sarah Saint, give hope of better days to this
humanity suffered so.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:30.549
Miraculous Saint Sarah, protectress of the
gipsy people, bless us all, that we are sons

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.540
of the same God.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.730
Saint Sarah, pray for us.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.570
Amen.
