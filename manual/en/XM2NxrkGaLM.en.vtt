00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.230
Hello everyone, today we are going to
open up our computer cases

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.509
and clean inside it. Does your computer
look like this?

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.940
or does your computer crash to desktop,
or having blue screen while playing games?

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.920
or having random textures pop up during
gameplay?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.350
well that may be due to overheating, and
only way to get rid of that

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.260
is, really open up your case, get your
hands dirty and clean all the dust

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.279
that's inside it.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.250
that's exactly what you're going to do
and hang along and clean your case with me.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.390
You're going to need two things for
this

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.300
One is a Philips screwdriver and the other one is a can of compressed air.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.890
You can get the can of compressed air from any store in your area,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.510
or you can get it from Amazon. First you
want to power off

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.530
your PC completely. for Windows 7 and XP you can do it from start menu.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.559
for Windows 8.1 you can do it from the
start screen.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.260
First shut down the power to the
computer. If your power supply does not

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.109
have a power button on the back side,

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.989
just remove the power cord before you
remove monitor cable, you want to unscrew

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.610
the cable.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.660
Turn them counter clockwise to unscrew and just pull it back.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.770
Ethernet cables can be a little trickier.
Push it from the top side

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.580
and then pull it back. Almost everything you see on this picture can be just pulled

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.440
back straight,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.300
but be careful with your cables don't
pull them too hard,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.400
make sure there isn't any screws
securing them to the case.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.990
once all the cords are removed you can
take your case to an area you don't mind

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.790
getting dirty.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.420
such as your backyard, your front yard or
even a balcony.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.740
Now the computer's ready to be cleaned you just need to open the case first.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.420
Looking at the back of the computer you want to open the screws that are.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.660
away from the motherboard connectors
which is going to be

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.740
the right side if you're looking
at the back side of the computer.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.740
Make sure you don't lose the screws.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.390
All cases open differently but

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.850
typically it will be, you slide back
side first.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.850
don't apply too much pressure you don't
want to break the case.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.640
and we get our compressed air.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.640
In short bursts just give it some air.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.000
Don't forget to put the screws back on.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.030
Now it's time to put it all back
together. First I'll start

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.230
by connecting the sound card
connectors. These are usually color-coded.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.470
Just follow the color code on this.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.140
black goes to black, green goes to green,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.170
orange goes to orange.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.370
Next I'll connect the monitor.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.250
Next I'll plug in my network connection. For USB cables, it

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.250
really doesn't matter where it goes. And
last,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.400
we connect our power connector.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.750
And now our computer is ready to go. You may want to check our website forfungaming.net

subject. If this video has been helpful
