00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.580
Now we're going to talk about Bunny Hop 360s.
Once you have your Bunny Hop 180s down, 360s

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.870
are pretty much the next logical step that
you can take. It's actually considerably different

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.080
doing a Bunny Hop 360 than it is doing a 360
off of a jump. It requires a much stronger

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.950
pop and it really I think requires better
form too because you don't have nearly as

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.810
much time to spin it so you actually have
to spin everything faster. The way that a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.859
lot of people first learn how to do Bunny
Hop 360s is by doing 360 Tail Taps on flat

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.580
ground which is when you do a 180, you land
on your back wheel and you don't let your

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.390
front wheel touch down. From there, you do
almost like a fufanu and pick up and spin

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.359
completing the 360. What that does, is it
gives you a better sense of continuing that

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.980
spin past 180 degrees so it's a pretty important
step to take and if you're having trouble

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.499
with your 360s, you might want to go back
to that step because it really as I said it

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:10.340
will allow you to regain a sense for the continuation
of motion throughout the spin. For me, I personally

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.780
think that the best way to learn Bunny Hop
360s is off of something flat into a very

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:27.070
close to flat ledge. The reason that I say
that is that it forces you to travel with

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:35.740
just enough speed to make it into that wedge
and what that does is it keeps you from whipping

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.030
around too much and it gives you more of a
sense of using a quick carve with your front

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.030
wheel to generate that type of spin which
is really going to be pretty helpful once

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.250
you start trying to do Bunny Hop 360s over
bigger stuff where if you're trying to do

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.340
them down stairs or something where you need
to control the speed a little bit more. If

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.310
you're trying to just whip them around standing
still pretty much, you're just not going to

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.560
learn to develop that same amount of control.
