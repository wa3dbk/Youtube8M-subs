00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.650
Spring means many things to people.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.619
The weather starts to warm up, the flowers
start to come out and most importantly, and

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.290
a new baseball season is about to begin.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.940
And with that new baseball season comes the
new entry in the Mlb 12 the Show series, allowing

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.590
us to live out our dreams of playing in the
show and what it would be like to actually

00:00:43.590 --> 00:01:00.379
see the Cubs win the World Series, because
it is never going to happen in real life.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.360
The Show series has become renown for its
realism, and this entry does not disappoint.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.310
Everything looks spot on, from the player
animations in the batter’s box, to the details

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.310
in the stadiums.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.729
It is almost creepy how close this looks to
the real thing.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.950
The series just keeps building on itself each
year at making the most realistic looking

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.990
games.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.960
The game has a new physics system for the
ball that sees more realistic reactions.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.200
The ball will now take random hopes and strange
turns.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.850
This just adds a level of realism that is
unprecedented.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.039
But we all figured the game would look good,
so what is different from this year to the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.039
last?

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.369
Well there have been plenty of gameplay tweaks.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.619
For one the game now has a brand new pitching
mechanic.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.420
It is called pulse pitching and is designed
to bring more realism to the game.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.590
You select your pitch, and when you move to
the location you will see a ring pulsing.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.310
The idea is to press X when the rings is at
it smallest point.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.770
Doing this will have you spotting your pitches
and making batters look foolish, while pressing

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.090
at the wrong time will leave you throwing
the ball in the dirt or makeing a wild pitch.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.630
The speed at which the ring pulses is dependent
on two things.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.120
One, the skill of your pitcher, and two the
confidence.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.760
If you have been getting rocked with your
curveball all night, its going to be harder

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.170
to throw it for a strike.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.900
This new system is great and brings a new
level to the pitchers, but there is still

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.489
the meter, classic mode and analog system
if you prefer those.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.510
The batting has seen the addition of Zone
Analog Batting.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.310
You now pick where you are going to swing
with the analog stick.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.150
It makes sense, as you will have to track
the ball whether inside or out.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:03.250
You can’t just go up there 
and swing anymore.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.459
There are plenty of modes to try out these
out on.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.830
Returning is Road to the Show and the incredibly
deep franchise mode.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.560
These have seen more refinements than changes.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.810
There is now a completely new mode called,
Diamond Dynasty.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.650
This is kinda of like the Ultimate Team from
Fifa, in that you are building a team based

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.070
on cards.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.840
You buy packs and train your players in hopes
of making a World Series caliber team.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.950
This is all online, with playoffs and more,
and is well worth your time.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.160
Also being added to the mix this year is full
motion control with Playstation Move.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.439
While last year hinted at this, this year
it is fully there.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:55.250
You can now pitch and hit with the Move controller,
making you feel even more like a major leaguer.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:13.879
They are fun for a while but will not become
your go to way of playing the game.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.310
Mlb 12 the Show keeps on improving in every
way.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.030
The presentation and commentary are spot on
and make you feel like you are controlling

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.410
a baseball broadcast.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.720
And the pitching and batting interfaces bring
even more ways to experience the show.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:44.099
Baseball is back, and Mlb 12 the Show delivers
it, in incredibly detailed and fun ways.
