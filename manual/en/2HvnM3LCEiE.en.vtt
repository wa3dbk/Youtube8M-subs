Hi, I'm Mike Lais. I behalf of Expert Village
we are going to go over some guitar tuning

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:14.429
techniques. Another common alternative tuning
is called Dad Gad, is basically the best way

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.750
to describe it and that's simply what the
strings spell out. When you have it finally

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.730
tuned it's going to be D, A, D, G, A, D. So
the way we're going to get this is just the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.960
way we've been doing it with drop D and with
open D tuning. We're going to drop our low

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:39.780
string to a D.
While we're doing this, again I'm going to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.320
be going below it and coming up, just like
so and to double check again you go to the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.079
seventh fret of the low string which is now
a D and that should match your fifth string.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:07.190
We're not there yet so just bring it up a
little bit. That sounds good. So now the next

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.700
two strings that we're going to change are
the second string and the first string. We're

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.500
going to take the second string, which is
tuned to a B right now and we're going to

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.220
bring that down to an A. The way were going
to find that is just by playing our low A

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:31.799
again and then just matching the pitch
and again, I'm always going to go below and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:44.320
come back. That's sounds pretty good. So now
that we have this beaming A, to find the next

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.990
note, all we have to do is play the fifth
fret of the second string and then we're going

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.159
to take that and that will be our new high
string which was an E and it's going to be

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:21.870
a D and so I'm going to want to go below it
and come back up. So now we have Dad Gad and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:31.361
when you strum it should sound like a suspended
chord. Just like that. That's your Dad Gad

00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:31.760
tuning.
