00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.649
Hi, I'm Joel Jones, I own Jonesy's Ink, we
specialize in customizing and restoring classic

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.710
cars and hot rods out of Richfield, Washington,
and today I'm going to talk about some of

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.580
the specialty equipment and basic tools that
you're going to need for your own project.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.419
What I'm standing right next to is your basic
milling machine. If you're going to be doing

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:25.670
any kind of customizing or fabricating of
any brackets for putting specific engines

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.279
in cars or converting different transmissions
or differentials, you're going to need to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.230
be able to drill holes, slot holes, and fabricate
special parts. And the best way to do that

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.140
is with a milling machine. It gives you dimensional
tolerances and three different axes--x, y,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.760
and z--by utilizing all the different levers.
In addition to that, it allows you to remove

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.859
material, shave things down with end mills,
put different surface finishes on different

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.200
materials, and alter the thickness with very
very precise accuracy. Less expensive substitute

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.969
is obviously a drill press, and you can get
pretty extensive drill presses with cross

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.780
slides and different feeds to kind of Band-Aid
your fabricating skills. The next specialized

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.369
piece of equipment I'm going to talk about
is the lathe. The mill is good for doing work

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.490
on flat pieces of material--aluminum, steel,
pretty much anything, you can even do plastic.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.600
The lathe on the other hand is used for turning
round parts. Dialing in the outside diameter

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.530
or the inside diameter of a bushing, cutting
threads, drilling holes in the center of round

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.229
objects that would be otherwise very very
difficult to do on the mill. You can't really

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.289
have a complete custom fabrication shop without
these pieces of equipment. Otherwise you'll

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.090
really really struggle to try to get the dimensional
tolerances that you need and therefore your

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.969
projects won't be as nice, things won't fit
quite as well, and everything will be sloppy.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.899
Other essential piece of equipment is the
hydraulic press. Basically, the press is used

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:10.000
to apply direct force to bearing races, acetal
bearings, anything that you need to force

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.700
on that you shouldn't be using a hammer blow.
Some of the things that you need to think

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.030
about if you're going to go out and buy a
press, they actually are fairly inexpensive.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.150
This one is a pneumatic press, which means
that it uses air pressure to actuate, but

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.801
a lot of them you can go out and get are manual,
they just have a little bottle jack that you

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:35.810
apply, you just pump yourself. You need to
take some time and try to accumulate some

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.300
of the special tools to go along with the
press. The most common is what's called a

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.830
bearing splitter, and these come in all different
sizes and they're an absolute must if you're

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.380
trying to remove bearings from different shafts.
In addition to that you need different types

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.060
of material, like I've got a bunch of brass
cylinders here that you can put underneath

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.140
of the press to apply a force directly onto
a bearing or a shaft or anything else. Also,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.790
aluminum blocks. Anything that takes up space,
because inevitably when you're pressing on

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.659
something, your geometry isn't going to be
accurate, and you need spacers to take up

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:21.191
the slop. In addition to that, you also need
an assortment of old bearing races that you

00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:28.530
can put over things to press down on. And
I always keep, any time I get a strange size

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.800
of bearing that I replace that wears out,
I always keep the races and throw them in

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.140
here on the press so that if I ever run into
something that needs a special size to push

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.581
on, then I've got it. The next piece of equipment
I'm going to talk about is an absolute shop

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:49.530
must, whether it's in your garage or you have
an external workshop, every single shop has

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.170
to have some type of compressed air system.
This one is a pretty big compressor, it's

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.909
a seven and a half horsepower motor on it,
and it puts out about 180 PSI. Every single

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:07.790
shop, whether it's any size, has to be able
to blow tools are, blow parts off, and run

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.180
air tools, whether it's a sandblaster, an
impact gun, or any of the other small tools.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.830
This air compressor is absolutely indispensable,
and you should not try to tackle any kind

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.710
of a restoration job without some kind of
compressed air. A piece of shop equipment

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.980
that I would also consider a necessity is
the TIG welder. T-I-G stands for Tungsten

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.080
Inert Gas, and this by far is the most versatile
welder that I've got. It'll weld aluminum,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.450
stainless steel, mild steel, any kind of material
that you really want. It takes a lot of skill

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.910
in order to be able to do this effectively,
but it's versatility is worth any investment

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.380
that you're going to make in it. Obviously,
expense of the piece is may exceed what your

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.970
average hobbyist will want to do, but if you're
going to be extensively working with stainless,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.140
or aluminum, then you must have a TIG welder
in your shop. The next piece of equipment

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.420
I'm going to talk about is a plasma cutter.
Now a plasma cutter is kind of... I would

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.940
classify as a specialized piece of equipment
because it's not absolutely necessary, but

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.430
boy it sure really speeds up the process when
you have to cut any kind of metal. Basically,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.490
the plasma cutter you hook up to the compressed
air system and you plug it into the wall and

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.890
then you can cut through any kind of thickness
of material you want. Whether it's rusty metal

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.450
you're cutting out of your floor pans, or
if you need to cut a piece of sheet metal

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.210
to make a new patch panel for your project,
a plasma cutter will do that very very well.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.770
Plasma cutter can also sometimes substitute
other tools, like a shear. If you use a guide

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.180
and you run the torch right along the guide,
you can cut sheet metal very very quickly

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.730
with almost no warpage at all, and have it
be almost as good an edge as a sheared piece

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:02.070
of sheet metal. Most of the time plasma we
use it to cut off rusty bolts, shear sheet

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.900
metal with it, and cut out rusty sheet metal
because of the speed that it has.
