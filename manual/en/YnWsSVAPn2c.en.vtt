&gt;&gt; Lebon: Welcome to the University of Texas!\

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.409
&gt;&gt; Jeanine: We hope you'll make the decision
to go Greek.\

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.339
&gt;&gt;Austin: There are a lot of rumors and stereotypes
out there about joining a fraternity or sorority\

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:15.289
&gt;&gt;Nathan: So we asked members of the Greek
community,\

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.480
&gt;&gt; Lindsey: To tell you the truth about being
Greek at UT.\

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.480

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:38.480
&gt;&gt; Dulce: I 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.090
went Greek because I wanted to get involved
on campus, and um, just with a closer group

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.640
and make the UT Community smaller.\
&gt;&gt; Emily: When I came into UT I realized,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.800
wow this school is really big. And I needed
to make some friends and feel a sense of community

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.110
to make it feel like a home not just a big
school.\

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.110
&gt;&gt; Kanishka: I went Greek because when I came
to UT it was just so overwhelming. Like, it's

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.790
such a big campus and community and I was
trying to find my own inner circle.\

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.080
&gt;&gt; Milam: That sense of brotherhood or sisterhood
from joining a fraternity is unmatchable.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.381
If you need somebody to go eat lunch with
you can call up one of your friends. If you

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:17.830
need somebody to go study with you can call
up one of your friends. There's always somebody

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.330
to turn to, uh, when you have that community
from being in a fraternity or a sorority.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.330
\
\

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.330
[music]\
\

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.729
&gt;&gt; Greek life has been at UT for a hundred
and twenty nine years.\

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.049
&gt;&gt; There are over sixty five different chapters\
&gt;&gt; With over five thousand total members.\

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.390
&gt;&gt; That's thirteen percent of the undergraduate
population.\

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.780
&gt;&gt; So at least one out every ten students
in your class are going to be Greek.\

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.130
&gt;&gt; Coming to college sometimes you feel a
little lost, and school's so big. And maybe

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.710
you came here without all your high school
friends. And you're here alone and you wonder

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.880
like what am I going to do now? Who am I going
to hang out with? Or, um, what am I going

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.840
to do on my weekends? And in being a part
of a Greek organization, not only do you develop

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.119
friendships, but also like close friendships
that you can take away after you graduate.\

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.170
&gt;&gt; You know, walking around campus it's so
big, but then you see someone with Greek letters

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.009
on and it's just like it brings that immediate
connection, and I think that's what's so awesome

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.260
about it. It's like, "Oh, you know, I don't
know them, but they're Greek," so if I were

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.380
to go up to them and like just introduce myself,
it's like we already have that one thing in

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.700
common.\
&gt;&gt; Being in a sorority helps you become a

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.120
leader. It helps you become, um, a solid person
in the community, and people recognize you

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.099
for that.\
&gt;&gt; The Greek Community at UT really offers

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.980
you, um, a unique look into the, uh, diverse
student body that UT attracts, and the neat

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.739
things they want to do while they're here
at this university.\

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.739
\
\

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.919
&gt;&gt; A big part of being Greek,\
&gt;&gt; Is being the best Longhorn you can be.\

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:43.310
&gt;&gt; Whether that's giving back to the community,\
&gt;&gt; Or taking care of business in the classroom.\

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.989
&gt;&gt; Going Greek will ensure that scholarship,
service and philanthropy are going to be part

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.379
of your college experience. \
\

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.480
\
[music]\

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480
\
\

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.519
&gt;&gt; I've definitely done a lot more, um, service
by being in the sorority. Uh, prior to joining,

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.309
I did random community service events here
and there.\

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:07.620
&gt;&gt; I think being in a fraternity really reinvigorated
that, um, desire to serve others, and uh to

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.790
serve in a way that's very selfless.\
&gt;&gt; Getting to give back to the community and

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.590
um partaking in different activities that
help the Austin area. I feel like that's what

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.459
we're supposed to do as people in the community.
Give back and, and uh, share what we have,

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.629
our gifts, and, uh, make our community better.\
\

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.829
&gt;&gt; Each of the Greek councils recruits and
conducts membership intake differently.\

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.200
&gt;&gt; Some councils recruit in summer. Some wait
until fall or spring.\

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.179
&gt;&gt; And some organizations require credit hours
before joining.\

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:45.180
&gt;&gt; You should talk to council representatives,\
&gt;&gt; To learn more about the different recruitment

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.939
processes.\
\

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.699
[music]\
\

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.739
\
&gt;&gt; Ask questions, go to the GLIE office, uh,

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.139
research online. Just anything, um, but definitely
get involved. \

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.830
&gt;&gt; Ernesto: The main thing you want to do
is to talk to the people. You wouldn't, you

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.859
wouldn't buy a car without test driving it.
So in order to\'85 if you want to get into

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.430
an organization you should go talk to the
people. \

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.900
&gt;&gt; You should go through recruitment. Don't
be nervous. Uh, don't think that anything

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.949
bad is going to happen to you through the
process. That's not the case. Um, we're here

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:21.359
to accept you and to, um, get to know you
a little bit better and help you find your

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.729
home here at UT.\
&gt;&gt; If you want more information\

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.790
&gt;&gt; About how you can join a fraternity or
sorority,\

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.169
&gt;&gt; You can always check out our website.\
&gt;&gt; I absolutely think going Greek is a great

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.120
idea. I mean, I don't, I don't see why you
wouldn't.\

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.810
&gt;&gt; Go Greek! It's honestly one of the best
decisions that I made here at UT. It, umm.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.860
You just get so many friendships out of it.
So many leadership, umm, skills, and it's

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.241
honestly an amazing experience.\
&gt;&gt; I think going Greek, once again, is the

00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:52.460
best decision I ever made. Uh, you meet just
the neatest people, and the friendships you

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.039
establish now, uh, you know that they're going
to last forever. And, uh, you know there's

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.150
always somebody you can call, there's always
somebody you can turn to. Um it's, it's a

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.289
family. It's a home away from home.\
&gt;&gt; I think it's great that our college campus

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.669
is so supportive of having Greek organizations,
and encouraging us to put on more events and

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.860
also to like branch our diversity and network
together.\

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.610
&gt;&gt; I know I've made lifelong connections with
some of the girls in the sorority and they've

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.240
become some of my best friends. \
&gt;&gt; Being in a fraternity has really allowed

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.140
me to come out of my shell. It's allowed me,
uh, to see things in a different light. It's

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.600
exposed me to different areas of this, of
this, university that I never would have,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.090
um, maybe experienced.\
