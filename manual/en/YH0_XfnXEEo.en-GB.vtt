Oliver Brunt: It's been one hell of an eye-opener
and a great stepping stone to get into an

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.119
industry and I feel privileged to be here.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.119
Yes, I'm an industrial designer, but I will
be doing work experience PR, marketing, advertising.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.199
The thing I find the most impressive here
at McLaren is the whole brand identity and

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.660
how it's carried out through everything they
do. It's a fantastic experience and I got

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.769
to walk round in
a Skoda uniform and I'm quite proud of it.

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:55.769
Everything you learn here can be applied somewhere.
I've been spending my time with the product

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.069
planning team where I've been getting really
stuck in and sinking my teeth into a huge

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:08.069
project for them. I've gained contacts, access
and a reputation, almost. I've been gathering

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.780
such a wealth of knowledge, it's unparalleled.
It's changed my outlook on life. It really

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.299
has. I've done some amazing things. I've met
some amazing people. It's just been unreal.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.600
James Benson: Today, I'm going to be talking
to you about car theft. I'll tell you the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.819
problem I've found. I'll show you my solution.
And try to convince you of the business model

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.310
I've put in place. When you buy your car,
you pay for an optional extra and you buy

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.969
a dock. This dock would then go in your home,
that you can slot the key into, and this will

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.119
disable the car key. This means that if a
thief gets inside your home, they cannot take

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.450
the car. They can steal the dock, but they
won't get the car. To re-enable the key, you

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.079
can simply swipe your finger print and you
get a color change, maybe that's through like

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.129
an LED in the key or on the base of the dock
to re-enable your key.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:17.129
Jonathan Maynard: The focus, as you now can
see, is using, reusing exhaust gases in internal

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.870
combustion engines. So to get the first bit
of jargon out of the way, it's called EGR,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.870
which is exhaust gas recirculation. My system
adds an extra exhaust valve into the head

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.200
of the engine and that exhaust valve is purely
for exhaust gas recirculation. It improves

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.069
the real world fuel economy, reduces real
world emissions, so those all those

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.450
contributions to CO2 you can get, and it very
nicely has a strong synergy with downsized

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.349
gasoline engines.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.819
Roberto Antonio Pace: Today, I'm really pleased
to present to you my invention which is called

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.239
the Cylindrical Brake System. So my idea was
actually to combine the main advantages of

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:06.010
the drum and the disc brake, eliminating the
disadvantages of them. I can have a size reduction

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.720
of the overall assembly so it means also a
weight reduction. And size and weight reduction

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.709
means also inertia reduction. So the actual
dynamic performances of the car will be improved

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.689
because it's going to be more reactive, especially
in the cornering, and so the handling is improved.

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:32.860
James: I'm ecstatic. I'm very pleased to have
reached the final three, and to know all the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.939
hard work has paid off. I'm very pleased.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.510
Jonathan: I really enjoyed it. It hasn't sunk
in yet that, you know, that I'm actually in

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.959
the final three. I think I'll have to wait
until the night of the dinner before that

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.530
does. But just feeling really, really happy.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.810
Roberto: At the beginning, I was so nervous
because I was just thinking that I'm going

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.810
to meet the most important people in the automotive
industry. Suddenly, you realise that they

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.120
are normal people. [laughs]
