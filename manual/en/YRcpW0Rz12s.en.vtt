00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.719
It can be said that the importance of a vehicle’s system is directly proportional to the impact

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.380
that system would have on your life, if it
failed. So, how important is your vehicle’s

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.710
fuel system? Well, if you’re living with
limited mobility, anything that takes your

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.150
vehicle out of commission has pretty significant consequences. After all, borrowing your neighbor’s

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.880
car while yours is being serviced isn’t
usually an option. And the consequences of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.360
a vehicle fire caused by a fuel leak, well,
that’s serious under any circumstances.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.190
So, my point is, you really shouldn’t compromise
when it comes to the integrity and dependability

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.190
of your fuel system. It makes sense to ask
how the wheelchair accessible vehicle manufacturers

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.370
you’re considering, reintegrate the vehicle
fuel systems after they take it apart and

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.030
drop that floor.
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.520
As you can see, this manufacturer chose to replace the original fuel lines on this vehicle

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.000
as part of its original conversion. That actually makes good sense because, as you can imagine, dropping the floor

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.370
several inches would require the straightening
and re-bending of lines to configurations

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:30.370
other than those intended by the OEM. Twisting
and re-bending can not only stress the lines

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.250
but it can also lead to kinking and problems with both fuel flow and venting. 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:46.470
So, new is good, unless the new lines have inherent problems that could compromise performance and even safety.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.350
If you have a vent line that is made of flex tubing, it’s not a problem. 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.630
But high pressure hose going to the engine like this one isn't the best idea. 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.740
The size of replacement hoses and tubing is also an issue. An undersized

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.240
fuel filled tube can affect the vehicle performance so it’s probably not a good choice.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.140
And this line uses worm hose clamps on the end fittings. Tighten those the wrong way and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.850
you could have problems that easily result
in check engine lights or even worse, a fuel leak.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.340
And that’s not all. This manufacturer
uses what is called a p-clip to attach the

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.349
lines to the frame. The problem is that p-clip’s
require the use of self-tapping screws, screws

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.370
that burrow right into the vehicle frame,
and that creates exposed areas that invites

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.310
corrosion. Any attempt to remove those lines
can result in stripped screws and the need

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.310
to use larger screws or make new tabs to reattach
the lines. All of which set the stage for

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.640
more corrosion. But that’s not even the
biggest concern here. These fuel lines were

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.519
reattached so that they rest right against
the vehicle frame. That means that every vibration

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.069
causes wear on these lines and lines that
are under pressure, really shouldn’t be

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:17.769
exposed to wear. Now, to be fair, every manufacturer of a lowered floor vehicle has to relocate the tank

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.319
behind the rear axle, and every manufacturer has to meet certain performance standards.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.599
But, blunt as it sounds, they’re not the
ones sitting on the side of the road if that

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:37.139
system fails. In this case, what do you see? This tank has straps running from side to side.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.520
So what, if anything, will help to prevent
that tank from being pushed forward in the event of a rear impact?

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.460
Alright, let’s take a look at another manufacture’s fuel tank.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.219
What you wouldn’t know by looking at it

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:59.779
is the OEM of this vehicle actually had support straps running from front to back, but this

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:05.939
manufacturer turned the gas tank, and of course the support straps, ninety degrees.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.900
So now the straps run from side to side. Totally contrary to what the OEM did. Why?

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.799
Is there a good reason? On a more positive note, this manufacturer doesn't use hose in the fuel system,

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.310
and that’s a good thing. These are
steel lines, and that’s better from and

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.310
engineering perspective. But then, you see
something like this. This is an evaporation line,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.350
and it circles back and rubs against
the body right here. It’s not routed right

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.190
and there’s too much excess. It looks like
they made it fit, as best they could, which

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.940
if you ask me, isn’t good enough. It’s
a short cut in your fuel system.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.690
Unfortunately, as we move forward you can
see that we have the same issues with the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.910
fuel lines that are attached to the vehicle.
P-clips, self-tapping screws, and even though

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.650
this manufacturer covered the lines with corrugated
plastic in what looks like an attempt to provide

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.000
a degree of protection, there’s nothing
in there to keep the lines from rubbing up

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.570
against each other. And over time, you’ll
get debris and moisture in there, and after

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.220
a little wear and a crack and a bend in the
coating, you could get quick corrosion on

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:30.380
the fuel lines. So, it looks good, but it’s
not. And it’s not what the OEM designed in the system.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.740
So how do you improve on what we've seen here?

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.740
Well BraunAbility takes what some would say as a more aggressive approach to their fuel system conversion. 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.380
Not only in an effort to
hold the OEM’s original design and construction,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.090
but also to overcome the challenges that are inherent to lowered floor vehicles. 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:00.380
For example, BraunAbility replaces their fuel lines from the jumpers of the engine, all the way back,

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.480
and as you can see, they’re nice and straight. Where bends are needed to follow the contour

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.100
of the undercarriage, they’re custom bent
to fit pre-designed routing. No straightening

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.320
or re-bending that can stress lines and lend
to leaks or failure.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:26.100
They also access the OEM’s tier supplier, meaning they have the same nylon pipelines, proprietary materials,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.820
quick connects and body locks that the OEM designed into the original system.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.570
Good design also lends to better fuel consumption and better control of emissions, so that’s a bonus. 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.480
And look at this, BraunAbility uses
Christmas tree style hangers that separate the fuel

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.810
lines from each other and from the frame,
so they can’t rub. The hangers themselves

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.400
are attached to the frame through holes that
are lasered, then primed and under coated

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.950
to make the metal around the holes more resistant
to corrosion.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.360
Now, even though everything up here shows
that significant attention to detail has gone

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.440
into the fuel system, here’s where I think
it’s most obvious: the fuel tank structure

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.440
itself has multiple gussets. This plate holds
the tank in, and then there are three straps

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.300
with bolts running from front to back instead
of side to side. And multiple billets show

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.200
solid effort to surround the fuel tank with
something of substance.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.950
No doubt, there’s a cost attached to what
you see here. BraunAbility invests significantly

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:39.450
more in their fuel system. But you might
want to ask yourself, why BraunAbility would

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:46.110
go to such great lengths and expense to design
and build a fuel system this way? Especially

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.230
when many consumers assume all vehicles are essentially the same. 

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.600
Why would BraunAbility work so hard? 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.840
Maybe a better question is why doesn't everyone?

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.750
The choice is yours.
