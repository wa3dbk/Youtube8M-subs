00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hello, and welcome once again

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this is TheFNDC.com

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Jöhnny Dîablø, and today we're making

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
a Godiva Truffletini.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
All you're really going to need is White Chocolate Godiva®,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
dark Chocolate Godiva®,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and whatever vodka you can get, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a higher end,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
a high end vodka is fine.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm using Smirnoff, this is just what I've got.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I don't stock like fifteen types of vodka. Okay.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[claps hands together]

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So, we've got...I just chilled this martini glass,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I just had ice water in it and I just threw it out, so okay.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A shaker full of ice, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we're going to add one ounce of your chocolate Godiva®,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
[pours liqueur]

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and a half an ounce of your white chocolate.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:16.000
[unscrews cap, pours liqueur]

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And also a half ounce of your regular vodka.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
[pours vodka]

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Alright, there we go.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
OK, and we'll just shake and strain it. Pretty simple.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Pretty basic.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:45.000
[shakes drink]

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Okay. That's nice and cold.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Alright.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Strain it out.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[Strains Truffletini]

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Look at that. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Looks pretty good.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
[Ice falls]

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Lost some ice, that's okay. Alright.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Okay, and then...

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it says garnish it with a truffle, I just got a piece of the chocolate

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
...that's gonna have to do.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Okay, let's try it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
[sips Truffletini] 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
...mmmm.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's sweet, 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 it's chocolaty,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
it has a little hint of vodka.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That's not too bad. Alright,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
