00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.630
Hi!

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.630
This is Kathleen Heuer,

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.290
with another Facebook tip for you today.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.810
Today, I'm going to show you

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.070
how to control the privacy

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.500
on your photos.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.500
So as you can see,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.889
I'm here on my profile page.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm going to create a new status;

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.940
this one's going to be a photo.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.429
I'm going to upload the photo that I'd likeâ€¦

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.169
which'll take me a moment here to find.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.439
Here we go.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.439
It's uploading.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.059
And I'm going to paste some text to go along
with it.

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.520
As you can see,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.520
it's just a photo and a quote.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.300
Okay, now here's where

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.210
I'm going to change the privacy.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.050
Down here next to the post button,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.080
you have a drop-down menu with some options.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.540
The top option is public;

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.300
that's the world icon or the globe icon.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.120
Below that, you have friends.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.100
You can choose friends except acquaintances,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.870
if you have a list of acquaintances set up.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.921
Facebook might even do that automatically
for you,

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.190
so you should go ahead and check that.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.290
You can also choose "only me;"

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.289
you can set a custom list of people

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:07.950
that you'd like to share this with,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.549
or you can use your friend lists,

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.819
if you have those set up, as well.

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:14.360
So for right now, I'm going to choose

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.340
friends only, and I'm going to post it.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.649
Okay, so there's the new post.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.810
That's what it looks like on my page.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.619
We will flip over to the news feed,

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.520
and I'll show you what it looks like there.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.619
Okay!

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.109
There you go.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.750
So right now, you can see down here,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.350
at the bottom of the picture,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.479
there's a little icon with just two people
in it.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.490
That means that only my Facebook friends can
see that.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.009
But if I want everyone to see it,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.079
I can go ahead and change it to public.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.420
But let's say for right now, it's still set
only to friends.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.969
And I decide it's so great,

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.810
that I'd like to share this with a group.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.979
So I go ahead and hit the share button,

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.740
and I'll do it in a group.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.100
And I'll choose the group that I'd like to
share it to.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.340
Now, you'll notice here at the bottom we get
a little warning message,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.600
with a yellow triangle.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600
It says,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.360
"Some people may not be able to see this attachment
because of its privacy settings."

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.410
That's because I have it set to share only
to friends,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.560
and I'm going to share it into a group.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.830
So right now, the way I have it set up,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.130
it's only going to be visible to my Facebook
friends who are in this group.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.280
So I'll go ahead and share it,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.400
and then we'll go ahead and find the group

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.300
so I can show you what it looks like there.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.430
Okay, so here it is in the group.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.030
We, of course, can see it, because it's ours.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.270
However, anyone who's not a Facebook friend
of mine will get,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.700
instead of this lovely photo, it will say
attachment unavailable.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.550
[sad trombone sound effect]

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.700
We don't want that to happen,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.540
so we can go ahead and fix that very easily
right here.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.920
We can go up next to my name,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.830
right above the text of the post, and select
this icon.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.330
Right now, it's the icon of two people, which
is the friends icon.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.700
We can change it to public, we can change
it to only me,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.400
we can change it however we'd like.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.320
But in this case, we'd like to be able for
everybody in the group to see it,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.850
so we'll change it to public.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.910
Okay!

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.900
And with that change, now everybody can see
it.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.460
This has been another Facebook tip for you
today.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.440
