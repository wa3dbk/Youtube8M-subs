Well welcome everybody, my name is Lars Erik
Robinson, and I'm with a company called LarsEr

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.900
Arts All Around Art-Tainment. And today we're
going to talk about how to paint with oil

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.170
pastels. I have an oil pastel kit right here,
what's amazing with oil pastels is basically

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.140
it's similar to watercolor pastels but it's
more of in an oil form. And you can take this

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.210
and be more opaque with it, for example if
I know this person has blue eyes, I could

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.030
take right in there, smudge it on like that,
take another bit of my thinner, for example

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.390
I want to have a blue background here. So
I'm just going to paint the blue in there

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.149
with this, it gives it a little bit of a texture,
but if I didn't want to have that texture

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:59.550
like that, I can literally take my thinner
and go onto it and it would blend it out a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:09.229
little more. Still leaving a little bit of
texture but oil pastels generally are great

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.740
for working with a canvas and creating that
texture, or usually when I do my paintings

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.439
I want it to be half and half. You probably
can't see it on the screen but there's still

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.249
a little bit more of an effect there, and
then once I have the mineral spirits or the

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:32.560
thinner on there I can take this again and
go onto it and it blends on there. I was working

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:41.189
on the eyes here. So oil pastels are a great
way of being able to add texture to something

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:49.450
you're working on, to be able to work with
a surface that you're working with. So usually

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.899
I try to - when I work with a color I have
blue here, I have a little bit more blue there,

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:06.609
I want to repeat my blue again on one other
corner. Maybe we'll make a swirl like that.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.250
So hope that gives you a little bit more explanation
of what oil pastels are, they're basically

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:18.860
like an oil in a stick form and you can use
them with your oil paintings as technique.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.330
Thank you so much for joining me, I'm Lars
Robinson and keep on painting.
