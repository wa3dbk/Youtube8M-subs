00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:11.960
Cool intro music

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.199
very cool intro music

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.250
What's up guys this is Cody here and
today we're going to be taking a look at this

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.730
awesome little scooter. Now first things
first we do want to take a look inside

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.879
the box just to show you guys what we
get there's actually not too much you'll

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.510
notice that we get a charger which is
obviously very important and next we

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.600
have the uses manual. Fantastic. Now under
the styrofoam we have the scooter itself

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.940
which is actually a hefty 27 pounds, so
if you run out of battery out on the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.940
road with this thing
hopefully you're very close to a vehicle

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.730
because carrying this thing around is
not going to be that much fun. So if you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.729
guys have looked these up online before
they don't really have a name so I'm

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.909
just gonna be calling it a scooter
throughout the rest of the video. Now for

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.549
this first clip I was actually gonna
show you guys me stepping on the scooter

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.280
for the very first time I thought it'd
be funny, but it wasn't really that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.240
entertaining because I nailed it like a
BOSS! but my friend on the other hand,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.200
didn't and you can tell by the look of
his foot [eww] they didn't have a very great

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.310
first experience but let's go ahead and
get into the review. So the first thing

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.400
you're going to notice about this thing
is how responsive it is. Basically you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.080
lean back to brake, you lean forward to
go, you shift your feet left or right

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.799
depending on which way you want to turn
it's really simple very natural feeling

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.499
as you can see and it's very responsive
I mean you can tell that I am very agile

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:40.289
on this thing just by you know shifting
my feet a little bit

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.189
it's even got those cool little lights
right there just to kind of show off you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.969
don't really need them they don't really
work very well I mean if you're in a

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.289
really dark house or hallway then it
works a little bit but they're really

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.399
just for show now in terms of battery
they say that you have a 10-mile range

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.030
on a single charge but I didn't really
have that type of range especially

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.479
outside just because I mean if you're
going up and down hills it's going to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.079
wear on the battery a whole lot more
than if you're inside inside it seemed

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.679
to last a very very long time so just
keep that in mind

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.190
so if we take a closer look at this you
can see that I've actually scratched the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.850
hell out of this thing
just from riding it around now this is

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.920
from you know hitting curbs rolling over
concrete you know you name it I've ran

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.430
this thing into everything you'll even
notice paint marks from inside my

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.790
apartment but you'll see right up here
that we actually have some bumpers on

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.019
the top you don't know what those are
for when you bail off this thing going

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.400
ten miles an hour this thing
going to roll so it's actually just kind

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.520
of as a protector for this wheel well
right here I mean this thing is not made

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.890
to be pristine and I mean if you ride
this only indoors it's very possible you

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.310
can keep this thing looking really nice
but of course I have not done that

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.970
notice that though the build quality is
actually very good it holds up really

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.230
well I mean this thing was rolling
around like crazy even the wheels I mean

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.460
these aren't air tires so you're not
going to get a flat it's a solid rubber

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.840
and it feels very solid and premium and
right up here this is where you're going

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.650
to get your light indicator so if we
roll this thing around so right here on

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.530
the back we have the power button so you
have to press this every time you want

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.340
to turn it on it actually goes into
sleep mode if you leave it on it's not

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.760
very long either probably like five
minutes or so so that's really nice

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.690
because it conserves battery now right
next to that we have the charging

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.630
station so this is where you're going to
charge it but if we turn this on you'll

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.470
notice right here that were going to get
a battery indicator basically telling us

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.520
that we have a good battery now if it's
getting low it's going to start flashing

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.630
red and beeping at you so just keep that
in mind that kind of gives you a little

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.830
pre warning that this thing is going to
die and I would want to be on this thing

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.000
you know going 10 miles an hour when it
dies I don't know what happens so you'll

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.180
also notice right over here that we have
an indicator once we put our feet on

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.440
there so if we put this on here you want
that to go green because that's

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.300
basically saying that they're connected
and that you can ride it now if this

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.080
thing is red then you want to hop back
off just because this thing has not

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.190
connected to this side so it can be a
little wonky and kind of jack you up and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.510
you probably are going to fall until
this thing syncs up on both sides now I

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.140
probably could have got a free review
unit from one of these companies like IO

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.940
Hawk or air board but I didn't want to
advertise for them because their pricing

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.370
is ridiculous I mean I think IO Hawks
around 1,800 bucks and air boards $1,000

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.810
I mean you can grab this off of Amazon
for like 400 bucks that's what I paid

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.310
for so you can get a good deal on one of
these you can even go to Alibaba if you

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.860
you know you're familiar with that
there's going to be a little bit cheaper

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.240
but I decided to just go through Amazon
you know and have them backed me up but

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.480
more or less these are all the exact
same product the only things you're

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.350
paying for is a brand name so you
probably don't want to do that you want

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.530
to stick with the one probably from
Amazon I'll link the cheapest one that I

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.310
can find in the description below if you
guys want to check it out so if you were

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.750
to ask me do I recommend this I would
say absolutely I mean if you're trying

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.770
to decide between the Apple watch and
this scooter I would say hands down

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.420
buy this scooter just because it is a
ton of fun and in my personal opinion I

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.530
get a whole lot more utility and fun out
of this scooter than I do out of my

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.970
Apple watch so that's just my opinion I
mean I ride this thing every single day

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.930
at some point during the day just
because well I mean it's fun even just

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.560
riding around the apartment if I'm going
from my computer desk to the kitchen I

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.570
mean literally that far I'll just hop on
this thing and ride it over so I kind of

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.050
stepped out of the box and did something
a little bit different for a video not

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.260
iPhone relate or anything like that let
me know what you guys think about this

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.680
type of video in the comments below of
course you guys want to see more videos

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.010
like this on different types of tech
then make sure you hit that like button

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.280
to let me know alright guys I'll catch
you in the next video peace
