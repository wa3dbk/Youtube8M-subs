Hi! This is Roy Stringfellow for expertvillag.com.
Our next step in building our coil pot is

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.920
after we’ve placed the bottom of the pot
into the form that we’re going to be using,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.279
what we’re going to do is take a tool like
this and begin scoring around the edge of

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.699
this bottom. We want to make just little deep
marks around here. What this is going to do

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.520
is allow the first coil, along with the slip
that we’re going to place on this, to bond

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:46.650
a little bit more solidly with out pot. Get
a little of that oil off of there. After we’ve

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.920
scored the bottom of the pot, what we’re
going to do is actually make our first coil.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.930
If you remember, what we did was place the
clay into the extruder. We’ll just simply

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:07.560
operate the extruder this way and squeeze
out a piece of clay or coil, cut it off here,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.970
set it aside. In order to help this, what
I’ll do is take this coil and sort of pinch

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.580
the end of it. Get it ready and take some
of our clay slip with these little sausage

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:32.550
type sponges. Get the slip on the sponge and
place it around the edge of this clay bottom.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.381
Now we’re ready to put on…it doesn’t
have to cover it completely, but now we’re

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:42.450
ready to put on the our first coil. What we
do with this simply take the coil and make

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.570
sure that it’s pressed against the inside
or the top part of the bottom. It’s a little

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.940
slippery with WD40, but if you do this you’re
going to be glad that you put that on there

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.290
because this clay will stick to the side of
whatever you choose to put there. Now the

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.670
other thing that we do, right at the very
end of our coil what I like to do is make

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.020
sure that I put a little bit more of the slip
right here, which will help, and I should

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.720
have scored that a little bit, but it will
help the two clay bodies attach to each other.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.700
Then I’ll take this little instrument and
make sure that the clay is pulled down on

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:35.569
top of the coil that’s there. So if you
look at it, this is the very basic beginning

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.031
of what we’re going to call our coil pot.
