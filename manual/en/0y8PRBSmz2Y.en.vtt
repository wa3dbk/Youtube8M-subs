00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.950
Hello this is Heather for Expert Village continuing
on with the bridal henna design that we've

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.290
started. We have most of the hand filled out
and now we're doing the fingers which we'll

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.190
be doing with vines and those are made up
mostly of swirls and some leaves and some

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.470
dots. Draw the bases of it and then go in
with leaves after. Again with the same dot

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.290
and pull method that we used in the lotus
petals. Now that we've got the bases of it,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.940
we're just going to put some little dots in
there. We'll stick to three dots since that's

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:48.540
what we did around the lotus. So that's one
finger and we're just going to do the same

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.880
on all the fingers trying to make it come
out from one of the points of the petals if

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:35.189
we can. So again just doing the same swirls
and leaves on every hand kind of sticking

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:44.310
with the same amount of swirls per finger.
Make each one grow out from the line and swirl

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:59.009
before it. So now we finished the henna design
and it looks fairly complicated with all of

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.720
the vines and dots and lotus and the paisley
and the peacock but I did just want to point

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.209
out that this is very simple as far as Indian
bridal henna goes. Typically it can take as

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.760
long as an hour or two just to do one hand.
Typically we would fill in the spaces that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.409
look empty now so that it looks like a complete
laced glove.
