00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.800
We all know the importance of airport security.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.940
So as you head through the checkpoint this
holiday season with food and gift items,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.820
we here at the TSA hope you'll keep in mind
this friendly gift guide

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.400
to the 12 banned items of Christmas.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.880
Otherwise your local TSA agent might give
you an enhanced pat down.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.840
So what is a 'gel?'

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.380
Here at the TSA we've just decided to ban
most of your holiday favorites

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.460
but it's not that simple.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.980
Take this avocado, solid food, absolutely
legal to carry on.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.120
But then, guacamole,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.500
tasty but also an officially prohibited TSA
gel.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.980
You can carry on a cherry pie, but you absolutely
cannot bring the cherry filling alone.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.900
Now we're safe.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.970
You cannot bring a 1 inch pocket knife, or
other TSA designated thrusting weapons,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.360
except vibrators.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.160
You can, however, bring metal scissors with
pointy 4 inch blades

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.860
or giant steel knitting needles.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.360
Please, do not thrust here-

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.600
or here.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.060
If you're looking for a gift with an edge,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.580
just remember that you can't bring anything
with a blade, like a corkscrew.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.680
You can, however, bring ice skates.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.020
Don't worry, the human skull is slightly harder
than this.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.720
Sometimes sporting goods can be dangerous,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.520
for example, TSA designated sporting bludgeons,
like this wiffle ball bat.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.520
Fortunately you can take titanium tennis rackets.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.060
We all know that you can't bring a pool cue,
but you can bring a fishing rod.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.260
But what should you get the bowlers in your
life?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.980
You cannot bring a bowling pin, but you can
carry on a bowling ball,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.220
because only the pin is a bludgeon.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.060
You can't bring a container containing more
than 3.4 ounces of liquid.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.740
Then again you actually can as long as you
label it breast milk.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.580
All better!

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.459
You cannot take a snow globe that's bigger
than a tennis ball.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.160
You can, however, take a giant globe that
is filled with water,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.640
provided that it also contains live fish.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.120
You cannot take even a single compressed CO2
cartridge.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.080
Unless you have a life vest, in which case
you can take 4.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.480
Remember that you can bring a single lighter
and/or matches.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.140
But don't even try to bring in two matchbooks
or-

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.040
We here at the Transportation Security Administration,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.059
would like to thank you for following these
rules

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.660
even though they've never stopped a terrorist.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.880
Much like Stanta Claus, we only make you more
secure if you believe.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.820
Happy holidays from the TSA.
