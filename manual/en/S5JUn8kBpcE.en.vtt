00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.700
So now we can take our paper template and we can lay it on the wood and make a mark

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.200
...the cutting edge and the bevel on the tool as the wood is peeled away

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.060
...here that the bevel is riding on the wood and it produces these nice long curls and leaves a real nice surface behind it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.640
...notice that the base is wobbling little bit
here so I'm going to support with my left hand

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.040
and for the finishing touch we'll add a bit of color

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.430
...roll it in here, I'm gonna work...

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.740
...stabilized red Box Elder and these are mainly pen blanks

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.600
...alright, we're gonna clean it up here now with a skew. Make sure you...

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.920
...let's take a closer look here, again, just plunge in there nice and...

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
...now go ahead and sand each one, start with your...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.540
...this will have kinda have a  purple and white color to it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.900
..that the lathe and the rag produce, gentle pressure

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.560
notice where I've got my hands - well away from the blade and also if for some reason

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.900
...so bring the lathe up to speed

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.920
...the green wood really cuts really quite nicely here

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.460
...short plunging cuts

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.140
...grits, all the way up to about 400 we now need to sand the bead

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.580
...work it in - a good heavy coat here, and this is the first coat of several coats

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.310
...the same kind of a cut

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.630
...that's where it's real critical

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.920
...now we're going down to the pencil mark that we have

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.260
...just give it a little tap, that is the MDF, give it a little tap on the ways of the lathe and that'll just pop the bowl out

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.720
all we have to do is turn a recess, it
will fit the back the clock

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.060
and we'll expose the face and then we shape wood
however we would like

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.180
...and then I'll border the cove with a bead on each side just for some detail

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.880
once we get this recess turned to the right size

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.160
the back portion of the clock should fit in the recess snugly

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.000
...we'll use a bevel rubbing shear cut here to roll this side

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.220
...but I'm being careful to avoid sanding off any crisp corners

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.940
...prevent any lacquer getting on the bed of the lathe

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.960
finally we can put our clock face back into position

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.750
...stem and around the body  of the top to help support it as it cuts through

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.360
The tool that we're using here is a 3/8" diameter deep fluted bowl gouge

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.640
as soon as they start turning a bit
golden in color, they are ready to take out of the oil
