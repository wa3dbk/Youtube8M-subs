00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Ears, Mind, Body, Part 2 with Paul Katz

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I can't tell you how much thinking you should be doing

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
versus how much listening you should be doing,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and it shouldn't be versus, they kind of go together. All right?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But it's the listening that you want to develop.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Before you walk out on stage you say,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
"Okay, I am going to center myself, and I am going to listen."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And I have, for myself, I started to develop this thing when I walk out on stage,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I imagine myself that my ears grow very, very large.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is true.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And then those ears are like a vacuum cleaner and they get suction,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and they start gobbling up all the sound so that no sound can get away from them.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If the ears are really controlling what you're doing here, and you're well trained,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and you're well trained, and you're prepared, you don't have to think that much.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The brain hovers around, it's there if we need it,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and I know, for example, some of it's preplanned.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll go out on stage and I'll say,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
"Okay, when I come to this shift, I'm gonna remind myself to bring my elbow up."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I actually will preplan something like that,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but, basically, I try and get to myself to the point

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that I can just go out there without a lot of conscious thought.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I have definitely walked off stage many, many, many times,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and I can't actually remember what happened,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but there's something inside that is just like, it was great.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
People are so nervous they kind of black out,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and they don't think, and they don't feel, and they don't hear.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That can be a disastrous situation also,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
but what I'm talking about, and I think you're talking about too,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it's a place that you can go on stage and in performance

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
where your senses are more aware, where your listening is keener,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
where your feelings, where your connection to the cello is more intense

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
than just kind of this day-to-day reality where we're sitting here and talking about it.
