Hi I am Tess.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.590
Welcome back to the Sweet Treats series.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.510
In this episode I am going to be making a
delicious cranberry spiced jelly.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:21.880
[music]
So to begin I have got some cranberry juice

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.880
here.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880
I have got some sugar.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.880
I have got some spices.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.970
So I have got a cinnamon stick, half a teaspoon
of ginger and a couple of cloves and all of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.750
those are going to go in to my pan straight
away.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:44.010
So that is a pint of cranberry juice going
in, cinnamon stick, the spices, the sugar,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.080
and then we have got two oranges so I am going
to go in with the juice.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.320
Don't worry about any pips going in at this
point because are going to sieve it later,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.760
the juice.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.450
For the full list of ingredients and the method
just check out the description box.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.160
The oranges and the cinnamon, the blackberry
and the cranberries all work really nicely

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.160
together.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.900
They are very Christmas-y, very festive.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.200
So the next thing to go in is the orange zest.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.220
All of that goes in, there we go.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.120
Now I am going to put this on quite a high
heat and I want to bring it to the boil.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.030
This will take about five minutes to do.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.140
Okay, so the jelly has come to the boil and
I have turned it off and I am going to leave

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.430
it to sit and cool slightly, just for like
10-15 minutes.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.640
So now my mixture has cooled slightly for
like ten minutes.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.090
I am going to sieve it into my jug right here.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.619
There we go.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.080
And to that I am going to add my jelly.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.299
You can just rip it up a little, or try to
rip it up anyway.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.209
Just to make it melt a little bit easier.

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.009
There we go.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.289
This is so much fun to play with.

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.320
Just give that a little mix and it will melt
into a mixture.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.889
You can set your jelly any way you want.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:07.460
I am going to be setting mine in champagne
glasses because it looks a little bit fancy.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.570
So my jelly is cooled quite a lot now.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.050
It is nearly at room temperature and before
it sets I want to pour it into the molds I

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.920
am going to be using.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.620
So I am going to use four but I have got two
of them here.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.769
I am just going to pour that in there.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.110
And I am going to do this for two others and
I am going to pop them in the fridge now because

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.260
they are cool enough so that they will set
quite quickly.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.980
If the mixture is still hot wait for a while
before you put it in the fridge because if

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.120
you put it straight in the fridge it will
mess around with the temperature and you do

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120
not want to do that.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.670
So I am just going to pop these two in the
fridge until they are set.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.099
I have just taken my jellies out of the fridge.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.180
They are nice and set now and I have got some
fresh cranberries here which I poached in

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.879
a sugar syrup so that is just water and sugar
and I brought it to the boil and simmered

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.140
it for about ten minutes or so and it has
broken down the cranberries and it has made

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.829
them a lot sweeter.

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:19.260
So I am just going to put a few cranberries
in the top of the glass of jelly like so.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.540
And then I am just going gently dust it with
icing sugar, just for a little bit of festive

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.209
fun.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.209
And there you have it.

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.560
These are my delicious Christmas jellies.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.370
I know you are going to love them.
