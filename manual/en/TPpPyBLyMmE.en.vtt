00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.160
Today on our 2007 Mazda CX7, we&amp;#39;ll be
installing the tow-ready trailer wiring kit,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.649
part number 118249.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.210
This kit is designed if you have the OEM tow
package.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.510
The OEM factory tow package port is actually
located at the right rear of the vehicle.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.740
When you pull the cover off, you can see the
wire is bundled up and actually has some black

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.050
tape holding it in place.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:48.640
It is the white plug 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:01:46.270
that we&amp;#39;ll be 
plugging into.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:02:21.939
We&amp;#39;ll first go ahead and 
set 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:51.390
off 
the spare tire 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:18.980
cover lid.
