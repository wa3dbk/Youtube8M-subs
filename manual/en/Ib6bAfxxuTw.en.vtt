00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:01.162
- Well hello everyone!

00:00:01.162 --> 00:00:03.969
My name is Tyler Oakley
and today I wanted to just

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:05.492
do a little update video because

00:00:05.492 --> 00:00:07.803
there's been so much
happening in my life this week

00:00:07.803 --> 00:00:11.807
and I felt like I have been
neglecting on filling you in

00:00:11.807 --> 00:00:13.630
as to what I'm doing like day to day

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.221
and so

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:16.311
here we go!

00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:18.122
So on Sunday I got to
do some Grammy coverage.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:20.989
I did a live stream, and
it was like four hours long

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.162
which felt like forever but
like while I was doing it

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:24.542
it felt like 10 minutes,

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:27.631
with Pop Sugar and I got
to host their live stream

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:29.501
viewing party and it was really fun

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:31.507
and I had special guests
and things like that.

00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:33.425
So many of you guys tuned in
so thank you for watching.

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:35.246
If you wanna see that I think there

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:36.849
are clips over on Pop Sugar Girls Guide.

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:37.928
The link is below.

00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:40.540
But I also got to film
right after I did that.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.209
I got to go and film some
Grammy's after show stuff

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:45.579
that was on TV Guide channel so that

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.901
was on TV so thank you for watching that

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:48.666
if you saw it.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.187
I was tweeting about it
and a lot of you guys

00:00:50.187 --> 00:00:52.023
were sending me pictures
and screen shots and things

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:53.520
like that so to me it's really fun because

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.483
I get to tell like my
family and friends from home

00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:57.664
back in Michigan like "oh
tune into this and you

00:00:57.664 --> 00:00:58.779
"can see me on TV."

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:02.041
And to them it's like crazy
cool and it's crazy cool

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.480
to me but like to them it's just like

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.428
I get to do something cool
that people just at home

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:10.099
can't believe and I'm like
yes, that's cool I can do that.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.058
Over all I liked the
Grammy's although I kind of

00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:16.286
just wish that there were
more queens of pop there.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:17.889
I mean yes, Beyonce and Katy were there

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:19.468
but I am also here for like Miley,

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:22.834
and Britney and Christina
and Gaga and Demi and Selena

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:25.102
and Fifth Harmony and all of my queens.

00:01:25.102 --> 00:01:26.376
I just want them all there together

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:27.595
and Rhianna and Kesha.

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:28.395
Did I say those two?

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:29.314
I don't know if I said them.

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:31.194
But like every queen of pop
I just wish the Grammy's

00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:32.145
could be about them.

00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:35.908
I understand there are
other genres of music

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.391
but I'm just over here
in the queen of pop land,

00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:39.935
let me just live there happily.

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:41.955
(sigh) That is what I love

00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:44.335
but honestly I died when
Beyonce was writhing up there

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:46.111
because surf boards okay?

00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:47.471
It's all you need to know.

00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:48.991
Surf boards.

00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:51.627
Speaking of queens of pop I
got to go to the Miley Cyrus

00:01:51.627 --> 00:01:53.913
Unplugged concert with my buddies Ricky

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.734
and Conner and JC and Mandy and

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.032
we got to sit front row
which was pretty amazing.

00:01:59.032 --> 00:01:59.985
I love Miley.

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:02.633
She was probably the queen of pop in 2013.

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:05.766
It was great, her live vocals
were basically incredible

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:09.082
like I haven't heard somebody
just deliver live vocals

00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:12.161
like that in forever so
I really appreciated it.

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:14.856
Miley, congratulashayla,
you were incredible.

00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:16.157
Also speaking of the queens of pop

00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:18.338
I got to host a Fifth Harmony event today

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:19.953
which was pretty insane and epic.

00:02:19.953 --> 00:02:21.136
Things that I never thought I would do

00:02:21.136 --> 00:02:22.796
especially considering
I was rooting for them

00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:23.702
back in the day.

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:24.980
Back on X Factor when they were

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.292
going by like LYLAS

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:29.018
and what else were they called, 1432?

00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:30.052
And things like that.

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:31.492
I have loved them forever

00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:33.058
and Miss Movin' On is incredible

00:02:33.058 --> 00:02:34.999
and Me &amp; My Girls is incredible

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.629
and I got to go host this
event which basically

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.707
consisted of me doing a Q &amp; A with them

00:02:39.707 --> 00:02:41.228
and hosting the live stream and

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.468
introducing the girls
to sing brand new music.

00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:45.292
I guess it's like it boggles
my mind that I get to do

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:46.825
stuff like this because I just it,

00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:49.632
I adore them and the girls are incredible

00:02:49.632 --> 00:02:51.943
because yes they are talented and stylish

00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:55.148
and beautiful and kind
and nice and just amazing.

00:02:55.148 --> 00:02:56.924
Overall generally amazing which

00:02:56.924 --> 00:02:58.886
a lot of celebrities are
but I think my number one

00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:01.371
quality when I think about
my favorite thing about

00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:03.843
any celebrity is their presence

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:05.666
and if they're there when
you're talking to them

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:07.407
and you can tell that
they're paying attention.

00:03:07.407 --> 00:03:09.949
That's my number one thing
and a few celebrities

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.261
have had that with me.

00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:12.492
Like Darren Criss has had that.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:16.810
Fifth Harmony has that and
the artists that have that

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.061
I think are the thing
that sets somebody apart.

00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:21.025
So I loved that.

00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:22.604
Thank you for tuning in
if you watched the event.

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:24.566
It was really fun and I
hope I get to do a lot

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:25.970
more things like that because that type

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.131
of stuff is fun to me.

00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:28.930
I also had a couple
collaborations come out this week.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.484
I did one with Puppet Sloth
which is a sloth puppet.

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:33.690
Obviously.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.781
But basically it's about
a puppet that is a sloth

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:38.044
who interviews you about
a cause that you enjoy

00:03:38.044 --> 00:03:40.390
and I don't think I've
ever laughed that hard

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.130
in a interview.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.849
I think it says something
about how thirsty I am

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.519
because even in a collaboration
with a sloth puppet

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.526
there was still sexual tension somehow.

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:52.081
I don't know how but it happened.

00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:53.788
The link to that is below so go click that

00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:55.181
and check it out and give it some love.

00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.503
I also did a collaboration with

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:58.860
my boys Scott and Mitch from Superfruit.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.007
They are two of the boys from Pentatonix.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.226
They are hilarious and incredible.

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:04.688
We did a Q &amp; A and their
cat crawled all over me

00:04:04.688 --> 00:04:06.000
and that was super fun too.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.821
You get to hear me sing if
that's of interest to you.

00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:10.621
The link to that is also below.

00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:13.407
And I did an exclusive
interview in my apartment

00:04:13.407 --> 00:04:14.715
with my buddy Paulo.

00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:17.093
He interviewed me and asked
me some really good questions.

00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:19.265
So if you ever want to see
a more in depth interview

00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:21.226
that's a little longer
with a little game in it

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:23.585
you can check that out and the link

00:04:23.585 --> 00:04:24.745
to that is also below.

00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:26.429
It was really fun so
give that some love too.

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:27.927
What else happened this week?

00:04:27.927 --> 00:04:29.505
The Fault in Our Stars trailer came out.

00:04:29.505 --> 00:04:32.605
Basically I felt every
emotion and then I immediately

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.796
got on Twitter and yelled at John Green

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:37.459
and told him that he made me cry again.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:39.416
So thank you John Green
for making that happen.

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:40.987
What else is happening in my life?

00:04:40.987 --> 00:04:42.911
I know I'm doing something tomorrow!

00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.374
I'm literally an idiot.

00:04:44.374 --> 00:04:45.836
Tomorrow I am headed to New York.

00:04:45.836 --> 00:04:47.495
I am getting in an Uber bright and early.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.471
Heading to the airport

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:50.317
and getting on a flight to New York City

00:04:50.317 --> 00:04:53.978
and I'm gonna go and try to enjoy the cold

00:04:53.978 --> 00:04:55.979
even though it's freezing I'm sure.

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.244
I have been told to
pack my bags really well

00:04:58.244 --> 00:05:00.820
with warm clothes because
it's freezing still

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.237
apparently on the East Coast.

00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:03.503
Things we don't have to deal with in L.A.

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.337
But I'm going to the
Super Bowl with Pepsi.

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:07.636
I got to go with them last
year and it was super fun.

00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:09.806
I got to meet Hunter Hayes and
be in a Beyonce commercial.

00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:12.022
And this year I am headed
there with a whole bunch

00:05:12.022 --> 00:05:13.462
of fun surprises so if you want to

00:05:13.462 --> 00:05:15.445
see exclusive details as to what I'm

00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:16.373
doing at the Super Bowl,

00:05:16.373 --> 00:05:19.066
the link to that is below
and there's gonna be a

00:05:19.066 --> 00:05:20.412
whole bunch of fun surprises so

00:05:20.412 --> 00:05:22.247
be sure to follow Pepsi on Twitter

00:05:22.247 --> 00:05:24.384
and track the hashtag #pepsihalftime.

00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:26.532
I am gonna be tweeting
with it along with like

00:05:26.532 --> 00:05:27.843
Facebook updates and Instagram updates

00:05:27.843 --> 00:05:29.051
and Twitter updates.

00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:30.851
I am gonna be letting
you know every exclusive

00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:32.871
detail as to what I'm
up to at the Super Bowl

00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:34.983
with Pepsi and a whole bunch of YouTubers

00:05:34.983 --> 00:05:37.665
so stay tuned it's gonna be a fun weekend.

00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:38.988
I'm really excited to go back to New York.

00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:40.126
I love New York.

00:05:40.126 --> 00:05:41.403
I love anytime I get to go to New York.

00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:42.529
It's really fun.

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.085
I have no clue who's even
playing in the Super Bowl.

00:05:44.085 --> 00:05:46.737
Honestly I didn't even think about that.

00:05:46.737 --> 00:05:47.824
I am rooting for the half time show.

00:05:47.824 --> 00:05:50.331
The Pepsi Halftime Show is
always great and Bruno Mars

00:05:50.331 --> 00:05:52.026
is performing and last year it

00:05:52.026 --> 00:05:54.128
was Beyonce which slayed
so I have no doubt

00:05:54.128 --> 00:05:56.948
that Bruno Mars is going to
deliver above and beyond.

00:05:56.948 --> 00:05:57.888
I love Bruno Mars.

00:05:57.888 --> 00:05:59.991
Plus he's like my height
which I appreciate.

00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:01.325
Nobody is our height.

00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:04.027
I am like five foot
nothing so you know what?

00:06:04.027 --> 00:06:05.571
Thank you Bruno Mars for representing us

00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:07.231
short girls, okay, thank you.

00:06:07.231 --> 00:06:09.912
P.S. I am so excited,
you guys, next week I am

00:06:09.912 --> 00:06:11.990
going on a little trip but also what's

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.013
happening next week?

00:06:13.013 --> 00:06:14.649
My buddy Korey is moving to Los Angeles.

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:17.552
I moved to San Francisco
with him back in the day

00:06:17.552 --> 00:06:20.396
like three years ago now to
San Francisco from Michigan.

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:23.785
And I moved down to L.A.
and he stayed there.

00:06:23.785 --> 00:06:25.714
But now he is moving down
to L.A. to be with me.

00:06:25.714 --> 00:06:28.643
Not to be with me but like
to be friends with me again.

00:06:28.643 --> 00:06:30.391
We did The Best Friends
Challenge together.

00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:31.796
We did The Chicken Nugget
Challenge together.

00:06:31.796 --> 00:06:33.550
We've opened up a whole
bunch of fan mail together.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.012

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.247
Whatever.

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:58.093
If it's not you're gonna
have to deal with it.

00:06:58.093 --> 00:07:00.444
That's my new single, you're
gonna have to deal with it.

00:07:00.444 --> 00:07:04.605
And if you dealt with it push
the thumbs up button (laughs).

00:07:04.605 --> 00:07:05.834
Wait if you really did deal with

00:07:05.834 --> 00:07:06.833
it push the thumbs up button.

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:08.029
If you watched this long.

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:09.886
I wanna know who has watched
me ramble for this long.

00:07:09.886 --> 00:07:12.069
Push the thumbs up button,
that's gonna let me know

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:13.067
who has watched this long.

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:15.412
The rest of the frick frackers
they can just get, okay?

00:07:15.412 --> 00:07:17.770
