00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:12.730
Today we are at a Japanese restaurant and
it is the kind of restaurant where the food

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.700
just revolves around and you pick what you
want.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.540
Let's see what we find.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.540
Sushi!

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.520
Alright, so everything is completely self-serve.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.919
The different color plates mean different
prices.

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.300
I'm a huge fan of salmon so I will be eating
a lot of the salmon today.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:52.569
I chose the grilled salmon here so I'm going
to take a bit of this and see.

00:00:52.569 --> 00:01:02.210
That looks like a happy customer.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.030
I am happy.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.790
Here we have the menu of all different sushi
you can get.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.790
Is that plural?

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.600
Different kinds of sushi - that'll work.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.890
They are all different prices.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.229
There is a huge list, so it is basically you
go here and you eat as much as you want and

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.050
afterwards they stack up your plates and you
get a bill.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:37.860
It is time for me to try the salmon here.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.780
You look like you're really enjoying that.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.270
That is so good.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.611
This totally reminds me of when I grew up.

00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:52.609
I grew up on Vancouver Island, Canada where
I had smoked salmon all the time.

00:01:52.609 --> 00:02:12.480
My Dad would be smoking salmon in the summer
and this totally reminds me of home.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.959
I love it.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.879
Time to put it in my mouth.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.290
How is the raw salmon?

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:29.010
It is really good.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:39.909
There is my hot tea.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:50.810
That looks like water honestly.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.000
I don't even know what this is.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.900
It is supposed to be green tea but maybe not.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.720
What are you doing here.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.440
I'm making myself some green tea here.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.940
In Korean that is nokcha.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.080
I'm adding some green powder.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.739
We already have hot water here and I will
swirl it with a chopstick I guess.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.769
It certainly looks green.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:33.660
Yeah, that is some nice green tea.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.300
Alright, so six stacked plates.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.030
That is all of the sushi we ate.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.320
That is close to eighteen dollars.
