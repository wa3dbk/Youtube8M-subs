00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.320
The new 8.11 update is not large, but it brings lots of new features.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.400
A new game mode was added into the game.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.880
A new map was added, and several old maps were greatly changed.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.640
Learn more details from this review.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.520
A new game mode—Confrontation— was added in the 8.11 update.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.600
In this game mode, the vehicles of one nation fight against the vehicles of another nation.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.800
For example, German vehicles against American, or Soviet against French.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.800
Combinations vary, with one exception, though.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.040
Chinese and Japanese vehicles can’t battle in Confrontation mode at the moment

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.560
because not all types of vehicles are represented in their Tech Trees.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.080
Players can join the Confrontation game mode exactly the same way they do for Encounter or Assault battles.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
It can also be turned off in the Options menu.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.520
A new map—Windstorm—was added in the 8.11 update.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.800
It’s a beautiful snowy town with original architecture.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.480
The town is divided in two by a river.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.040
The bases are located on either side of the river.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.560
There are two main avenues of advance. You can attack through the town or use a bypass route

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.000
The bypass routes in the town provide different options for maneuvers.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.560
River banks are connected by the bridges; this is where the fiercest battles will take place.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
You can reach the enemy base quickly using a bypass route.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.880
There are plenty of places to take cover along the whole route.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.240
The third way to attack is along the river.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.840
But it’s quite risky, because there’s an open space where you will be exposed.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.200
Four maps—Erlenberg, Highway, Redshire, and Northwest—went through the rebalance changes.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.480
These changes are mostly aimed at making battles more dynamic and improving the balance of map sides.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.400
Redshire was changed the most.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.120
Bases were relocated, so now players set off in different directions after the start of the battle.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.520
For example, battle action on the first and second lines will now take place in the center.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.440
Vehicles won’t stay in the field near the south base for a long time anymore.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.280
The hill on the 9 and 0 lines was flattened.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.040
Also, a gorge appeared in this area, so it will be quite comfortable for heavy vehicles.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.720
This must bring more action to the right flank.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.600
The famous hill in the upper part of the map was divided into three parts, and a number of bushes were removed.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.600
Now, it won’t be so easy to stay on the hill and fire at enemy vehicles from behind the bushes for half of the battle.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.200
However, the hill is still a very important point, so teams will fight more aggressively to gain control over it.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.920
Encounter Battle mode seems very promising in the renewed Redshire.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800
The base is located on the hill.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.040
The relief shape provides cover right in the capture zone.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.680
Tanks with well-armored turrets and good gun elevation will do particularly well here.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.600
Team bases in Erlenberg were also relocated.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.200
As a result, the usual areas of battle action will also change.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.440
Now, players will mostly battle near the castle and around the buildings on the hill.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.400
The center of the map has been reworked.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.840
Many buildings were added.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.040
They serve as safe cover when players are driving from the base.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.840
Now, the central part of the map is a separate direction that particularly suits heavy tanks.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.160
Players now have more options to move from cover to cover.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.080
Fording points appeared near the north and south bridges.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.120
Changes in Highway were made for the benefit of the south base.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.320
The whole right part of the map was lowered.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.200
A steep hill near the north base was removed.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.040
The way from south base to the town has been flattened out.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.400
Now, you have to move much closer to spot enemy vehicles driving under cover this way.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.120
A new block appeared in the town. It will provide good cover for players approaching from the south base.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.440
Buildings are also located a bit differently.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.960
Now, controlling town streets from the north base is more difficult.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.320
In the field, there’s also additional cover for medium tanks.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.880
Plenty of bushes have been removed on each base.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.840
Now, there’s cover for 1-2 vehicles only, so players won’t stay near the base in the first minutes of the battle.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.840
Northwest. Some bushes were also removed, and ground relief near the bases was lowered.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.280
Now, it will be easier to reach and capture the enemy base.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.920
Another attack route appeared.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.040
There will be no massive battle action here, but this may bring an element of surprise.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.720
This area is connected to the way slightly above it.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.040
Players who control this area will be able to stop an enemy offensive below, or help their allies.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.680
Some other maps were also changed a bit. These changes won’t affect gameplay, and will only make them more atmospheric.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.120
In the 8.11 update, the BigWorld engine will be updated to version 2.4.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.360
This opens new directions for developing the game and allows us to use new technologies that you will see soon!

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.680
Attention! The game client functionality may be unstable with some computer configurations.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.040
On players’ requests, new interface features have been introduced.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.640
Now, you can look through the battle chat history.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.560
You can also turn off the chat in Random Battles.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.960
Crew management has become more convenient. Now, you can retrain, return, or send to the Barracks all crew members at once.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.760
The missions interface was also improved. Now, it’s easier to see the mission you need.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.600
Some other minor, but useful, changes were also made.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.760
This is all for now. Good luck on the battlefield!
