00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.601 align:start position:0% line:71%
Wonder what time it is?

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:05.038 size:84% position:42% line:68%
Just walk into this museum
filled with amazing clocks.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.208 align:start position:0% line:68%
And enjoy a few other
historic attractions.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.747
Dan: Spillville is a small town
with a rich Czech heritage.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:18.784
That also holds a special place
in classical music history.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.188
With its bed and breakfasts,
beautiful churches,

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:26.359
and fascinating museums,
Spillville and the surrounding

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:30.730
area offer one-of-a-kind
intriguing attractions.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.533
But on my way up to Spillville,
I had to first make a quick stop

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:38.404
to what some claim is the
world's tiniest church.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.776
Dedicated in 1886, St. Anthony
of Padua Chapel is presented as

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.779
the "Smallest Church in the
World."

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.515
Don't be fooled
by its 40 foot steeple.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.151
With its 12 ft.
by 16 ft. interior,

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:54.119
and pews for eight people,

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.722
Festina's tiny church
is a refuge for

00:00:56.822 --> 00:01:00.460
road-worried
travelers seeking solace.

00:01:02.528 --> 00:01:06.899
The Bily Clocks Museum and
Antonin Dvorak Exhibit has been

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:10.904
a favorite attraction in
Spillville for many years.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.306
Every winter for
more than fifty years,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:18.177
when they weren't farming, Czech
bachelor brothers Frank and

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.613
Joseph Bily passed the
time carving clocks.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:23.549
Their huge intricate
masterpieces feature fully

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.753
automated wooden
figures and music boxes.

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:31.857
and they're still ticking
and chiming today.

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:36.729
Director of the Bily Clocks
Museum, Carol, gave me a tour.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.635 size:81% position:41% line:72%
Carol can you tell me
something about the people
who created these clocks?

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:46.706
Well, Frank and Joseph Bily are
two bachelor brothers who in

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:50.176
their spare time in the winter
decided to carve clocks.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.946
They never sold any
or gave any away.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:58.384
Dan: The clocks depict history,
art, religion and culture

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:02.955
and are covered with hundreds
of beautifully carved figures.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:05.725
Now here is the history
of travel clock.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.961
This is very interesting.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.763
It has the various
means of transportation.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:14.700
And starting at the bottom
it's travel by water,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.538
then we have travel by land,
and then travel by air.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:24.277
And even the eagle at the top
of the clock is travel by air.

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:26.412
None of the clocks have
nails in them or screws.

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:29.515
Everything was glued together
with glue they made themselves.

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:30.716
Dan: They made their own glue?

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:32.351
Yes they did.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.787
Now there's a beauty
off to that side.

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:37.223
Tell me about it.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.125
This is the grand tower clock.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:41.460
It's one of their scroll
work design clocks.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.997
They used a jigsaw that
looks like a sewing machine.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.732
It was very difficult work.

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.634
They did seven of
this style clock

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.037
and then they changed to
their hand carving.

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:52.905
they have beautiful
inlay in here

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.141
that is really just
part of the wood.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.210
And beautiful rounded corners.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.181
I understand they didn't
really travel that far from
the Spillville area.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.384
No, they never left town more
than 35 miles in any direction.

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:07.720
And you can go out
town four ways here.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.255
In their entire lives?

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.824
Amazing.

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.827
Now I understand that
a rather famous person

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:16.429
had his eye on that clock.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.897
Tell me the story.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.866
Henry Ford sent scouts
around to find anything

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.402
with a clock or a music box in.

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:24.670
This had both.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.206
The Scouts couldn't get
anywhere with the brothers.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.875
And so Henry Ford came himself.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.076
They didn't sell it.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.112
They said if anyone
wanted to see this clock,

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:35.114
they would like them
to come to Spillville.

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:37.917 size:75% position:63%
I understand that Henry
Ford was willing to make
them quite an offer.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.118
He was.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:42.688
He was going to and did offer
them one million dollars.

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.891
Unbelievable.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.459
And truly the brothers
weren't in it for the money

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.562
if they turned down a million.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:52.799
It was all for their family.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.534
[cuckoo clock chimes]

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:59.672
Carol, I understand the Bily
Brothers weren't the only famous

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:02.675
people associated
with this building.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:06.846
I see one of their works here
that has the name

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.881
Antonin Dvorak.

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:14.153
Dan : World-famous musician
and composer, Antonin Dvorak,

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.557
spent the summer of
1893 in Spillville, Iowa.

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:22.929
He was lonesome for his
countrymen and so he came here

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.465
and invited his family here
and they stayed the summer.

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:33.972
This bust of Dvorak was
donated by the Czech Republic.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.775
There's one in the Czech
Republic and one here.

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:39.044
And they are the only
two in existence.

00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:42.281
Dan: While in Spillville,
Dvorak
composed the widely-known

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:44.517
"American Quartette"

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:48.120
and found the inspiration
for "Humoresque."

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.726
This is the organ that he
wrote his music on for the
American Quartet.

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:54.993
And this is a pump organ?

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:56.528
Yes it is.

00:04:56.628 --> 00:04:58.731
And he played it and said it
sounded better through the

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.833
windows in the houses
of Spillville

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:04.537
than it ever did
through any stage.

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.806
Dan : It was said that the
morning after he arrived in
Spillville,

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:11.177
he headed to the site
of Riverside Park,

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.078
along the Turkey River,

00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:15.114
to commune with nature and enjoy
the sound of birds and feast his

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:18.517
eyes on the beauties
of the region.

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:21.253
And I understand that he was
a pretty passionate organist.

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:22.522
He was.

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:25.057
He almost knocked the women
right off the seats he said.

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:28.961
Dan: According to Carol, Dvorak
played organ every day

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:31.297
at St. Wenceslaus Church.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:35.067
I decided that I needed
to visit St. Wenceslaus.

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.371
The oldest Czech Catholic
Church in the United States,

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.674
St. Wenceslaus was built by
the settlers who immigrated
to the area.

00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:45.111
The church was
completed in 1860,

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.147
and original pipe organ played
by Dvorak,

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:52.752
installed in 1876,
still remains.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.454
For me it's been
an enriching day.

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:59.620
Experiencing some
unique Iowa history in
a unique Iowa setting.
