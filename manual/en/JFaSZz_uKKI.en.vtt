00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.360
Hello. Look who is here: Su is here again.
And we made a nice meal. Take a look!

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:21.280
This is Persian rice with barberries, saffron
and an amazing yoghurt sauce.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400
This is what me made for you.
So, if you want to see how it's done, keep watching.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:40.760
We need: rice, brown suger, barberries, saffron,
butter, cream yoghurt??, mint, cucumber, dried dille and raisons.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.200
In order to make Persian rice, you need to use Basmati rice.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.880
And I use a smoked rice here because it has a great aroma.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.120
It needs to be washed first.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.400
You wash the rice so it doesn't stick
together later and becomes fluffily.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.120
After the rice has been cleaned properly it can be cooked.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.320
I used two cups of rice and three cups of water.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.520
Then, of course, add seasoning and a big lump of butter.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.240
Well, butter is a great flavor carrier.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.200
While the rice is slowly cooking,
we can soak the barberries in water.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.840
Then we are coming to our saffron.
We are pestling it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.520
After that, we are mixing it with water.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.280
Everything is prepared for the rice, so now for the sauce.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.280
First, cut the cucumber into little pieces.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.240
Very important: remove the core or the sauce will become too thin.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.160
Now cut the mint. I like it when the mint isn't cut too fine,
but everyone can decide that for themselves.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.480
Add the raisons.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.960
And the dried dille.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.160
Now mix it all together so that it becomes a nice sauce.
By the way, I also added salt and pepper, but you can't see it.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.560
In the mean time the rice has cooked
and you can't believe how good it smells.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.000
I put a towel over the rice to absorb the dampness.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.360
The barberries have become soft and the water can be poured out.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.440
Now we come to the last part before we start the arranging.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.720
For this part we use the evil butter again,
but it simply tastes so good.

00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:53.008
When the butter is melted put the barberries in the pan.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.160
SautÃ© it in butter briefly.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.440
Before adding the brown sugar.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.920
When the barberries are lightly caramelized, we can plate up.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.480
Here is the finished dish.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.640
As you've seen there aren't a lot of ingredients.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.800
This is really my absolute favorite rice dish.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.880
In Berlin there are a lot of Persian restaurants.
I don't know if there are Persian restaurants where you live,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.920
if there is, check it out. Because Persian rice is amazing.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.240
Yes, I have to say...

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.280
Even though I look like this, I'm not the biggest rice fan,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.800
but this rice is really delicious.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.400
Very good, but come. Let's taste it.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.280
- We couldn't taste it before because I had to set up the camera.
- I have my fork ready.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.840
Ok, here we go.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.880
- This is so delicious.
- It's so good with the saffron.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.064
- The barberries.
- Very good.

00:06:56.004 --> 00:07:00.920
We'll eat some more. If you would like to see the entire recipe,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.040
then take look in the description box.
Because Su had a blog called fraeuleinchen,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.120
... there you'll find all the ingredients.
- You can read up on it.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.520
If you make this recipe I would like it if you tag me
with #janinaandfood.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.800
Then Su can see it too.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.680
- Perfect. And with that we'll say goodbye and eat some more. Bye.
- Ciao.
- Very good.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.200
The.... uh...

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.200
Guess not. The.....

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:38.000
- Stop it Su.
- Ok.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.840
- Su, will you start?
- Yes.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.072
That's not... (???)
