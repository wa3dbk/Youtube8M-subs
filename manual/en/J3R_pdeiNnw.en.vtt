00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.339
How to Get a Baseball Player's Autograph.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.710
You say it's just for your son or daughter,
but you're still a kid when you're around

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.080
a pro ballplayer.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.550
Getting an autograph is like bagging your
prey -- here's how to do it without getting

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.699
clubbed with an autographed bat.

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:25.690
You will need Pen Paper Stamps Fan events
Ball games Audacity Community events Road

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.150
trips Internet access and child (optional).

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.150
Step 1.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.870
Research and network to find out where a player
lives.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.969
Don't stalk, but write a letter telling them
what a huge sports fan you are and ask for

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.399
their autograph, point blank.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.489
Step 2.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.899
Attend the fan events teams will usually put
on, like Tiger Fest in Detroit, where some

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.420
players sign balls, programs, and jerseys
and interact with fans.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.999
Beyond a small fee to get in, there are no
charges for autographs.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.069
Bring a child any time you try to get an autograph.

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:02.710
Borrow one from a friend or relative if you're
not a parent yet.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.790
Ballplayers are more inclined to connect with
them.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.090
Step 3.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.100
Go to batting practice hours before a game
and hang out in the box seat area near the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.979
dugout as they come out, watching them throw
and play.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.619
Joke with them when they roam nearby until
you get the gumption to pop the question.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.880
Step 4.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.659
Visit baseball card shows and pay for an autograph.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.280
Get some value added by asking them about
the game, rumors, and predictions.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.939
Have the items you want signed and the pen
ready.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.729
Make it easy for them.

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:32.850
Step 5.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.290
Meet the player at a community charitable
event, perhaps something for their own foundation,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.780
where you will also encounter other active
and retired players.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.720
Let a ballplayer have their privacy when they're
out and you happen to run into them.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.590
Don't intrude on them at a public place with
their family.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.729
Step 6.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.570
Take a trip to a minor league game to see
a player who is there during a rehab stint.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.960
They will be much more accessible -- possibly
pleased that someone remembers them.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.039
Step 7.

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.240
Catch the player outside the park long after
a game as they walk to the car.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.350
Step 8.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.060
Buy autographs online if all else fails.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.030
It's not as fun, and for all you know a machine
signed it, but the story you make up about

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.730
how you got it is still yours.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.459
Did you know Into the early '60s, Detroit
Tigers star Al Kaline regularly held free

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.349
baseball clinics for kids every Saturday morning
when the Tigers were in town.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.290
He invited pros from the visiting team to
teach skills, answer questions, and sign autographs

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.919
-- all for free.
