Hi! This is Megan with Beadaholique.com and today I want to show you how to make

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:13.880
this really fun

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.010
simple

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.779
stretch bracelet with these vintage flatback

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.230
plastic rhinestones

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.949
so our little

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.740
stretch bracelets are plastic

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.339
with a little cute

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:28.380
bezel cup

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.929
this is a twenty-millimeter

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.380
round and I have a little twenty-millimeter

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.570
flatbacks

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.540
one thing to know is that some of these
fit than better than others

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.440
but they do fit close enough. I think if
you just use enough glue, they work fine

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.570
it may not sit totally flat down in there

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.990
but it'll be fine and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.340
personally as quick and easy as this
is, this is the kind of thing that I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.290
would love and wear to death

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.100
all you need is some E6000 glue

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.970
your vintage flatback

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880
and your bracelet

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.270
it's

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.090
literally

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.760
one of the most simple things you could
do

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.479
you need eight flatbacks which is how
many come in a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.070
twenty-millimeter anyway, it's exactly
the right number to fit on your bracelet

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.880
put some glue

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.380
on the back and like I said don't
go crazy on there and have it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.999
oozing out once you put it on there

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.790
onto the bracelet but enough so that it's not

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.790
sitting totally flat it's still going to touch the glue

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.220
and just work your way

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.690
around

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.690
glue all 8 down

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.979
on these bracelets you may see the knots
poking out but that's

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.089
very very simple all you do is

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.689
reach in...

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.819
don't mess with it too much while it's still wet

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.969
so once it's dry, if you can see the
the knott you just

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.719
pull on there a little bit and get it to go
inside the

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.350
bezel

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.609
what I did the first time was I went
ahead and did

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.809
two or three at a time

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.639
because they do fall out

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:44.189
sit it for a few minutes to let the
glue set a little bit

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:51.189
do the next two or three and work that way

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.430
so once you get

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.629
all 8

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.869
of your flatbacks on

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.859
you want to let this dry

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.929
completely by all the way before you try to wear it

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.019
it's a good idea to let it dry

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.790
over nigh. Plus

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.909
the fumes will dissipate and you won't smell like E6000

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.469
glue

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.309
it's really simple, we have this stretch
braceletand the

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:29.469
silver color and the black color, so you
can pick

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:33.629
your favorite color of the twenty-millimeter vintage lucite flatbacks

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.709
and your favorite bracelet

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.999
you can get a different look depending on the
colors that you choose

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.210
that's a really fun

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.230
quick and easy project. Go to www.beadaholique.com to purchase beading supplies and to get design ideas!
