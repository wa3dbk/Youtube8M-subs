00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.670
What’s going on?

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.670
Little dap.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.960
It’s Jared Montz former pro and founder
of OnlineSoccerAcademy.com.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.380
Today in soccer school we are learning how
to play a killer soccer pass or through ball.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.219
This is what this soccer techniques looks
like.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:25.319
Soccer passing with A through ball is used
to play a pass behind defenders.

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:28.760
The pass cuts them out of the game.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.989
A through ball is mainly used in the attacking
third of the field.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.700
For this soccer academy video you will need
5 cones, a ball and a partner if you have

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.700
one.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.310
Exercise Player Can Do:
Set up 4 cones in a line about 15 yards apart.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.340
A start cone, two middle cones next to each
other that are your imaginary defender, then

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.960
an end cone where your attacking partner stands.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.620
The fifth cone is placed up the field angled
inside from your partner’s cone about 10

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.620
yards.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.330
Now, imagine you are dribbling across the
field and the defenders are moving across

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.330
with you.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.970
If you pass a square ball to your teammate,
have you done anything dangerous?

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.970
No!

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.320
The defenders just shuffle across and the
ball is still in front of them.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.540
This is where we want to play that killer
pass behind the defense!

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.350
So instead of passing square, pass behind
the defenders and tell your teammate to run

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.350
after it.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.789
Now the defenders are chasing and that is
what we want!

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:23.869
Do a set of 10 reps and then switch with your
partner.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.380
If you don’t have a partner, just imagine
you do and get use to the idea of playing

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.159
a through ball.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.049
Key Points:
Key Point 1.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.960
Disguise your pass!

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.060
If you turn your shoulders to play your through
pass, everyone will see it’s coming.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:56.670
Keep your shoulders facing your teammate when
you play this pass to throw off the defenders.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.649
Key Point 2.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.990
Lead your Pass!

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.920
Play the ball so it’s ahead of your teammate
and putting them in on goal.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.260
Don’t play it wide and out of their running
path to goal.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.700
Key Point 3.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.930
Communicate and tell your teammate to run.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.800
Key Point 4.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.210
Runner doesn’t leave until the ball is passed.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.150
If the runner leaves to early, they could
be offside.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.300
What Football Player Could Be Doing Wrong:
If your teammate is not getting on to the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.350
end of your pass you are playing your pass
to far or short.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.600
Timing is everything on a good through ball
so make sure to weight your pass and not over

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.460
hit it or under hit it.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.050
Bonus Tip:
Not every situation is a through ball situation.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.800
Sometimes it’s best to play the ball sideways
or square.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.320
But if you are confident, in the attacking
third and the situation calls for a through

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.120
ball then have the confidence to play that
killer pass!

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.060
