00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.960
&gt;&gt;If we think about the brewing process, we
have four main ingredients: water, malt, hops,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.769
and yeast. If we think about our malt, it
comes from barley, and it gives us our main

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.769
constituents that we're going to use in the
brewing process. It has carbohydrates, proteins,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.550
and some lipids. Let's focus on the carbohydrates.
If we think about carbohydrate, this is going

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.550
to be our main source for the sugar that's
going to be converted into alcohol, ethanol.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.530
What is a carbohydrate? Well, a carbohydrate,
from its name, is a carbon hydrated, so it's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.010
going to be a carbon with water added. So
therefore, if we think about the structure,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.010
we have a very simple formula: CnH2nOn. So
most of our sugars are going to be C6H12O6.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.229
Now let's look at the structure of our simple
carbohydrates. If we look at our carbohydrate—such

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.060
as glucose, which is going to be our main
carbohydrate—it's usually shown in a few

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.010
different forms. The first structure we see
here is actually in a three-dimensional form

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.090
that organic chemists are very comfortable
with, because it gives accurately what the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.380
structure will look like energetically in
solution. But notice that it is a straight

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.200
chain. The other structure that we're going
to use quite often is the Fischer projection.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.860
A Fischer projection doesn't give us the correct
information as far as how the molecule will

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.000
look in three dimensions, but it gives us
a very easy way to draw structure and tell

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the difference between different sugars. Now,
both of these are what we call acyclic. They

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.010
both have an aldehyde group, and we can see
that they have five hydroxide groups. Every

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.380
carbon in the structure has at least one oxygen
bond. Now, this is the acyclic form; we can

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.819
also have the cyclic form. If we look at the
cyclic form, we have a possibility of the

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.519
rings coming around, so instead of being a
straight chain we now are forming these rings.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:29.519
Notice when we do this that we have one position
that has two possibilities. So how this occurs

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.859
is that one of those alcohols comes around
and attacks our carbonyl position. When it

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.319
attacks that carbon's initial position, that
hydroxide that's formed can either go up or

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.319
can go down. So we can either end up with
an alpha or a beta. This is going be important

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.510
as we look at the functionality of larger
carbohydrates. So here we have simple glucose.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.049
The other thing to realize about glucose is
that all of the hydroxide groups are in the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.340
most stable formation, and in fact, if we
look at beta D-glucose, you'll see that all

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.650
of our hydroxide groups are in the equatorial
plane, which is the most stable confirmation.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.790
Now, these were monosaccharides. When we go
to disaccharides, this is when we have two

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.620
sugars together. The one that we're most concerned
with is maltose. If we look at maltose, we

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.980
have two glucose molecules. It differs from
sucrose, another disaccharide you're probably

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.909
familiar with, because sucrose has a glucose
and a fructose molecule. In maltose we have

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:43.909
two glucose molecules. The connection between
these we refer to as as a 1,4 alpha linkage.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:54.059
This 1,4 alpha linkage is the type of linkage
we're going to see in amylose and amylopectin.

00:03:54.309 --> 00:04:01.309
It is the type of linkage that can be easily
divided or broken when we look at different

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.499
sugars. As we can see here, here's amylose.
If we think about amylose the sugar, it is

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:15.499
a long-chain carbohydrate. So instead of a
mono- or disaccharide here, we have lots of

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:22.569
glucose molecules connected and in amylose
by 1,4 alpha linkages. These 1,4 alpha linkages

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.840
can be broken by amylase, the enzyme, into
smaller carbohydrates. In malt what we're

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.870
looking for is maltose, so the amylose, the
carbohydrate, is being converted with amylase,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.880
the enzyme, into maltose. When we think about
these structures, we also have amylopectin.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.540
Amylose, as you can see here, is just a straight
chain with all 1,4 alpha linkages. When we

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.540
look at amylopectin, we still have alpha-type
linkages but we also have 1,6 connections

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.680
as well as 1,4. If we look at this structure
here, you'll see that we have our normal 1,4

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.400
alpha linkages, but then up here we have a
1,6 alpha linkage. That's what makes amylopectin

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.900
a little bit different, and why we need not
only alpha amylase, the enzyme, but also beta

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.040
amylase enzyme to break down—to fully break
down—our carbohydrates. Now we talked mostly

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.630
about amylose and amylopectin with alpha linkages.
That's because these are the ones that are

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.060
going to be broken down into fermentable sugars.
The other structures we have is cellulose.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.780
The malt has cellulose because we have cell
walls and we have the plant structure. These

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.450
are actually useful in the filtering process
and to settle out the mash at the end of the

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.880
mashing process. Notice that in cellulose,
we don't have alpha linkages like we would

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.880
in starch or amylose, but we have a beta linkage.
So we can see carbohydrates is where we're

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.750
going to get our sugar for the yeast to convert
it into alcohol. We start with long-chain

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:22.380
carbohydrates and then, through enzymes, we
break that down into smaller maltose and glucose

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.800
molecules. We start that in the malting process
by activating those enzymes; then we're going

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.140
to finish that process during the mashing
process, where we allow that enzyme and water

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:42.080
to work on those long carbohydrates to convert
them into small disaccharides, maltose, and

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.350
monosaccharides, glucose.
