00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.400
Today's question comes from Jonhattan Armstrong from Seattle in the United States

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.750
Johnattan wants to know when is carnival in Rio.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.789
This is a great question and the first people ask

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.000
when they think about carnival in Rio de Janeiro

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.490
Well, carnival dates vary from one year to another because it depends on Easter date,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.340
that depends on the full moon, the equinox... a lot of factors

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.380
Let's cut to the chase and answer Johnattan's question.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.390
In 2014, Carnival in Rio

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.399
and all over Brazil starts on Friday
February 28th

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.430
and goes until Ash Wednesday, March 5th.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.970
But if you're planning to watch the
parade at the Sambadrome it's important

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.800
to know there are

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.120
at least three different categories 
of samba parades.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.300
Here they are, in order of importance:

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.340
Special Group parade: six schools parade on Sunday, March 2nd and other six

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.100
on Monday, March 3rd, always starting at 9 pm.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.469
These are the performances everybody
wants to watch.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.170
We are talking about schools such as Mangueira, Salgueiro, Portela.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.940
Access School parade, the second division of carnival

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.770
17 schools compete to get a place at
the Special Group the following year

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.960
this happens on February 28, Friday

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.000
and Saturday, March 1st.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.189
A tip for you: watch at least 1 day of the Special Group, but if you can, also attend the Access Group Parade.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.729
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.729
Tickets are less expensive and the party
is great,

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.920
the sambadrome gets packed. There is also
the Winner's Parade

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.500
that happens the following Saturday, March 8th

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.270
Six best schools perform again  to a passionate crowd resembling a Superball game.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.530
Well, now you know all the dates for
carnival and types of samba parades.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.900
