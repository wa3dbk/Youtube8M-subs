00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.090
Hello my name is Cal Thomson and
today I'm going to show you how to create

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.000
long exposure hype lapses just like this

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.580
A hyper lapse is a form of time-lapse photography where the position the camera moves

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.980
between each exposure producing a nice seamless tracking shot.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.320
They're actually fairly easy to do but really hard to make look good.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.880
I'm using my trusty Canon 6D with the Tamron 24-70mm 2.8

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.770
If I want a nice crisp I hyper lapse. I can actually shoot hand-held if my camera is set up to 1/100

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.230
F8.0 ISO 100 for instance I can use the
guidelines built into my camera

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.420
to frame my shot take a picture move one pace

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.699
take a picture, move one pace take a
picture. When I stitch those together 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.939
and add a bit of post production stabilization

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.700
I'll get a nice seamless tracking shot

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.060
When it comes to considering your frame. I recommend shooting a nice wide angle landscape with nothing in the foreground 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.660
Also consider your move.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.280
What's your start point and what's your end point going to be?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.520
Make sure you're going to have no complications before you actually start shooting.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.760
When shooting long exposures, it does become a little more tricky.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.079
You will absolutely need a tripod I've got manfrotto 501 fluid head here with me

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.600
In my scene here at lovely Media City
Manchester

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.340
I want the water to blend together ever so
slightly. I want the clouds to blur

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.960
If there are any people in my frame or any cars, I want them to streak across the scene.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.060
Now in order to do that in daylight I absolutely have to use

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.819
an ND filter or an ND fader or variable ND whatever you wanna call it

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.030
because I know if I set my exposure time to
two seconds

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.189
even f22 ISO 100 my image is gonna be
overexposed

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.880
This is my ND fader, it's just two pieces of glass that rotate over each other

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.279
which stop down light from say 1 to
about 10 stops of light

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:48.119
I stick this on the front of my camera spin the ND filter until I get the correct exposure

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.280
Once I've framed up my shot I hit the shutter button.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.700
This is why I have to use my intervalometer

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.420
because at a two second exposure as soon as I hit my shutter button I'll add a bit of camera shake

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.279
which will produce an unsharp image

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:03.609
so instead I like to use my intervalometer here. Set my interval to about 12 seconds

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.040
so when I hit start it will automatically fire the camera. I then have 10 seconds

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.459
to pick up my camera move my tripod re
frame-up

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.679
and leave it I don't ever have have to touch the shutter button again because the remote will do it fore me

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.260
When considering your move you could use a bit of half on the floor

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.599
and evenly mark out distances so when you move your tripod you know it's gonna be exact

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.940
I simply like to use my shoe because I
know it's consistent size

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.310
so I typically pick up my tripod and move it  a shoe length or half a shoe length

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.850
Depending on how many shots I want to take

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.520
I then bring all my shots into Adobe Lightroom 5 for a bit of editing.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.180
Now I don't have to do this. I can actually skip this step completely.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.870
and go straight to my editing software. But as I shot RAW I know I can push my images

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.720
that little bit further without any loss in quality

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.060
Now this shot is a little bit grey and a little bit dingy

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.790
so I'm just going to push it here using my settings on the right hand side and see what I can get.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.830
The first thing I'm going to do is bring the highlights right the way down.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.780
I'm going to bring my shadows right the way up

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.239
I'll do a white point by holding 'alt' 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.769
just until a little bit of white creeps through

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.540
do a black point. Bring the blacks right the way down.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.670
add a bit more contrast to the image

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.480
until a black smudge comes through

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.959
Add a little bit of clarity. It just sharpens the image a bit

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.980
add a bit more vibrance to bring that colour out

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.120
and we look a bit overexposed. So I'm going to bring the exposure down every so slightly.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.040
You can also change your white balance and change your framing.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.760
whatever you wanna do. And that is it. To check the before and after I'll hit the back slash button

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.230
before...after...before...after. I'll just show you them side by side

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.670
So as you can see the after is much more pleasing

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.370
The next thing I need to do is sync all the photos

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.500
Press Command 'A', select all hit sync

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.569
make sure all my boxes are ticked and hit synchronize

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.569
and this will update every single one of these photos beneath here

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.091
Once my photos have all updated and they're all synced together

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.430
I can then do file, export

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.850
I wanna export these as a jpeg

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.760
I actually reduce my file size down to 5 megapixels, 300 dpi to save on a bit of hard drive space

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.139
pick the folder you want the photos to go into

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.110
and you can change the name to

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.220
Media city....done

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.940
and then click export.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.060
Then you want to open adobe after effects click new composition call this

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.720
Media City hyper lapse okay

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.940
Import your footage. Go media city

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.100
click the top one. Make sure jpeg sequence is selected

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.480
And click open

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.040
I can then simply drag and drop my frames on, I'll just zoom out a little bit

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.990
As you can see, the images are quite large. I've done that on purpose

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.930
just so I can adjust my framing to my personal taste

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.320
And also when we do any post production stabilisation, we'll actually zoom in on the image every so slightly

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.660
and there will be no loss in quality.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.540
So I'm just going to show you what the hyper lapse looks like without any stabilisation

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.560
done so I'll go here, click RAM preview 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.500
so this is what my hyper lapse looks like without any stabilisation done

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.780
As you can see, it's quite jittery but generally pretty good. Sadly the
stupid sun keeps going in and out

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.580
so I might actually start from a little further on so it doesn't affect our hyper lapse.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.240
so now I'm going to go into my effects and presets. Hit 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.340
warp stabilizer. Drag and drop that on

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.410
warp stabiliser will now that analyze all the
information in the shot just in the background

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.390
and in a couple of minutes it will have stabilised our shot

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.360
Warp stabiliser usually does a phenominal job but if this isn't the case however or you own 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.070
an older version of after effects without the new plugin then you'll have to stabilize manually

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.770
I'm just going to show you how to do that

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.310
hide warp stabiliser for now

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.230
click stabilise motion

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.640
make sure position is ticked and rotation so you get 2 tracking points

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.900
then drag these tracking points over to a feature thats common throughout the sequence

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.240
I'll pick up here. I want them to be quite far away from each. Make that a little bit smaller.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.400
I'm just going to go and pick a corner over here.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.310
Once I'm happy with that

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.620
I simply click analyze forward. It's a little
bit of a slower process

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.050
and may have to pause the video and
move tracking points manually but does

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.940
the same thing

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.460
once that's all done you then click apply, okay

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.650
Once your sequence is nice and smooth and you're happy with it. You simply go Composition

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.510
Add to render queue. Rename to whatever you want to name it to

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.790
And save, click render

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.620
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and learnt
something new

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.220
my name's Cal Thomson cya soon.
