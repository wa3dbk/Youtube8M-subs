How To Make A Whiskey Sour From Scratch

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hello, welcome once again

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is your bartending host

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000

This is our YouTube channel.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Today we are making a classic drink, the Whiskey Sour!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Actually this is what I order about half the time when i walk into a bar.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So what we're going to need is

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a shaker full of ice, some fresh lemons,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
a little bourbon whiskey or just straight whiskey

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Usually I use Jack Daniels or Maker's Mark, I have Maker's Mark today

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And a little bit of simple syrup

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is 2 to 1, ultra fine sugar water

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
OK so let's start with 1 ounce of your simple syrup

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and then, 2 ounces of your whiskey or bourbon

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and then, take the juice from 1 lemon

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm going to strain this so i don't get seeds

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
OK no seeds, just juice

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Alright

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
OK now we shake this. We normally shake drinks for 15 seconds.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We want to get this like nice and slushy...

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So about 30.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
OK there is like ice forming on the outside of that shaker,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So that's success.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
More

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm going to throw some of the ice in here

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
OK then top it with a couple of cherries.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
You are good to go, that smells delicious.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
That is one hell of a good Whiskey Sour.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You want to try this!
