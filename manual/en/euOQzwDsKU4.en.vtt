The Macro Converters attach to your Lensbaby

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.050
Pop the Macro Converters into your lens body
then insert your optic of choice for

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.669
eye popping close up photography.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.079
The 8mm and 16mm converters can be used separately

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.289
or stacked to give you a 24mm extension.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.949
You can focus up to the very front of
the glass depending upon the optic and

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.770
lens body you use.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.380

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.920

distances please refer to the macro

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.290
charts and Lensbaby.com

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.470
To install your macro converters first
remove your optic from your lens body.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.890

video at Lensbaby.com

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.070
Make sure the focus ring is rotated
counterclockwise as far as possible.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.280
Next, line up the solid dot on the Macro
Converter with the hollow dot on the lens body.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.670
Turn clockwise until the solid dot on
the macro converter aligns with the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.610
solid dot on your lens body.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.080
To stack converters simply repeat these steps.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170
To install a bladed aperture optic

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.370
set your optic to its brightest aperture.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.229
Align the solid dot on the optic with
the hollow dot on your lens body

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.940
Turn clockwise to lock.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.590
Caution: the 8mm converter uses a
tension lock.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.070
If you turn your optic's aperture ring
forcefully counter-clockwise

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.340
you might accidentally disengage the
optic or 16mm converter.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.190
To install an optic that requires an Optic Swap
Tool.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.049
Insert the optic while lining up one of its
notches with the hollow dot. To lock

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.590
turn the tool clockwise until one notch
aligns with the solid dot.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.840
You can remove the optic from the converter
in the same way that you remove the optic

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.900
from the lens body.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.890
When both converters are installed grip
the top converter in order to remove

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.710
just optic.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.619
To remove the converters simply rotate
counterclockwise until one or both

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.229
converters disengage.

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.879
You can use the optic or 16mm converter to

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.209
more easily rotate and remove the
8mm converter.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.959
The Macro Converters are just
one of the many tools that Lensbaby

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.769
