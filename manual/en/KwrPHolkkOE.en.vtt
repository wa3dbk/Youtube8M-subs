From the very beginning with League of Legends, we set out to create a very fun and balanced experience that would appeal to a mass audience.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Now that we’re wrapping up Season One, we really want to continue to evolve the experience to help establish it as one of the top eSports titles in the world.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.500
And that’s why we’re excited to announce the League of Legends Season One Championship at the largest LAN event in the world, Dreamhack!

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:45.500
Dreamhack is an eSports landmark. If you’re a gamer, and you’re playing at Dreamhack, you’re kind of a big deal. You’re excited, you’re up on stage – there’s thousands of people that are cheering. It’s an awesome event! 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.000
Dreamhack is the biggest LAN party in the world! It takes place in Jönköping, Sweden from June 18th to June 21st.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.500
We’re flying out the eight best teams from around the world and letting them battle it out over a one hundred thousand dollar cash prize and the title of ‘League of Legends World Champions.’

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The Season One Circuit is comprised of online and live tournaments in North America, Europe and Asia, which have been hosted by some of the most respected eSports organizers in the world.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.500
To date there have been nearly fifty certified circuit tournaments where top-placing teams have earned circuit points and already established themselves as championship contenders.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.000
In May, the field of teams will be narrowed down to eight finalists, who will travel to Dreamhack and compete against each other for the very first time ever, live!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The last team standing will undeniably be the best League of Legends team in the world.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.500
Even if you can’t join us in Sweden, we’ll still be streaming live all three days with tournament matches, interviews with competitors and other Dreamhack festivities all coming right to your home.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.500
We’re also running a contest to bring two of you with us! One lucky summoner and a friend are getting a flight, hotel, and VIP treatment for the entire event, on us.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.000
Details on this contest are coming soon, so stay sharp, summoners!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.000
We’ve been overwhelmed by the response from players and the eSports community and how they’ve embraced League of Legends.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.500
And the Season One prize pool is massive! A hundred thousand dollars! It’s going to be awesome.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.500
