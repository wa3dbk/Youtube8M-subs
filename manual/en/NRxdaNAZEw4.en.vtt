Dennis: Hello everyone, it's Chrome Time here
at Empire Chrome Shop. I'm the Chroman, Junior's

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.059
not here today, he's out playing. He just
got a new Gummi Bear CD. Many times, people

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.840
call or come in to the store, looking for
new and unique parts. They say, 'I'm done,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.430
I can't chrome anything else.' Well, we here
at Empire Chrome believe that there's no such

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.340
thing as ever being done. I say to them, well,
have you ever chromed out a significant other?

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.190
This is the Chroman's woman, say hi to the
folks.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.500
Betty: Hi!
Dennis: Yes, you can chrome out your wife

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.110
or girlfriend and it can be a really fun project.
As you can see, you get fantastic results.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.950
Let's take a closer look. Let's start at the
bottom. As you can see, I chose a chrome shoe

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.750
with silver straps and a three inch heel.
The three inch heel is important, more on

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.640
that in a moment. Also we have some firethorn
polish - it's important to get contrast on

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.670
the nail polish so that it helps the chrome
stand out. As we move up the leg, you can

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.420
tell that the leg is tanned. It's important
not to have pale skin, as it helps the chrome

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.830
stand out. Up here, you can see that we have
the firethorn nail polish again, and these

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.360
great looking diamond plate cuffs at the end
of the arm. As with all projects, they all

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.260
revolve around one great looking piece of
chrome, and this one revolves around this

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.960
great looking tank dress. This is why the
three inch heels are so important. They push

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.159
the muscle up the back of the leg, up to the
top, and cause this great looking chrome

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.130
hubcap style curve right here. Fantastic.
Finally, to finish this look, we've added

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.240
this great looking EC, which stands for Empire
Chrome, and these lugnut earrings. Still,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.290
there's something missing. Ah yes, no project
is complete without chicken lights. We've

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.470
got this great looking sash chicken light
right here, you want to plug it in - be careful

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:17.340
how you do this. And there you have it! Looks
great. Now let's go outside and see how well

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:27.970
we've done. As you can see, we've done a great
job. The shoes coordinate extremely well with

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.680
the wheels. The nail polish looks super with
the paint. The tank dress, and the fuel tanks,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.069
look really polished. And finally, the chicken
lights on the entire truck finish the job.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.050
Projects like these have medicinal purposes
also. Remember, all drivers spend a lot of

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.819
time with their trucks, and sometimes they
have to spend extended times at home with

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.480
their wives or girlfriends, and they become
trucksick. Being trucksick is kinda like being

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.920
homesick. When you're at
home a long time and you've drove a truck

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.710
for months on end, you kinda start missing
it. This way, you can bring it home with you.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.739
And you'll feel better while you're at home!
In case y'all are still wondering whether

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:21.441
or not this is my wife, I've got proof from
all those years ago. And yes, that is a chrome

00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:31.349
suit. She said I do. You think she was expecting
this? Until next time, don't wear an ugly

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.190
suit. Now you can prove to your wife that
you can love chrome and her, and don't drive

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.030
an ugly truck.
