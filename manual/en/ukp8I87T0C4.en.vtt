Hi, my name is Rachel, and I'm the owner of
austinstylewatch.com, street fashion site.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.050
I'm also a freelance fashion reporter, and
today, we're going to talk about how to dress

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.090
for cold weather. Just because it's cold,
doesn't mean you have to forsake fashion altogether.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.569
There's actually ways to modify your cool,
trendy outfits, but not totally sacrifice

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:26.919
your warmth either, so today, I want to talk
about some of the ways that I keep my warm,

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.039
and keep my cool, at the same time, so the
first thing we're going to talk about, is

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.261
layering. If you actually use a little science
in your layering process, it will keep you

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:41.000
a lot warmer, so what you're going to do close
to your body, first of all, is just insulate

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
what's right close to you, break the wind
from coming in to you. What you're going to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.859
want to do, is just use an undershirt, just
something light to cover your immediate skin.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.530
The next layer you're going to want to put
on top of that, is something woolly. Now,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.719
the point of something woolly, is that warm
air can get trapped in it, so a loose net

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.129
sweater, is actually, that's fine, anything
that will hold that warm air and hold it close

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.890
to your body. This is the same way, like a
down comforter works, is that it has that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.079
pad of air in there, that picks up on your
body heat, and keeps that warmth in there,

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.840
so if you have that bottom layer, the fuzzy
layer on top, and then the third layer, that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.110
you're going to put on the very outside of
you, is going to be something that wicks wind

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.990
and moisture, and that can be something like
a windbreaker, or a leather jacket. I really

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.540
like this one, because it's kind of got a
cool, nice puffy sleeve, so just because you're

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.220
wearing a windbreaker, doesn't mean you have
to look like you just shop at REI, or anything.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.039
There's ways to keep it looking nice, so now
we've got our main body covered, but the other

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.720
place we lose a lot of heat from our body,
is our extremities, and that's our hands,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.829
our head, our feet, so we're going to talk
about protecting those. One of my secrets,

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.560
is long johns, and they sound really nerdy,
but they're invaluable when it comes to warmth.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.859
The long john tops are a little hard to hide.
They're kind of bulky, but where my real trick

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:10.330
lies, is with long john bottoms. If you get
a really tight pair, which is how long johns

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.600
should fit. They should fit really tight to
your skin, like that, but wear them under

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.380
your jeans. Pull your jeans right on top of
it. It doesn't add that much more bulk, and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.510
it keeps you a million times warmer. Other
techniques if you're like me, and like wearing

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.250
skirts, even in the winter, tall socks are
really in right now. American Apparel carries

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.000
some great lines of very tall socks, keep
your legs warm. Brightly colored tights, add

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.190
a little color to any outfit. They keep you
really warm, and they look really classy.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.830
They're nice for fancy events. Leg warmers,
don't just mean they're from the 80's, you

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.420
don't have to think that kind of look. These
are some nice lace kind of leg warmers. They

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.910
give you a different look, that's not so Jane
Fonda, and finally, and this is a little Avril

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.170
Lavigne, and you may think it's a little too
young for you, but it can be modified, and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.200
different colors can be added, but arm warmers
have a little thumb hole and a finger hole,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.670
keep the rest of your arm warm, under your
coat, so you keep your fashion, dress warmly.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.320
This has been how to dress for cold weather.
