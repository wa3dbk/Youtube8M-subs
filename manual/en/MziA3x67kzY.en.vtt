00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.400
Good evening everyone!

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.330
This is Ryan with the National Weather Service
in Norman, Oklahoma.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.740
Well, it’s May, and that usually means thunderstorms
are likely going to be brewing somewhere so

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.030
let’s take a look at the headlines through
the rest of your work week regarding severe

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.590
weather and fire weather.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.630
Severe thunderstorms will be possible beginning
late tomorrow afternoon and early tomorrow

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.369
evening across portions of western north Texas
and southwestern OK, and continue across the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.189
rest of OK through Thursday.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.550
In addition to severe storms, extreme fire
danger will also be possible again tomorrow

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.140
as strong south winds develop during the day
and combine with extremely dry conditions

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.890
across western OK and portions of western
north Texas.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.430
Some heavy rainfall will be possible with
the approaching storm system, especially early

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.790
Thursday mainly south of I-40 and east of
I-35.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.490
A pattern change through this weekend will
likely result in cooler temperatures, and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.470
perhaps more rainfall, by early next week!

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.260
Let me first briefly discuss the fire danger
for tomorrow afternoon, before we get to the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.250
severe weather threat.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.780
As I mentioned earlier, very dry air will
remain in place across western and northwestern

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.320
OK tomorrow afternoon.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.140
East of here, a dryline will be positioned
from just west of Enid southward to west of

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.050
Wichita falls.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.060
The minimum relative humidity may be more
difficult to determine tomorrow afternoon

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.490
near this dryline, but strong south to southwest
winds near 25 to 35 mph appear more and more

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:51.890
likely so any fires that develop, or are ongoing,
will have the potential to spread rapidly.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.720
If you remember the yellow boxed area from
the last slide, you’ll notice that along

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.240
and east of that box is where our severe threat
will be through late tomorrow night.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.380
This is because storms will develop along
the dryline and move northeast and east perhaps

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.710
into central OK.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.709
The main threats will be hail at least up
to the size of golf balls, and damaging winds

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.269
near 70 mph.

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.680
Now that you know where the threat will be
through about midnight, we’ll take a look

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.819
at some of the thunderstorm timing for tomorrow.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.819
Storms will likely first develop very late
in the afternoon and early evening hours across

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.099
portions of western north TX and southwestern
OK.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.670
Isolated to widely scattered storms cannot
be ruled out further north into central OK.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.810
Hail and damaging winds will be possible during
this time period.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.640
As night falls, the storms may continue to
develop, or move into, a broader portion of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.389
our forecast area.

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.200
However, coverage may remain below 60% at
this time.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.840
The damaging wind threat MAY decrease during
this time period, but the hail threat will

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.709
likely persist.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.189
As we move into the overnight hours Wednesday
through early Thursday morning.

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.779
Thunderstorm chances will increase, once again,
across portions of western north TX and southwestern/southern

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.299
OK.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.400
Notice that chances will also persist from
our earlier round of thunderstorms along the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.849
I-35 corridor.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.639
The highest thunderstorm and rain chances
are expected during the early part of the

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.230
day Thursday, mainly along and east of I-35.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.319
Severe weather will still be possible during
this time, likely in the form of hail around

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.719
the size of quarters, although the threat
will decrease.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.620
The heavy rain will continue to shift eastward
into eastern and southeastern OK during the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.349
early afternoon hours Thursday.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.510
However, redevelopment appears possible mainly
along the I-35 corridor through at least 7

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.909
PM, if not later.

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:10.230
The severe thunderstorm threat will continue
through most of Thursday, although thunderstorm

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.269
chances will decrease for most of the area
during the late afternoon hours.

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:20.739
The severe threat will likely shift to central
and northern OK during late afternoon and

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:28.050
evening hours Thursday, as the dryline and
a cold front impact these areas.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.620
Redevelopment along the dryline across central
OK along the I-35 corridor will be possible

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.139
as the heavier rain exits our region to the
east.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.479
The key thing to remember here is to not let
your guard down through Thursday evening.

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.240
Tornado chances are very difficult to determine
right now, but they most certainly cannot

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.350
be ruled out.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.479
Here’s a look a possible rainfall total
through Thursday night.

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:56.580
These are only estimates.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.840
If a thunderstorm moves directly over your
location, you could definitely receive more.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.060
Notice the purple shaded area in southeast
OK.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.539
This is where over an inch of rainfall appears
very likely.

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:15.199
In closing, remember, don’t be scared, be
prepared!

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.389
Have a plan and stay weather aware.

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.620
Check that phone app, favorite TV network
or local NWS page before you head out!

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.620
Be sure to check back for updates, as we all
know the forecast can change very quickly.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.480
Make sure you have some way to receive severe
weather information such as a cell phone,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.919
or portable weather radio!

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:37.810
Always have multiple ways to receive warnings,
don’t wait for outdoor warning sirens to

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.039
alert you to an impending hazard.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.639
They are not intended for people indoors.
