00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.960
[Intro]

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.050
The sun is one of those things that you can
always count on being there.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.090
Well … at least during the daytime.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.300
Usually, whenever we look up into the sky
during the day, we can see the sun shining

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.720
down on us, giving our planet heat and light.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.890
But sometimes you can also see the moon during
the day.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.610
The moon moves around the Earth, making a
full trip all the way around our planet, once

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.640
every month.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.760
And during some of that month-long trip, you
can see the moon only at night.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.030
But at other times, you can see it during
the day.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.680
And every now and then, when you can see both
the moon and the sun in the sky during the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.989
day, cool things can happen.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.390
And this week is one of those times.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.890
Because our planet is going to experience
a solar eclipse!

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.079
A solar eclipse happens when the moon gets
right smack-dab between the sun and the Earth.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.000
When the moon does this, it blocks some of
the sun’s light, and casts a gigantic shadow

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
on the Earth.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.260
It doesn’t last for very long -- just a
few minutes, really -- but when the moon blocks

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.750
the light from the Sun, it can make the sky
appear as dark as night -- even though it’s

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.750
still day time!

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.240
Now, not all eclipses are the same.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.680
They can look different, depending where on
Earth you are, and where the moon’s shadow

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.680
is.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.140
A total solar eclipse is when, from where
you’re watching, the moon completely covers

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.850
the sun in the sky.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.490
And there are also the partial solar eclipses,
when the moon passes over just a little bit

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.490
of the sun.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.130
When this kind of eclipse happens, the sun
looks like a little chunk is missing -- like

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.180
a cookie with a big bite taken out of it!

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.729
Now, it’s not very often that sun, moon
and the Earth line up in just the right way

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.500
to create a solar eclipse.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.100
But the next one is going to happen on March
20!

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.409
Not everyone in the world is going to be able
to see it -- only people who happen to be

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.180
in the path of the gigantic moon shadow.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.030
So where I live, in the United States, we
won’t be able to see the solar eclipse.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.260
But people in Europe -- especially in the
northern parts -- will get the best view.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.070
Those folks will get to see the total eclipse.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.850
Right around breakfast time, they’ll have
a few minutes of darkness, almost as dark

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.030
as night.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.070
People in the rest of Europe, and also parts
of Asia and Africa, will see a partial solar

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.070
eclipse.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.000
For them, it will look like a little bite
has been taken out of the sun.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.150
And as the minutes pass, that bite will get
smaller and smaller until the sun is back

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.150
to its old self again.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.500
Now it’s important to remember, you should
never try to look directly at an eclipse,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.670
because the rays from the sun can really damage
your eyes, even when it’s partially covered

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.670
up.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.170
So the next time you go outside during the
day, see if you can find the moon.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.170
What does it look like?

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.130
We’ll be keeping an eye out for it too here
at SciShow Kids.
