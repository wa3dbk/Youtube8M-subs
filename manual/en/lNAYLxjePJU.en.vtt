00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:05.499
What's left to say about the Mercedes C-Class?

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:18.780
It's an Autoblog favorite...

00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:21.114
...especially the C63 AMG edition.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.439
It's also the best selling
Mercedes worldwide, it's a great success.

00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:28.369
They still felt the need for a facelift...

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:33.574
...even though I thought there was
nothing wrong with before.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.950
But Mercedes is big on LEDs nowadays...

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:41.767
...so this one couldn't be left behind.

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.882
They've tidied up the front and rear.

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:47.586
The real changes are on the inside.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:54.427
The pre-facelift interior
was a bit too basic for Mercedes' standards...

00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:56.615
...and they've fixed that now.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:07.522
They've also fixed the telematics...

00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:09.202
...it actually works now.

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:16.932
Especially the integration with
mobile phones and portable music players.

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:21.456
You just turn bluetooth on,
press a button and it works.

00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:27.440
Via bluetooth!

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:30.980
The wireless music connection just works.

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:40.074
Of course it's stuffed with electronics.

00:01:40.098 --> 00:01:44.335
From Lane Keep Assist to
Attention Assist to Blind Spot Assist.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.485
Lord knows what other assists it's got.

00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:53.571
There's an army of assistants on board to
keep you on the road, awake and so forth.

00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:58.189
And in the constant fight
to lower CO2 emissions...

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:04.506
...they've worked on the engine and transmission
with start-stop systems and eco-settings.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.443
It's much more economical.
The 6-cylinder is even 30% more economical.

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:14.060
That sounds very spectacular, but maybe
the previous one was just a gas guzzler.

00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:20.235
It's fitted with the AMG package.

00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:23.905
You should always get the AMG package
when you get a Mercedes...

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:28.271
...it makes it look more fresh and sporty.

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:31.481
It's got 17 inch AMG style wheels...

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.737
...but I would continue saving
for the 18 inch ones.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.948
I would like to tell you about its price,
but I don't have that information on me now.

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:43.031
I'll have to check out the press release
which is in the trunk.

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:47.389
Let's see.

00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:50.222
The C-Class.

00:02:55.217 --> 00:03:02.158
The cheapest one on the list is 34.950 euros.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.234
That 35 grand buys you
the C180 BlueEfficiency.

00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:15.018
Prices go all the way to 64 grand
for the 300 CDI 4-Matic BlueEfficiency.

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:19.328
It's got 11 CO2s more
than the 350 petrol we're driving now.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.689
You pay 8 grand more in taxes
because it's a diesel.

00:03:23.896 --> 00:03:26.426
I personally think diesel is the fuel of satan...

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.394
...but an 8 grand fine is a bit excessive.

00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:46.348
This car is a 350 BlueTec petrol.

00:03:46.652 --> 00:03:49.996
Is it BlueTec or BlueMotion?
BlueMotion right?

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.728
Did I say BlueTec?
-You did.

00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:53.999
It's not BlueTec, it's BlueMotion.

00:03:55.324 --> 00:03:59.383
Did we just talk about BlueEfficiency or Blue...
-Efficiency.

00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:03.276
Did I just say that?
You said BlueMotion, but that's Volkswagen.

00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:06.237
Dammit, that's right.
-Thanks.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:12.055
Ok, just say that this one has...
What is it again, BlueEfficiency?
