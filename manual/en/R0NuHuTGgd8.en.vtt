00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.240
A taut crime thriller from actor/direction
Ben Affleck, this 124-minute feature managed

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.099
to earn four times its $37-million dollar
budget when it was released in September of

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.610
2010.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.850
Affleck and Jeremy Renner star as bank robbers
from Charlestown, Massachusetts - who we're

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.980
introduced to by way of a carefully planned
and well-executed heist, in a very entertaining

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.560
and thrilling opening sequence.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.980
Ben is feels right at home, both literally
and figuratively - and does a great job on

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.349
both sides of the camera.

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.600
Meanwhile, Renner's overly-combative persona
scored him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.600
Actor.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.680
As FBI agent Jon Hamm attempts to track down
the culprits, Affleck accidentally falls in

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.610
love with Rebecca Hall, one of the robbery
victims who is often portrayed as weak and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.339
gullible, while Renner gets anxious looking
for their next big score.

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.879
The exquisitely beautiful Blake Lively has
a smaller role as an ex-girlfriend, but shows

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.280
a surprising amount of dramatic depth with
her character.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.080
Although some of the developments are a bit
too neat and convenient, a fair amount of

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.949
the dialogue is authentically Boston.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.480
Containing a number of violent shootout scenes,
the action in this film is tense and hectic,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.739
culminating with a harrowing standoff inside
the bowel's of Fenway Park.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.560
Steadfast on avoiding prison time, ex-con
Renner stoically warns before the final job,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.970
"If we get jammed up... we're holding court
on the street."

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.770
Affleck's use of strong depth of field in
long-shots, coupled with hand-held sequences

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:49.990
in other areas manages to feel appropriate
in each environment.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.569
Functioning almost like an R-rated love letter
to Boston's criminal underworld, this film

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.369
doesn't quite glamorize the immoral actions
of its protagonists, but successfully convinces

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.100
you they're at least worth rooting for.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.409
Seldom used, the score from Harry Gregson-Williams
and David Buckley is a modern and subtle one...

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.619
adding just enough noise and bass to the already
tense atmosphere.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.170
Although the pacing is bit clunkier in the
extended-DVD version, this is another otherwise

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.390
quick film with lots great action sequences
perfectly spaced out at the beginning, middle,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.390
and end of the film.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.120
Focusing on themes of defiance, betrayal,
and starting over - this isn't award-winning

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.480
art, but it's a capable thriller that folks
from Boston will definitely enjoy over and

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
over again.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.330
"The Town", "Gritty and exciting, but hardly
ambitious."

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:34.220
Here are some of your reviews from the YouTube
comments.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:44.500
An EIGHT and a SEVEN for "The Town"... although
the originality of the plot was critized by

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.650
many, you enjoyed the action and performances,
rating this a GREAT.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.430
A fun and quasi-emotional picture if you're
not too critical, I thought this was a COOL

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.790
movie.
