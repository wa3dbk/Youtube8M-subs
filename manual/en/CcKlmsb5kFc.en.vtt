00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.490
Four sections down we've got how many more
to go? One, two, three, four, five to go.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.820
So we have nine tufts in all or nine sections
for the corn rows. Just really quick, a quiz.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.230
What am I going to do first? I'm going to
grab a section, grab the very first part,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.680
I've got to get my tuft, it's sitting here
waiting for me. Want to make sure it's not

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:32.860
too thick. Take the three sections side, middle,
side. Middle goes down. Her hair's really,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.800
really kind of thin up here so actually may
take a little less of that tuft just because

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.520
the more hair you have to work with the least
amount of hair, it's going to be hard. So,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.180
I made that just a little bit smaller, that
tuft. This time, this section, I'm actually

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.110
going to go quicker. So you've got your three
sections, you're going to cross over, cross

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:04.810
over, cross over, cross over, and get going.
Add your sections. So, cross over about four

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.390
or five times with a normal braid and then
add your sections. Ashly can you tilt your

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.770
head back a little bit? Not too far, baby.
Grab some hair, add it to the section that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.130
didn't have any tuft. Woo flip that hair.
Can't see where I'm going. I've got the grab,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:36.110
I've got these two, I'm going to add the hair
here. Remember, grab your hair, put that underneath

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.150
section up top and remember put it underneath.
Now, we're going to fly. Are you guys ready

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:49.939
to go? Watch my hands. Add the hair underneath.
Grab with hand. The underneath goes on top,

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.560
the top goes on bottom. What do we do next?
Grab some hair and add, oops I just lost my

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:08.229
gripping a little bit, top, bottom, add. OK?
Add. Grab, top, bottom, grab.
