00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.210
 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.900
 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.730
I was asked to be a judge here

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.350
at the burger battle and it couldn't
have been a better time

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.640
very cool event I recommend it to
anybody as a baseball

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.760
fan, here I am standing in the middle of the River Cats
baseball stadium on the grass

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.570
actually at home plate. So it's a phenomenal event

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.960
Lots of great beers, wines. More burgers than you'd ever want to eat

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.089
everybody's walking out of here stuffed full and happy.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.190
And it's the coolest thing ever. We at Broderick are really honored just

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.540
to be you know in a competition with
this group. You know, I think everybody kind of wins because of

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.380
the charity but on this has been a blast working with some great chefs

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.950
and we're trying to put out a a good
product today

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.830
our particular burgers is 100% locally sourced

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.509
everything within

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.539
pretty much about 30 miles from
our homemade barbecue sauce down to our

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.030
smoked black pepper from Napa, and you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.090
know cheese from Spring Hill in
Petaluma. You know we're just happy to be out here it

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420
this has been a great event

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.909
one of the best settings

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.909
I got a great burger and we're feeling pretty
good about it

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.979
and now no matter what man a great
event everybody wins

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.430
Rodney put together a great fundraiser
for a great cause

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.909
and I'm man great turnout and it can't be
really any better

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.310
It's umm...again nobody loses on this one

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.759
but I really hope to win I'm over here
the burger battle

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.740
it's 2013. I was here obviously last year 2012, it was
amazing

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.660
this year I think blows last year out of the water, which I didn't think was possible

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.479
We've got all these great places. You've got amazing burgers

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.119
I've tried probably about 8-9 of them out of about 16 that are here.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.870
great beer, great people, good times, once again Rodney amazing event buddy

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.710
I run a local burger blog where I review hamburgers

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.069
take pictures of them

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.940
called BurgerJunkies

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.450
I post about the great burgers I find around Sacramento

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.110
or around the country

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.690
and uh, it help me put this event together

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.099
We've got about 15 chefs here sharing their burgers with the city

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.170
to help

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.069
me raise funds for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.840
and...

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.760
...looks like people are having a good time

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.470
Hi, I'm Patrick Mulvaney from Mulvaney's B and L

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.099

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.560

food. Really proud

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.860
of my compatriats here in Sacramento to see what they did. Looking forward to see

who won this year and looking forward to coming back next
year and eating some more beef.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.370
My name is Chef Pedro Depina. I'm at the Burger Battle. We just won this year

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.660
It's our second year going. Placed

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.900
second last year in both categories. This year, we're taking home the hard wear!

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.150
Oh, the event was amazing! Great for Sacramento. Just great. I mean just

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.409

just trying to soak it all in.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.830

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.960

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.310
We'll be here next year

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.109

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.740

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.030
Can I kiss it? Are you getting this, Nicholas? Here we go

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.030
mmmmwwaah! WOOOO! I couldn't pick a better guy to lose to. We go way back

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.230
I'd have a hard time losing to other people but this guy, he's all right.
