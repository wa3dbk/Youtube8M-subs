00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.820
Brandon had to do
problems 45 through 75

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.230
for homework tonight.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.960
If Brandon did all
of the problems

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.010
he was assigned, how
many problems did he do?

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.510
So there's a
temptation here to just

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.280
say, well, what is 75 minus 45?

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.540
So you might say, hey, 75
minus 45 is equal to 30.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.190
Maybe he did
exactly 30 problems.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.602
But we have to be very,
very, very careful here.

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:27.810
And to understand why we
have to be careful here-- so

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.562
let me put a question
mark right over here.

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:32.270
To realize why we have
to be careful here

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.130
is imagine-- let's do
some smaller numbers

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.580
so that we can really
count things out.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.880
So let's say instead
of 45 through 75,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.290
let's say he had to do
problems 3 through 6.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.610
If we use this technique
that we just did up here,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.900
we would say, well, 6
minus 3 is equal to 3.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.707
Maybe he had to do 3 problems.

00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:56.040
But let's actually count it out.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.870
So there's problem 1, problem
2, problem 3, problem 4,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.840
problem 5, problem 6.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.830
He's going to have to do problem
3 through 6, including problem

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.410
3.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.130
So he's going to do problem 3,
problem 4, problem 5, problem

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.060
6.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.550
When I subtract 6
minus 3, I'm really

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.870
only caring about
problems 4, 5, and 6.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.540
I'm looking at how much do I
have to go to go from 3 to 6.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.200
I'm not including the actual 3.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.890
So really, when he's doing
problems 3 through 6,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.560
he's not just doing 6 minus 3.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.000
He's doing 6 minus 3 plus 1.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.955
He's actually doing 4 problems.

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:36.830
And you could do this
with multiple scenarios

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.490
to realize when
you just subtract,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.250
you're not counting
the very first problem.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.970
You're just counting all the
incremental ones after that.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.780
So to answer this question, if
he's doing problems 45 to 75,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.520
it's not enough
just to subtract.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.290
That won't count the
first problem, the 45th.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.020
You actually have to add 1.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.370
So in this case, Brandon
does 31 problems.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.210
Let's do another
counting problem.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.290
A baker has a whole
loaf of bread.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.850
How many cuts must he make to
have exactly 7 even slices?

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.320
Well, you could work
this one out directly,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.752
trying to cut a slice of bread.

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:17.210
But let's think
about even if there

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.310
were 70 even slices,
a much larger number.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.850
Well, we could do a
little loaf of bread.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.590
So that's our loaf of bread.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.950
If you want 2 slices, how
many cuts do you make?

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.720
Well, you only make 1 cut.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.490
2 slices, you only make 1 cut.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.900
What if you wanted 3 slices?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.830
So if you wanted 3 slices, how
many cuts do you need to make?

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.380
Well, you make 1 cut,
and you make 2 cuts.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.070
So you make 2 cuts, and I
think you see a pattern here.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.450
If we want 4 slices, how
many cuts do we make?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.172
Well, 1, 2, 3 cuts,
so it's 3 cuts.

00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:02.630
And you could go all the way
to 7, but you see the pattern.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.600
However many slices
you want, you only

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.410
need to do that many
slices minus 1 cuts.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.770
So for 7 even slices, you
only have to do 6 cuts,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.500
and you see why.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.100
You don't have to cut
out that very last piece.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.540
It just falls off the edge.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.980
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.510
Ishaan is building a straight
fence with posts 1 meter apart.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.440
If the fence is 18 meters
long, how many fence posts

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.940
does he need?

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.130
Well, we use the same idea.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.680
Let's do it with a
smaller situation.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.150
Let's imagine a
2-meter-long fence.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.950
For a 2-meter-long fence, he's
going to have 1 fence post.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.360
Then the fence is
going to go a meter.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.500
Then he's going to need
another fence post.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.240
Then the fence is
going to go a meter,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.220
and then he needs
another fence post.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.970
So if you compare it
to the cutting bread,

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.900
you have your cut,
but you also have

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.620
to do the ends right over here.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.260
So for a 2-meter fence,
he needs 3 posts.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.930
What about for a 3-meter fence?

00:04:09.397 --> 00:04:11.480
Well, you're going to have
to have the first post.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.410
You go a meter of fencing.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.660
Then you have the second
post, a meter of fencing.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.990
You have the third post,
but you're not done yet.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.615
Then you have another
meter of fencing.

00:04:20.615 --> 00:04:22.970
And then you need to have
the end post right over here.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.220
So you see you need 4 posts.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.540
You essentially need 1 post at
the beginning of each section,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.680
and then you need
1 to finish up.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.630
So what you see here
is however meters,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.390
you're going to need
that many plus 1 posts.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.460
So here, if you're
going 18 meters,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.600
you're going to
need 19 fence posts.
