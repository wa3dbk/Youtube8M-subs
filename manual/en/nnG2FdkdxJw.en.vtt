[Huskies howling]
"Aroooooo!"

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.120
What we get girls?  What we get?

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.040
Okay, so today's video is
gonna be a little bit different.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.520
Hi!  Thanks for almost kissing me.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.500
Thanks for kisses!

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.869
Couple months ago,
I saw this really cool thing posted online

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.500
and it was called Cuddle Clones.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.240
And some of you may have already
seen this if you follow us on Instagram

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.320
Instagram.com/GoneToTheSnowDogs
or if you follow us at Facebook

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.360
Facebook.com/GoneToTheSnowDogs

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.860
You may have seen the picture
that I posted of this

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.220
and I told some of you that
I would be doing a video on it.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.790
Well this is the video!
We got a Cuddle Clone.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.920
Now I've already seen it.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.840
the girls have already seen, but I thought
I'd put it back in the box for you guys.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.899
What?  Hold on let me open it
and nobody can chew on it!

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.340
It's not for chewing on.
It's not!  This is a toy for me!

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.420
Well, it's not really a toy but kind of!

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.600
it's kind of a toy!

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.680
Wait!  Stop!  Stop, cause you can't chew on it!

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.280
No!  No!  No!

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.240
[laughs]

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.280
No!

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120
Okay, I will open it up!

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.440
Oh!  It's a paper!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.060
I'm sure the girls probably think that it's food.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.769
Don't chew on it.
Can't chew on it!

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.440
So anyways this is...

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600
A 'Cuddle Clone!'

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.029
Can you...  Stop (Memphis)!
Can you figure out?

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.940
Who this is?  Who this is a 'Cuddle Clone' of?

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.620
Can you?  What?  Who's that?  Is it Shiloh?

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.820
Is it a Shiloh 'Cuddle Clone?'

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.740
No, you can't chew on it!
Is not a toy!  This is a 'Cuddle Clone.'

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.540
There's no food in there girls!

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.540
A 'Cuddle Clone' we had made of Shiloh.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.799
No, you can't chew on it!

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.620
It's not to chew on!

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.620
As you can see...

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.580
If you look at pictures of Shiloh, it has her markings
right down, to right between her eyes.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.300
I don't know how well that will get...
It has her pink nose.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.620
Where is it?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.020
The little bits of brown that
where around on the back of her legs?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.140
Now what these are...
NO chewing on it!

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.220
Let's move the box...

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.380
Now what these are, this is a 100% 'customizable'
(custom made) stuffed animal.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.480
As you can see they're pretty big!

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.780
It's a lot bigger than I thought
it was going to be actually...

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.870
Stop chewing on it!
It it's not a toy!

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.200
And...

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.360
I plan on eventually getting one made
of all the dogs because I think they're really cool.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.460
And we're gonna have a little
like container made to put it in

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.639
But you can go to CuddleClones.com to find out more.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.989
They make these, they also make
little sandstone figures, and I mean

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.340
It's a really cool idea as a memorial gift
for somebody who's lost a pet

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.760
or a memorial gift for yourself,
If you've lost a pet.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.860
I mean, I just I think they're really cool.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.620
I like stuffed animals, you know...
Who doesn't like stuffed animals?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.340
I like stuffed animals!
I've always been a big fan of stuffed animals.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.560
So when I saw these I knew,
I had to have one.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.240
Then you know, I kinda did the whole...
"I don't know!  I don't know!  I don't know!"

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.990
But after getting it, yeah!
Now I want one of all the dogs!

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.700
It's one thing to have a stuffed husky!

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.550
It's another thing to have a stuffed husky
that actually looks like one of your dogs!

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.699
And if you guys look, maybe I'll put
some pictures of Shiloh over here.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.340
I'm looking at my screen over here,
that you guys can't see.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.290
I'll put some pictures of Shiloh
over here below Oakley.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.029
You are kind of look-like Oakley too.
So you guys can see the comparison of what...

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.940
The pictures I sent to them versus what
the dog and the stuffed animal ended up looking like.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.220
That's pretty cool!
You gotta admit, that's pretty cool!

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.740
I know a lot of you guys had seen
the picture and you're really interested in

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.800
and I thought "You know what?"
I'll do a 'Cuddle Clone' video of Shiloh.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.120
But anyway guys!

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.660
I just wanted to share that
with you, because like I said

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.620
a lot of you saw the photo and
wanted to know more about it

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.720
and what it was and where we got it?

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.780
So we thought we would do
a video today on our Cuddle Clone.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.060
For those...  Even the tail!  That poofy tail!

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.780
No, you can't eat it!

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.100
Can't eat it!

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.360
No!  You can't eat it!

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.540
Can't!  Can't eat it!  Sorry!

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.200
You can't!
[kisses]

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.100
I kissed your nose!
[laughs]

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.260
You kissed me back!
Thank you for the love!

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.660
Oh, thank you for the love!

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.560
If you guys missed the Easter video,
I know Easter is already coming on.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.560

In other news we had,
in case you missed 'Fan Friday's' video,

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.960
it seems like a lot of our videos aren't
going out into the subscription boxes.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.600
A lot of people are missing them.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.260
Where getting a lot of emails and messages
from people asking where our videos are?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.640

our videos and they are not in your sub boxes

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.820
more behind the scenes type of thing,
about the videos and is kind of what I start going with.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.920

update you guys on that.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.360
