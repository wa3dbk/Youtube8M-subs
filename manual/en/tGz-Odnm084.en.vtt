00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.879
This is to help you build the best island project

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:06.850
With realistic looking water.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.850
 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.559
 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.008
You start out with a 12 x 17 cookie sheet

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:16.008
 

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:18.008
 

00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:20.008
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.239
First you tear off a piece of aluminum foil that is larger than the cookie sheet to completely cover the sheet

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.789
and crumple it up into a ball

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.668
Not tightly because when you open it you do not want to tear any holes in the aluminum foil

00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:34.668
 

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.668
 

00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:38.668
 

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:40.320
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.290
Now to wrap the aluminum foil up and over the edges of the cookie sheet

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290
 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.290
 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.290
 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.289
 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.429
For the rest of the supplies you will need: Plaster of Paris, Woodland Scenic Realistic Water

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.420
 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.010
Elmer's Glue, Sand, Scott's Brite pad (yellow and green), Styrofoam,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.489
 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.999
Acrylic paint &amp; brushes, pen &amp; paper

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:03.970
 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.679
Guiding tool - butter knife works fine for this

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.679
 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:11.679
 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.679
 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.919
Mix your Plaster of Paris and shape into your island

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:21.919
 

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:23.919
 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.080
While the plaster is drying it will become more like clay so you will be able to shape it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080
 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.080
 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.080
 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.860
 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.860
Making mountains and the volcano

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.390
When the plaster of Paris is first poured it is easy to make flat plains

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.390
 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.390
 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.819
Paint your island and make sure you allow

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:18.459
 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.229
the paint to completely dry

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.229
 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.229
 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.229
 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.929
For the cities cut out Styrofoam is small squares and paint the buildings

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:50.379
 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.979
Then paint the buildings let them dry and  glue them down with Elmer's glue which dries clear

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.979
 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.979
 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:00.969
 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:07.829
For the forest take the Scotch Brite pad

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.549
Pull pieces off of the top of a Scotch Brite sponge and glued them down

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.549
 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.549
 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.549
 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.549
 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.549
 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.260
 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.239
Woodland Scenic Realistic Water is available in blue

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.059
But you can buy it in clear and add a couple drops of blue acrylic paint and you are good

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:35.059
 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.059
 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.059
 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:40.659
 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.688
This product is latex based and has a VERY strong smell

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.999
so make sure you have good ventilation

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.999
 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.999
 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.999
 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.999
 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.929
Pour it very carefully, you do not want get any bubbles in the "water"

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:05.929
 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:07.929
 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:09.929
 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:11.929
 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.470
When pouring the  Woodland Scenic Realistic Water around the island into the rivers and lake

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.470
 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.470
 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.470
 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.280
 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.109
You will want to use a guiding tool, a butter works fine, to help make sure the "water" is evenly distributed

00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:45.109
 

00:04:45.109 --> 00:04:47.109
 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:02.100
You need to make sure you allow the "water" to dry for 24 hours

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.100
 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.100
 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.910
 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.910
Make sure it's dry. It's solid

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.910
For the beach, brush on Elmer's Glue

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.970
 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.179
and sprinkle sand over. The glue dries clear so all you see it the sand

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:20.179
 

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:22.179
 

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:24.179
 

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:25.810
 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.070
Make sure the sand is dry and get rid of all the extra so you do not have loose

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.130
sand under the water

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.130
 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.130
 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.130
 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.130
 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.130
 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.130
 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.130
 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.860
 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.040
Use the guiding tool to make sure to get as much of the "water" around the beach, it will look great!!

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.860
 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.310
Then with your paper and pen, write your labels

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.980
 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.540
and key

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.869
with dimensions of the island

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:05.869
 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.059
Then trim extra aluminum foil

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:19.600
 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.710
from around the edges for a finished look

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.710
 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.710
 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.710
 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.710
 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.710
 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.710
 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.710
 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.710
 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.710
 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.710
 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.710
 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.710
 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.710
 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.710
 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.710
 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.710
 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.710
 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.710
 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.710
This is an inexpensive fun project that can

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.710
be used for school

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.710
or for learning how to work with these

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.710
Different materials for future projects

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.710
Please let like our video

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.710
Thanks for watching

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.710
 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.710
 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.669
GREAT!!

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:19.840
YOUR

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:28.250
ISLAND IS DONE!!!!!

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.250
 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.250
