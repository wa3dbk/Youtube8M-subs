00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:12.269
The difference between fatty tuna is what
part of the tuna you are taking it from.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.099
Fatty tuna is coming from the belly part.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.970
It's more oily.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.820
The color usually becomes a pinkish color,
and the backside of the meat is reddish because

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.440
there's not much fat in it.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.619
It's more like muscle.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.221
It used to be that even in Japan, we only
ate the back part of it because the fatty

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:38.010
part of it gets bad so quickly.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.429
We didn't always have any refrigeration system,
and it would just get bad.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:52.220
People would throw it away or bring it to
their cats.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.199
The homeless people and whoever didn't have
much money, started eating those things, because

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.199
it was being thrown away.

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.050
They said it was very good.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.850
This is how it became more popular and popular
in my country.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.479
This country likes the fatty part of the tuna.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.560
People were throwing it away because they
didn't know what to do.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.420
Now, it's considered the best part of the
tuna, and the most expensive part of the tuna.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.689
When you are mixing with a spicy miso sauce,
or a heavy kind of sauce, don't even try to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.409
use the good part of the tuna, because you
will only taste the spicy sauce.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.900
Get the red tuna, the inexpensive tuna, and
mix in with the sauce.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.979
If you get the real good part of the blue
fin or a big eye tuna, or the medium belly

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.759
part, don't mix it with anything.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.250
Just try to eat it as it is.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.909
Try to taste the good flavor over the flesh.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.069
That's the best.
