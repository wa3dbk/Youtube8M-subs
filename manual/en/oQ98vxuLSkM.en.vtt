00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.080
Did you know that in a 
recent independent study

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.980
Lenovo was actually judged to be
more reliable than Apple?

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.180
That's right, Apple. Not the fruit,
the company owned by Steve Jobs.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.660
This PC is actually better
and more reliable than an Apple

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.060
which is absolutely incredible.
This is the K230 IdeaCenter,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.280
it's one of the newest
ones from Lenovo

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.740
and particularly right now
when I'm making this video

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.070
this is a hell of a
computer, it is a steal.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.470
This thing comes
with so much stuff.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.400
Let's just real broadly,
it's got a Quad Core,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.080
it's got 4 gigs of RAM,
it's got a 1 terabyte hard drive,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.680
it's got a blu-ray player and
it's way way way below 1000.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.430
So let's look at the 
IdeaCenter K230

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.720
and see what's up with
a very very nice desktop

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.490
on a great budget. I'm going
to start by showing you the back

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.890
since you already kind 
of know the specs.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.800
Let's just talk a little bit 
about what's on here.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.460
Power supply, PS2s for 
your keyboard and mouse,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.960
a serial port which you may or may not
ever use in your entire life,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.750
you've got a VGA port, you've got
a bunch of USBs down here

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.070
as well as a 10/100 NIC right there,
so Network Interface Card,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.000
you also got your 
input and outputs

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.580
for your headset and
microphones right there.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.850
An integrated DVI 
card is right there

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.150
which is actually Integrated 
Intel G33/31 Graphics

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550
that's on here 
which is very useful.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.750
It's the x4500 which is DirectX 10
and it's actually a decent card.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.650
It will actually do, it's not 
a card, it's on board

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.000
but it will do 1080P, it 
will do 720P videos,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.400
it will do hi-def stuff,
it looks really good

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.700
and my favorite part is
a nice built-in wi-fi

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.300
because a lot of people don't
use ethernet these days.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.840
You're going to pretty much
take this home

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.610
and you probably already
have a wi-fi network

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.800
and you're going to set it up
and it's going to work great.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.550
Now let's go a little bit 
into the inside of this case

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.910
which is very nice.
I'll show you what's in here.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.120
Very simple, I think that's why
Lenovo has so much luck

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.800
on the reliability front is
because everything is so simple.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.620
So let's take a look. First of all
under this CPU cooler is a Q8200,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.830
that's a 2.33 gigahertz
Intel Core 2 Quad, very nice.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.500
4 gigs of DDR3 are
loaded up right here.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.100
That's 1066 memory right there,
DDR3, very nice upgrade

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.870
especially for a computer
that is so affordable.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.070
Right over here, there's this
hard drive that's over here,

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.710
this is a 7200 RPM, 1 terabyte
SATA 2 hard drive. Very very nice.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.950
This is going to store tons and tons
of footage, movies, pictures, files,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.220
you name it, it will do it.
You have integrated wi-fi

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.860
like I mentioned before on this
little card right over here.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.800
This is the DDI port for your
on-board graphics chip set,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.530
let me move the computer
over a little so you can see it,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.340
which is very nice. You're also going
to notice that you do have space

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.670
for more stuff so if you want
to expand you have 2 PCIs,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.170
this is a PCI Express x1 if you want
to replace it and not use it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.470
and this is a PCI Express so if you
wanted to get rid of this altogether

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.510
you could do it and put a video 
card on there no problem

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.100
which is really nice. Now let me
move on to the front

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.880
because this is where one of 
my favorite things is on here,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.610
especially for the price 
you don't see stuff like this.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.250
Check this out, this DV drive
is not only a super multi DVD/CD

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.530
it's also a blu-ray drive, 
it's not a blu-ray burner

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.580
but it is a blu-ray reader so if you
want to do blu-rays to your TV

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.340
through the DVI to HDMI cable
you can do that.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.530
It does support HDCP which
is really awesome

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.040
and again it's just really nice on 
a computer that's so affordable

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.400
to have a blu-ray disk drive
which is awesome.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.940
It will also do DVD-RWs
RAMs, ROMs, +Rs, -Rs,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.590
every CD in the book,
you name it, it will do it.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.100
And while I'm here in the front
let me just show you,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.460
scroll down over here,
keep coming, keep coming.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.450
Alright here is your
multi-media card reader.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.160
This is pretty much a 16 in 1, 
so this is the one

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.130
that's the bigger one. It does
just about everything as you can see,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.540
MS, MS Pro, MS Pro Duos, CF,
Media Cards, XD, SD,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.800
multi media sticks,
mini HCs, it will do

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.170
just about every media card
you can think of, 16 in 1.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.980
Very impressive. If you move down
here you've got 2 USB 2.0 ports,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.120
you've got intake, input and output
for your headset and your microphones,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.680
which is really nice
and when you buy this computer

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.520
in case you're not ready for it
right off the bat,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.090
included in the box, which
is very nice to have,

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.830
is a keyboard and mouse. So if 
you're sending a kid to college

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.100
or need to have an 
affordable, cheap computer,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.500
this is going to be
absolutely perfect

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.100
because it comes with
everything you need.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.930
And if you don't know 
about Lenovo,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.600
Lenovo, see this little
red button right here?

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.570
This is like a 
one-button restore.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.740
So let's say you're giving 
this computer to Grandma

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.550
and she's just ridiculously 
retarded with computers,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.840
she has no idea what 
she's doing, this is perfect.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.410
If she messes up, I mean she could
destroy the computer

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.220
and get like 1000 viruses,
you push this one-touch restore

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.790
it'll go back to the restore point
that you have saved and backed up

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.680
and you're back in business,
it's not a big deal.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.490
It's not going to shut 
you down for a while,

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.530
so in the end this thing is awesome.
For the money it's unbeatable.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.630
It's got great graphics
for non-gaming purposes,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.840
it's got a Quad Core.
It's got 4 gigs of DDR3.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.280
it's got a one terabyte drive
so tons of movies,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.470
it's going to be great for media
and it's got 10/100/1000 ethernet,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.780
it's got N-Drive wireless,
it's got all this stuff built in,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.050
keyboard, mouse,
Lenovo - most reliable,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.120
it's incredible, 
it's awesome, I love it.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.750
That's it, it's over.
See you guys later.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.950
If you have any questions email me.
See you guys next time.
