What's going on Nation?] I'm going to demonstrate to you guys how to do a single arm dumbbell overhead extension

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.439
this is a really great exercise to isolate the

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:26.488
Triceps the primary mover here is going to be the triceps you're also going to utilize your core to help stabilize throughout the exercise

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.390
Now you can do this exercise

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.709
Standing up or sitting down if you're going  to stand you wanna

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.190
Have your feet about shoulder width apart

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.239
Once again really contracting your core to stay up nice and tall

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.119
if you're going to be seated you want to make sure that you're sitting upright don't let your butt slide forward on the seat

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.018
So now we're going to go over some more key points while I demonstrate the exercise

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.649
begin by grabbing the dumbbell with a pronated grip

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.039
You're going to start the exercise from the contracted position

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.449
And then lower the dumbbell past 90 degrees and then extend back up

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.759
you can choose to put your opposite hand across your stomach on your hip or

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.489
You can place it inside the pocket of your elbow to help you spot yourself during the exercise

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.149
be sure to stabilize through the core by flexing and contracting your abdominals if

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.989
You have a back injury you can utilize a chair and when you sit in the chair make sure you're sitting straight up

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.269
