00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.010
Hello everyone. Hide your wallets, Glu have released a new game. Heroes of Destiny!

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.030
It's free to play

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.970
it's by Glu, 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.409
it has inapp purchases. Need I say more. But,

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:17.060
like a lot of Glu games that have come out of late, I found myself going... it's got inapp purchases... but the gameplay's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.609
really really good.

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.670
Glu get a really hard time off a lot of reviewers

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.759
but actually

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.529
they're producing some very good games
these days. 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.530
I can kind of overlook the inapp purchases when you've got such great gameplay.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.970
So this is their new one.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.280
It's kind of reminiscent of like a World of Warcraft heroes kind of thing or 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.910
Warcraft Heroes.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.430
It's sort of like...

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.360
it's quite difficult to explain but the idea is 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.979
you have a party of characters, each of those characters has a 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.820
particular role like a healer or a tank  

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.930
a warrior, or, you know, range character like the ranger.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.539
And the idea

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.840
is to complete these various levels

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.450
winning obviously would be preferable

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.169
and then from there

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:07.680
you can kind of explore this story. So,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.040
these are the characters I've kind of already unlocked and these are the characters that I could happily if I felt 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.350
like it put my hand in my pocket and buy

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.400
using Glu cash.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.969
And you see some of these can be unlocked for the silver money which is stuff I earn

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.219
in-game and the gold are the ones I could actually pay for outright if I felt like it

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.040
using my wallet.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.550
I'm not going to, obviously, But

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.550
let's just go back, let's try 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.040
and actually get into a game.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.950
OK, so that was where I got up to last night

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.630
and I got my butt kicked because it's an elite mission so let's go to something a little bit easier.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.670
Do a mine raid. OK.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.650
Just on that screen there that I accidentally flipped 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.659
past allows you to pick which heroes will be in your party.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.380
OK, here we go, so this is my big tanky guy

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.290
and you draw a line between the character

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020
the character you want to use

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.180
and the thing you want to attack.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.240
So you just draw the line and it goes red.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.340
Green lines, like that, mean

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.149
it's healing or 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.250
throwing on some other special effect

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.599
and you also need to obviously mine yourself

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.229
behind you, you have special attacks as well

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.620
which are absolutely essential because the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.180
game does get quite difficult, I have to say, that's, you know, par for the course with anything

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.339
made by Glu.

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:31.849
Every time you defeat a little wave of monsters in one of these kind of rooms

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.959
you get linked and then you move on to this kind of

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.129
strange

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.330
camera angle. Kind of places you behind
the party as you run down the corridor

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.809
and in some of those corridors you'll find even more loot.

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:47.009
You use those items of loot later to upgrade your character,

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:48.410
buy new powers

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.410
or you know, change out weaponry etcetera that they might be using.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.179
One of the things that I've noticed with this game is that it's kind of got that Diabolo thing going on

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:04.019
you know the dungeon crawler where there's just loads and loads of different bits of loot and you can upgrade

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.010
all of that loot

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.019
and it's just so well done.

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.799
I found it really really difficult to kind of, here we go with some loot.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.259
As we run down this corridor.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.029
This amber stuff

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.800
pieces of amber are used to upgrade
equipment or level up your character

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.099
from what I can tell. I've not found it being used  for anything else but it does 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.129
seem to come in quite heavily for doing your upgrades etcetera.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.519
You have a certain chance when you're upgrading items of equipment to either be 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.249
successful or to fail

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:33.019
and

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.439
the higher the level item of equipment you're trying to upgrade the greater the chance of failure.

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.569
But, lo and behold, 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:45.039
Glu have given you a way to always be 100% successful at upgrading you can give them some money!

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:48.889
It's all there basically. Every aspect you could do

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.030
normally as it were or take the risk on

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.549
you can mitigate the risk by 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.539
using effectively ingame

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.290
purchases

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.870
in app purchases to use, you know

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.480
the Glu money or gold or whatever they call
it.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.470
So you can see here, I've completed this level I've got 138 silver 8 pieces of amber, couple of 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.719
new pieces of items and one of my guys just levelled up.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:14.719
So we go over to the heroes

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:23.099
load times are a little bit slow in places.

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.240
Glu - maybe a patch would be nice. So, you can go here, training time, train for free 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.360
and basically

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.999
every time you want to level up your character it
takes a little bit of time but obviously

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.150
if you want to you can pay Glu

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.389
cash and you can speed that up. We'll wait the 10 seconds. I don't think it's going to 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.099
hurt us too much. Please don't shoot away.

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.490
Essentially once we've upgraded this character
and done the training time

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.770
we can then choose a new skill or increase a 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.440
current skill.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.199
So you see here again I could spend some
Glu cash if I want to and I can get two 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.280
skill points instead of one skill point.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.289
You can see how Glu have kind of evolved this. Down every path is a choice

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.090
use

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.870
just your in game money and you can have half 
or take the risk that item is not going

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.239
to be successful in upgrade or alternatively, hand over some ingame 

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:12.600
Glu money and

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.680
you can then have a bigger bonus or be
more successful.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.880
So in this case we'll

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.030
choose to upgrade swiftness so that creates me a new power, I'll upgrade that again,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.870
that's quite cool, let's go back, 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.680
And that's that. But

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.360
in essence it's a dungeon crawler but with a very very very well 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.469
presented

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:31.910
game going on.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.990
Once you raid mines, every time you come back to the game after a certain 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.030
number of minutes you can collect more ingame money so a key part of this is to obviously to make sure you collect up

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.629
all of the mines around the map as you go.

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.370
Let's pop over to this one.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.240
You can go back and replay a mission

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.990
based on its difficulty so once you've actually unlocked it by completing it once 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.830
you can go back and play it again and again

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.969
and you get different bonuses depending
on obviously, the difficulty level.

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.070
Everyone seems to start at easy

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.140
apart from some of these special missions
which are known as elite missions which are 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.270
just rock hard.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.820
And presumably only for those people who have

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.509
spent a bit of money on upgrading their
equipment etcetera.

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.479
Certainly when I try the elite missions on my level 5 I got trashed by 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.339
the first

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.810
bad guys basically, just ripped me in half.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.699
So I would not waste your time on those, skip them and come back later.

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.400
There we go, let's have another chest. You can see the graphics are fantastic and very reminiscent of 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.949
Warcraft I would say.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.199
That kind of cartoon, cell shading animation going on but with 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.819
really nice lighting effects and quite lush detail character models. 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:41.819
It works and it works really well, a lot of thought 
feels like it's gone into this game.

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:57.699
As you can see, it's quite involved

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.159
to the point where you 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.839
forget to talk occasionally!

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.339
Here we go, running through one of these
pieces again.

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.539
Make sure we get as many of these taps in as we possibly can.

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:11.259
Come to some more bad guys. There's kind of big bosses that litter some levels as well

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.999
That prove more of a challenge, especially the  ogres at this level

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:18.709
can take a fair number of hits. 

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:22.029
And you're constantly having to watch which
characters are in combat and holding

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:24.669
the aggro. Should always be the tank ideally.

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:28.080
to try and slide out of there,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.360
there's a big nasty guy. Try and give him a good

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.360
whack.

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:43.630
But yes, not a bad release from Glu.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.100
One of their better titles, yes it's got  inapp purchases but it's not too

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.280
badly done, it's not too gratuitous 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.240
for your money.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.499
And, you know, a really really nice bit of gameplay. Certainly I've spent a fair hour now

00:07:56.499 --> 00:08:00.180
playing through this game and just finding it really fantastically well done.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.090
A great execution from Glu.
