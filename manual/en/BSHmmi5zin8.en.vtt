00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:05.160
for the longest time the only floor pan
replacements for fox mustangs where

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.850
these half pans. great for patch panels
not so good for full replacements. this is

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.890
because they have none of the speed
nuts

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.090
or reinforcements installed on them.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.530
you would have had to remove them from
the old floor pan.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.009
luckily we were able to up the game
and bring you these 5.0Resto

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.990
full floor pan replacements for both
automatic and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.380
manual transmissions

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.460
Fox mustangs.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.070
these full replacement5.0Resto floor pans go from the front on the

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.290
front foot well all the way to the rear
to the rear footwell

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.320
and spans the area between both rockers.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.389
They fit coupe and convertible.

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:42.580
Taking a look at the automatic
version first you'll notice there is no

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.030
hole for the shifter. that's because the
shifter bolts directly to the pan. not

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.380
having the hole there allows you to placed
your automatic shifter wherever you want.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.330
especially if you're running an
aftermarket unit.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.120
all of this speed nuts and 
reinforcements for the rear seat bolts

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.920
are in place as well as the driver's
side

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.620
upper reinforcement that was introduced
somewhere around 1983.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.930
also welded into place are the seat
belt anchor points

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.850
and you even have the cut-out and speed nuts
for the emergency brake handle. If you have a

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.000
1993 mustang the retaining bracket for the emergency

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.660
brake cables is not in place you will
need to reuse that off of your original

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.120
floor pan. the manual transmission floor pan is identical to the automatic ffloor

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.170
pan except it does already have the
hole cut

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.600
for the shifter

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.800
and it has the tunnel extension that is
specific to manual transmission car.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.160
neither of these floor pans comes with
the front seat reinforcement cross

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.900
brace. this is because

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.470
you can reuse your original if it's
still in good shape. if yours is all

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.380
broken out, we have this replacement
available for you.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.789
even though our floor pain is in great
shape, i wanted to point out

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.450
the common failure areas. you can build
up rust all in the rear floor pan area,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.530
all along the rockers,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.160
and in the front of the floor pan area.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.920
cracks typically develop around the rear
seat belt holes specifically the one

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.070
closest to

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.369
the transmission tunnel.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.110
the other common failure point are the studs at the front of the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.030
seat feet

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.880
sometimes

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.510
those will just completely pull out of
that front seat reinforcement.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.079
so if you find yourself in need of floor pan patch panels

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.589
or the whole thing LatemodelRestoration.com has you covered.

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.690
don't forget to pick up all your extra
hardware, caps plugs and  grommets

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.490
to finish off your floor pan install
