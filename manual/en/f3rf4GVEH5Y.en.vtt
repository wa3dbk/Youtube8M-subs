00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:06.396
oh , hello. Just catching up with a few letters in the office here

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:11.178
yes and in the office, we are in for some very big changes

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:15.343
we are doing some shifting around and packing and stuff

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:18.130
so I thought I would show you what its like

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.068
well, due to lack of finances,

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:24.901
and a wedding to attend

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:27.649
we are having to pack up the entire puppets thing

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.313
and go back to New Zealand

00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:33.892
for a few months, this year. So I thought I would show you

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:37.203
what we actually have, in packing up

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.561
This is what we have as puppeteers

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:44.874
We have  basically one room 3x3 metres

00:00:44.874 --> 00:00:50.267
is what we have been recording in

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:53.285
and this is some of the stuff that, we have some bits and pieces

00:00:53.285 --> 00:01:03.618
and our wardrobe we have 1,2,3,4,5 boxes of cloths

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:07.559
that we do the puppets in

00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:15.810
and this is the sum total of all of the large walls that we have

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.790
which are around about that size wide

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.428
and this is the sum total of our rocks,

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:29.136
in the attic

00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:33.131
which will cover one entire room basically

00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:38.936
and our props department.. not too much stored

00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:42.774
because we generally find them all over the place

00:01:42.774 --> 00:01:47.711
and the sum total of smaller walls, the not quite so wide ones

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:51.973
and fold away furniture

00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:55.903
and normal furniture

00:01:55.903 --> 00:02:01.399
not too many...and bits and pieces of stuff

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.278
and models department

00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:11.653
more models department

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:14.094
with trees and bits and pieces

00:02:14.094 --> 00:02:20.269
not too much stuff I suppose but it still all needs storing

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.000
so , got to pack it all away and go to New Zealand
