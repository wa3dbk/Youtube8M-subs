00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.859
Is “apptastic” an adjective?

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.260
It should be.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.710
A descriptor that means “you shouldn’t
pay more than a dollar for this, if that.”

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.161
By that definition, Sky Peace is certainly
apptastic, though it in fact appears on the

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:32.161
3DS.

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:37.210
Granted, it doesn’t use one of the screens
for anything, and only uses one control-vector,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.980
as you don’t have to shoot.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.360
The entire game is movement in a high-speed,
fast-paced environment, and all you have to

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.440
do is get your little chibi sky-surfing dude
or dudette into the right place at the right

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.820
time to get coins.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.160
That’s about as iPhone as a game can get,
frankly, without involving some flapping potato

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:03.030
salad or whatever the hell you kids are on
about these days.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.790
So in lieu of a story, we’re going to presume
these kids are in it purely for material greed.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.510
There are coins and gemstones suspended in
midair, and they’re after them because of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.600
reasons… and high-score.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.260
That last one’s the real driving force here:
you’re after points.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Man.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.140
It seems like a long time since I’ve been
able to say that’s a game’s main goal,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.680
but sure enough, you’re trying to collect
as many of the things as possible, in hopes

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.060
of getting a better grade.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.560
Sure, there’s conflict - not everything
in the sky is friendly or made of points - but

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.380
even then you’ve got ways of dealing with
them.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.110
Not innately, though, as the only controls
available to you are moving in one of eight

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.110
directions.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.422
And even then, you’re not so much moving
as “changing your position relative to the

00:01:41.422 --> 00:01:43.480
autoscrolling that’s already happening.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.659
To this end, you can use the D-pad, the circle
pad, or the ABXY buttons, whichever floats

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.909
your boat.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:02:00.030
But once the game gets going, you’re in
for a well-animated, smooth-playing, moderately

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.610
challenging little side-scroller, where you’ve
gotta slalom through birds and various floating

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.300
obstacles in the pursuit of more money, as
my dear friend Yogurt would say.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.080
Peace doesn’t come without a price, though,
and if you take too many whacks to the noggin

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.629
in your surfing adventures you’ll have to
restart the stage.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.540
That’s not really saying much, though, since
this isn’t about difficulty, it’s about

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.540
skill.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.870
And you’ll need all the skill you can muster
to unlock Sky Peace’s dozens of achievements,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.810
which are where the game really begins.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.499
Obtaining a mastery of the combo system, learning
the ins and outs of each track, and managing

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.541
to suppress your reptile brain long enough
to go against the flow of coins in favor of

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.450
that several-thousand-point-gemstone that
would otherwise pass you by are your bread

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.209
and butter here.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.200
Yes, it’s apptastic.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.050
Exactly the kind of game that should cost
a buck.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.909
The kind of thing you can pick up in seconds,
and use to kill downtime at the dentist’s

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.129
office waiting room, the will call line at
a Prince concert, or your local DMV.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.280
Sky Peace might be a simple idea, but at least
it’s supported by decent gameplay, quality

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.680
graphics (that aren’t just ripped of from
Super Mario World ARE YOU LISTENING BIRD)

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.989
and a retro soundtrack that itself is almost
worth the price of admission.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.169
If you’ve got an extra dollar in your eShop
account and absolutely need something worthwhile

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.160
to do with it, Sky Peace is here for you.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.559
To make peace with.

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:17.870
In the sky.
