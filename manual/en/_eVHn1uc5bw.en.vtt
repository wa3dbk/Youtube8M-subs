Hi, I'm Chef Tony Matassa, today we are checking
out the grill pizza oven combo, this is the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.080
alsace.. let's have a look under the hood.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.730
The cooking grids measure 16inches deep by
26 inches wide and can comfortably grill up

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.550
to 15, four inch round hamburgers at a time.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.540
The grids are made of solid stainless steel,
allowing for great sear marks and durability.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.030
Below the grids, you will find the firebox,
inside the firebox you can use either hardwood

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.570
or lump charcoal.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.550
Fuel can easily be added by opening this door,
and the pan also slides out.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.290
Below this wood fuel pan, there is a slide
out drip pan for easy cleaning.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.430
On the exterior of the door, there are two
fully adjustable vents, allowing for customizing

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.850
the cooking environment depending on what
you are grilling or baking.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.570
The great thing about this Alsace is when
you are ready to bake, or make pizza simply

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.950
lower the oven section over the fire and you
have an outdoor wood fired oven!

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.770
On the oven portion, the door has an easily
accessible window with a thermometer in the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.320
center for precise temperature control.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.700
On the inside, you will find over 1.5 inch
thick masonry cooking stones, providing incredible

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.150
heat retention and distribution.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.729
The heat of your fire not only heats the stones
for a crispy pizza crust, but it also travels

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.090
up the side and back of the double lined walls,
providing a 360 degree cooking environment.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.530
Other nice features include the removable
chimney with a rain cover on the top, and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.909
two folding stainless steel side shelves.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.130
