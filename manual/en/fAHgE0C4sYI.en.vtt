This is Bob Olsen with Expert Village. We're
gonna take this torch, this propane torch;

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.880
it's just a regular torch. We're gonna light
it and we're gonna burn the edges of this

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.240
birdhouse to make it look more, there we got
it lit, that's the first time it's ever lit

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.850
the first time on me. Now what we do is come
along here, if you see the light color of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.289
the wood there and we'll just kind of make
it look darker so it looks more original on

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:37.100
most of this. And it doesn't take too long
to do it. And I like to do all the edges,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.500
the raw edges which are sawed because it makes
it look so much nicer and it looks a lot older

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.800
looking. And the wood is old but when you
cut it, it's still kind of in the inside there,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.380
so you take the torch and you just kind of
burn it in there. And that color, a little

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.739
bit of it will come off and I don't like to
use any finish on my birdhouses because I

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.909
find that, I don't know why, but birds seem
to know when it's finished with some kind

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.659
of a lacquer or something like that, and they
don't like it at all. So what I like to do

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.950
on the chimneys too, is I like to hold it
in the middle there and really burn the chimneys

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.300
because the chimneys usually are pretty well
burned but after I burn the inside of it real

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.369
good then I come down and let it burn on the
outside a little bit to make it look more

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.819
real and then, of course, on your roof, you
know you've always got a burn place on your

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:45.569
roof where it comes down. And so you just
take and run it down that way and then it

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.490
looks more original, it looks like you've
had a fire in it and then we've got the back

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.439
edges here to do, like I say, if you had two
raw edges like this it'd be really nice to

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.799
use the old edges. So there's not really a
lot to do it, it just takes a little time.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.450
Sometimes you want to burn it a little bit
darker than others, but I like to leave it

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.770
just pretty close to the same color wood that
was on there. We can go to the next segment

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.920
and we'll finish it up and I'll show you my
little trademarks.
