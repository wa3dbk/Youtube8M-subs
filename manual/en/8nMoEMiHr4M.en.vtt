00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Maor Melikson plays just four months in Wisla Krakow 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And in approximately 120 days he got anything he wanted.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
His four goals and an equal number of Assists for Visla promoted the team for the Championship.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
He himself took the title 'revelation of the season'

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And even the national team dilemma - Poland or Israel is already solved.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In this short period, and a little before the age of 27, football started to smile for the gifted child from Yavneh.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is where I grew up. We came to this Water tower every night when we were kids.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We were yelling until the neighbors would go wild and chased us with sticks or something.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Isn't it cold there in Poland?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In The first game it was minus 15 or 16 degrees. I remember when we landed and it was very cold.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I told my agent it seems difficult to live but I am glad I was wrong. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
From the start everything was right for me.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I took the ball, I was not ashamed, I did what I know and I had a good game. I felt good.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Before the good months in Poland Melikson past years wasn't easy in Israel.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The Potential sword from the days in Yavneh drifted above him. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
A good term In Beitar Jerusalem and one in Maccabi Haifa that few remember proceeded before the relegation with Hapoel Kfar-Saba.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
He also lowered it to division two.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Once you're expected so much it's not easy.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I had some good years in Yavneh and In Beitar.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Expectations are not something easy to handle.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm not one that cares what people think of him but. It was not a pleasant to walk down the street and people ask 'Where do you play?"

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
At the beginning of this season I was not in good shape.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
A few games after things worked out better.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I played as usual and I'm glad things worked out at the end.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
From there he began his new connection with the Team Hapoel Be'er Sheva.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Things came together for me there from the beginning.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I felt pride in the city and the fans that helped me. I am like that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I think they (Be'er Sheva) will work out fine. There are excellent players and the team is in good hands.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'll be honest with you.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I knew I was an important player but I did not think it will be like that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I thought there were enough good players to reach the Top playoff.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You want me to do a Circle?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I had a good season...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
A Gifted guy...

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
When the winter came the talk of a possible move the Visla Krakow Started.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The team that most Israeli remembers from the big win over Beitar in Champions League qualifier recruited the new 5.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
From the beginning until the championship goal everything came together.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Here I am ... This Player played against Beitar, an excellent player.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I brought my dad the shirt after the game.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
When I got there they took the photo, I look awful mad.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This is the medal of the championship, 40 Kilogram it seems...

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Funny little story. The night before I had serious back pain.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I called the doctor at midnight and he gave me two shots.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I decided I did can't give up because my family was there and my girlfriend with fans from Be'er Sheva. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And... If we win we are champions. I scored the winning goal.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Even an entire career could not prepare him to madness in the streets of Krakow after the championship game.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We arrived with the bus and there were some 35 or 40 thousand people in a large square. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Flares, songs and you see so many people like ants and they are all singing and know the names of the players.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I filmed the all time; I had to show this to my friends.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The good ability from the first games in Poland raised a speculation.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Poland National team coach, Smuda, sent representatives to ask the player whether he would to represent Poland in Euro 2012.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The Media said that the coach asked if I want to play for Poland and he also sent some people to me that asked 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Professionally, they sure are in Euro 2012 and my class is higher in Poland.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The thought crossed my mind but I decided not to, even if not invited to Israel, I Would like to play for my National team

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I played in all of the young teams and I owe the state. It is an honor to play for the country.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I want to be a factor and it's too bad that the injury came. I could contribute. I have things to give, I hope, I believe...

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Look at this face...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Julio Come ... Julio, He has European looks
