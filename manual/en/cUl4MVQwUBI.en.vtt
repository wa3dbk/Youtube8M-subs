00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:13.813
Looks you have a newer car here Michael. What is it?

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:17.660
Hey aaron we have an 07 Mazda 6 Customer says that  the check engine light is on.

00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:21.694
I gotcha. Are there any symptoms or is there just a code?

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:24.120
Customer said that id did not run any different but just a check engine light.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.807
You know as well as I do if there is a light on then there is a problem. 

00:00:27.807 --> 00:00:32.840
It may not be enough for the customer to notice but there is a problem. I agree any time the oghts on there is a problem.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.620
Well I am sure you have already scanned it. what code did you pull out.

00:00:37.793 --> 00:00:42.513
We have a P0455 code evap gross leak code and a p0171 which is a lean code. 

00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:46.320
and as per every car maker you have to diagnose the codes in order, first code first. 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.880
Second code second in order to get the correct diagnosis. 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.020
Lets get started on the P0455 code and go from there. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.020
A p0455 code states that there is a leak in the evap system 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.413
Evap stands for evaporate emissions system. EVAP is government mandated.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.400
They do not allow fuel vapor to be released into the atmosphere unless its reburned through the engine or released through a charcoal filter. 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.729
And the evap system is pretty simple once its broken down. 

00:01:18.353 --> 00:01:25.353
it consist of a vent solenoid a purge solenoid a fuel tank pressure sensor and or vacuum sensor and a charcoal canister. 

00:01:25.353 --> 00:01:30.631
The vent solenoid vents the fuel vapor through the charcoal canister. The purge valve reburns it through the engine. 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.120
The fuel tank pressure sensor ensured the integrity of the system that it holds pressure and or vacuum. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.100
To any diagnosis is a very good visual inspection. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.960
Since we are dealing with an evap problem, we want to check the lines and components.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.120
You want to start following the lines from the engine back to the fuel tank 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.280
and then back to your evap canister

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.840
yont to check for dry rot cracks or physical damage.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.620
Fro the top of the car you want to follow the line from where theycome up from the bottom to the purge valve.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.080
to the intake.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.440
Now that we have our code 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.068
we want to check our code against technical service bullitens. 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.380
tsb's are put out by every manufacture that are known fixes to common problems.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.560
after the visual inspection everything looked to be in proper working order and intact. 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.426
I just found a tsb referring tp the purge valve talking about it leaking down 

00:02:46.488 --> 00:02:50.088
and causing our code. great Michael lets start there. 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.910
lets check that. 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.140
We are going to save us and the customer time and money.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.580
The tsb states to unhook 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.700
the purge valve electrically and un hook the vacuum line

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.100
from the fuel tank side

00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:12.401
we are going to use a standard vacuum guage 

00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:15.702
hook it to the back side of the valve

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.680
crank it up and if the valve does not seal properly it will pull vacuum

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.220
if it pulls any vacuum its a bad valve

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.112
go ahead and crank it up aaron

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.980
you can see we are already pulling a little vacuum 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.800
and the longer it runs the more vacuum it pulls.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.640
we definitely have a bad purge valve and looks like found the problem

00:04:00.144 --> 00:04:03.104
we will replace it and clear the codes retest 

00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:03.604
to verify the repair

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.500
and we should be good.
