00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.069
so as i'm sure you're aware of the news
has been buzzing lately about jeremy

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.490
wins a maze ing performance in his first
few games as starter for new york next

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.940
but the part of a story that i'm really
interested in is based on a huffington

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.470
post piece the talks about how much
jeremy lin has done to change the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.950
perception of harvard basketball by
harvard undergraduates it's really

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.470
amazing house for a long time obviously
this is a major you know basketball

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.790
school but he's actually got people
thinking about it and talking about it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.979
both inside and outside of class

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.809
we have quotes here for people who
covers sports for the harvard crimson

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.559
which is the uh... the harvard on campus
newspaper he says people are even

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.840
skipping reading to watch n_b_a_ games
on t_v_ or string on the internet

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.239
this is sort of a major school i imagine
that they take their studying

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.180
pretty seriously it's also lead to a
dramatic increase in views on their

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.879
youtube page because you know they have
videos from when he was playing at

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.140
harvard

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.140
so it's pretty amazing how one athletes
sort of rise to this amazing starting to

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.940
slip such a short time has been enough
to completely change the perception

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.590
of this university sports program from
both the students and from you know the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.320
faculty and fans and all of that they
want to talk about how there's been a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.810
lot of press interest

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.190
in china to interviews with former
teammates of wins when he was a harvard

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.300
uh... so it's changing it really a lot
about harvard at how people perceive it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.640
sports and one interesting angle on this
is if there's a lot more media coverage

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.140
of their of their basketball program
which by the way i i i wasn't sure you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.110
know has been doing quite well that's
gonna probably generate quite a bit of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.310
money for harvard as well so freely this
story's been a win-win you have this

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.600
really inspiring story about athlete
sort of coming out of nowhere

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.330
representing a school that you wouldn't
really expect an n_b_a_ athlete to come

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.079
out of it's also doing a lot of good
first former out dot teammates

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.759
and for the program in the universe
itself so there's been a pretty amazing

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.770
story there's been a lot of discussion
about online i'm sure you have your own

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.270
view on how significant his recent
performance has been in this talk about

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.390
easy to be the next michael jordan all
that alley that's a sports channels but

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.140
i think it's really interesting the
harvard itself has been gripped by the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.280
slim sanity celestial you think he did
not comment down below and if you're a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.319
student at harvard in your wrapped up in
this sort of change in perception of

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.590
harvard up like that i would love to get
a video from u and it's really

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.490
interesting to send that in this indian
annotation up into the video

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.790
