00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.950
Ok, now we've done the grip, we've done the
drawing again. This is a home run key point

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.590
I want to reiterate, I can't stress it enough.
Again, I firmly believe there are no such

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.360
things as accidents when it comes to firearms.
There should never be an accident with a firearm.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.660
A Firearm is a mechanism, mechanical, unless
there's a round in there that's going to explode

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.440
or whatever, the weapon will only go off at
the hands of the person who pulls the trigger.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.780
That's why we don't play with loaded weapons
and we don't do all of that. Having said all

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.270
of that, what I would like to demonstrate
now is finger placement. This is crucial.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.000
Every time I draw my weapon, wether I think
I am going to shoot, I know I am going to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.440
shoot or I am not sure, this is how it comes
out. Finger on the side of the frame. I draw

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.560
down on my target. Now if I have to fire,
it's a millisecond to go like this (moves

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.610
finger to the trigger). I don't even know
if it's a nano second to go from here to here.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.400
But if I start of here, what happens is sympathetic
fire. If you are on a firing range and a lot

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.890
of people are firing and you're not ready
and boom and you flinch and jump you pull

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.960
the trigger and pull off a round. So that's
what we try to get out of so we always finger

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.760
discipline. Finger on the side of the trigger.
People say well, I don't like that because

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.450
what if I have to shoot right away? Well how
long does it take to go from here to here?

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.920
You know from here to here I am already on
target all I got to do is this. Bang, pull

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.119
the trigger. So that is not a valid argument.
IT saves lives and this is how you train all

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.000
the time. This gun can't kill anyone of us
unless I load it and pull the trigger. I can

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.990
drop it, run it over. It will screw up the
gun but it won't actually kill no one unless

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.650
I actually pull the trigger. And that's how
most weapons are being manufactured with the

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.790
stringent laws and stuff today in all of the
different states. So finger placement is very

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.060
crucial.
