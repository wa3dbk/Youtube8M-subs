Hi everyone, I am Pepino from MSI Headquarter and today we are on the COMPUTEX booth on MSI. 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.000
And I'd like to introduce you to some really really nice case modding made by Soccer from Hungary. It's called MSI GAMING Dragon.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:28.500
And it includes our X99A GAMING 9 ACK motherboard. It has lightning eyes and moving wings, and all the component are hidden inside the case, so it's really really nice

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.170
And I invite you to join us with Soccer to take a seat to see more about this mod. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I live in Hungary, Budapest. I work in the Hungarian State Opera. I make scenery and props

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I started modding on my own machine. I made a bug from it, and I was satisfied with it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:13.300
Later, it came to my attention that there are others in Hungary with similar interests like me. I went to them and I decided that I try myself.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:34.000
As usual, there were plenty of ideas between two Plexiglas hang a machine, or a big dragon's body hidden in the machine. But there wasn't enough time for all that. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In the end we decided to make a Dragon-PC hybrid.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The hardest part was making the dragon in unique character. It had to be mean, but a little bit kind, and wise. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The inspiration to this idea came from MSI GAMING Series motherboard parts. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We tried to follow the color scheme of this motherboard, that is the red and the black, it is very important in this case.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:35.200
Following this color scheme then this Gaming Dragon Mod was born.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.000
I don't know the exact work hour that we had put in it, but many times I worked on this mod until late night whit my friend BaluC, 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000
who helped me on the whole project, so it could be finished before deadline.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.270
The hardest part was making the character of the dragon.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm most proud of the dragon character. The shape of the body and the painting.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And work together with my friend BaluC, who helped me a lot in this project, and co-work to create this mod.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:54.070
The air-brush is what I would like to highlight, and the head, and the sculpting of it. The wings' movement is also an important visual effect of this mod.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.667
The most proud of? The Design. The eye, I did the whole thing. 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:12.030
The base paint, so Soccer could do the airbrushing on it. The tail and the most proud of the co-working!

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.000
The working together it was very important to finish it in time!

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.000
Don't give up, of course! Not even when it seems no reason to continue that mod.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Not even when you have to sacrifice money on it and not even when you don't win on a contest or on an event.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.600
I think the greatest creations are made when you make it for yourself, and not for others.
