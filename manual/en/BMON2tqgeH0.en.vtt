Hey what's up guys, Sean Nalewanyj here of
BodyTransformationTruth.com, and in this video

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.900
I just want to share with you one really simple
form tweak that you can make to your leg extensions

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.079
to help you get a better overall contraction
in your quads on each rep if you do perform

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.470
leg extensions as part of your overall routine.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.630
And the form tweak is this, at the top of
each rep when your knees are fully extended,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.130
also focus on raising your knees up off the
seat as if you were trying to bring your thighs

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.690
toward your chest.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.059
So you can test this out for yourself right
now in your chair as you're watching this

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.059
video.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.061
So first off, just extend your knee upward
as if you were performing a regular leg extension

00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:53.730
exercise and notice the contraction that you
feel.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.840
And then from there, lift your knees up off
the seat toward your upper body, and even

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.879
though your knees are probably only going
to travel a very smal distance, maybe an inch

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.740
or two, you’re going to immediately notice
a deeper contraction in the middle portion

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.340
of your quads.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.700
So why does this happen.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.190
Well, your quadriceps are made up of 4 individual
heads, and all of them insert onto your lower

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.460
leg and they perform the basic function of
knee extension.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.520
However, one of the 4 heads which is called
the rectus femoris and it’s the one that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.250
sits right in the middle portion of your thigh,
that head originates up on your pelvis, and

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.790
on top of performing knee extension it also
performs the function of hip flexion as well.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.130
So, by combining both of those functions,
knee extension and hip flexion into the exercise,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.290
you’re going to end up getting more well-rounded
stimulation of your quads on each rep because

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.990
you’ll be training the rectus femoris through
both of its functions, again knee extension

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.560
and hip flexion.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.280
The difference here is not going to be anything
too significant but if you are looking to

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.800
get every possible edge when it comes to building
up bigger quads and maximizing your overall

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.930
leg gains, then this is one basic technique
is definitely worth incorporating into your

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.989
workouts.

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.599
And if you find that it feels a little bit
awkward to raise your knees up off the bench,

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.019
another option here is to slightly raise your
butt up off the bench instead because that's

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.410
going to help you accomplish basically the
same thing.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.519
So thanks for watching this video lesson,

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.989
