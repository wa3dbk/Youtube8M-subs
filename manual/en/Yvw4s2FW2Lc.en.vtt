00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.290
Hi!

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.290
I'm the YouTube deal guy!

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.000
You might know me from your local TV Station
or USA Today.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.670
If you're a subscriber you are the reason
I have a job!

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.170
You have no idea how much I appreciate you!

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.469
Everyday I found huge deals.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.490
None of these are paid products and I do not
make a dime a commission on anything I show

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.490
you.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.220
And I put everything right under this video
window.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.590
Today, before we get to some really amazing
Bluetooth savings, I just want to point out

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.130
that if you are new to this channel please
click the subscribe button on your screen

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.900
right now and you will be signed up to get
all of my huge deals moving forward.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.430
Now at the end of this video I will explain
how you can get the ultimate grab but the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.050
Bluetooth speaker that I was going to test
today is not this one.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.090
I was going to do the sound brick because
it had dropped in price again but when I actually

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.240
got to hear the sound on one of these bad
boys and see all of the features tied to this

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.560
go groove, I was blown away!

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.590
Now here's what I like about this re-chargeable
wireless speaker.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.610
It has NFC Technology.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.470
So what that means is if you're device is
equipped like many blackberry's are and actually

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.290
the Android device I use, all you have to
do is tap your phone against the speaker to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.770
pair it, which is an incredible feature!

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.630
But of course, there is also Bluetooth capability,
if you have an I-phone or any other device.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.130
Tremendous speakers which Intern Amy is going
to show you, HI AMY! we will get back to her

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.130
in a moment!

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.330
This speaker, which is rechargeable with a
flash import and Bluetooth 2.1, is tremendous!

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.210
The price is increbible, 20.00 dollars down
from 70.00! 72% off!!

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.520
Now before Amy shows you the speaker, for
those of you who need a little refresher on

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.400
the controls sometimes, as we all do with
all of our devices, there is a grid on the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.229
back that shows you what you can do.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.520
The speakers are not only on one side of this
but two so that means you are also getting

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.049
a back stereo sound!

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.590
Now Intern Amy is ready with the audio test!

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.119
You actually really like device out of the
dozen you've had a chance to test.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.479
Yeah I like this one mainly because it has
Bluetooth that can sync to my I-phone.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.610
But if you don't have Bluetooth capability
on your phone you can use this AUX chord.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.479
It charges via USB which is also nice!

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.260
So right now we are going to do a little audio
test with my favorite song.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:13.450
(UpTown Funk plays) MAKE IT LOUDER AMY!

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.760
I am now about 20 feet away from you, great
sound!

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.450
It's very powerful!

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.819
If you want to grab this deal, the link is
located right under this video window!

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.340
This will be around maybe a few days, ideal
for dads grads and everything else!

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.340
And now floor director Jeanie has an important
message for us!

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.590
Hey guys its floor director Jeanie!

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:42.709
