On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Laura Banford
and I'm going to teach you how to make a super

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.320
sandwich. Now that we've prepared all of the
ingredients for our super sandwich, it's time

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.650
for the very important step of sandwich assembly.
You can't just take your ingredients that

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.520
you've lovingly picked out and prepared and
slap them on a sandwich haphazardly and expect

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.620
it to be a super sandwich. That's not going
to happen. The order, in which your ingredients

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.320
go on this wonderful loaf of bread, makes
a difference. It's really going to make a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.570
difference on how the sandwich looks, and
tastes. We have this wonderful loaf of Italian

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.120
bread. It's a nice big fat loaf, soft, because
this is going to go in the oven and you don't

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.150
want to start out it being too hard. I'll
take my serrated knife, cut it right down

00:00:49.150 --> 00:01:01.940
the middle here,
we're going to open it up, and there we go,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.540
beautiful. Now we're going to take our spread
that we made in the last clip, with mayonnaise,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.370
barbeque sauce and pickle relish, and this
goes on both sides. It has a lot of flavor

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:25.480
and texture, like I said. So you want it to
go on both sides so you get that "zing" with

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:35.640
every chew.
Next we're going to take our wonderful roast

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:54.000
beef, lay that down,
then we're going to take our mushrooms, like

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:17.610
that, our onions go next, nice and caramelized,
nice and brown, then our tomatoes and very

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.760
important, right over our tomatoes go our
cheese, thinly sliced provolone, and that

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.650
way the cheese is going to melt over the tomatoes
which I think is really important, got our

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:43.600
bacon, and finally our leaf lettuce. That's
how you assemble a sandwich if you really

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.980
want it to be super.
