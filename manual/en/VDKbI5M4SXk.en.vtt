00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.240
How to Climb Mount Everest.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.490
You may not be able to move mountains, but
they can move you.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.400
Standing at the top of the world after an
extremely challenging climb can be a profound

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.400
experience.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:24.310
You will need $60,000 Excellent physical condition
Weights A practice mountain An expedition

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:33.190

Energy Safety practices A mountain-climbing

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.190
course (optional) and weight gain (optional).

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.930
Always consult a physician before attempting
to do any exercise or exercise plan.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.930
Step 1.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.900
Start saving your pennies – climbing Everest
is not only a challenging expedition, but

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.400
also an expensive one.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.080
You'll need about $60,000 to make your dream
of standing at the top of the world a reality.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.080
Step 2.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.790
Get in shape by running 5 to 10 miles a day,
preferably uphill, for at least 12 months

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.100
prior to your climb.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.940
Lift weights to build your upper body strength.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.220
Step 3.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.889
Practice on an easier mountain – both to
build your experience and confidence, and

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:11.130
to get your body used to exertion at high
altitudes.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.340
Take a course that teaches the skills involved
in ice and mountain climbing.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.340
Step 4.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.740
Join an expedition when you are ready to tackle
Everest.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.649
This will be a large portion of your expense,
but some of your equipment is provided and

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.880
climbing with a group makes for a safer experience.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.880
Step 5.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.289
Purchase all the gear that your expedition
does not provide.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.520
This will include clothing, boots, sleeping
bags, and more.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520
Step 6.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.139
Prepare yourself mentally.

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.320
Visualize a successful climb, while understanding
how hard it is going to be physically and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.609
mentally.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.450
Pack on some pounds before you go, as you
could drop up to 20 percent of your weight

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.619
over the course of the climb.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.799
Step 7.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.799
Tackle the mountain.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.310
Conserve your energy and your oxygen for the
long haul, follow best safety practices, and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.000
stick with the group.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Step 8.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.979
Brag to anyone who will listen.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.209
You’ve been to the top of the world and
lived to tell about it.

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.840
Did you know Erik Weihenmayer climbed Mount
Everest in 2001 – becoming the first blind

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.050
man to scale the mountain.
