00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:21.730
I heard about shuna in the local magazine
I saw it again in the local paper and it was

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.670
just what I needed.Trichologists are quite
rare around where I live so it was quite nice

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.800
to see Shuna was close to where I live making
it easy to come and see her.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:42.910
Before I came to see Shuna my scalp was very
red angry dry and very itchy and also quite

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.750
a lot of bald patches that I could see and
I was also aware that other people could see

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.890
it as well.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.860
The condition affected me and affected my
confidence, made me feel totally unfeminine.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.790
I used to go swimming a lot but it stopped
me going totally because I was aware when

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.820
I was in the pool, maybe people didn't notice
and it was just me but I'm sure that people

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.700
were looking at me because they could see
my scalp because my hair was wet and it was

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.430
very obvious and I couldn't bear to be in
the pool.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.670
So I stopped swimming as a result of my condition.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:24.450
Also sitting down and people coming for dinner
I would make sure I was standing up so that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.090
people weren't talking to me from a height.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.260
That bothered me as well.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.130
So yes it did affect a lot of aspects of my
life.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.290
When I first started seeing Shuna we talked
a lot about the condition and possibility

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.270
of why it's happened.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.670
We went through what I was doing at the time
to try and treat it myself the amount of money

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:56.509
I was spending things like medication I was
taking if any I also used to use a lot of

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.630
things like mousse and hairspray.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.710
I'd wash my hair every other day or every
2 days thinking that was actually good for

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.729
my hair.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.829
So after consultation with Shuna I realised
that using all this stuff on my hair was doing

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.200
no good at all.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.380
I would do anything I could to make my hair
look thicker.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:25.019
Some of the products were very expensive and
were very temporary as well, so that was one

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:32.590
thing that had to go and also I went and had
some blood tests at the doctor who was more

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.709
than happy to help.

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.989
Now I am much more confident.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.790
I can have my hair coloured, which I thought
I couldn't have.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.199
With Shuna's help and advice and working in
conjunction with my hairdresser we have come

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.199
up with a plan.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:50.669
Having my hair coloured makes me feel more
confident.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.000
Now people don't seem to look at me anymore
and it is growing back.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:08.189
Even my son was looking for me the other day
and he said 'oooh mum 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:14.059
I can see it's growing' these little tiny
spikey bits and he took a photo on his phone.

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.389
So yes it's fantastic.

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:23.719
When I first came to see Shuna I was a bit,
well I wanted to come, I was a bit apprehensive

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.609
because I wasn't sure what to expect to be
honest.

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.709
I knew they treated scalp conditions and hair,
but I didn't really know a lot.

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.909
I did a bit of research on Shuna and got a
little bit but it was great.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.969
She worked totally round me to come.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:45.909
I totally felt at ease and we just talked
about how it made me feel all the things I'm

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:46.909
telling you now.

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.879
We went through everything and it was great.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.040
It was fine and I couldn't wait to get back.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.339
It was great to get some advice rather than
going to the chemist or the doctor actually

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:05.209
and paying all this money for treatments that
I thought made me feel better but were not

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.319
long term.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.150
Shuna as a Trichologist has been fantastic,
she's been supportive, anytime even through

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.120
the time I was getting my hair coloured, and
she's offered to speak to my hairdresser as

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.549
well.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.590
She's been an incredible support, even sometimes
at the beginning of the treatment when I wasn't

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.229
sure if I was doing it correct I would email
her text her, always having a response.

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.770
Having to change appointments was never a
problem.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.780
Been very supportive emotionally and physically
I'd recommend Shuna 100% yes definitely and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.970
even if my treatment all went and my hair
has grown back fully I'd still be coming back

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.160
here, yes I would.
