00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.400
Before starting this tutorial I'm going to ask please that target at the bottom in the video description

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.440
the application must download playstore so they can continue with the tutorial.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.140

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.240
once you have done this movie opened page,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.740
In this page you can choose three different types of languages that the product operates as:

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.440
Spanish Latino, Spanish from Spain and English with subtitles in Spanish

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:44.500
when their chosen language use can also search for movies by categories to go directly to the type of films that we like, as you can see on the screen at this time.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.460
In this tutorial makes two tests with different genre of movies so that they can see that it works very well

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.000
well then seeketh the first film.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:06.180
I will put this movie is called (Voices) and is in English with subtitles in Spanish and Latin Spanish

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:16.800
As it is in first place in English with Spanish subtitles when transmitting my screen take that first choice and reflect on your screen

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:26.780
but if I wanted to see it in Latin Spanish should go on the bottom and choose another server appropriate to the language you want to convey to my screen.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:42.300
Once we have chosen the movie automatically on the top right we see a red arrow that means that we can now send our screen

00:01:43.320 --> 00:02:03.920
we will make next is click and a box red will appear and where it says SELECT DEVICE will scan your Androis screen connected to it our network

00:03:23.760 --> 00:04:42.820
