JEANETTE WHITE: Hi. I'm Jeanette White with
Expert Village and Piper's Quilts &amp; Comforts

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.070
is located in Salt Lake City, Utah in Sugarhouse.
Today, we're doing the English method of hand

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.779
applique. We started by tracing our design
on the back of our background fabric with

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.850
a brown micron pen. Now, we're going to take
heavy quilting thread and a heavy needle,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.870
and we're going to do a little tiny running
stitch right on top of that brown line all

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.760
the way around following our brown line that
we've made with our micron. And once we've

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.290
gone all the way around then we can clip our
thread and then we're going to thread our

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.680
applique thread. I like the number 50 weight
DMC thread because it's a very lightweight

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.170
and it does knot very much and it produces
a quite an invisible stitch. I'm not crazy

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.290
about silk thread because it doesn't have
a long shelf life. Now, I'm going to flip

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:09.249
this over to the right side and you can see,
I now see on the right side this outline where

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:14.899
I have done my running stitch going through
all the layers with my applique patch on the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:22.299
front. So I've now got both sides of the right
side facing up on the applique patch which

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.850
is here and my background fabric here. I'm
going to take my applique thread and do my

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.299
beginning knot. The knot that your mother
taught you, this one where you lick your finger

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.069
and then go around doesn't hold. So now, we're
going to take the long thread, crisscross

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.659
it with our needle, pick up the bottom thread,
wrap it around two or three times, the more

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.180
wraps, the bigger the knot, pinch it, take
our left hand and pull this through. And there

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.600
you have a perfect tiny little knot that will
never come undone. Trim the tail as close

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.219
to the knot as you dare. And now, we can begin
our applique process.
