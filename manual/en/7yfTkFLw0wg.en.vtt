00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.220
How to Make a Caffe Latte.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.760
Learn the art of luscious lattes, which taste
better and cost less than their paper-cup

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.650
counterparts.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.699
You will need 10 to 16 oz. of cold milk A
stainless-steel steaming pitcher A thermometer

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.699
An espresso machine with a steamer wand 1/4
to 1/2 oz. of freshly ground espresso A tamper

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.960
A spoon And a mug or latte bowl A saucepan
A milk frother Your favorite flavored syrup

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.620
and sugar or other sweetener.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.230
Clean the steam wand thoroughly before you
use it, since warm milk can breed bacteria.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.230
Step 1.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.330
Pour milk into the pitcher so it is 1/3 to
1/2 full and submerge the thermometer.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.120
Place the steam wand in the milk so the tip
is just below the surface.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.050
The difference between a cafe latte and a
cappuccino is that a latte is espresso mixed

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.470
with steamed milk, while a cappuccino is espresso
mixed with milk and foam.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.570
Step 2.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.440
Turn on the steam and watch the milk increase
in volume as it heats and aerates.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.570
Turn off the steam when the thermometer reaches
140 degrees Fahrenheit, and set the pitcher

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.570
aside.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.119
Never touch the steam wand or tip once you've
turned on the steam – it's hot!

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.749
Be sure to hold the pitcher by the handle.

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:17.009
You can also heat the milk in a saucepan,
and use a milk frother with a plunger to aerate

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.130
the milk.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.130
Step 3.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.369
Remove the filter apparatus – or portafilter
– from the espresso machine.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.729
Pour espresso into the portafilter.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.729
Step 4.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.880
Pack the grounds firmly with the tamper to
keep water from rushing through too quickly.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.259
Many portafilters have a "fill line" ¬that
the espresso should reach after it has been

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.719
tamped.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:35.719
Step 5.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.509
Replace and lock the portafilter and place
the mug or latte bowl below the spout.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.200
Press the button to start the water.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.789
It should take about 25 seconds to "pull a
shot" – that is, make 1 to 1 1/2 ounces

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:46.789
of espresso.

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.810
A good espresso shot is dark and rich with
a lighter-colored top layer called the crema.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.969
Step 6.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.049
Flavor your latte if you'd like by adding
1/2 ounce of flavored syrup to the espresso.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.150
Pour steamed milk to fill your mug.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.090
Use the spoon to hold back the foam.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.049
Add sugar or sweetener to taste.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.899
Did you know Each year, baristas, or coffee
bartenders, from all over the world serve

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.000
up their best lattes and other beverages to
compete for the title of World Barista Champion.
