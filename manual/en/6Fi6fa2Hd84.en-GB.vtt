00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:10.030
The Earth is 4.6 billion years old, if we
scale that down to 46 years. Humans have been

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.880
here for only 4 hours. Our industrial revolution
began 1 minute ago and in that time we have

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.759
destroyed more than 50% of the world’s forests.
Welcome to RIF.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:35.530
In 1894 a priest saved a 4 year old boy from
drowning, that boy was named Adolf Hitler.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.570
All the humans on earth could fit into one
cubic mile.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.490
Goats have rectangular pupils.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.030
A small percentage of static on televisions
is actually radioactive resonance from the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.050
big bang 13 billion years ago.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.400
If there were no space between any of its
atoms, Earth would be the size of a baseball.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.220
Turtles can breathe out of their butts.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.340
The loneliest tree in the world was hit by
a drunk driver. It’s in the Sahara Desert

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.240
and is the only tree for 400 kilometres in
any direction.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.829
Butterflies eat each other and are therefore
cannibals.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.539
And finally just months before 9/11 the World
Trade Center’s lease was privatised and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.600
sold to Larry Silverstein.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.389
Silverstein took out an insurance plan that
covered terrorism. After 9/11 Silverstein

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:43.929
took the insurance company to court, claiming
he should be paid double because there were

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:55.169
two attacks. He won and was awarded $4,550,000,000.
