"Hawaii is favorite destination for millions
of travelers.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.449
But each month, the full moon brings a unique
group of visitors to paradise.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.590
An influx of Alitina Alata or Hawaiian box
jellyfish.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.449
Dr. Angel Yanagihara of the John.

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.039
E Burns School of Medicine has dedicated herself
to researching this intriguing species and

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.079
applying her discoveries to medicine.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:52.030
Speaker 2: Over the last 17 years, I've been
looking at the Hawaiian box jellyfish.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.379
It's an animal called Alitina Alata, and specifically
I've been looking at the venom.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.889
I'm a biochemist, so my primary interest has
been in taking it apart and figuring out what

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:11.760
particular bio molecules make up this venom.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.210
I myself ended up in an ambulance, and I came
to, I had passed out, I was wrapped with Saran

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:29.590
wrap and vinegar and all these tubes coming
in and out, and I really thought "What in

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.590
the world are they doing?".

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.280
I never intended this to be a life long research
path.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:44.020
But as a biochemist, I was stung and that
intense pain basically feeling like thousands

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.130
of match sticks on my neck, got my full attention.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.310
My primary initial interest was just to do
a quick literature search, I thought it would

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.800
be already published and the answers would
be out there, just to answer my own curiosity.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.720
When I did a literature search though, I found
there was no answer already known.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.640
So that actually got more of my curiosity.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.510
The seventh to eleventh days after each full
moon, we look at the tidal schedule and all

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.069
these different factors, and we basically
go out to the beach during the night drop

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.709
from high tide to low tide, and we are walking
up along this control area off of Waikiki

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.879
beach that has been looked at every single
month without fail since 1997.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:46.189
In addition to that, we may survey other beaches,
but we collect every single animal on those

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:52.260
beaches during that time period and then we
report those numbers to ocean safety.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.680
There's over 60 box jelly species.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.659
Only one of them has this unique spawning
cycle where they come in the middle of the

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:07.959
night from the deep ocean, swimming over a
mile off shore to these particular beaches.

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.819
All the other species have very different
life cycles and field ecologies.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.939
So when we're out there the 7 to 11 days after
each full moon, there's only one species that's

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:28.400
coming ashore, and it's this Alitina Alata.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.469
The first experiment I did, while there was
no published declarative statement as to what

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:43.900
was causing this in these animals, there was
a hypothesis that there was a yet to be discovered

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.439
ion channel blocker, some mysterious silver
bullet.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.700
So I started out with experiments designed
to look for ion channel blockers.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.639
The very first experiment though was a complete
catastrophe, because as soon as I added the

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.309
venom, I had what is called leak current.

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:04.199
And this is a non-specific, non-starter basically.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.559
Once you have a leak current, you can't do
anything more.

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:13.889
I went in to different approaches to to look
for bio active compounds.

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.040
But at the end of the day, at the end of 17
years, I find in fact that that protein that

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.550
was causing the leak current is actually the
locomotive that drives the whole train.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.980
So it's a pretty ironic, circling path, it's
wasn't at all the linear plan I had in mind,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:40.690
but that was the beginning and it turned out
to be the answer.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.780
I think my major accomplishment at this point
is survival.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.200
Just to continue keeping my enterprise going
forward.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.650
I get no dedicated institutional support,
so I'm what they call "soft money".

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.240
For 17 years, I've brought in my own salary,
my staff salary, my equipment, my supplies,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.160
so just keeping that enterprise going and
writing enough grants to do that is a major

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.170
accomplishment, it's actually very difficult.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:23.340
But I have been passionate about answering
this question, and I have really enjoyed the

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:31.750
process, and I think that's probably what
I'm most pleased with, is just to be able

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.260
to look back and learn from the process itself.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:42.360
The process itself has sort of brought it's
own benefits and these are all very enriching

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.690
things that I have learned.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.400
And I think to draw students in, I've had
numerous undergraduates and graduate students

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.490
along the way, post docs, in to this enterprise
of discovery, is also something that is an

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.900
accomplishment, and I really appreciate being
a part of that process.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.420
We're dealing with a far more ancient types
of venom.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.420
In fact, it's one of the first animals on
the planet just after sponges, so we have

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.710
a very primitive life form.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.610
And these 17 years of deconstructing this
complex venom have shown that the bio active

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.860
constituents, actually a lot of them are far
more similar to pathogenic bacteria.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.250
My work really has clarified what is the fastest
acting agent, and then having determined that,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.550
I went though hundreds of compounds to figure
out how we can inhibit that.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:47.400
So now I have developed multiple technologies
towards that, and those are all these intellectual

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.050
property IPs that are now in the pipeline
to get out to the commercial market place.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.720
Unfortunately that's it's own slow process,
but we're in the middle of that and I'm very

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:21.280
happy about that."
