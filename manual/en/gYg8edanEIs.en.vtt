Hi this is Jon on behalf of Expert Village
in this video clip we'll be attaching the

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:18.700
chain on the original drawing for this project
that we modeled it after we have this cross

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.560
brace piece that helps keep it from opening
up to far and just falling flat. So what we're

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.800
going to do is actually go and install a chain
that goes across here. I purchased a packaged

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.239
chain of 10 feet in length and what I'm going
to do is just cut this down and having that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.770
silver chain we'll help keep it from sliding
apart and it'll match those hinges. Going

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.940
back to our drawing we want our open size
to be 29" I went ahead and laid my easel on

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.879
it's side and opened up the legs to 29". I'm
going to have my chain located right about

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.560
where those cross braces are on the back side
so I'm going ahead and measure the distance

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:23.850
of that and that is 19", so I'm going ahead
and cut off about 19" of chain. I'm going

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.610
to use my new cut piece of chain to measure
a second piece of chain so I have the same

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:41.180
number of lengths. To install my chain I'm
going ahead and drill a pilot hole in my desired

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:52.750
location
and then using a thin screw, I'm going ahead

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:11.080
and screw that through the chain.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.260
But I'm not going to screw that in all the
way because I still need that chain to rotate

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.150
a little bit. Go ahead and continue that same
procedure for the other side and then when

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.260
you test it out when you reach your 29" opening
your chain should be firm.
