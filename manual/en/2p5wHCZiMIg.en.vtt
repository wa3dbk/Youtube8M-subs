00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.420
Today is the day.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.149
You decided to buy your first home.

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:07.910
It is time to hop in the car and start looking
at "for sale" signs and making calls.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.809
You are excited and you want to make this
happen.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.049
Wait...

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.860
Buying your first house starts out exciting,
but simply jumping into the process without

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.119
a plan will not only give you anxiety and
frustration, it can lead to very costly mistakes.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.609
In the next few minutes, we will outline 12
steps for buying your first home.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.369
As important as the steps, is the order in
which they are executed.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.140
This step-by-step process will save time,
minimize stress, and increase your chances

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.450
of getting the best house for your money.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.940
In this video, we will summarize each step.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.860
In subsequent videos from the Home Buyer Channel,
we will cover each of them in more detail.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.140
The first step is to make sure your credit
rating is in good order.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.260
A low credit score can make financing more
expensive or even prevent you from getting

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.410
a home loan.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.750
Get a copy of your credit report, make corrections
if necessary, and do whatever you must to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.340
get your rating as high as possible before
you do anything else.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.739
The second step is to get an idea of how much
house you can buy.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.590
There is no sense in falling in love with
a house you cannot afford.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.799
According to Freddie Mac, a quick initial
estimate can be determined by multiplying

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.100
your gross annual household income by 2.5.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.479
But this calculation does not fully consider
your expenses or your existing debt.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.750
The best way to factor these in is by calculating
your debt to income ratio.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.159
Eventually, your mortgage lender will do this
for you, but you can get a head start by doing

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.110
the calculation yourself.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.340
The next step is finding a mortgage professional
and getting pre-approved for a loan.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.850
Many new homebuyers want to skip this step
and go directly to looking at houses.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.999
But do not.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.799
There are several good reasons for getting
a loan pre-approval.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.020
First, the size of your loan pre-approval
determines which houses are in your price

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.020
range.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.520
Second, loan pre-approval makes you a desirable
buyer.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.560
This is especially important if you end up
competing with other buyers for a particular

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
house.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.420
There are several different places to begin
looking at mortgage loans.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.079
You can go directly to a lender, such as bank.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.819
Or you can use a mortgage broker, who will
work as your agent to help you find a lender

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.270
who best meets your needs.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.360
There are also mortgage marketplaces where
you can compare different lenders.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.900
Now that you know the price of the house you
can afford, you are ready to choose a real

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.129
estate agent.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.230
This could be one of your most important decisions.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.299
A good agent will be a trusted guide through
the rest of the process.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.709
Finally, with your loan pre-approval and a
trusted agent, you are ready to look at homes.

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.769
Do not be surprised if this process takes
months.

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.060
But be ready to move quickly if a promising
house suddenly appears on the market.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.049
When you find the house you want, it is time
to make an offer.

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.110
Though it is common to offer slightly less
than the list price, remember that every local

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.250
market and seller is different, and that in
some cases you will be competing with other

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.460
buyers.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.800
In most cases, you should expect a counter-offer
and be ready to negotiate.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.450
Keep a cool head and look at the big picture.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.040
This is the time when a good agent can prove
to be invaluable.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.599
Once the deal is acceptable to both parties,
the offer is accepted and a closing date is

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.599
set.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.469
It typically takes 30 to 60 days to close.

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.610
Soon after the offer has been accepted, a
home inspection should be performed.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.439
This cost is normally paid by you, the buyer.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.799
Get this inspection done as soon as possible
to allow time for repairs and renegotiation.

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.210
In most cases, even the most pristine houses
will have something that comes up during inspection

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.860
that needs to be repaired.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.150
Unfortunately, this is when things can become
needlessly contentious.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.980
Do not get hung up on the many small items
that can show up on an inspection report.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.939
Instead, focus on the big items that could
be costly to fix.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.810
Before closing, you will need to get homeowners
insurance.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.969
In many cases, you can get an overall discount
if you purchase your homeowners and car insurance

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:44.650
from the same company.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.799
The final step is the closing.

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.680
As daunting as this may seem, your agent will
guide you through the process.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.280
They have been through it many times before.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.840
Now that you know the 12 steps to buying your
first home, you are ready to set out on your

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840
journey.
