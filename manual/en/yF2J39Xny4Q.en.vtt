00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.430
JAMES GRIME: They wanted to find
out the number of moves

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.530
it would take to solve the most
difficult combination.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.740
And this number would be
called God's number.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.920
If you have perfect knowledge of
how to do the Rubik's cube,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.360
you would be able to solve the
most difficult position in its

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.590
perfect, most efficient
algorithm.

00:00:23.592 --> 00:00:26.750
MATT PARKER: Obviously if you
get a solved cube and you

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.810
twist one bit, you've just
got to twist it back.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.880
So it could be one, or it could
be two twists, or it

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.420
could be five or so on.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.780
But what's the most you're
going to need?

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.554
It turns out, for a long
time we didn't know.

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:40.580
JAMES GRIME: So they knew that
the number of combinations for

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.235
the Rubik's cube was
this huge number.

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:44.320
It was 43 quintillion.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.980
And if you turn a piece 17
times, if you do 17 moves, the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.140
number of combinations you can
reach is less than this

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.610
massive number, 43
quintillion.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.750
So if you want to be able to
solve all combinations, it's

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.735
definitely more than 17 because
there's so many you

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:02.960
can't even reach.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.630
And they managed to work out
that there was less than 30.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.720
And over the years, they started
to whittle this down,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.192
closer and closer.

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:16.200
TONY JIANG: As you can tell, I'm
not really fast, but I'm

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
not too slow, either.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.780
MATT PARKER: It was 2010 was
the first time we actually

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.500
knew for sure no matter how much
you scramble up a Rubik's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.790
cube, you can solve it in
20 or fewer twists.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.650
It's often called
God's number.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.300
It's called God's number because
you have to be some

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.550
kind of omniscient being to
work out those 20 moves.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.570
It's so difficult to calculate
what those moves are.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.190
KATIE STECKLES: I couldn't look
at a cube and say, oh I

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.690
need to do these 12
moves or whatever.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.310
But there are people who can.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.840
So they do Rubik's cube
solving competitions.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.540
And they have, obviously, speed
challenges to see who

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.900
can solve it the fastest.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.240
But one of the other things that
they do is a efficient

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.240
solve competition.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.180
And the competition there is
look at a Rubik's cube and

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.020
then just write down a list of
moves that will solve it.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.680
The world record for
that is 23 moves.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.510
And obviously that was
for a particular

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.370
scramble of the cube.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.670
And it may have been that the
actual, most efficient way to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.780
solve that was fewer than 20.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.300
But a human can look at it and
actually write down a list of

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.320
23, which I think is probably
more impressive than people

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.370
who can solve it
really quickly.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.080
MATT PARKER: You might think,
well how do we know?

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.505
How do we know that?

00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:30.890
Did we just check all 43.25
billion billion different ways

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.550
of solving it?

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.830
And we effectively did that.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.830
JAMES GRIME: A move, by the
way, is a quarter turn, or

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.190
quarter turn the other
way, or half turn.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.630
That counts.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.120
So anything that you move
counts as a move.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.610
All right, so a quarter turn,
a quarter turn, or a half

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.154
turn, those all counts as one.

00:02:54.154 --> 00:02:57.483
MATT PARKER: So guys got the
Rubik's cube and they try to

00:02:57.483 --> 00:02:59.070
look at all the possible
combinations.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.320
And they realized that actually
you don't have to

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.210
check all of them, because some
of them are the same.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.080
And so they used arguments
from symmetry, saying, in

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.700
fact, being mixed up this way is
actually the same as being

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.580
mixed up that way.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.400
It's the same way to solve
it and so on and so on.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.240
And so they managed to whittle
down the number of ones they

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.020
have to check.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.650
And this is one of those
wonderful things where you do

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.685
a proof by exhaustion.

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:23.540
JAMES GRIME: They found a
very difficult position.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.720
It was called the superflip.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.230
Now the superflip is essentially
completely solved

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.070
except each edge position
was flipped over.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.650
Now that would be a very
difficult position to solve.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.220
They realized that you could
solve that position, the

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.940
superflip, in 20 moves.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.050
And they proved that you
couldn't do it in anything

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.770
less than 20 moves.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.750
So you couldn't do it in
19 or 18, nothing less.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.930
So 20 moves.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.330
So they thought, great.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.230
Maybe 20 is God's number.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.030
MATT PARKER: And to do a proof
by exhaustion, you have to do

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.710
two things.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.700
You've got to first of all
reduce the number of cases you

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.420
need to check as much
as you can.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.790
Secondly, you've got
to get very clever

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.080
ways of checking them.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.200
And so they got better and
better computer programs and

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.000
also more and more powerful
computers.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.260
So they just crossed.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.329
So they had reduced the number
of cases far enough.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.410
They had a fast enough computer
with a smart enough

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.970
program to check that many.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.440
And they could run it.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.330
I've been to the place where
they actually did the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.230
computation.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.860
It was at the Google
headquarters in San Francisco,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.100
just outside San Francisco.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.650
And Google, because it's run
by benevolent nerds, let

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.580
people use their mind bogglingly
powerful computer.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.370
The amount of computer power
that Google has is phenomenal.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.650
They don't use it all
of it all the time.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.390
And so if you come up with an
interesting enough reason,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.980
they will let you come and
play around on their

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.280
incredible computer
processing power.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.950
You've got prove that your
code's not going to

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.340
run amok, et cetera.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.270
And that's what these
guys did.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.750
They had their code
that checked the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.900
reduced number of cases.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.300
They ran it on the
Google servers.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.110
And they did.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.220
They exhaustively checked.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.770
And we know now, for a fact--

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.800
JAMES GRIME: --that God's
number is 20.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.656
Every Rubik's puzzle can be
solved in 20 or fewer moves.

00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:18.590
MATT PARKER: I'm actually
involved at the moment in a

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.030
attempt to set the world record
for the most people

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.820
solving a Rubik's cube
simultaneously.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.700
So we're going to try and get
2000 school students into the

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.020
O2 venue in London.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.610
And we're going to try and break
the simultaneous solving

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.590
world record.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.720
And it's for a charity.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.060
So the DePaul charity
has organized this.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.070
Rubik's is sponsoring it.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.110
And any school in the
UK can enter.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.875
It's on the 21st of November.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.750
So if you go to the
DePaul website--

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.500
Or I imagine, this
is the internet.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.650
We can probably hyperlink this
information beneath the video.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.410
Schools can get involved.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.985
I'm involved.

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:55.280
It's the charity I do
charity work for.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.810
It's to stop young people from
becoming homeless, which I

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.470
think is fair enough.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.410
I'm hosting the event.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.180
So I'll be there on the 21st
wandering around talking about

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.920
math and how wonderful it is.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.550
And I'm developing resources.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.890
So I've developed videos and
worksheets for teachers to use

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.730
to teach students how to
solve the Rubik's cube.
