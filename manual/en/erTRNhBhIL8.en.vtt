00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.860
Nice, the radio station's calling me.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.080
Everybody silent!

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.580
Hi.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.920
Hi Kelvin, this is Youri.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.640
I'm ready for the interview,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.560
so if you are too we can kick off.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.740
That seems like a good idea.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.908
I'm 100% ready.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.380
Radio 538 is interviewing us about this channel.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.380
[RADIO] They have 166k subscribers,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.020
and an average of 88k views per video.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.020
..Which kind of proves they're making good videos.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.020
We have Kelvin on the phone with us today.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.520
Hey!

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.860
How are you?

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.380
I'm good.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.700
We're full time YouTubers and we get do so many fun things every single day.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.320
You deserve it. Good luck.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.040
Thank you, thank you.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.100
And tell Peter I said hi!

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.876
I will.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.600
Alright, bye.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.120
Youri says hi.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.740
Did you turn it off?

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.720
Sometimes they automatically leave it on.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.760
I totally knew that, but uh, yeah, you know.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.420
Up top bro, good job.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.496
Up top.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.040
We're on our way to Kootwijkerbroek.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.340
We're about to shoot some footage, from a helicopter.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.320
We're making a promovideo for a company which arranges helicopterflights.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.100
When we arrived, everyone was eating fries.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.900
Hi, everyone.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.980
Let me introduce myself.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.260
We talked on the phone right? I'm Pieter, nice to meet you.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.620
We don't eat fries everyday though. On Mondays we eat hamburgers.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.720
We basically want to show what our work consists of.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720
Because the helicopterflights are primarily what we do.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.900
Those are our ideas. But we really want to hear you opinions on everything.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.280
Because you are the ones that know about filmmaking.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.140
So you'll stand here, and then we'll fly towards you.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.460
I really, really want some fries now though.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.640
Me too.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600
We were so close.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.560
If only we'd gotten here earlier.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.620
I NEED some fries man.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.320
How long will it take you to reach that corner?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.580
'Cause I'll first film the lift-off...

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.140
We're really excited to fly, but unfortunately I have to stay on the ground to film.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.140
Peter gets to go first.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.300
Then, it's Kelvin's turn to fly.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.140
Good old farmland.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.600
You're home!

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.500
Alright now push that.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.760
Push again.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.660
I'm pretty sure this'll turn out great.

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:01.876
You look like an actual pilot.

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:03.792
Time to fly, fellas.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.300
The wind is.... non existent.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.880
So I won't need these gloves.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.880
But the weird thing was, I was looking through the viewfinder without realizing I almost fell out.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.200
So they pulled me back in.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.020
The helicopterflight was epic.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.660
We do however have to wait for our helicopter to come back, in the cold, in the middle of nowhere.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.040
This just takes a little longer than we'd hoped.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.880
And did I mention it's really cold?

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.060
Can you get off the field? The helicopter's back.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.316
Done. Let's go home.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.940
Jasper, do you know what we're doing today?

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.000
No.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.320
We're going to our freinds at Endemol, to get some props.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.120
I'm Jasper and I'm always very serious about everything.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.120
But I'm actually the youngest.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.100
And then I hit the brakes intentionally.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.420
Who are we here for?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.160
Frank de Wit.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.740
Thanks.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.280
Was that really that hard?

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.340
What a sad little crossing gate.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.040
Where are we going?

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.340
I don't know. Visitors?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.840
That way.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.960
We're supposed to go that way.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.856
You're right.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.880
Today we're in the prop room to get some stuff for our videos.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.800
This is a space filled with thousands of random objects, and we can pick whatever we want.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.356
How cool is that?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.740
Don't we already have something similar?

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.740
No, it's not the same.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.340
This one's softer.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.500
This chair has gotten out of hand.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.160
A cow!

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.940
Yeah, but that won't fit in the car.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.260
All the things I actually want are just too big.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.144
 We're brothers.

00:06:07.144 --> 00:06:09.244
You humped the cow too?

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.380
We're cowbrothers.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.160
Congratulations on the 160k subs. There you go.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.280
Cool right?

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.480
Cool, I want to drink milk from it.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.520
Of all the things we could pick, we eventually only took 4 lamps.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.140
A little boring, but very light to take with us.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.740
Thanks for the lamps.
