00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:27.739
I’ve never played any MechWarrior games,
but from what I gather, they’re part of

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.249
a much larger franchise.

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.739
Something about BattleTech or MechBattle,
I don’t know.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.030
I’m going into this one with a pretty clean
slate here, so I have no loyalties or nostalgia

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.910
affecting my opinion.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:01:00.039
Which is unfortunate for MechWarrior: Tactical
Command.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.920
Like I said, there’s a lot of history behind
the MechWarrior name.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.490
There have been games in that series dating
back to the eighties, but this is its first

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.159
release on an iOS device.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.090
Frankly, you’d think the iPad would be a
good platform for this kind of mech battling

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.330
strategy type thing...and maybe it is.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.280
It’s just that this one doesn’t show it.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.829
The game puts you in control of a group of
up to four mechs.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.119
You go into its three worlds with a pretty
simple to-do list...destroy the enemies and

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.159
fulfill whatever your objectives may be.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.860
You do that by commanding your mechs and navigating
them around these sprawling environments.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:47.180
And really, that’s where the problems start
for Tactical Command.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.659
You move your characters by tapping them and
then tapping an area for them to move to.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.579
That’s fine, when it works.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.710
The problem is it sometimes doesn’t.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.520
You can tap all you want, but the command
won’t work.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.420
And even when it does, it just feels clunky
and slow.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.350
In fact, a good deal of its problems are directly
a result of that.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.300
The game just doesn’t run that well.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.290
And you know, for a game about blowing up
robots, you’d think there’d be some epic

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.290
combat here.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.680
At least some kind of satisfaction in the
battles...but there just isn’t.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.440
The camera is so far out, the combat just
looks really unimpressive.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:33.069
It’s kinda like you’re watching little
miniatures that...shoot water or something.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.640
The game doesn’t look very good, either.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.890
And that’s another area in which the camera
doesn’t help.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.360
It really shows just how barren the landscapes
are.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.020
And even though you see a lot of the levels,
you somehow never feel like you’ve got a

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.020
good angle.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.060
I mean, this just isn’t a very user-friendly
game.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.860
If you’re really into strategy games or
mechs, you might be able to see past its issues.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.390
But even then, I mean...it’s decent at best.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.950
And there are probably better options in the
App Store with bigger explosions than MechWarrior:

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:17.829
Tactical Command.
