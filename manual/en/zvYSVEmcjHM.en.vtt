00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.746
&gt;&gt;Marguerite: These kids aren't
just doing research to do research.

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:07.716
We're making sure kids are able to apply
the information across the curriculum

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.566
and in different aspects of life.

00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:13.106
That's real world, that's a skill
kids need to leave high school with.

00:00:16.506 --> 00:00:20.026
Our performance-based assessment
does come from that idea of rigor

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:24.526
and relevance, and the idea of it is
that your assessments require students

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:28.876
to think at a high level of rigor, so
that they're synthesizing information.

00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:32.146
They're creating from the
information that they've garnered.

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:36.526
We're making sure kids are able
to apply critical thinking skills,

00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:38.746
problem solving skills
across the curriculum

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:40.666
and in real world applications.

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.896
&gt;&gt;Kenneth: Can you apply the stuff
that we were talking about in class

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:47.456
to this new scenario that you
may or may not be familiar with?

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:51.706
In this case, a research project is
the performance-based assessment.

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:55.036
The project itself has
multiple components.

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:58.956
When I first made the assignment,
they see the rubric of how I'm going

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.336
to grade every component of it.

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:05.066
They have to make a model of their
compound using proper bond angles

00:01:05.496 --> 00:01:09.596
and show relevance by what they're
using to make their model out of.

00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:12.286
&gt;&gt;Student: One thing that is
being looked at is design--

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:15.936
&gt;&gt;Kenneth: The video component is where
they present the pros of their compound.

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:19.546
Instead of doing it as a straight
research and presentation,

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:23.516
I decided to change it into a
debate and amp up the project.

00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:30.256
They picked similar compounds and
debate which one is the most effective.

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:34.386
&gt;&gt;Today our debate is diesel versus
octane and we're going to get rolling.

00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:38.396
&gt;&gt;Student: The main use for octane
is as an ingredient in car fuel.

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:44.666
Even the supreme grade octane gasoline
isn't as expensive as diesel fuel is.

00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:48.836
&gt;&gt;Kenneth: Through the rubric, part
of that is to discredit their opponent

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:51.486
and use their video against them,

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:54.136
so they have to have all this
research prepared ahead of time

00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:55.586
and they're taking avid notes.

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:57.176
&gt;&gt;Student: Diesel fuel contains

00:01:57.176 --> 00:02:00.506
about fourteen percent more
energy by volume than gasoline.

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:03.606
This gives it a significant
edge in fuel economy.

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:07.086
&gt;&gt;Student: If you had a forty-two
gallon barrel of petroleum,

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:10.626
twenty-one gallons would be able to be 
used in gasoline and only about ten

00:02:10.626 --> 00:02:11.976
to twelve would be for diesel.

00:02:12.146 --> 00:02:15.716
&gt;&gt;Student: Luke also cleverly
leaves out how performance cars

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:17.756
such as trucks actually are...

00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:22.436
&gt;&gt;Kenneth: The rubric for
the project is over half

00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:23.676
of their fourth marking period grade.

00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:27.846
The model and video, they both
have a sixty point weighting.

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:32.536
You've got the opposing argument, the
rebuttal, I gave it thirty points.

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:33.806
&gt;&gt;Student: So that's
ninety-eight percent

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:37.766
of normal people every day are
driving around gasoline engined cars.

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:40.746
&gt;&gt;Student: So diesel is the
future and it a way better fuel--

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:43.736
&gt;&gt;Kenneth: All the notes that I take
throughout the process could have been

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:47.116
just a comment made,
organization of their thoughts,

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:49.756
or things that were directly
defined in the rubric.

00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:52.986
Like part of it is using their
opponent's video against them,

00:02:52.986 --> 00:02:57.126
so if I see evidence, then I write that
down, so that I can go back and say,

00:02:57.126 --> 00:02:59.216
"Look, here's why I'm
sliding it higher on the scale

00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:01.816
or why I didn't slide it higher,
because I did not see this."

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:04.136
&gt;&gt;Marguerite: Kids own it, they
want to know the information.

00:03:04.136 --> 00:03:07.296
Then they connect it to other things
that they know and it's theirs.

00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:09.186
They retain it and they
can do more with it.

00:03:09.186 --> 00:03:11.996
&gt;&gt;Kenneth: As a teacher, I was
trying to find a way to say,

00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:15.276
"You might not remember every test or
every question I've ever given you,

00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:18.816
but you will not walk out of those
school without remembering my class."

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:19.746
&gt;&gt;Student: You did good.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:20.286
&gt;&gt;Student: Did I?

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:20.586
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.
