Hey, this is Ryan Bowman, guest expert for Top 10 Best Website Builders.com

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.540
and i'm taking a look at free
website builders today.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.420
Now I hope you understand if you should
use a free website builder

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.029
or if you should upgrade. One the most
attractive aspects of

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.050
website builders is the fact that they're
low-cost. Many website builders

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.720
do allow you to build a website for free,
but it's important to understand the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.189
limitations with a free website builder.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.970
The limitations are a little bit different
with every website builder

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.870
but I'm gonna take a look at two website
builders Weebly and Yola

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.030
to give you an overview of the most
common limitations

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.540
when using a free website builder. The
first limitation is the fact that they

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.820
don't allow you to use your

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.370
own domain name, so with most free
website builders you're going to have to use

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.390
a sub-domain. So I created websites with
Weebly and Yola and for example on

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.120
Weebly

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.800
my site would be WebEminence - dot - weebly - dot - com

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.300
so the fact that you're on a sub-domain
means your site is always going to be

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.920
something - dot - Weebly - dot - com.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.659
 and if you have a free site from Yola

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.760
it'll be something - dot - Yolasite - dot - com.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.420
So this is one really good reason to
upgrade to a paid account

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.299
so that you can use your own domain with
your website builder.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.090
Another big limitation with free website
builders is the fact that the show ads

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.900
so I'm on my Yola site right now and
since this is a free site if I scroll down

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.530
to the bottom you see that it says make
a free

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.400
website with Yola and it's basically an
advertisement for Yola so if you click on it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.799
it takes people to Yola dot com.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.210
And if I go over to a free Weebly
website and scroll to the bottom

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.000
you'll see they also have an
advertisement at the bottom it says

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.030
create a free website

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.570
powered by Weebly, and if people click on
it actually opens a larger section at

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.600
the bottom where they can actually sign
up

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.140
for a free website right on your website.
Many free website builders actually

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.540
limit you on storage, bandwidth

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.569
and number of pages, and Yola is a good
example of this because if you go with

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.690
their free account

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.170
you're actually gonna be limited to only
three pages on your website

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.680
and one gigabyte of bandwidth, 1 gigabyte
of storage

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.600
and you'll see if you just upgrade to
their basic plan, you actually get unlimited pages

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.600
and unlimited bandwidth.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600
Many website builders give you total access to their website builder features

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.940
with a free account but there are some
that

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.450
will limit you on the features if you're
using a free account, and Weebly is a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.870
good example of that, because if I look inside their website builder

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.420
and if you scroll down the lefthand
side where all the widgets are

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.300
you'll see anything with a star next to
is actually a limited feature because

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.360
I'm in a free account. So they'll let me try
out these features but I won't be able

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.900
to publish them to my site until I upgrade.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.640
So if I try to add HD video to my site

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.140
it's going to tell me that a pro element and I have to upgrade

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.129
to use it

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.040
but I can try it out if I'd like. So
they're many cases where a free website

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.580
builder may be all you need

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.819
but if you're a business, or serious about
building a professional website for the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.599
long term

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.860
you'd probably be smart to consider
upgrading your website builder

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.330
to remove some these limitations and
take advantage of the advanced features

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.510
that they offer.
