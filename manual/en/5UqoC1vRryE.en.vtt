00:00:01.032 --> 00:00:03.032
Amazing sensation!

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.940
Long Cast

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.960
"Cast lightly, but makes long cast."

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.320
Good catch
“Awesome!”

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.300
Sharp dart

00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:18.100
Bringing innovation to the squid fishing world,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.100
Duel Technology produced the ultimate evolution of squid jig.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.780
MAG CAST SYSTEM -International Patent P.-

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.480
Duel particular about overwhelming casting distance on producing lures.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.740
Long cast is an essential advantage to anglers in lure fishing.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.280
It’s realized by Duel’s original super long cast mechanism

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.640
that is...

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.080
‘MAG CAST SYSTEM’ -Tungsten Magnet Weight Transfer System-

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.419
At last,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.720
EZ-Q series which is creating a great sensation 
with flutter fin and foot has adopted the MAG CAST SYSTEM.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.720
It’s named ‘ez-Q MAG CAST’.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.740
Comparing casting distance to conventional type

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:25.300
Conventional squid jig: AURIE-Q® RS #3.5
(Leader: Quick®Leader)

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.080
ez-Q MAG CAST
 (Leader: Quick®Leader)

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.411
In Practical measurement,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.280
comparing with original Oita type, ez-Q MAG CAST flew more than 20% far on average

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.080
and the maximum flying distance increased 33% up compare with original Oita type.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.140
Increasing initial velocity due to the weight transfer ball move to tail part by centrifugal force when it is casted,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.620
and casting distance remarkably improve!

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.500
&lt;Flying Posture of Conventional Jig&gt;
Comparing flying posture with conventional jig of Oita type, ez-Q MAG CAST flew steady.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.580
&lt;Flying Posture of MAG CAST&gt;
Comparing flying posture with conventional jig of Oita type, ez-Q MAG CAST flew steady.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.500
&lt;Flying Posture of MAG CAST&gt;
Almost horizontal flying posture reduces air resistance and realizes significant increasing flying distance.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.540
As you see, this is the difference in the angle of flying posture between two.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.000
The conventional jig flies with a lean of 54°.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.300
In contrast, ez-Q MAG CAST flies keeping 6° which is near to horizontal.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.820
In cooperation with Fukuoka Industrial Technology Center,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.080
We measured air resistance with a special fluid analysis device and proceeded developing

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.740
while repeating making prototypes.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.200
We set each jig for each flying angle.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.500
&lt;Conventional squid jig: AURIE-Q® RS #3.5&gt; 
-Drag Coefficient: 0.66(*It is assumed that flies at 60 km/h)-
As you see, when it floats in the same wind speed,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.400
&lt;Conventional squid jig: AURIE-Q® RS #3.5&gt; 
-Drag Coefficient: 0.66(*It is assumed that flies at 60 km/h)-
Conventional jig is receiving higher resistance on its body in flight.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.040
&lt;ez-Q MAG CAST&gt;
-Drag Coefficient: 0.27(*It is assumed that flies at 60 km/h)-
In contrast, ez-Q MAG CAST has less wind receiving area and resistance value is less than half.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.160
&lt;ez-Q MAG CAST&gt;
-Drag Coefficient: 0.27(*It is assumed that flies at 60 km/h)-
So, a huge gap arises in casting distance.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.400
Assuming an increase of up to 33% in casting distance and casting from one place,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.400
a searchable range expands up to 77% compared with a conventional jig.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400
As you see the image,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.900
there is a large difference between MAG CAST and conventional jig.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.400
No doubt it may be a big advantage following conditions.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.900
Against the wind,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.100
a strong wind,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.000
shallow seashore such as surf or reef area,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.200
when you target a far point,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.000
a popular area with many anglers.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.700
Especially, in against the wind, the feature will be remarkable.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.960
Furthermore, even under sharp dart and fall,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.960
‘MAG pocket which is ‘rear magnet structure’ can certainly fix a weight.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.760
And it makes the lure swim in a stable state.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.520
After land on the water, even jerking, a weight doesn’t move to rear. (Filming: Omijima Diving Center)

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.520
Another distinctive feature of ez-Q MAG CAST is PATAPATA fin.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.420
It is different from conventional feather type.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.600
It generates lively vibration when it receives water resistance

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.100
by dart and fall to be grabbed in spite of itself even by very cautious squid.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.620
At Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.940
Assuming an actual swimming bait under the sea,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.440
We set a live horse mackerel in the flowing water tank

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.980
to measure frequency of vibration of its dorsal and pectoral fins.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:47.560
It proved that PATAPATA fins and actual bait’s fins produce quite similar pattern of vibration and wave motion.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.420
Counting the number of fin’s vibration 
(Actual bait’s fins: 60 times in total/ PATAPATA fins: 62 times in total)

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.580
Not only casting distance but also quality of darting further improved!

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.800
ez-Q MAG CAST adopted ‘Oval Tying Head Eye’.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.520
Due to an eye which is placed on an upper part of the head,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.540
ez-Q MAG CAST is able to deal with a variety of jerks and perform very quick wide dart.

00:05:21.214 --> 00:05:22.154
As you see,

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:24.354
(Left: ez-Q MAG CAST/ Right: Conventional squid jig: AURIE-Q® RS #3.5)

00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:28.400
Comparing the number of dart in the same distance between ez-Q MAG CAST and conventional jig,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.580
Conventional jig darted 6 times within 2mater wide.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.400
In contrast, ez-Q MAG CAST achieved 10 times wide dart.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.580
It’s coming!

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.220
Because darting movement distance forward is short,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:11.160
ez-Q MAG CAST stay around target point to appeal to squids longer.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.480
It leads to increase the hit rate.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.700
Squid fishing from the shore is becoming difficult year by year.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.920
Everyone is thinking of undiscovered place,

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:28.440
and waiting for the meeting squids.

00:06:29.981 --> 00:06:36.501
Duel technology released an innovated squid jig which has overwhelming fling distance and vital feeling.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.180
ez-Q MAG CAST

00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:42.491
It expands range longer and wider

00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:44.314
and improves hit rate.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.020
It should stand by anglers in squid fishing
