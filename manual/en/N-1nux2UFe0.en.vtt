00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.379
A: I think that the most impressive thing
that hit me initially was Dr. Moy's hand and

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.149
eye coordination.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.120
That's special talent we can't give to somebody.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.250
That has to be innate.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.510
The way we operate, the procedures that we
do, are done so carefully.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.670
We spend that little extra time to make sure
that the tissue is properly handled, that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.440
the planes that we open we have the ability
to close again.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.399
That tissue just comes back together naturally.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:47.879
B: Coming up next, one of the most profound
discoveries of the 20th century.

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.250
How will the miracles of modern medicine lead
us into the next millennium?

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.879
Join us when we go behind-the-scenes, inside
the OR.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.320
C: Before I knew it, I was just waking up
and it was done.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.320
D:

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560
I went to the gym about five days later.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.799
E: Dr. Moy made me feel that we were going
to do this together.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:07.950
Dr. Richard Moy: Hi.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.060
I am Dr. Richard Moy.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.910
Are you or someone near to you suffering from
foot pain caused by bunions?

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.340
If so, you owe it to them and you owe it to
yourself to consider an examination.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.020
In the past, bunion surgery was often more
painful than the bunions themselves, but not

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.310
anymore.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.430
Using advanced surgical techniques, I've developed
a procedure that significantly reduces the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.560
pain and recovery time traditionally associated
with bunion surgery.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.540
In the next 30 minutes, I'll show you how.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.390
F: In my business, we sell tile, and stone,
and granite to contractors, builders, and

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.479
designers.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.590
My job requires me to be on my feet at least
ten hours a day, walking on hard surfaces,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.310
carrying samples, going out to job sites under
new construction.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.150
My concerns about having bunion surgery were
the downtime that it would take for me to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.150
recover from it.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.569
It amazes me that I can wear heels now, much
more comfortably than I ever could before.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.180
Walking on hard surfaces for ten hours a day,
I experienced no pain at all, like I used

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.920
to in the past, before bunion surgery.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.920
G: Mainly, it was the time that I was going
to take to recover.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.180
I felt that I couldn't afford to miss work
for one.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.530
The doctor I had consulted with prior told
me it would be six weeks to two months, and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.310
I certainly couldn't afford that.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.180
I'm also very active.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.380
I spend a lot of time training, and running,
and playing basketball.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.670
I'm just an active guy.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.620
My feet are very important in that aspect
of my life.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.220
I didn't think I would be able to continue
to do that unless I had had my feet corrected.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.980
As a doctor, Rich Moy has been terrific.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.510
His follow-up has been very precise.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.400
I recommend Rich, and have, to other people.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.209
From what I understand, their surgeries have
been very successful, as well.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.489
H: After years of having a lot of pain in
my feet, and being very afraid to actually

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.580
go through with having any kind of surgery,
I had always heard a lot of really horrible

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.420
stories about the pain that you experience.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.300
I've had a lot of fear about that, being not
able to walk, and being out of commission

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.790
for weeks at a time.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.110
After talking to Dr. Moy, he's assured me
that with this type of foot surgery and this

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.950
type of surgery that he does, you can choose
what you want.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.950
You can choose between being completely wide-awake,
with just a local, or being put to sleep,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.840
however you want to do it, what you're comfortable
with.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.689
Since there is no pain involved with the surgery,
you wake up not feeling sick to your stomach,

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:50.480
not feeling really disoriented, and in a lot
of pain, which is a really great relief and

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.260
comfort for me, another reason why I've decided
to go ahead and have surgery.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
Dr. Richard Moy: Hi Andrea, how are you doing
today?

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.260
Andrea: Fine Dr. Moy.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.260
How are you?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.260
Dr. Richard Moy: Good.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Andrea: Good to see you.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.260
Dr. Richard Moy: I know you're interested
in bunion surgery.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.049
So, what I'd like to do today is show you
your x-rays, and show you where your bunion

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.750
deformity lies.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.810
Right here, we have the first metatarsal.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.780
What you see here is an enlargement of bone
on the side of your foot.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.269
That's where your bunion is actually causing
you pain.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.250
This view over here of your right foot is
an angled view called the medial oblique.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.920
That shows you the dorsal medial prominence
or the prominence that is above and to the

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.560
side of your foot.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.100
This is a side view of your foot.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.660
Right here is where the problem lies.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.220
What we plan to do is create an osteotomy
through your foot, like this, to allow this

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.770
segment of bone to slide over.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.630
You can see, this segment of bone is cut in
this direction and slid over, and has screws

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.050
placed in it.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.930
This will all be smoothed off and polished
off, but that's left there to show you exactly

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.610
how the bone's cut and how the screw's placed
into the bone.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.510
This is a person's foot who just had surgery
about six weeks ago.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.830
Right here, again, is where the bunion lies.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.280
You can see the soft tissue swelling, that's
occurring around here.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.440
OK?

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.699
What we do is, we went in, we removed the
small segment of bone, here.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.080
We shifted this segment of bone over in this
direction, like this.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.220
Therefore, we're allowed to realign the sesamoid
bones.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.600
The sesamoid bones are sitting right here
and right here, right now.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.470
What you can see in the postoperative view
is that the sesamoid bones are realigned,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.310
right here, right where they should be, and
that the bone is in nice alignment.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.131
You can see how the angulation, or distance,
now, between this bone and this bone is a

00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:40.340
lot less.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.410
The toe is in nice straight alignment with
the first metatarsal.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.960
Looking at this other x-ray here, on the medial
oblique view, where I told you that the bump

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.670
is not only sticking out the side but up,
you can see how that's been completely reduced.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.650
And you see this bone here, right here, is
now in line with about this point here, so

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.240
the bone is no longer sticking past this red
line.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.630
Also, in this particular view over here, we
see how the metatarsal is here and this actual

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.690
bone has been dropped down slightly, right
here, and lowered, just ever so slightly,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.160
to create increased range of motion for this
patient, in this direction.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.100
Andrea: I heard from several people that bunion
surgery is extremely painful and they weren't

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.100
able to walk for months.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.100
Is that true?

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.360
Dr. Richard Moy: When you have a fractured
bone in your body, the pain is a result of

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.430
the two ends of the bone moving.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.330
We have created a quad-correctional bunion
procedure that realigns the great toe joint

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.370
in four different directions.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.080
Then we use a screw that allows for tight
compression.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.780
In this case, there is no movement and your
body does not tell you that your foot is fractured.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.280
Andrea: How long will the surgery last?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.890
And how long before the numbness wears off?

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.180
Dr. Richard Moy: Well, the procedure will
only last right around an hour.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:57.420
Then you'll go home, relax, keep your foot
up and the numbness will wear off in about

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.650
8 to 12 hours.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.670
Andrea: Will I need a cast and crutches after
the surgery?

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.120
Dr. Richard Moy: Well, after the surgery,
no, you won't have to use any crutches or

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.830
a cast because the bone is so tightly compressed
together that you can actually put pressure

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.480
on it without moving it at all.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.420
I: I found that I had no problem walking.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.670
It didn't stop me from going out and doing
the things that I normally do.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.370
J: Well, I've had foot pain for years.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.810
What it felt like was a burning, kind of,
dull ache . . .
