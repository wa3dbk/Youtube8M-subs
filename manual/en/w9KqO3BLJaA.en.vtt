00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.140
Hi, I'm Rob Fowler, I'm a Critical Care and General Internal

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.210
Medicine Physician at Sunnybrook Hospital, and over the next few minutes

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.300
it will be my pleasure to walk through our policy at Sunnybrook Hospital that tries to help

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.330
provide best care for patients, especially at 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.350
the end of life. We've had a lot of work on end of life and trying

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.430
to improve our ability to deliver the best care for patients that

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.460
are at that very tough point in their life, for many years.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.490
And it's come together as a policy among the physicians and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.510
nurses, spiritual leaders and allied healthcare team over

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.550
the last few years. At the end of life, having an appropriate

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.590
care plan and one that respects their wishes and also respects the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.670
limitations of some of the treatements that we can provide

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.680
is really important. We try to base all of our treatment

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.700
decisions upon what the patient, and if they're not able to

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.720
communicate with us directly, their family members or their substitute decision makers

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.750
are able to tell us about what they wanted through their life and what they might want

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.790
in times like this. Our job is to try and help

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.820
the families understand what the medical system

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.870
and nurses and doctors are able to do to help patients ideally get

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.920
better, ideally get them to a point where they are out of the hospital and 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.980
feel better, but sometimes it's not the case that we're able to 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.020
cure. It's important for us to balance the aggressiveness

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.090
that we are able to technically provide, especially in the intensive care unit,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.170
with a focus on making sure the patient

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.180
is comfortable, making sure they are not suffering with

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.220
pain or anxiety that sometimes accompanies severe illness

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.260
and that we are able to try and keep patients comfortable

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.300
even if we can't cure them. 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.420
The ventilator,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.460
medications intervenously, dialysis machines and other things

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.470
can keep the organs working for a long time,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.530
often though, we have a hard time getting the whole body better and 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.590
it's important for us to try to help both patients and families

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.620
to understand when we are at the limits of our ability to get 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.660
people better and are unfortunately in a position where we may only be 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.670
supporting their organs, and really not them as a whole person.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.720
And maybe not able to get them back to a quality of life and state of life

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.790
that they had hoped for. 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.860
When patients are inside the hospital and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.880
are admitted for an illness, the chances of CPR

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.940
being effective in getting them to a point where we are able to reverse

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.010
something imminently reversible, unfortunately diminish quite a bit. 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.040
And I think a lot of us are very much influenced by

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.110
what we maybe see through television programs where CPR is 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.140
being used very frequently inside the hospital setting and the emergency

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.180
room on hospital wards for patients that are quite sick and

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.230
it's interesting that on television shows it's almost

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.260
uniformally effective and patients frequently leave the hospital

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.300
smiling and doing very well. In real life, inside the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.350
hospital, CPR when someone is very ill to begin with 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.380
is often less effective. The notion that CPR will

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.410
always revive someone unfortunately just isn't accurate.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.460
And in the process of doing chest compressions and shocks to the heart

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.490
the patients that were minimally conscious or regain

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.510
consciousness for a period of time after that event, it can be a very

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.540
uncomfortable procedure and often leads them to a 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.570
condition that was much worse than they were in to begin with. At some point

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.630
we're all going to go through this period that leads us to

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.680
the end of life and one of the goals we might have here

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.730
whether it's for a young person, for an older person or someone 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.750
who was previously healthy or someone that has in fact suffered for a long 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.760
time with a certain medical condition, is to try to get through that 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.780
phase of life, at the end of life, as comfortably as possible, 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.810
applying medical therapies and technologies as much as

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.840
we can to try to reverse things that we can reverse

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.870
to try to help familiies and patients through that phase where maybe they are

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.920
not any more medical therapies that will cure them but maybe there

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.930
are treatments that we can apply that will help keep them comfortable

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.950
and help provide as good an attempt at

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.980
a good death as we can.
