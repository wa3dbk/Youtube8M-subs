00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.910
The studio overview of set.a.light 3D is located
on the right sidebar.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.730
There you can find the realtime-histogram,
the preview-camera, the studio top-view and

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.730
the setlist.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.000
The histogram is only a passive tool to display
information about the current light situation

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.780
and the tonal value that the camera captures
at the moment.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:35.380
More information about what the histogram
is and what it does are in our manual.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.550
The preview camera gives you full control
about your shots while you are working on

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.789
them in the studio view.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.329
It shows you, how the final picture will look
like.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.249
In contrast, the Main window shows you how
your studio looks like.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:01:02.329
Depending on your lens, you can zoom over
here and change the format from landscape

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.950
to portrait and vice versa.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.740
To adjust your framing you can do that smoothly
by holding down the right mouse button or

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.470
using the button in the bottom right corner
of the window.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.939
The preview-window is also the place where
you can choose your focal points.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.770
They allow you to focus on your object correctly.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.200
If you wanna take a closer look you can switch
between the windows with this button over

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200
here.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.390
But you can use a shortcut by pressing the
letter "T" on your keyboard.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.579
Of course, every function you had in the preview
window migrated to the main window as well.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.399
Like the preview camera, the studio top view
gives you full control over your studio at

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.210
every time.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.790
Move your equipment around by dragging and
dropping it around.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.700
This is especially helpful with large and
complex settings.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.750
The setlist is located at the bottom of the
right sidebar.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.340
It lists all used material and equipment which
are used in the setting.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.910
Especially extensive lightsets tend to be
confusing sometimes.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.440
In this case the setlist guarantees you a
good overview.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.050
Individual items like flashes or models will
be highlighted in the main window and in the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.330
Studio Top view when you choose them.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.770
When you work on the setlist, you can choose
more than one object by holding the ctrl (control

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.870
key) and then select multiple objects.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.830
When they are marked, you can move them around
with your mouse and the pressed down „ctrl"

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.830
key in the studio window.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.340
To even get a better organization out of the
list you can double click on the name and

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.110
change it individually.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.640
By pressing enter you leave the name field.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.730
Every change you made is now saved.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.380
The tiny lock over here prevents objects from
being moved accidentally.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.680
The handles will turn red in the studio window
for you to recognize it easily.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.940
If you want to lock all objects, simply press
"ctrl" and "A" and click on a lock.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.740
Now they are all locked.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.810
If you wanna reveal the selection, just click
anywhere in the studio.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.970
For example you can now unlock only one object
which you may wanna reposition.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.320
If you want to fine tune the position of your
model and objects you can do this by using

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.500
the arrow keys.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.940
The height is adjustable with the page up
and page down keys.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.820
But we have a shortcut for that as well, by
holding the letter „H" down and moving the

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.230
mouse up or down will give you the same effect.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.280
