How to make a rabbit pen

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:26.300
Today I will show you how to make three different rabbit pens.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:40.240
They range from very small to pretty big. The smallest has the most realistic dimensions, but it looks very cramped.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.780
I'll put in the rabbits at the end of the video.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.860
The rabbits are able to climb the ladder.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:50.160
This last one looks a lot like the previous, but it has some new features.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.880
Realistic but cramped!

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:34.060
Two floors and a lot less cramped.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.940
Two floors, access to the pen and an outdoor area!

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:51.920
