Hey! How you doing? This is Jonathan Escotto,
also known as B-boy Xcel, on behalf of Expert

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.080
Village, and today we're showing you breaking
tips. Now we're going to talk a little bit

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.150
about what we call hang glide. This move was
made famous by a lot of famous B-boys out

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.940
there. This is a pretty good move to learn.
Very style live, add a little bit of flavor

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.640
into your move. I'm going to show you what
a hang glide looks like first. Start off from

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:33.610
here. Looks something like this. Okay. That's
a hang glide. Now, depending on what type

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.430
of floor you're on, you can get more rotations.
This is a rough floor. On a wood floor or

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.321
linoleum, you probably can get 2 or 3 rotations
easier than that. And if it's a rough floor

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:49.960
you can use a glove or whatever floats your
boat to help you spin. Now I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.510
the move. The easiest method to get into it
that I find is right off of here. You can

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.030
get into it any way you want. Now from here,
I'm going off my right hand. So what I'm going

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.670
to do from here is I'm going to put my right
foot down and I'm going to put my heel down

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.990
on the floor. I'm going to go into it here
like I'm doing the freeze twist. Now from

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.430
here, once I put my left hand down, my right
hand's going to come in with the stab again.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.000
This time, once I come into the freeze, I'm
going to let my momentum take me so I turn

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.460
all the way around. The trick to this move
is when you put your wrist down, you don't

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.750
let your fingers stay on the ground. Your
fingers, when they're here, have to stay up

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.460
so that they allow you to spin. Similar to
this. You don't want to do this because it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:02:00.200
causes more friction. Let's try it slow. From
here we're going to go 1, 2, 3. The more you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.619
try, the more rotation you'll be able to go.
You want to place your legs as you're spinning

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.180
in a position that you can balance yourself
out, whether it be straight, side to side.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.129
Whatever works for you. Let's try it again.
This is what it's going to look like. I'm

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:22.870
going to do it full out. From here.
That's a hang glide.
