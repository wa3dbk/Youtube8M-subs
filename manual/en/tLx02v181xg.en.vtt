00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.419
My name's Michal Wesolowski, I'm from Poland,
I'm from the northern part of Poland and

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:14.419
I came to Bradford to Study here, Civil Engineering
and I went to Korea for a whole year, last

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:22.189
year I was in Korea for a whole year in Seoul.
I was studying mathematics and cultural studies.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.700
The winning picture that I have taken, it
was at the beginning of my studies in Korea

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.450
in the first semester, me and other exchange
students, we decided we are going to explore

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.350
one of the national parks in Seoul, in Korea
and whilst we were getting to the top and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.829
we reached the peak of the mountain and I
just stood there, and you could see the whole

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.809
city, and I just opened my arms, and that
was the moment that I actually fell in love

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.809
with Asia and Seoul, looking from the top
on that 20million metropolis was something

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.610
really, really amazing. First time when I
was in Korea, when I landed there it was really,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.610
really hot, I was very, very tired because
my plane was delayed by 7 hours I think and

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.900
we were supposed to arrive like, 3:00 and
we were after 10:00pm and I was wondering

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.880
if there was anyone to pick me up from the
airport because I had no idea where I'm

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.049
going to go, where I'm staying overnight,
so that was a bit hectic and I was just there

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.810
and I was waiting for someone to come and
pick me up and after a while because I had

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.170
the phone number to the Korean girl, she was
at the airport but she was at a different

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.830
gate and she was waiting for us, oh thanks
god, and we managed to go to the place, I

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.700
mean it was really, really dark, so I couldn't
see much of Seoul, the only thing I knew is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.119
big, really, really big city because it took
us more than 1 hour to get from the airport

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.470
to the place we were staying overnight. But
the next day when I woke up, I just saw the

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.439
place was huge and Seoul is more like kind
of a concrete jungle, not many trees, very,

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.570
very crowded, everywhere, so many cars. I
mean I really liked it at the beginning, it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.159
was nice. A typical day, I was living in a
dormitory and It was really funny because

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:18.790
the dormitory is split into 2 different departments,
one is for males and the other for females

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.790
and none of us were, kind of like, not able
to go to the female department otherwise we

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:34.669
would be expelled from the dormitory. So until
9:00 we had the breakfast and cafeteria which

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.419
was in the basement, so we would go in there
for breakfast, then I had some lectures. Lectures,

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:47.419
they started at the same time as it is here,
at 9:00am and not later than 6:00pm. So within

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.689
this time I was at the university studying
or I was having lunch with my friends and

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:01.480
later on, we could do anything we wanted,
so either partying somewhere else in Seoul

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.480
or experiencing the culture. I am always willing
to go a bit further so when I was in Poland

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.730
I was like, I'm going to go to England to
study, so I came here, and then when I was

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.059
in England I was like, I'd like to go somewhere
further, so I went to Korea, and that was

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:23.739
very, very spontaneous because I never actually
thought I'm going to go to Korea, I remember

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.969
that day, I went to my friend to visit one
of my friends and she was like, "I'm going

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.609
to go and do an Erasmus program in Spain"
and was like "are you going anywhere?".

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.879
So I'm like yeah I'm going to give it
a go, I might go somewhere but I'm not sure

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.879
where. So I emailed the university, asking,
are there any presentations about the countries

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.930
where we can actually go and she told me,
you can come tomorrow but it's going

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.930
to be about, anywhere outside Europe and she
gave me that idea to go to Korea. So this

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:06.639
is the photo. All the people on the photo
are my friends that I met in Korea on the

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.309
exchange program in Korea and we decided that
we are all going to meet in Hong Kong for

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:17.910
New Years Eve and that was on Victoria
Peak in Hong Kong. The city is really amazing,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.520
I loved it, Hong Kong is such a nice place.
The other photos, that was, at the end of

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.090
January, we travelled to Cambodia, to one
of the islands which I think is a must see

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.979
if you are in Cambodia. It is a Rabbit Island,
without Rabbits, and me and my friends we

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.520
decided that we are going to do some kind
of a tour and see the whole island. We didn't

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.080
have any maps, we just had like flip flops,
you can see we haven't even t-shirts, nothing.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.610
Just flip flops, cameras, that's it, no
water. The photo was done, I had a stopover

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.810
in Kuala Lumpur and that's the photo in
front of the Petronas towers. As a Civil Engineer

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.639
I was really impressed that you can see such
a thing and me and my friends we decided we

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.030
are going to do some kind of a really nice
photo, so he was lying on the floor and he

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.370
was taking a photo so at the same time, it
looked like I'm really, really high but

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.780
actually I was like a half metre. But on the
photo you can see it's like pretty tall.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.949
In February we went to Thailand. So if you
watched Hangover 2, you would probably recognise

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:34.860
the place. It's a really, really, nice place,
the water was amazing and the people and food.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.860
The other photo is from the Philippines, she
was called Samantha. During the Christmas

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:50.610
time which I spent with a Filipino Family.
They took me to one of the zoos and they were

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.960
like "oh! that's the snake, you can just
go inside, you can kiss her". Now I'm

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.599
kind of a spontaneous person, I don't really
plan much in advance, like Korea was like

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.379
just before the deadline and I was like yeah
I'm going to go to Korea for a whole year,

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.919
and my family was like "where are you going?"
to Asia "for a whole year?" and I was

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.050
like yeah why not? Asia is an amazing place
to be, I think as a Civil Engineer and that

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.860
people I have met, they are always suggesting
to me to go to Hong Kong or Singapore, to

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.860
get a career, so I'm considering Asia as
a place to be. I met people from all over

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.719
the world, I learnt a language, basics but
I did. I think it's one of the most amazing

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:42.719
things you can actually do in your life. If
you have the chance just do it.
