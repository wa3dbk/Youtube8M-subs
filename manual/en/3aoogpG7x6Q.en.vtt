00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.129
So at the Exertion Games Lab we research the intersection between technology,

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.059
the play and the body.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.890
Because we believe we sit way too much in our work lives,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.560
and we want to get people excited about
being physically active again.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.199
What we've been working on for the past couple of months is a helmet that

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.739
is able to show information to the outside world. We did that by turning it into

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.410
a kind of low resolution display

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.200
by covering it with LEDs and all of
these LEDs are multicolored and we

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.110
can control individually which means
that you can display patterns on it,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.900
numbers, colours

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.880
and what we've been thinking about is what
does it mean when your helmet becomes

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.930
interactive what does it mean when i can
show information about yourself.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.800
And we've been talking with different usergroups
that use helmets in their activities like

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.819
cycling or skateboarding or construction
workers and we asked them

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.549
"what would you do with a helmet
that has this kind of capability?" "How could it help you in your activities?"

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.289
One of the problems we've had for many years is that 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:13.700
drivers say:

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.880
"sorry mate i didn't see you", even though we're there in full view

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.750
everyone else saw us, but one particular
person didn't see us.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.400
So the bikes that are out there are visible but
they're not being recognised,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.420
and i think this project

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.110
is an interesting way of introducing
some kind of signalling behavior on the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.940
part of the cyclist

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.240
that might help to make us more recognisable.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.790
A helmet is a static object that is there
to protect us when we fall and for the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.000
rest of time it's just there, it's not doing anything.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.350
So we though, this is perfect. We have this object
that is clearly visible to everybody else and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.100
that we can use as a means of
communication

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.650
the research is important because we
believe in we make

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.100
wearing a helmet more engaging, more fun

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.619
we can actually not only facilitate more people to wear helmets,

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.610
which can increase safety

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.390
but also inspire us to think about
how technology can create new

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.780
opportunities for engagement and get really people to think about

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.230
how we can facilitate and inject play
back into physical activity to get

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.900
people excited about moving their bodies again.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.189
I think It's really interesting about

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.049
how does a cyclist

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.249
represent themselves and their
personality and who they are

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.900
to other bike riders. And i think
there's a lot of interest you know, in using

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.699
new technology that can help us identify
ourselves to others who might be

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.539
interested in something that we're interested in.
see

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:51.809
and I think a visual display, an LED system on a helmet....

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.179
I mean, how conspicuous is that?
