00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Hi, everybody! My name is Eugene,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and today we'll examine this Electro-Harmonix 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Crying Bass wah and fuzz pedal.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
This unusual wah pedal
has a durable metal body

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.700
and it has no moving parts.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
On the back side of the pedal
is a guitar input,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.000
volume, low pass filter
and fuzz controls

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
and a calibration button.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.500
The pedal is powered by a 9V battery
or adaptor with the same voltage.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, let's listen to the sound of it.
