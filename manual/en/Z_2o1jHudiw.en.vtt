00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.679
In my opinion, you have to go between two bits,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.617
right through the middle there.

00:00:56.763 --> 00:00:58.355
Maybe not.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:02.055
The net’s between the headland there.

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:33.945
There’s a long white thing

00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:35.595
in the middle of the keel,

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.245
I think it’s a bit of plastic.

00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:52.437
The light up ahead is Singapore

00:01:55.413 --> 00:01:57.741
and we’re approaching the exit from the channel.

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:00.705
We’ve got a good 30 or so miles to go.

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:07.925
There’s a mark flashing red to starboard.

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:09.425
Is it okay?
