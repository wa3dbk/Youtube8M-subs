00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.420
Matt Lauer: We're back now at 11 minutes after
eight o'clock and this morning on Today's

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.410
Health "The Dangers of Gymnastics" - the graceful
sport that demands discipline and strength

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.480
attracts a lot of the young kids with dreams
of Olympic glory.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.740
But while most of them don't make it that
far, a new study suggests that too many end

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.710
up in the hospital instead.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.150
Here's NBC's Kevin Tibbles.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:32.180
Kevin Tibbles: Like many young athletes, 15-year-old
Lauren Bledsoe thrives on competition.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.070
She's been training since she was barely able
to walk.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.750
But within months after winning top honors
at the Missouri State Championship last year...

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.750
Lauren Bledshaw: Can you walk sideways for
me, baby?

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.750
Kevin Tibbles: Lauren's Olympic dreams were
dashed.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.350
Doctors told her to stop competing or face
injury.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.190
Lauren Bledshaw: They found out I had three
bulging disks and a herniated disk that was

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.440
pinching my nerve in my back.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.670
Kevin Tibbles: Many parents may not look at
gymnastics in the same way they do football,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.330
hockey and other contact sports, but medical
experts cautioned gymnastics injuries can

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.420
be just as serious.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.080
Dr. Dee Hodge: You can fall off the equipment
and you can take a tumble and injure your

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080
neck.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.410
And so there are injuries associated.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.670
Kevin Tibbles: A recent study by the Nationwide
Children's Hospital in Ohio found up to 27,000

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.340
gymnasts end up in the emergency room every
year.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.330
Many of them were strains and sprains to the
arms and shoulders.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.820
According to the study, gymnastic injuries
like the one caught on camera in this video

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.800
provided by the hospital, could be reduced
with good coaching [Shrieks] and proper equipment.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.420
Dr. Dee Hodge: This is probably just the tip
of the iceberg.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.250
We need to speak with particularly in the
younger girls about trying this stuff at home

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.280
away from practices in the backyard.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.130
Kevin Tibbles: At the All American Gymnastics
Center in Saint Louis "Safety Comes First".

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.600
Budding gymnasts use what's called the "pit"
filled with blocks of soft foam to practice

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.790
flips and flops.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.450
Sue Renshaw: It's like jumping into a swimming
pool.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.130
It's a safety situation for them.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.729
It's a softer landing.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.729
There's room for error.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.039
Lauren: OK, let's see you walk.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.400
Kevin Tibbles: Though she no longer has a
"gold medal" goal herself, Lauren is keeping

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.239
a watchful eye on the next generation.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.060
For "Today" Kevin Tibbles, NBC News, Chicago.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.310
Matt Lauer: Dr. Nancy Snyderman is NBC's chief
medical editor.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.310
Hey, Nancy, good morning.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.310
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: Hey, Matt.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.340
Matt Lauer: This is scary stuff.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.010
What kinds of injuries are doctors seeing
in these emergency rooms?

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.890
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: Most of the injuries
of those 27,000 are girls.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.930
82% percent of them are girls and most of
them upper body injuries, and there a lot

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.970
of those fractured arms.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.950
Matt Lauer: And yet, if you listen to this
information and you hear the statistics, you'd

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.950
say, "OK.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.140
There must be some very strict rules and guidelines
for people operating gymnastic center for

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.910
the people spotting these young athletes."

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.099
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: Therein lies the rub.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.040
There are really strict rules for the competitions
but they are not uniform; they aren't enforced

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.590
so your school, my school may be different
and all these little gymnastic centers around

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.459
the country there really are no formal regulations.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.661
So the injuries that are being reported to
these cherry-picked 100 hospitals, they're

00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:14.750
coming not from competition but from the schools
and recreation centers.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.610
Matt Lauer: Let me go back to what you just
said, 82% of all these injuries...

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.610
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: Are girls.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.610
Matt Lauer: Girls.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.920
Why such a large majority, girls over boys?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.910
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: Girls are of more in
the sport, but on top of that, more vitamin

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.920
D deficiencies in girls are bone masses not
as great as boys and unfortunately, in this

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.410
patient population of gymnastics, we see a
lot of eating disorders and that makes bones

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.410
brittle, too.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.340
Matt Lauer: We don't want to have parents
out there telling their little girls and little

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.340
boys, "Forget it.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.340
You can't go into gymnastics."

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.980
But let's give them some information they
can use before they actually let their kids

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.980
take the first step.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.440
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: You need to see the pediatrician
first and I know this sounds like one of those

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.209
garden cop out answers but you have to make
sure your child doesn't have any other injuries.

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.790
And I think a psychiatric and intellectual
profile is as important because your child

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.050
has already an eating disorder or wants to
be Mary Little Riding or has really misguided

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.370
views about what he or she may accomplish.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.310
This may be a child that is so driven that
she may, in fact, go through that pain and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.980
that "no pain no gain" stuff kids should be
warned about.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.490
Matt Lauer: "Make sure your kids wear all
the required safety gear" and this is...

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.490
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: Yup.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.490
And that could be just wrist guards.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.490
Matt Lauer: Right exactly.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.849
And this next thing as what you just said
"Make sure your kids are not the kind of kids

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.629
who are going play through pain."

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:24.629
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: That's right.

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.249
If it hurts, you tell the coach and you stop
and that really means also parents have to

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:29.719
be a part of this.

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:36.180
Matt Lauer: You should encourage your children
to express their fear or anxiety over some

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.310
difficult moves.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.400
Now if you're trying to make the team, if
you want to go that next step, that's going

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.439
to be something a lot of kids are going to
have a hard time with.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.680
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: I would suspect if you
talk to the Olympic athletes, they will tell

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.069
you that at point or another, they've been
scared and I would bet most kids are driven

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.150
enough to excel like that won't say "I'm scared."

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.080
A little trepidation with the right coach
perhaps, but you can't just turn your kids

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.499
over to the occasional coach and say it's
going to be OK.

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:07.099
Go to those centers, drop in on the training
sessions and make sure you have a coach who

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.690
frankly is going to be nice to your child
and encouraging and not going to push your

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.690
kid too hard.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.690
Matt Lauer: Push him too hard.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.690
All right, Nancy, good information.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.690
Thanks very much.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.690
Dr. Nancy Snyderman: Yeah.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.690
Thanks, Matt.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.695
Matt Lauer: Thanks very much.
