00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
In this week's video, we're gonna give you a few tips on how to follow up on your job application over the phone.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.080
That's coming up!

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.620
Hey guys, I'm Kim with Snagajob, your number one source for hourly jobs

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.740
and welcome to our weekly job search advice show.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.820
So I know I tell you this all the time but I really can't tell you this enough.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Following up on your job applications is so so so important.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.180
It shows the employer that you're very determined and passionate about the job

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.620
and let's them know that you'll stand out as a great employee.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.720
One quick and easy way to follow up is over the phone.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.620
It sounds really simple, but there are a few tips you definitely want to keep in mind.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.180
First, rehearse out loud.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.000
It sounds kind of silly but you really want to go over what you're gonna say before you call.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.260
This way you can make sure you're not stumbling over your words

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.840
or even worse hanging up as soon as they answer.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.140
Um, I just wanted to give you a call back to say how much I appreciated

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.360
you taking the time out of your day to talk to me.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.060
And if you're worried about what you're gonna say, make a list of your main points

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.840
so you'll make sure not to leave anything out.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.660
And here's an extra tip. If you're using your cell phone, make sure you're in an area with good coverage.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.400
It might be kind of awkward to call back after a dropped call.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.560
Second, call during non-peak business hours.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.020
Non-peak hours are between 2 and 4 between during the week in restaurants

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.360
and for retail, it would be before 4.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.620
Also, don't call them on a holiday.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.980
That will be sure to annoy them.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.360
Third, ask for the hiring manager.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.800
You want to make sure that you're talking to the people that actually make the decisions.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.560
So if you call and the manager is not around, ask when they'll be back and follow up again at that time.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.760
Do you know when she'll be available?

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.720
Ok. And what's a good time to call back?

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.020
Fourth, check your voicemail greeting.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.280
You may be thinking, why would that even matter?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.040
But it really is important. I mean, think about it.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.520
The hiring manager calls you back and your voicemail is unprofessional and sounds like:

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.500
Hey, this is Emma. If you know me, leave a message.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.640
If you don't, don't call me. I'm on the do not call list.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.460
It would really stink for the employer to call you back and your voicemail is unprofessional

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.240
and that takes you out of consideration.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.300
Fifth, be enthusiastic.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.660
This is your opportunity to really let your personality  shine through and show them

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.280
that you would be great with customers.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.920
Also, make sure to mention that you'd be delighted to come in for an interview and leave the ball in their court.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.500
Now, remember. If a job posting asks you not to follow up,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.400
then you definitely shouldn't. You want to show them that you can follow directions.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.100
But if there's nothing in the posting about it, then you should consider it a required part of applying to the job.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.740
