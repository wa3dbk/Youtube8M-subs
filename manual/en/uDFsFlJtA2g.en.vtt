[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.470
Hi, I'm Caroline.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.765
And now, I want to show you how to
introduce color into your makeup.

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:26.890
Introducing color into your makeup can
sometimes be a little bit difficult.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.889
You might find that it's
a little bit too strong

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:30.977
or it takes over your face
a little bit too much.

00:00:30.977 --> 00:00:33.060
But introducing any kind
of color into your makeup

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.090
brightens up or modernizes your face.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.450
And also, when you kind
of get to spring/summer,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.720
it's kind of quite seasonal and it
feels quite refreshing to have color.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.720
But this is why I want to use
Masterpiece Color Precision Eyeshadow.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.430
Because wearing color is much easier
when you're using a cream eyeshadow.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.820
It gives it a much more
softer, more feminine approach.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.010
And because it's got lovely gold
speckles in it, it's very, very sheer

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.270
and reflects the light.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.190
So I'm going to apply a
block color on Simone.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.200
Very, very simple, not just
applying it just to the socket,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.936
gonna take it right up to the
eyebrow and further it out.

00:01:02.936 --> 00:01:04.200
Again, very simple.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.580
Just use the applicator.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.400
Start on the inner corner of the eye.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.890
Sweep along a fan-like shape
effect all the way along the lid,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.430
back again over the socket
and all the way up to the top.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.180
Take a straight line
from the inner corner

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.869
of your eye right at the start
of your brow and sweep out.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.222
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.216
And again, just pat those
edges with your finger.

00:01:34.216 --> 00:01:36.200
And that's basically it.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.670
Simone, just open your eye for me.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.611
It's a really lovely, simple way
of adding color to your makeup

00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:42.860
and that looks really cool,
but it's really refreshing

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.151
and it still looks very modern.

00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:46.490
I think it looks beautiful.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.114
I'm going to finish off with a bit of
Max Factor Masterpiece Max Mascara.

00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:52.280
And I'm going to use it on
the top and bottom lashes

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.600
just so you get the balance because
the color is quite strong all the way

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.870
to the top of the eyelashes.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.820
From the eyelashes--
all the color is really

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.720
strong from the eyelashes
to the eyebrows,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.410
you want to make sure there's
always balance in your eye.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.710
So keep it pretty and
feminine by adding mascara

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.847
to the top and bottom of your lashes.

00:02:06.847 --> 00:02:07.930
So look up for me, Simone.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.930
That's it.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.046
Just very lightly, one coat.

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:17.914
Just use the latex brush just to groom
all the lashes so they sit beautifully.

00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:20.080
And the wonderful thing
about these cream eyeshadows

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.000
is they're completely smudge proof.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.970
So once they've dried,
they just sit still.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.790
They don't move.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.540
They don't crease.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.939
They don't wear off.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.730
So it gives you great confidence
whilst wearing your makeup all day

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.070
that you can strike a look like this and
you know that it's not going to move.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.570
Fantastic.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.920
