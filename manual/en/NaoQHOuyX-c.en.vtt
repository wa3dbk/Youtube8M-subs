00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.410
So in this clip, we're going to learn how
to safely and securely attach our boat to

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.790
our car so we can drive safely on the highway.
To do the bow line, the bow strap, I step

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:25.740
up here and give my kayak a big hug like so.
The key of course, is to get that buckle up

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:39.160
on the boat, slip the strap underneath and
gently pull it down so the boat is secure.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.351
Not too much pressure because you can crack
your boat. Put a little security knot in there

00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:51.530
and you're set to go. This is a locking strap
so I can turn my key, lock it, go have lunch

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.160
and not worry about my kayak missing when
I come back. This is great just for everyday

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.330
paddling around locally, driving short distances.
But if you're going to go on the highway for

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.400
long distances and high speeds or even over
a bridge, you'll want to put a bow line on

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.300
here. A bow line helps counteract the lift
that's generating when you're driving at high

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:26.950
speeds. I've attached my bow line underneath
a utility hook underneath this truck and then

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:43.460
I'm going to attach it to the bow toggle up
here like so. And then I do what we call a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:53.030
Turkish hitch. It?s just a loop, a couple
of twists, grab this end and pull. I take

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.720
this loose end here and put it through here.
Now what you want is you don't want a tight

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.990
line here, it?s fairly loose. All its doing
is just keeping the boat from being lifted

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:14.790
up. So just give it a pinch and you just do
some half inches through here. See that? Just

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.120
a series of them. I don't want to do a million
of them so I just drop down here and do one

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:30.010
here on the bottom as well and you are set
to go. There, now you're ready for a long

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.239
trip.
