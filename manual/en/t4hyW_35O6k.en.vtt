What's going on? Little dap. It's Jared
Montz former pro and founder of OnlineSoccerAcademy.com.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.870
Today we are learning how to defend in soccer.
Specifically how to defend against fast attackers.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.399
We are indoors today. Our location is Pelican
Athletic Club in Mandeville, Louisiana.

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:20.719
Soccer defense will not be an easy to practice
defending soccer by yourself but you can do

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:26.139
it. It will be more of a mental exercise with
in a physical exercise.

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:30.829
If you are not as fast as the attackers you
are playing against, then you need to be faster

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.380
mentally to get the edge on them. First we
will set up the exercise and then I will give

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.220
you a few tips on how to be faster mentally
and read the game quicker then your opponent.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.750
Soccer Exercise Player Can Do:
Stand in one area, that will be your start

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.180
cone. Imagine you are standing next to an
attacker you are defending. Then pretend there

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.180
is a midfielder about 30 yards ahead of you.
They are going to play a ball over the top

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.469
into space for their attacker to run onto.
That midfielder thinks their attacker is faster

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:12.149
then you and they will beat you for speed.
We need to stop that from happening. The exercise

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.369
is, you stand there, on your toes, then as
the imaginary attacker is about to pass it,

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.799
you take off running into space. Run about
20 yards, then come back and repeat. Do this

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.789
10 times.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.949
Key Points:
Key Point 1.

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:51.729
Stand goal side of your defender. Make sure
you are between the defender and the goal.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.219
Key Point 2.
Don't get right on his back. Stand an arms

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.280
length away with your arm out making contact
on the defender. If you are to tight on him,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.280
he will turn you and use his body to spin
you.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.760
Key Point 3.
When you see that midfielder put their head

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.880
down to pass the ball over the top you start
running in the direction it's going. Get

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.020
a 1-2 second head start on the forward turning
and running. Don't wait for the ball to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.960
be kicked and then run. That's when the
attacker will be running. You need to start

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.389
before she does.

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:41.389
Key Point 4.
When you turn and run to chase the ball down,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.410
push off your attacker. Don't foul them,
but give them a little push. That pushes them

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.440
backward and you forward. Don't push them
like you are trying to start a fight, but

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.440
a little push off that is disguised in your
running technique when you take off.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.330
What Football Player Could Be Doing Wrong:
If in a game an attacker is constantly turning

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.499
you and beating you to the ball then you are
to tight on them. Don't be right up her

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:35.930
back. Give her an arms length distance so
that attacker feels pressure but it gives

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.149
you a few steps head start.

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:43.369
Also don't be scared to be physical and
give a little push off as you take off running.

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:47.499
Bonus Tip!
Yes, you can improve running speed but at

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:53.100
some point you are not going to be able to
go faster. Where you can go faster and constantly

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.930
be improving your speed is in your mind! Think
fast in your mind and that will increase the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.669
chance of you successfully defending against
fast attackers.
