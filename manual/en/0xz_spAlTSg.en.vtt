well they're about marquis

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.960
delhi chief minister feel a bit

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.810
captivated and i know that i say it's not
known about him for a while and interested

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.960
uh... adopting laughing at us and stuff

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.450
while about was that

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.630
and epic failure i can't believe that he kept
going on even though there were two other

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.490
people in that newscast that were not laughing
that obviously felt uncomfortable and wanted

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.580
him to stop as soon as possible but he was
legal at the end zone jokes it's like a really

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.770
really bad comedian who doesn't get that he's
not funny any continues lacking in his own

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.259
jokes it was terrible that was such a bad
the situation

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.909
uh... he's children props first of all

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.340
the guys that child doesn't prevent didn't
get the paper

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.759
dictator jet

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.819
does not really

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.839
bring it on recent demand

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:39.979
argue but that's not a final passages is good
that sounds like you're when i get it that's

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:41.159
what it looks like

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.209
repair big and to return to

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.559
the part that i think this is a bigger trouble
is when he says so probably which is ended

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:53.369
housing way i don't get that what was that
appropriate

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:57.969
no no exactly and thats the reason why he
got fired right after that broadcast there

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.180
were several groups protesting

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.329
and uh... i sharing their thoughts on that
broadcast in how they thought that it was

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.529
inappropriate

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:10.289
and um... it turns out that he decided you
know what i've made a huge mistake lack of

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.749
judgement i'm definitely gonna resign from
my job in fact he issued a statement he said

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:20.009
that he is no longer practical in the current
environment for me to do the job i was employed

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.539
to do it is also difficult for television
new zealand to get on with the business of

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:29.459
being a first-class broadcaster as long as
i would main on the staff

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.369
so he realizes his mistake and he resigned
immediately

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:38.700
for nearly and i'd like to apologize to boost

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.769
ho

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.769
dr

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.349
do you know what appear look any in his defense
just a tiny tiny dis defense

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.139
pretty really does look like it's

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.009
it's pronounced diction

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:55.659
could spell d_r_i_ k as they try t but after
mispronouncing it wants

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.079
and then getting corrected

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.839
move on with your life don't continue insulting
this one in the name and insulting indian

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:04.949
it's ridiculous so

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.159
uh... dot i mean you know what when i when
i read the story i really like stand back

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.549
and thought about it because

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.849
there's that political correctness in the
united states and was so quick to judge others

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.449
and maybe there's are more

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.519
lax atmosphere in new zealand but as you mentioned
as soon as he said

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.250
so it's all properly because she's in did
not die

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.869
that's not okay that's not that i appropriate
statement to make on a live broadcast

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:29.919
or any broadcast at all
