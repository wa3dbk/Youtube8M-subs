00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
"Which Brand of Tuna
has the Most Mercury?"

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.900
Are some brands of tuna
worse than others?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.460
An evaluation of mercury concentrations
in three national brands of canned tuna

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.340
was undertaken recently.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.260
In total, they found that "55% of all
tuna examined was above the U.S.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.580
Environmental Protection Agency’s
safety level for human consumption."

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.720
Mercury is not just
a problem for children.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.260
As I’ve noted in videos over the years,
the "Health effects resulting from

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.020
consumption of methylmercury for adults
are considerable and may include central

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.000
nervous system damage, ataxia,
paresthesia, hearing loss,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.340
diminishing vision, loss of sensation
to extremities, and loss of

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.820
consciousness leading to death.”

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.320
"Due to the increased susceptibility of
the developing nervous system," though,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.740
"damages are more pronounced in fetuses,
infants, and children and may include

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.740
microcephaly [which is a shrunken brain],
delayed development, impaired cognition,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.580
and gross neurological disorders."

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.260
Given the average level of mercury
pollution found in canned tuna, they

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.100
suggest that your average nine-year-old
would exceed the EPA limit eating any

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.200
more than a can of tuna every 43 days.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.920
This is not the first study
of canned tuna.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.300
Previous studies going back nearly
20 years found levels of mercury that

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.440
were bad — but not as bad as
the ones found now.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.980
The problem of mercury in tuna appears
to be getting worse and worse.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.180
But which brand was the worst?

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.040
National brand number three contained
significantly more mercury than

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.080
the other two, but they failed to
disclose which brand was which.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.800
They wouldn’t say.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.900
All they said was that these results
indicate that "stricter regulation of…

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.680
the canned tuna industry is necessary"
to ensure the safety of sensitive

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.300
populations such as pregnant
women, infants, and children.
