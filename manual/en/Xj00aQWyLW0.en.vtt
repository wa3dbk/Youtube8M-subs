00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.750
So, to do your Cat Eyes we're going to start
with our isolation.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.750
One handed.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.270
The hoop's in front of you about top of your
head height and belly button.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.880
I'm leading with my pinky finger to do my
one handed isolation.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.800
And my hoop is rotating counter-clockwise.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.310
So, to start the Cat Eye.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:38.190
It looks like this.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.230
And what the illusion is is that the hoop
is dropping down and then coming straight

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.230
up.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.100
Without moving out of this plane or going
side to side.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.500
We want the hoop to make a vertical column,
so to speak.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.489
So, we start in this position with the hand
at six o'clock.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.530
You're going to move your hand slightly to
your right to allow the hoop to drop down

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500
on the back of your hand.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
So, I'm here.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.150
My hand moves slightly.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.070
And then, I allow it to rest on the back of
my hand here.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.170
As the hoop rolls across my hand, I'm going
to grab again on my left side to bring it

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.720
back in front of me.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, this is the tricky part.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.950
From this position my hand is going to go
straight up.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.200
So, I start here and move to my right.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.850
Allow the hoop to drop.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.900
Grab.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.560
Bring it straight up.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.780
So, the path of my hand goes left, down, up,
straight over my head.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.710
So, I'm basically making a big arch there.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.490
Going to make, the entire step involves making
a box with your hand.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.490
Okay.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.750
So, I'm here.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.270
Move to the right.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.270
Allow the hoop to drop.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.270
Grab.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.020
Bring it straight up overhead.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.989
And then I've got the hoop straight above
me.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.170
My hand is at 12 o'clock.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.930
As I continue the hoop rotation over I'm going
to move back out to the left to allow the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.730
hoop to come back into that center position.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.700
Now, ideally, my hand would end here so that
I could just continue to do it again over

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.819
and over.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.430
With practice that will happen.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.239
But, I like to add in just a little center
isolation to give myself some time to prepare

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.120
for the next Cat Eye.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.040
So, isolation.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.180
Move your hand to the right.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.180
Drop.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.180
Grab.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.480
Bring it straight up and back to center.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.200
One isolation to finish.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.730
A little faster.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.450
Goes like this.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.850
And that's how you do a Cat Eye.
