00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.910
Today I'm really excited to be chatting with Stella Price,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.299
who has just moved to Sutton Group - West Coast Realty

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.089
with her entire team.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.499
Stella has been in the business for 12 years

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:19.580
and has had an extremely successful career path

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.529
being a top producer

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.679
from when she first started.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.499
Stella, I'm so thrilled to be chatting with you today. 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.769
Welcome to Sutton Group - West Coast Realty.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.640
Thank you, on behalf of my team and myself, we are very excited to make this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.930
move.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.710
Tell us a little bit about the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.460
key to your success

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.500
I think the key of our success is

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
my team and I work well together

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.040
and we converse in 7 different languages

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.050
and we work 24/7

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.520
and I think service is a huge part

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.700
of our success.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.210
My team is super important

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.550
to me because I gotta give myself enough time to deal with the client

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.440
on a one on one basis.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.890
When you deal with so much volume that we do,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.970
I can't be everywhere - it's impossible.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.110
We need the extension

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.320
and these guys are superb in what they do.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.730
Stella, with 19 managing brokers within our group to

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.960
to support our agents, what does that mean for yourself and your team?

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.820
It would really benefit a lot for our clients

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.310
and as well for our team

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.860
and that is

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.920
unbelievable

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.110
I don't think any other

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.280
brokerage can offer that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.910
To this point, what has been missing

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.290
in your business model, if anything?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.560
I think it's location.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.720
I need the multi location throughout the lower mainland and that's important to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.549
me

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.200
and also having the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.320
the biggest brokerage

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.960
in Canada is also very important to me as well

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.470
So why Sutton Group - West Coast Realty and why now?

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.590
I think it's the resources that you have

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.289
and with my team working with the Sutton West Coast team,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.589
we're all working together as one,

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.480
it frees up a lot of my time

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.909
to deal with

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.519
on a 1on1 basis

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.049
and with the offices throughout the lower mainland,

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.400
that's also going to help

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.899
because we work not just in Coquitlam, 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.149
we're everywhere throughout the lower mainland

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:32.599
and as well if I'm traveling in the Victoria for example

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.319
and we're dealing with a client, I can just hop into that office

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.729
and feel like I'm home again, throughout the whole office.

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.250
this is a big move for me

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.499
and I'm really confident, I'm truly excited,

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.729
I feel like I've found a home

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:48.969
now, with Sutton West Coast Realty.
