00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:04.409
(classical music)

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.920
- I'm Cristen, and this is Brain Stuff.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.636
And there are plenty of
things I'd like to erase.

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:13.587
The box of pizza rolls I ate yesterday,

00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:15.445
ever watching Sex in the City part two,

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:18.023
and every single Willy Wonka meme.

00:00:18.023 --> 00:00:19.602
Just make them stop.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.898
Unfortunately, a lot of marks
in this world are permanent,

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:25.615
but not so with pencil marks.

00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:28.448
Yes, the humble pencil, or not so humble,

00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:29.933
as the case may be.

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.094
Pencil lead isn't actually lead at all,

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:35.623
so no, you can't get lead
poisoning from a pencil wound.

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:36.807
It's made from graphite,

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:38.711
which is a soft mineral made up of flaky,

00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:41.474
atom-thin layers of crystal and carbon.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.074
Ever since the 1790s that
graphite has been mixed

00:00:44.074 --> 00:00:47.534
with clay to achieve different
pencil lead hardnesses.

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:50.994
As you write or draw flakes
of this clay and graphite mix

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:54.036
cling to the fibers that
make up your piece of paper.

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:56.150
The fibers have a huge surface area

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.077
that catches lots of flakes,

00:00:58.077 --> 00:01:00.886
and the flakes will gladly
stick around for decades

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:02.233
if they're not disturbed.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:05.506
But erasers can lift those
flakes right off the page

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:08.851
by virtue of being stickier
than the paper fibers.

00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.476
It's as simple as that.

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:12.449
Since the flakes are just
hanging onto the paper,

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:14.958
not unlike thousands of
tiny clay and graphite

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.441
kittens just hangin' in there,

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:20.182
anything stickier than
paper can lift them off.

00:01:20.182 --> 00:01:23.316
In fact, the earliest erasers
going back to at least

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:25.871
the 1500s were just bread,

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:29.260
slightly moistened and
balled up pieces of bread.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.374
By the 1800s people were using erasers

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:33.139
made from natural rubber,

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.275
which is harvested in the form of latex

00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:38.502
from certain trees which
excrete it to discourage

00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:40.570
plant-eating insects.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.659
The name rubber actually comes from one

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.144
chemist's observations circa 1770

00:01:45.144 --> 00:01:47.743
that this tree latex stuff
is great when you use

00:01:47.743 --> 00:01:50.118
to rub out pencil marks.

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:50.770
Get it?

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.233
Rub out? Rubber?

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:53.209
Huh?

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.415
But because natural latex
rubber can be expensive

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.248
and some people are allergic to it,

00:01:57.248 --> 00:01:58.549
(coughs) condoms,

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.686
modern erasers are almost always made

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:03.054
from synthetic petroleum-based rubber

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:05.260
like polyvinyl chloride.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.976
Your standard pink eraser
has bits of pumice added

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:09.532
to make it more abrasive,

00:02:09.532 --> 00:02:11.389
which is a cheap way to help dislodge

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.339
flakes of graphite from
those paper fibers.

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.334
And magic erasers work
on a similar principle.

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:18.634
Magic.

00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:21.096
No, instead of being literally sticky,

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:24.183
they contain rigid micro
structures that trap dirt.

00:02:24.183 --> 00:02:25.553
But if you're ever without one,

00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:27.876
give your standard pink eraser a try.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:31.336
They're effective on way
more than just pencil marks.

00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:32.799
So hey, I want to know.

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.307
What would you erase
if you had the chance?

00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:37.070
Tell me in the comments

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.533
