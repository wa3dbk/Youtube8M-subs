00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:01.475
FELICIA DAY: It's
really tight.

00:00:01.475 --> 00:00:02.190
Why is it so tight?

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.062
-That's the point
of a wetsuit.

00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:04.800
FELICIA DAY: God,
this is awful.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey, everybody.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.050
I'm at the beach.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.615
I'm going to do some
beach stuff.

00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:08.551
Love it.

00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:10.475
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.070
FELICIA DAY: There could be
a needle in the sand.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.702
Here we go.

00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:22.430
Here we go.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.680
OK, no.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.160
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.615
OK guys, I can't do this.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:33.100
I'm sorry.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.070
I love you but no.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.010
No, no, no.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.520
Hey guys, guess what?

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.190
I've got something to tell
you about the Flog.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.650
It is not going to come back on
a regular basis this year.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.000
Wait, before you start weeping
and yelling at me and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.460
commenting and whatever,
just hear me out.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.286
I had an amazing year doing
50 things that made me

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:51.430
uncomfortable.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.180
I can't even swim.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.110
What am I doing here?

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.950
And it was awesome.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.540
And you guys supported me
all the way through.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.990
So thank you so much.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.710
But this next season I decided
to do something different.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.200
So that's why I've decided to
take the Flog and make it

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.420
intermittent, like when I'm
going to a convention.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.230
And my brother will be coming
back to more co-op gaming

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.900
later this year.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.365
Reasons are, I want to have the
flexibility to be able to

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:15.610
do other things on
the channel.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.980
Like on Monday a new show
premieres called "Felica's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.810
Ark." If there was a huge
flood that was going to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.420
annihilate every creature in
the video game world, which

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.180
one should be saved to
repopulate the earth?

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.700
If you think too hard about
it, you're going to ruin

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.390
everything.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.500
All those different ideas I want
to do, but I just don't

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.175
have the time to do, that's
why I'm trying

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:32.790
to free up my schedule.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.480
And write, and act more
on the channel.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.150
So anyway, I don't want
you guys to be upset.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.440
Because I'm going to be on the
channel probably more, just in

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.500
different ways.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.780
And I really appreciate your
going along on the ride with

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.850
me, and not making me
get in the water.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.880
Thanks you guys for watching.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.840
I'm really excited to show you
new things this coming year.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.873
And just stay tuned.

00:01:49.873 --> 00:01:50.660
I'm out of here.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.810
I'm just going to--

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.750
god it's so hot.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.170
I'm sweating.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.635
I'm sweating.

00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:57.422
I've got boob sweat right now.

00:01:57.422 --> 00:01:58.326
Bye.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:01:59.682
Oh god, it's sweat.

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:01.040
It's disgusting.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.770
Why, why are all these
things around here?
