Hi! I'm Karen for Expert Village. So the foot
is down and we have a wide zigzag and you

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:17.670
just want to make sure that your rip is as
close together as possible. The needle will

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:26.460
zigzag over each side of the rip. The needle
will be zigzagging on each side of the rip

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:36.359
and just go down and paper helps to. Okay
when you get to the bottom there and to the

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:49.100
L shaped rip, we are going to have to lift
the foot and reposition the rip so that the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.639
other part of the L shaped rip is in place
and then you could hold the fabric tight to

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:03.110
help keep that rip together while you are
sewing. You can hold that tight right there

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:16.200
down at the middle and again, very fast and
close zigzag stitch. Okay you can finish it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.880
off by changing your stitch width to 0 and
just running the machine for a minute to knot

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:33.270
the end and there is our repair. It is a nice
wide and flat satin stitch; very closed stitched

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:42.340
zigzag. You'll just trim off your threads
like this and then in the back you will also

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.729
trim off your threads and you remove the paper.
The paper should come right off. The paper

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.030
helps to keep the stitches very flat. If you
didn't have the paper, the stitches would

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.600
want to pull together a little bit and you
would have a little bit of buckling so the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.960
paper keeps it nice and flat. The extra fabric
gives it strength. So we will just trim away

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:18.910
some of the extra fabric, like that and that's
our repair.
