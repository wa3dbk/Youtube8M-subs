Hello, welcome to 1000Bulbs.com.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.400
Today, we're going to do an overview of the
Sun System Yield Master Two.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.930
We're going to open the box up for you so
you can see how it's packaged and we're going

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.119
to go over some of the specs.

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.770
As you can see, it is very well packaged with
double-walled cardboard and inserts to keep

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.180
it safe during shipping.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:34.340
It has a 15-foot cord, and as you can see,
this is not a standard cord.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.429
This plugs into the ballast that is designed
for use with this fixture.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:40.949
It will not plug into a regular wall socket.

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.070
The ballast and the bulb for this fixture
sold separately.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.579
This fixture is fully pre-assembled, except
for the mounting brackets, which I'll show

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.609
you how to put on.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:01:05.000
This fixture is very light, only 15 pounds;
actually only 14 pounds.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.070
This has 6-inch duct flanges for exhaust with
an easy breeze ducting for maximum cooling.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.260
It has tempered glass and a heavy-duty airduct
with an air-tight gasket.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.820
And it has wing nuts for easy access to the
bulb.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.630
This fixture comes with heavy-duty hangers,
which are very easy to assemble.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.590
They simply clip right on to the outside,
just like that.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.360
This fixture comes with a durable, white powder
coated finish, German aluminum reflector,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.630
and a mogul socket for up to a 1000-watt metal
halide or high pressure sodium bulb.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.870
The bulb and the ballast for this fixture
are sold separately.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.670
This also comes with a 5-year warranty.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.820
And that does it for our overview of the Sun
System Yield Master Two.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.830
Thank you very much for watching.
