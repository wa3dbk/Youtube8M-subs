00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.750
Smile! You are now in the Samoyed Zone.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.130
This dog is from the Spitz family, and takes
its name from a Nomadic reindeer herder tribe

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.570
from Siberia. I am not making this up. They
were bred to pull sleds through snow and carry

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.519
packs for their owners, and they are loyal
companion dogs.

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.640
With snow-white fur and a cheeky smile, these
guys definitely stand out in a crowd. They

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.439
have distinctive long, curled tails and thick,
triangular ears.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.000
In colder months, their fur is extra thick
and dense, so patting a Samoyed is like a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.920
close encounter with a big friendly bear,
or a cumulus cloud.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.360
Beware, these guys shed so much they have actually knitted clothing out of their fur.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.969
Start your vacuum engines!

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.459
This special breed suits dedicated dog owners
who can devote plenty of time and energy to

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:18.550
their fuzzy friend. A loyal family dog, the
Sammy loves to be part of a gang, and is definitely

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.430
happiest hanging out with its pack.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.520
They’re also not made for
the heat, but that shouldn’t shock you.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.080
They’re very independent dogs, which can
make them tricky to train, so don’t expect

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.660
Sammy to fetch your pipe and slippers.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.940
Samoyed puppies are really, really ugly. Just
kidding, they’re pretty much the cutest

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.360
thing on four legs, in fact they make other
so-called cute things look boring.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.970
But the Samoyed is full of surprises. Its
wispy white fur is actually hypoallergenic,

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.840
so sneezy people can snuggle up safely.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.000
Smiling Samoyeds are a sweet sidekick, and
an outstanding choice for fluff-lovers.
