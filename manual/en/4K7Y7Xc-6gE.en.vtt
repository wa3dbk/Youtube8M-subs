00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Sunlight, I wake up from a dream; the light of the morning

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.500
shines again (all over my sight)

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
on this world.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.000
It was only me who kept that interrupted promise of ours.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.500
This yesterday behind my eyes (it's over my blind)

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
is all that I chased.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.000
Stay high, I had forgotten about the clearness of this blue sky.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Surely, because of you I got to know my brilliant true feelings.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Even if someday the strength with which you're holding my hand becomes painful, I definitely won't let it go.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We will be dear friends to each other forever and ever.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Stray days, we did look up at the same moon so many times.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.500
The same good-bye (We told you so long) 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.000
is what we overcame

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I should have known that because of someone important to us we could experience the pain. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But the light of your lost life (You told me what's wrong) is all we counted.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.500
Stay high, if you look through the window, there's a dazzling blue sky 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.000
Surely the door to tomorrow (still green) is opened to us.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Even if someday the passage of time changes everything

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I definitely won't lose you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'll lead the brand new days

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.500
Sunlight, I wake up from a dream; the light of the morning

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.000
then shines out (it's all up to you) 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.700
on this world

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
There are days when I tire of calling out the meaning of my life, and my head droops 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But still, in my heart (So look up to you) 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
is your smile.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.000
Stay high, I had forgotten about the clearness of this blue sky.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.500
Surely, because of you I got to know my brilliant true feelings.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.000
When I wake from a dream, I can meet a new tomorrow

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I definitely will believe in your faith

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
always, forever

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Stay high, if you look through the window, there's a dazzling blue sky

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Surely the door to tomorrow (always green) is opened to us.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.800
New days, graduation can be heard in the spring breeze 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.000
From now on, true days take the place.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Towards the new day when I can meet you, I'll lead the brand new days.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
The new miracle will start from this shining place.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Let's be together once more...

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
