00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:21.891
(Drums, Gong, and Cymbals)

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:30.052
Leonard Han: Chinese Lion Dance is a form of 
 performance art. Its a cultural performance art.

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:43.211
It involves footwork, postures, martial arts postures, percussion music, drums, cymbals and gong.

00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:49.043
The lion moves in unison and precision to the rhythms and the beats.

00:00:49.043 --> 00:00:51.556
(Music)

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:59.255
Well, the Lion Dance consists of two dancers. One that performs the lion 
 head and the other performs the lion tail or the body.

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:05.549
Uh, then there is the drummer. Usually symbol players and a gong player.

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:09.739
There's also the happy Buddha or in Chinese they call it Dia Dal Fuat.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:15.663
He kinda, he interfaces is between the lion and the audience.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.288
Basically guides and leads the lion through the performance, the choreography.

00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:32.902
And takes the lion through the premises of wherever they're performing at.

00:01:33.512 --> 00:01:41.720
We go out and perform for the numerous civic events, schools, organizations,

00:01:41.723 --> 00:01:48.110
typically and traditionally for anything from weddings to birthdays to major events.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:56.360
You'll see it performed for Chinese New Year. Its also 
 performed by Tet, as the Tet festival among Vietnamese.

00:01:56.363 --> 00:02:05.280
It was exported from China to a wide range 
 of Asian countries and today throughout the world.

00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:10.850
It developed through an interaction between West Asian or Persia and China.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.320
 Where the ambassador of Persia was sending 
 gifts and animals to the Emperor China.

00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:34.390
And since lions were not native to China at some point, traders 
 brought lions through the silk road, between China and Persia.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:46.110
You'll see it reflected in a lot of different cultures: Japan, 
 Korea, Tibet, all of South East Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore.

00:02:46.108 --> 00:02:57.680
Widely and in fact after the Cultural Revolution or during the 
 Cultural Revolution, many Chinese left China and went to 

00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:05.250
these other countries in Southeast Asia and took with them all of these traditions.

00:03:06.142 --> 00:03:12.840
The most enjoyable, you know, the movements. Like 
 all dance its the feeling, the expression.

00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:18.950
Its beautiful. Lion Dance, Chinese Lion Dance is 
 unique. Nothing quite like it. You know.

00:03:18.954 --> 00:03:23.240
You get under there. Its a combination of dance rhythms and movements.  

00:03:26.207 --> 00:03:34.560
I think there's something for everyone in the sense 
 that there is music. There is percussion music.

00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:46.140
There's theater. There's dance. And so the lion has been able 
 to provide a or represent part of the culture.

00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:58.060
In other words, the visual form if you will. Bring visual 
 form to this narrative and this dialogue about this history

00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:06.550
that has been by in large unspoken and unavailable to people.
