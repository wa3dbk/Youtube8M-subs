00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:02.837
- (man) You know what makes
me feel better? Smooth jazz.

00:00:02.837 --> 00:00:05.797
♪ (smooth jazz) ♪
- (Ian) SHUT UP!

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:07.937
- (crying in pain)

00:00:07.937 --> 00:00:10.155
- Look at that poor kid.

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:14.306
- Yeah, it's all bent and twisted.

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:16.057
- Think he could use some help?

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.517
- (crying)

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:18.977
- Yeah.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.847
- Don't worry, little guy.
We're here to make it all better.

00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:25.936
- Yeah, so we got you... this new wheel!

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:28.647
(jovial laughter)
Yeah!

00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:31.408
- Ah, good as new! Stay safe there, buddy!

00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:33.447
- Yeah, don't want to break another wheel!

00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:35.716
(laughter)

00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:37.207
- (crying)

00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:40.218
- Man, I feel so good
making that kid's life better.

00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:43.798
- I know, right? Why don't we make
more people's lives better?

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:44.958
- Yeah!

00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:48.668
(goofy chuckle)

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.278
That's horrible.

00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:56.399
- Yeah. We could make it better!

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.390
(laughs jovially)

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.888
Stop this nonsense right now!
- Yeah, what are you doing?

00:01:01.888 --> 00:01:05.110
- Excuse me?
- Well, first of all,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.489
your technique is all wrong.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:10.540
You need to lean your body
in with the punch to get more force.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.450
- Yeah. And plus, when you punch,
you want to bend your knee.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.449
That way, you don't throw out your back.

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:17.410
- Hmm.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.630
(thwap!)
- (grunts)

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.968
- Wow! Thanks, kids!

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:24.689
- Don't mention it! Have fun! (chuckles)
- What the hell, man?

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:30.859
- (woefully) One day you'll be mine.

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:35.582
- Got a big crush, huh?
- Yeah, but I think they're in love.

00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:38.043
- Don't worry. We could make it better.

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:39.952
- Yeah.
(laughter)

00:01:39.952 --> 00:01:42.714
- Imagine a boa constrictor
biting an apple.

00:01:42.714 --> 00:01:45.505
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:50.303
(grunting and struggling)

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:53.501
- Flipping idiots!

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:58.130
I have a crush on him! (weeps)

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.039
(whimpering)
- (both) Ohhhh.

00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:08.679
- A boa constrictor?

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.381
I mean, more like a banana slug.
(laughter)

00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:14.809
- Yeah, I know, right?

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:18.740
- (sobbing)

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.190
- What's wrong?
- I'm just so sad because

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.492
the One Direction concert's been canceled!
- Don't worry.

00:02:29.492 --> 00:02:30.864
We'll make it bett--

00:02:31.764 --> 00:02:34.013
Wait. [Bleep] that!

00:02:34.013 --> 00:02:36.484
- Yeah! Later, LOSER!

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:48.615
- Give me your man purse!!!

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:50.167
- It's a messenger bag!

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:51.793
- Whatever!

00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:55.943
- Don't worry. We'll make this better.
- Yeah. Let's go.

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:58.216
- Yeah-ha-ha!

00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:01.995
- We did it!
- Yeah, we caught the mugger.

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.774
And we got you your man purse.

00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:08.335
- We've done our good deed
for the day. Now it's your turn.

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:11.265
- My turn? What do you--
what do you mean, my turn?

00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:15.235
- He can't be allowed to live.
- He must pay for what he's done

00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.687
in agony and blood.

00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:19.935
- Kill him!

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:22.307
- Guys, it's not that big a deal. I-I--

00:03:22.307 --> 00:03:24.867
- We have sworn to change the world.

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:28.394
- He has existed only
because we've allowed it.

00:03:28.394 --> 00:03:31.867
- And you will end him
because we demand it.

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:34.649
- Wait, no, I'm not gonna do that!

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.238
- Kill him!
- No!

00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:37.958
- Kill him!
- No!!

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.857
(Ian and Anthony chanting "Kill!")
No! No!!

00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:45.689
(shouting)

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.898
(gasping)

00:03:49.764 --> 00:03:51.078
- Feel better now?

00:03:51.078 --> 00:03:53.225
- I certainly do!

00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:55.193
- (all) All right!!!

00:04:00.357 --> 00:04:01.583
- (Anthony) To see bloopers

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:04.415
and an entirely different
alternate ending,

00:04:04.415 --> 00:04:06.626
click the video right here!

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:08.066
- Then it goes in your butt!

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:12.096
Thanks for subscribing!
You don't want to resist.

00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:14.288
- (Anthony) You can't resist.
