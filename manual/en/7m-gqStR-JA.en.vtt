00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.970
Riku: Sora!

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.590
YMX: Don't touch the new vessel.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.680
Riku: Vessel?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.540
YMX: Yeah. In the beginning, it was meant to be you.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.800
YMX: But your heart built up a tolerance to the darkness.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.270
YMX: So, we chose the next Keyblade Wielder like you.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.540
YMX: Roxas... A being quite suited to be a vessel.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.200
YMX: But he had too much of a sense of self, and went back to Sora.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.670
YMX: The true purpose of Organization XIII was to divide Xehanort's heart into 13 vessels.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.070
YMX: We knew that thanks to you we would lose many of the vessels.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.430
YMX: But we've already made up for that.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.330
YMX: With the thirteenth vessel, Sora, in our hands, it will be complete.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.620
Riku: Thirteen... Xehanorts?

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.470
Riku: This is...!

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.510
YMX: The true Organization XIII.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.690
Riku: Organization XIII?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.880
YMX: Among these, I am the Xehanort from furthest in the past.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.800
YMX: I was given the duty, by a version of myself from a future time, 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080
YMX: to gather here, today, all the split or fused versions of us from throughout the worlds.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.470
Riku: From the past?

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.160
YMX: There are many restrictions when it comes to crossing time.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.450
YMX: Firstly, to cross, you must cast off the flesh.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.450
YMX: Before you can cross time, you must not exist.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.970
YMX: While crossing, you may only travel in one direction with the flow of time.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.810
YMX: You cannot rewrite the realities that occurred at those times.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.810
Riku: What are you trying to do!

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.890
YMX: Soon, the very latest version of myself will return here.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.640
YMX: Once that happens, each time will return to its original flow, 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.150
YMX: and I too will go along the flow of time to my original era.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.840
YMX: You should ask him.   

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.310
Mickey: Stopga!

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.630
Mickey: Looks like I'm just in time!

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.880
Riku: Mickey!

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.510
Mickey: Anyhow, let's hurry and take Sora back.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.360
Mickey: He won't stay stopped for long.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.910
Riku: Got it!

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.510
Riku: Mickey!

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.260
YMX: I thought I told you not to touch him.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.230
Riku: Why can you move?

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.220
Mickey: It can't be! That's--!

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.850
YMX: Disappear--!
