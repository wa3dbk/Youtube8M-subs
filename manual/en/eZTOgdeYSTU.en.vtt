00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.100
Its nearing the end of February.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.040
Its interesting that we've still got a fire
season here.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.780
The days are getting shorter, the weather
is starting to change, but we've still got

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.599
a fire season that people have to be conscious
about.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.949
Its interesting with the days being shorter,
were seeing a slightly different change in

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:19.949
the weather.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.050
I think over the weekend we've seen slightly
cooler, shorter days means a little more moisture

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.140
around and we certainly welcome that.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.119
But we haven't seen any change with the fuel
conditions.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.149
That means we've got dry grass and bushland
across Victoria, and that's the key factor

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.480
at the moment.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.960
This week we'll see a cooler week, a more
mild week with the potential of lightning

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.699
earlier in the week which could mean we have
other starts of fire.

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.299
But also we're going to see the potential
for showers and rain, and we certainly welcome

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.350
the word about rain.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.410
That will change the landscape dramatically,
and we hope it's widow spread, but that may

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.410
not be the case.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.670
So stay tuned to the forecast and the Bureau
will do its best to make sure we get the weather

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.870
thats best for us.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.590
The other thing thats interesting to reflect
on is the fire last week in Donnybrooke, a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.020
hot day not a windy day, that saw a grass
fire move three, four, five kilometres an

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.850
hour in three hours as sitting right on the
edge of the Metropolitan area and caused a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.090
lot of concern for people in the outer metropolitan
area.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.479
The urban fringe, or what we call the urban
rural interface is something we need to be

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.359
very conscious of.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.950
We've done a lot of work since then
in the last week about understanding better

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.259
the types of community on the interface.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.340
We know them well, but we actually went and
had a look at a lot more information about

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.590
where the schools are, the child care facilities
and we're going to make a real focus, if we

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.969
have a fire in that area, in any of those
areas in the next two weeks that we really

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.649
do tune a lot closer to the schools, because
I think thats where a lot of the concern was.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.659
If your a parent you'll be looking for what
the kids are doing, if its after 3:30, where

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.039
the kids are.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.579
Thats one of the things that we certainly
focused on last week.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.760
To you, as someone who's out there, weather
your a school child or weather your a parent,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.090
think about the school hours, think about
what happens for those two or three hours

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.720
after school finishes.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.330
People are on public transport.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.400
Where are hay, what would they do if a fire
started?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.220
What would they do if they couldn't get home
because the bus didn't make it or the train

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.220
didn't.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.000
So there are lots of things to think about
and I think thats the action this week, is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.660
to think about what it means to be a person
that lives in urban areas.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.760
Weather it be in Melbourne or some of our
provincial cities, if a fire was near you

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.620
and is close to your home that you don't normally
think a fire would be.
