00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.667
There's something I've always
wanted to try:

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.167
to engineer a dress made
out of unusual materials.

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:12.567
NAOMI:
These here are 160s,

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:16.733
which means they are one-inch
wide and 60 inches long.

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.467
Hi, I'm Deysi from Design Squad,

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:22.833
and I'm here with Naomi
from Red Balloon Company.

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.067
So, do you want to see
one of my dresses?

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:25.233
Yes.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.300
Naomi is a balloon twister.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.900
That's so cool!

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.500
I want to combine fashion design
with engineering

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.233
because I'm giving
a speech to kids

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.567
about what engineering
means to me

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:38.633
at a TEDx Youth Event.

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:40.067
So I need a cool dress.

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:41.633
Can it be purple, please?

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:42.967
Sure, yeah.

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:45.667
Here, I'll show you
a bunch of different colors.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.300
We'll have the base of it be
mostly purples,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.233
and then we'll have some
of these golden rod highlights

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.200
and also add some blues
in the mix.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.367
Okay.

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:55.600
We got our colors,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.367
and I'll see you in a week
for the fitting.

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:58.367
Okay, yay!

00:00:58.367 --> 00:00:59.433
I'm excited.

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:00.567
Thank you so much.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:02.300
You're welcome.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.200
To start making the dress,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.033
I'm going to make a small twist
called a pinch twist.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:14.367
So this is the basic unit
of construction of the dress.

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:16.533
I'm going to keep
adding a pinch twist

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.133
and a 160 going down
until I've made it long enough

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.700
to go all the way
around the dress form.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.400
One balloon in itself is not
that structurally strong,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.167
but when you build
with the fibers,

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:32.100
which are the balloons,
the more structural it gets.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.600
This is pretty strong
and sturdy.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.933
A balloon dress
is really engineering

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:40.100
to make something temporary,
as opposed to permanent.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.367
I think Deysi is going
to be here very soon.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.033
DEYSI:
Is it ready?

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:46.300
Yeah, you ready to see it?

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.233
Yeah.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.633
All right, here we go.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:51.533
(gasps)

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.800
Wow!

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.967
And it's purple, yes!

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:58.200
So can I try it on?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.567
(balloons rubbing, squeaking)

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:02.533
It's alive!

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.400
Just gonna twist these...

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.333
(balloon pops)

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:08.767
(screams)

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:12.300
Naomi, this is the noisiest
dress I've ever tried on.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.033
(another balloon bursts)

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.600
Ta da!

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.033
I like it.

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:21.167
And it's comfortable, actually,
once you get used to it.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:25.033
(squeaking)

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:31.567
I'm here at the TEDx event
and I am very nervous.

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:35.333
At Ted X Youth events,
kids and adults share ideas

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.067
about how they
experience the world

00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:38.800
in a new and different way.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.600
I've been walking around,
showing off my balloon dress,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.533
A lot of people
have been taking pictures,

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:45.667
they've asked for autographs,

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.833
I let some kids touch the dress,

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:50.900
but very carefully
because we don't want

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.500
any of the balloons to pop.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.600
HOST:
So our next speaker,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.500
born in Mexico,
grew up in East Boston,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.467
and then she decided she wanted
to become an engineer.

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:00.800
And she's wearing what I was
going to wear.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.833
Deysi.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:04.533
(applause)

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:12.733
Naomi Greenfield,
the owner of Red Balloon Company

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:14.300
is the creator
of this spectacular dress.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.400
Naomi, instead of weaving
traditional materials

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.033
like fabric or thread,
she wove balloons together.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.967
Engineers can do amazing
things by understanding

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:26.167
how their materials work.

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:27.633
I always liked building things,

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.267
but it wasn't until the summer

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:31.100
before my senior year
of high school

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.867
that I actually got the
opportunity to really try it out

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:37.500
when I was asked to be
a contestant on Design Squad.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.400
I figured out that my passion
for math

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.233
and my love for theater would be
channeled into one field:

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:45.000
engineering.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.333
Because of Design Squad, I was
able to discover first-hand

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.933
what life for engineers is like.

00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:53.600
I learned from the challenges
we tackled on the show

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.767
that engineering enabled me
to work with great people,

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:58.200
solve problems, be creative,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.533
and make a difference
in people's lives.

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:01.767
Design Squad also showed me

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:04.733
how much creativity
there is in engineering.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:07.200
My last words to you
about engineering are:

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.200
If you thing something
is important to you,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.133
follow through with it.

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:13.600
Don't be afraid to explore
your creative side,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.467
because it's very important
to put your own input into it.

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:20.300
Thank you.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.700
(applause)

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.167
It's over!

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:30.233
I did it!

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:31.367
Yay!
