00:00:05.935 --> 00:00:09.285
- In many ways the artists' materials are

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:13.270
what the musical notes are for a composer.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:17.705
The artist brings together a
disparate group of materials,

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:19.621
assembles them into a composition,

00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:22.360
and what we see of that
composition is on the canvas.

00:00:22.744 --> 00:00:25.477
And just the same way
that a conductor's job

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:28.839
is to take this set of notes and make

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.434
some sense of the unruly orchestra,

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:35.072
a restorer's job is to
take the set of materials

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:38.010
which has gone through a
lot of transformations,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.589
since it was applied by the artist,

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.355
and make some sense of it.

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:44.928
As conservators we have a variety of tools

00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:49.719
that have been adapted
to give us clues about

00:00:51.197 --> 00:00:53.580
what the artist may have had in mind

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.855
when he was creating a particular image.

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.510
This is the Farewell of
Telemachus and Eucharis,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.150
which was painted by
Jacques-Louis David in 1818

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.213
when he was working in exile in Brussels.

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:09.955
We're looking at a detail of the painting

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:12.520
with a technique called
infrared reflectography,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.156
which involves taking a
camera that has been equipped

00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:17.158
with an infrared sensitive tube,

00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:20.280
and seeing the reflective
abilities of different materials,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.916
different pigments in
the infrared light range.

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.528
If we take a close look at
this area of the painting,

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:30.078
when we look at it with
infrared, what we see is that

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:34.258
David went to the trouble to
block in the figure in the nude

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:37.569
underneath the drapery, and
then to literally clothe him.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.504
David was trained as an academic painter.

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:42.803
Academic painters in France were trained

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:46.007
from a very young age to
draw and study the nude.

00:01:46.637 --> 00:01:48.015
And one of the reasons you do that

00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:50.738
is so that you can get
a real sense of form,

00:01:50.738 --> 00:01:52.450
not just the surface of the skin,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.919
but the bone and the
muscle that's underneath.

00:01:58.263 --> 00:01:59.869
When you walk through the galleries,

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.097
there're a couple of things
that you're not aware of.

00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:05.290
One is the fact that the
picture has a history.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.779
It has a history from the
time that it left the easel,

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.483
when all sorts of things
began to happen to it.

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:13.716
This is a painting by early 19th Century

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.931
German painter named
Caspar David Friedrich,

00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:19.846
who's an extremely rare
artist in this country.

00:02:20.394 --> 00:02:22.995
When I first saw the painting
at the auction house,

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:28.448
it was in a somewhat disheveled state.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.408
It had fairly discolored
runners on the surface,

00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:34.439
and more importantly it had a large hole

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.874
in this part of the painting.

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:42.179
What I did do, was to repair
the hole from the back,

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:44.003
glue some new pieces of fabric

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:45.242
just to the edges of the painting,

00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:48.055
which allowed me to re-stretch
it onto the stretcher.

00:02:48.055 --> 00:02:49.966
And then I prepared the stretcher with,

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:51.735
yet another piece of fabric,

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:54.510
and then the whole package
was put back together,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.649
so that from the front you really

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:57.993
can't tell that anything has happened.

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:04.775
So the challenge in the
restoration was to take care of

00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:08.838
the structural anomalies,
this hole in the sky,

00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:10.753
but to do the work in such a way

00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:15.398
that my presence would be
as invisible as possible,

00:03:15.398 --> 00:03:17.324
so that all that was left in the end

00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:20.910
was the artist's voice
speaking to you directly.

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:23.981
We have been able to look at this painting

00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.790
with infrared reflectography,
and underneath the surface

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.542
is an extraordinarily elaborate plan.

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:32.081
These trees in the distance,

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:35.877
which have a kind of misty
quality, were laid in,

00:03:35.877 --> 00:03:38.478
in very elaborate, precise detail,

00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:41.941
and then the paint actually
played the role of the mist.

00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:45.652
Imagine a late afternoon, early evening

00:03:45.652 --> 00:03:49.193
when the mist begins to
rise from the fields.

00:03:49.193 --> 00:03:51.538
Friedrich literally laid in the mist,

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:52.652
laid in the paint the same way

00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:54.433
that the mist would have
traveled into the field.

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:57.824
and that's one of the reasons
that this illusion of a tree

00:03:57.824 --> 00:04:00.522
in the mist in the distance,
compared to the clarity

00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:02.803
of the tree in the
foreground is so successful.

00:04:02.803 --> 00:04:05.689
Because he's used the
paint almost to imitate

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.508
the natural progression of the atmosphere.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.392
What appears to be, the essence
of simplicity and purity

00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:14.861
is often the result of a tremendous

00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:17.983
wrestle and struggle with materials.

00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:21.861
Paint is a very unruly and
difficult substance to handle,

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.689
and it's very hard to make
it do what you want it to do.

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:27.669
And one of the reasons that
artists are such geniuses

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.825
is because they're able
to take a virtually

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:34.674
unmanageable material
and make sense of it,

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:36.881
make it speak, make it say something

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:40.774
and reflect some inner beliefs
and feelings that they have.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.650
And that's a tremendous
skill and talent and gift,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.343
which is why we appreciate
these things today.
