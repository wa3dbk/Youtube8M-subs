00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.300
Sweet Princess, my gift shall be...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.100
Why, it's Maleficent!

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.400
What does she want here?

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
Shh!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Well, quite a glittering assemblage, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.800
King Stefan

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.000
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
(laughs)

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.000
how quaint

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.000
even the rabble

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.400
I really felt quite distressed at not receiving
an invitation

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.000
You weren't wanted

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.000
Not wa...? Oh dear, what an awkward situation

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.500
I had hoped it was merely due to some oversight

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600
Well in that event, I'd best be on my way

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.500
And, you're not offended, Your Excellency?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.500
Why no, Your Majesty

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.800
And to show I bear no ill will,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.500
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.800
Listen well, all of you!

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.000
The Princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.400
beloved by all who know her

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.310
But, before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.390
she shall prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.400
and die!

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.700
Oh no!

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.600
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.300
Seize that creature!

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.000
Stand back you fools!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.500
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
