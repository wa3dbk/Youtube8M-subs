00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:40.673
So here we are; the final edition of Tech Head.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:43.610
I guess you could say it's not so much the end, as a beginning.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.246
But you'd be wrong - because it's the end.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.614
The end of the series.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.616
Over the last twenty-odd episodes of

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.785
pioneering short-form Internet content,

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.219
I've travelled through space,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.921
explored strange new worlds, 

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.724
flown over mountains, under ground,

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.360
and sat in some pretty awful traffic to get here. 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.327
My mission?

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:05.131
To boldly explore, dissect and possibly unravel

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.301
the mystery of people-kind's fascination with technology.

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.536
And what have we learnt?

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.204
Well, for one thing,

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.706
I need to get the cushion on this chair re-stuffed.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.942
I may look comfy, but after twenty episodes

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.211
this thing is taking its toll.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.180
But apart from that, what else?

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.849
I like toasters less than I did when I started,

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:23.883
which is a surprise.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:24.684
So that's something.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:25.251
[Toaster pops]

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:29.122
But if I've whined like an overheating CPU,

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.458
please don't take me for a techno no-no

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.293
or install a cooling system in me.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:36.062
I still love the stuff. I guess, if anything,

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.565
I've come to realise that whilst technology is brilliant,

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.868
it might - just might - swallow us whole

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:45.705
like a giant, really hungry "Hungry Hungry Hippo"

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.006
- and that's a lot of hungry.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.075
But if technology does kill us all

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.710
like what it did in Terminator 2

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.078
and countless other less-popular

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.780
but equally bleak sci-fi films

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.515
- then let's just hope it'll have the courtesy

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.318
not to flash up that little spinning beach-ball of death

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.520
or force us to hold down the start button 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.988
and do a hard-reboot first.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:04.691
No, we should definitely embrace the future

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.192
and all the wonderful things that

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:09.162
people with brains far bigger than mine cook up.

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.798
But we should also, maybe, slow down a bit.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:15.568
Great tech takes - and will stand the test of - time.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:18.204
Nothing banged out of a mass-production factory line

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:21.040
to quickly cash-in on a fad is going to be any good...

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.411
although that USB-powered humping dog thing was inspired. 

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.413
Sorry, that was basically just a lot of

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.315
 contradictory nonsense wasn't it? 

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.284
Err... How to conclude...?

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.652
There must be an App for this... 

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.854
How's about I just say that contradiction

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:36.856
 is the theme of the show...? 

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.124
Yeah, that's it. After all, 

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:40.527
I'm just as confused, enthused, frustrated, elated,

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.195
fatigued and intrigued by technology 

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.898
as I was when I started this epic journey.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.567
One day I'm giggling with childish anticipation over 

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.335
the latest smart-phone software release,

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.938
the next I just want to be a goat-herder.

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:55.008
A Nepalese goat-herder in the early-to-mid 1930s 

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.910
with a belt made out of string

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.279
who hasn't even heard of laptops or flat-screens

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.581
or USB-powered humping dogs.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:03.750
A goat-herder who believes in his heart

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.617
that that salesman bloke

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.619
who just explained how a telephone works

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.788
was in fact a travelling wizard.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:12.992
But for now, I'll carry on flying around the galaxy I guess. 

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.727
But don't worry - thanks to some rather nifty 

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.362
technology I've picked up along the way,

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.766
the carbon footprint of this pod is very small indeed. 

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.201
So... until next time. 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.003
Pedal to the metal, boys!
