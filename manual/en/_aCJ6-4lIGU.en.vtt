00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.330
Hi, my name is Lincoln Ward. I am the director
of the Austin Tennis Center here in Austin,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.630
Texas as well as a USPTA certified teaching
pro. Today we're going to talk about how to

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.980
purchase a new tennis racket. Remember when
you're buying a new racket, you're paying

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.590
for the technology and the design of that
racket. Nowadays, rackets have a wide variety

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.269
of different materials they're made with as
well as features. You want to look for a racket

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.430
that suits your game. When you're buying a
racket, its not necessarily the cost of the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:46.469
racket, but how it suits up with your game.
If you have a longer stroke, you want a lighter

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.190
or mid-range racket that you can take all
the back and swing through and it gives you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.380
time to meet the ball. A super heavy racket
might not give you enough time to get your

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:06.000
swing all the way completed. If you have a
very short stroke, you want a lighter racket

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.580
with a wider header so that it will help you
generate the power without a long stroke.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.740
A lot of rackets now have a variety of different
types of grommeting systems. A lot of the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:30.180
Wilson rackets have rounder holes whereas
some of the HEAD rackets have completely different

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.860
grommet system. They're all just designed
to help keep the vibration away from the frame

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.880
of your racket increasing the sweet spot of
your racket. Another thing is the composition

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.380
of your racket. Usually the more expensive
rackets will have a more higher technology

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:01.290
in composition in the graphite to Kevlar combination
in the racket. Those are a couple things you

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.209
can look for when purchasing a new tennis
racket.
