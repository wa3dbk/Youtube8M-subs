Hey, what's goin' on ya'all, this is tWitch
with DS2DIO 360's Dancer Spotlight. Now today

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.000
we have a very special guest. This is dancer, 
choreographer extraordinaire Galen Hooks. When I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.740
first met Galen, I thought she was just a tapper 
actually. GALEN: Really? TWITCH: I'm sorry to call you

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.189
out like this, but I met Galen on Star Search
GALEN: Yup. TWITCH: Mad years ago. GALEN: And

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.460
I met Stephen Boss on Star Search! He
wasn't even tWitch yet! TWITCH: Yah and my

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.990
hair was a different color. It was yah, it
was a tough time. Now you've seen Galen working

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.550
working with the likes of Justin Bieber, and Janet,
Ne-Yo, and the list goes on and on with over

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.470
two decades of going hard in the industry,
right? GALEN: Yah. TWITCH: Absolutely. Now

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.290
recently she was the consulting producer and
host of DS2DIO's show Masterclass. Now tell

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.850
us a little bit about Masterclass. GALEN:
It was one of the best experiences of my life.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.340
The people we have on it first of all
are all special individually. And then to

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.329
have them all on one show is really I don't
know when that has ever happened or will happen

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:19.840
again. Dancers all around the world, anybody
can take class from these people that are

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.009
giants that people in LA don't even get to
take class from. TWITCH : Exactly. GALEN: And

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.009
the components of it being interactive. You
can, there's a progress bar. You can tell

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.520
where you are in the routine when you're learning
it. I feel like it's a really powerful tool for

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.789
dancers everywhere, no matter if you're a
professional or if you just like to dance

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.170
in your living room at home. It's so great
because you just, you get this choreography

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.369
from things you recognize from TV and you're
like, I get to learn that now. TWITCH: But

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.179
you also get a very in depth interview
with literally the greats. GALEN: For me it

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.840
was just more like learning as a whole the
choreography and dance industry through the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.529
past decades and what has led up to now and
then it gave me a whole different perspective

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:01.479
on everything. TWITCH: Right. GALEN: Cause
we only see these people as what they are

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.380
today. You know it's like she is Marguerite today, 
she is Fatima today, but how did she become Fatima?

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.149
How did she become Marguerite? TWITCH: Exactly.
GALEN: And as you listen to each of their

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.909
stories you kind of get this overall picture
of what ties them altogether, all the similarities

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.970
they all have. Like Travis Payne was talking about
how Marguerite was his, was the first person

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.470
to hire him as a dancer for a job. Or AJ was
talking about moving to LA and sleeping on

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.420
Rich and Tone's floor. Or like Wade and Brian's
relationship. TWITCH: Right. GALEN: And

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.650
how they started things together and Wade
gave Brian his first job as a choreographer.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.890
And it's just like you're starting to put
all the puzzle pieces together and you realize

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.150
this whole...it's like being able to go into
the past. TWITCH: If you find yourself asking

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.860
like, what are they talking about? Then after
you finish watching this interview of course,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.720
you need to go back and watch the entire Masterclass
series. GALEN: Yah. TWITCH: And we have new

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.549
episodes coming up, correct? GALEN: Yes. We have 
Jamaica Craft, Marty Kudelka, Tina Landon, AJ, this

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.480
is mind blowing for me. I can't wait. You
know I don't know if I'm gonna post a response

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.610
video, but I'm gonna be getting down. GALEN:
Yah! Oh my gosh, you have to. tWitch: I'll

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.939
be getting down in my living room though.
GALEN: That'd be awesome. TWITCH: So how was

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.209
that? The new episodes, all that. GALEN: They're
all different style and they're all different levels

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.400
of skill levels. AJ's routine is one of the
hardest routines I've ever seen in my entire

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.579
life. He does Usher' s work. And you know Jamaica
Craft does work with Ciara and she's doing

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.049
a routine from Ciara's "Promise" video which as
a girl that was a video that all the girls

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.250
were like, I wish I was in that video. So
now you get to learn it at home. And Tina

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.579
Landon is literally an icon. In the industry
everybody considers her an icon and a legend

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.480
and she's teaching something from Willow Smith's 
stuff that she's been doing. Marty Kudelka

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.569
is somebody that has inspired a whole generation
of male dancers. He's had such a huge impact

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.709
on the industry. He did Justin Timberlake's
choreography. I'm so excited about these

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.980
next four episodes. TWITCH: Very nice. Me
too, me too. Now you're also an advocate for

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.920
Dancer's Alliance? GALEN: Yes. TWITCH: So,
can you tell us a little bit about that for

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.870
those who don't know what Dancer's Alliance
is? GALEN: Sure, yah. Dancer' s Alliance is

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.200
a basically a group of dancers and choreographers
who donate their time to improving the working

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.650
conditions for dancers and choreographers
in the entertainment industry and I'm kind

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.969
of the chair of Dancer's Alliance. I've been
involved in it for about 8 years. I've been

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:20.359
working on trying to get them unionized with
the entertainment union that we have here

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.759
in LA which is now SAG-AFTRA and we got a union
contract. TWITCH: Very Nice. GALEN: Were you

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.930
at, you were at the event. TWITCH: Absolutely,
of course. GALEN: Yes, we had a huge event

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.580
a couple weeks ago that actually some of our
Masterclass choreographers were performing

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.120
in it: Brian Friedman, Travis Payne, Tina
Landon, Marty Kudelka. I called them and asked

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.970
if they would perform and they said yes and
I wanted to die. It was one of the most historical

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.479
nights in the dance industry's history so
we're really proud about that and now we are

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.630
working on getting tours covered so that all
dancers with have all of their work wrapped

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.660
up in this great protected bubbleâ€¦TWITCH:
Nice. GALEN: that has not existed before so

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.710
yah, you can check out dancersalliance.org
for more information. We have some tank tops

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.900
on sale right now you can buy that donates money to 
us. You can donate to our organization in general

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.849
to us on the website and just learn a little
bit more about it. TWITCH: That's awesome.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:15.210
Now, with that being said, what piece of advice
can you pass on to aspiring dancers to gain

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.800
the longevity that you have? GALEN: It's about
just taking control of your career and really

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.940
training and not just imitating. Don't just
watch the youtube videos and imitate. Really

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.030
train and take class and know what you're
doing and then you'll get longevity and you

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.009
won't just be hot for a second and then out
the door, so...TWITCH: Right. GALEN: Really

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.940
love it and train and do as many different styles 
as you can. From there it's just about believing

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.870
in yourself. I know it sounds cliche, but
it's like, you gotta, it's a tough industry. You

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.870
get knocked down 500 times and you have to get up 
501 times. TWITCH: Exactly. Gotta have thick skin.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.300
Well, thank you so much Galen for coming by and 
what were some of your favorite Masterclass routines

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.979
and have you posted a response video yet?
Leave your comments below and we'll see you

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.000
next time. GALEN: Bye.
