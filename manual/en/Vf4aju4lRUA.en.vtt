00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:09.720
I have accusers who accuse me because I teach
people to go to Jesus, to be led by the ONLY

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:17.279
ONE who can TRULY TEACH THEM,
which is JESUS WHOM THE HOLY SPIRIT TEACHES!

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.360
They say to me; “Well why are you making
youtube videos all the time

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.029
and teaching and preaching to people if the
Holy Spirit is the ONLY Teacher?

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.710
Why don’t you be quite and shut up?”

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.010
I preach Jesus and I teach Jesus because this
is what Jesus called me to do by His Holy

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.550
Spirit!

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.460
He called me to “Preach the gospel
free of charge” and I have done as He has

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.559
called me to do.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.280
My hope is that YOU would go to Jesus and
be led by HIM,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.249
because you certainly cannot be led by me!

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.879
I cannot be your teacher.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.899
NO ONE can be your teacher except JESUS WHOM
THE HOLY SPIRIT TEACHES!

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.600
Do you want to be led by JESUS WHOM THE HOLY
SPIRIT TEACHES, not men?

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.689
You cannot be led by me because I do NOT know
the situations

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.840
you are facing; I do not know if you need
to turn to the left or the right.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.640
BUT JESUS CHRIST WHO GIVES HIS HOLY SPIRIT
IS ABLE TO LEAD THE MAN AND THE WOMAN OF GOD.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.479
If you TRULY choose to be led by the Holy
Spirit, HE will lead you and guide you into

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.030
ALL truth.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.950
This is why Jesus said there is only ONE Teacher,
the CHRIST.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.850
You can read about this in Matthew chapter
23.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.250
NONE of us are to be called “Good Teacher”
or “Rabbi” or “Father”.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.869
We are to be called “Servants”; I am a
servant,

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.240
we are all servants of the Most High GOD.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.009
My accusers will say to me though; “Well
didn’t Paul teach that there were many spiritual

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.079
gifts
and one of the spiritual gifts is that of

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.179
teaching?”

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.900
AND that is TRUE, there is the gift of administration,
of teaching, the gift of tongues;

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.640
The Holy Spirit gives many supernatural gifts,
but these gifts are NOT OF US!

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.709
There NOT like the gifts that the pastors
say they have of teaching.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.900
You know the pastors are able to teach because
they have their degree, they come out of seminary,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.760
and they know the Bible because they have
read it.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.760
BUT THAT IS NOT A SPIRITUAL GIFT!

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.510
ANYONE who has read the Bible can teach the
Bible from their carnal knowledge.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.819
Anyone who has read the Bible knows what the
Bible says.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.879
But NOT everyone has been given the HOLY SPIRIT.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.930
Not everyone seeks the Holy Spirit.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.310
If you really want to be led by the Holy Spirit,
you have to go to Jesus and ask Him for the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.230
Holy Spirit.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.379
Do you want to be led by the Holy Spirit?

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.650
Or do you want to be led by men and women
who can NEVER truly lead you.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.950
LISTEN TO A TEACEHR AS MUCH AS HE POINTS YOU
TO JESUS AS THE TEACHER!

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.349
His job is DONE if he has led you to JESUS.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.450
Because then you are led by the Holy Spirit.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.239
What a (false teacher) pastor does is he says;
“Come to my church,

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.950
be led by me, come and be part of my flock,
come weekly to my church…”

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.540
BUT as a true disciple of Jesus,
I’m NOT here to lead you, I cannot lead

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.540
you.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.750
But I CAN tell you to go to Jesus because
HE is the One who leads me.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.489
He is the One who helps me when I have troubles.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.660
He is the One who leads me and guides me.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.000
I cannot help myself when all these problems
come in my life.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.219
I look around and I know there is NO WAY I
can survive UNLESS I rely on JESUS.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.569
AND HE HELPS ME.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.319
Are you putting your faith in Jesus?

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.989
Are you being led by HIM?

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.410
Or are you just seeking out “wise counsel”
from pastors,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.350
from books, from commentaries, from your own
Bible knowledge?

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.660
OR is truly the Holy Spirit you Teacher?

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.190
May the grace of Jesus be with you.
