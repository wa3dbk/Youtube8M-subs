00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.840
With the explosive growth of cloud computing,
data center cooling is one of the world's

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.950
fastest-growing energy issues.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.520
ISAC, short for In-Server Air Conditioning,
is Asetek's next generation data center liquid-cooling

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.630
solution designed to significantly reduce
energy use for data centers.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.630
Cooling accounts for 50 percent of annual
operating costs in a traditional air-cooled

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.449
data center like this one.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.320
ISAC integrates with Asetek's RackCDU, completely
eliminating the need for Computer Room Air

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.020
Conditioners to cool servers inside the data
center.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.760
The air stays inside the server and recirculates
rather than exiting and heating up the data

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.760
center.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.219
In addition, the need for cold aisle containment
and raised floors is also eliminated.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.890
Let's take a closer look at how it works...

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.672
Warm facilities liquid enters through the
tubes on the back of the server and in to

00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:56.010
the liquid-to-air HEX cooling the air inside
the server.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.270
The warm liquid then moves to the direct to
chip cooling system where integrated pumps

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.330
and cold plates cool the GPUs, and in this
case, the CPUs.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.170
By cooling and circulating the air inside
the server ISAC, is able to keep all of the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.210
remaining components in the server comfortably
within spec without drawing any air from the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.080
data center.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.380
Air in the data center doesn't need to be
cooled or conditioned for dust and humidity,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.049
meaning ISAC servers can operate in the most
hostile environments.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.860
Hot liquid exits the server and is free cooled
outside the data center and the cycle repeats.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.990
All air stays and recirculates inside the
server and is sealed from the surroundings,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.299
eliminating the need for chiller, CRAC and
CRAH units to cool servers.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.950
As you can see, air cooled servers exhaust
huge amount of hot air out to the data center

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.340
to operate.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.479
Asetek's ISAC solves this problem by recirculating
the air within the server without ever releasing

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.990
it into the data center.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.659
In addition, easy to remove bezels preserve
the server's serviceability.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.829
Cooling data centers account for almost 2%
of the global power consumption.

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.830
Asetek's ISAC reduces energy and infrastructure
costs, eliminating much of the capital and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.200
operating costs associated with using computer-room
air-conditioning for cooling servers.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.820
In addition, no air is shared between server
and the data center, making data center air-quality

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.940
requirements irrelevant.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.080
Now that's liquid cooling done right.
