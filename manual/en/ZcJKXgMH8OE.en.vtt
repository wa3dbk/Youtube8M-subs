years ago

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.180
when we still use pedal boats without
engines we could catch up to 700 fish in

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.760
one night

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.920

more aggressive an illegal methods are
being used to catch remaining fish

identity to be revealed moment

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.960
but I'm glad I'm I feel guilty using
this illegal method

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.500
but if we use lines we hardly catch
enough to make a living and to be able

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.830

still can compete with the big boat

sketching all the fish

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.989

lot for murder

branch the effects of overfishing become
painfully clear at this harbor in Bali

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.840
the most have the tuna fleet is docked

penetration the government has
introduced marine protected areas

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.340
were fishing is limited to make sure a
fish populations will grow back

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.000
but this might be too little too late
with aggressive fishing techniques not

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.849
being banned

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:10.220
traditional fishermen and Flores have
only a slim chance to pass on their
