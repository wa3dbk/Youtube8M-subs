00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.860
hi I'm Joe wiesenfelder with cars.com I
just drove a very interesting animal a

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.650
hyundai genesis luxury car it comes in
v8 and v6 versions now the thing that's

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.279
most interesting about this car is
thirty-three thousand dollars

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.619
thirty-eight thousand dollars I'm
sitting inside a 4.6 which is the trim

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.640
level named named after the v8 engine
which is 4.6 liters

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.059
it has 375 horsepower it's extremely
quick

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.930
6-speed automatic transmission just
about the what you would expect in a

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.000
luxury car in this class

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.080
the materials are very nice there's real
aluminum and the cases where it's not

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.890
real it actually looks really high
quality stuff like the center console

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.320
has the right sound to it

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.150
it's not just the look and feel it's the
sound inside you'll find a connector for

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.900
an actual ipod brand ipod and its
standard equipment

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.350
the other guys might make you pay more
for this and in addition to this

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.170
connector you can plug in a USB flash
drive a cheapo piece like that full of

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.080
hundreds of songs again standard
equipment

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.300
a lot of the other expected features in
a luxury car cooled seats are available

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.490
on this particular version

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.540
you've got a power sunshade over the
rear window and also an optional

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.440
navigation system which is tied into the
premium stereo by a company called

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.590
lexicon that's been doing this stuff for
a long time in the home theater filled

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.710
it has one of these multifunction
controller knobs and though I'm not

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.350
crazy about that usually I do like touch
screen

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.990
it's pretty easy to use and it has stuff
like a real-time traffic information and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.470
stuff like that on the maps now here the
back seat is one of the things that

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.820
makes it a little bit closer to a
full-size luxury car even though it's

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.630
priced to compete with the mid-size I've
got lots and lots of legroom the front

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.110
seat here is all the way back in terms
of the width of the car

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.770
you could put three people back here
pretty easily now as you might expect a

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.970
large car is a large trunk which is good
unfortunately the back seat does not

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.030
fold flat there is a pass-through in the
center

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.420
unfortunately this is pretty common
among large cars though you can buy a

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.760
large car with folding back seats

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.749
so here's the interesting part I'm now
in a genesis 3.8 which stands for the

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.170
3.8 liter v6 engine now it doesn't have
quite as many

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.650
standard features as the 4.6 there's a
lot

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.770
it still has leather standard even
though it's not the same whether it's

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.300
not premium leather and in this car
there is a leather-wrapped dashboard

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.400
which is an option on this one but still
the regular 3.8 very nice well equipped

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.650
heated seats not cold

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.250
you get that in the other one you can
get the premium stereo and this one too

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.269
I'm having a hard time finding things
that are wrong with it

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.880
really this text here is not real
elegant it's kind of bright

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.800
I'm stretching I'm gonna be honest now
the v6 engine in my opinion is plenty

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.940
powerful enough

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.650
now what do you think of this 17 city 25
highway step seem pretty good

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.549
well that's actually the v8 this one is
18 27

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.410
you don't get that a lot of cars even in
this class that cost considerably more

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.569
and maybe even go slower

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.290
even though there's no hyundai H on
the grill here this is still a hyundai

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.010
the company thought about having a new
brand to sell luxury cars but there's

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.160
more to a brand than just putting a name
on a car you've got to have a whole

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.299
dealer network and all that stuff it's
not exactly an easy thing to do I got to

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.150
tell you for what you get for the money
here I don't care if they call this

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.970
thing and oldsmobile a you go

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.400
I still buy for additional information
on this car or any other go to cars.com

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.320
