Hi my name is Paolo and welcome to expertvillage.com.
As I discussed earlier, I'm going to teach

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.810
you how to clean the varies components of
the PC. That includes your keyboard and your

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:19.170
monitor. Again, right here I have the stuff
that we are going to need for cleaning. We

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.750
got a can of compress air. Over here I have
a mild solution of mild dish detergent and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.700
water. Make sure that you diluted properly.
First off, we are going to clean the keyboard.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:41.190
I'm going to use a piece just a piece of paper
towel. What I'm going to do is dab it a little

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.310
bit here just to moisten it up. Okay, normally
most keyboards are white so with a whiter

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.190
keyboard you see a lot of stains and grind
around the keyboard but since this is black

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.690
you would not see that much. But this is what
you do you could other you have a choice using

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.190
other this soap and water solution or you
could use a anti static spray or towelette.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.300
For this one I'm going to use soap and water.
Just rub against the keyboard like that. See

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:42.270
just rub the surface of the keyboard. There
you go. Okay. Next thing you are going to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.270
do make sure you clean the keys to wipe a
little bit especially if it is white you could

00:01:46.270 --> 00:02:02.170
see a lot of stains and grind. Okay. Next
thing that you are going to do is take a can

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.009
of compress air. Turn the keyboard like this
so all the dirt beneath the keys would fall

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:17.019
out. Take the can make sure that it is up
right. Spray in between the keys. Using short

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:42.210
blows. Okay there you have it that is how
simple it is folks. That is how you clean

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.229
your keyboards.
