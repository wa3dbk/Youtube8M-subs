00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.870
As if my brain didn’t hurt enough this Monday
morning, I had to deal with fixing the station’s

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.930
Famicom (I think Derek mistook it for an oddly-shaped
toaster) and covering some classic import

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.290
titles.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.800
Which would normally be fine... if it wasn’t
for the inherent confusion of such an enterprise,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.580
redoubled by it being a Monday morning.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.140
For whatever reason, some Namco materials
drop the Y in Wagyan, despite it being right

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.210
there in the title.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.690
For that matter, some Namco materials spell
Namco with a T, a strange quirk of Famicom-era

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.680
gaming for which I’ve yet to hear a convincing
explanation.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.780
Some say it was to separate Namco arcade games
from Namcot-with-a-T home console games.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.610
Some say it was for their collaborations with
Data East or other developers... which explains

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.860
why there’s no T in Namco on the box art
for Chojiku Yousai Macross, but there is on

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.820
Wagyan Land, but... wait, there is on Tower
of Druaga...

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.320
AAAGH MONDAYS

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:23.860
Thankfully, Wagyan Land (that’s how Felicity
in Worcestershire wrote it, and that’s how

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.670
the Kacho pronounced it, so that’s how I’m
gonna roll) is a fairly benign platformer,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.270
allaying the fears I had given that... well,
it’s a Namco-published Famicom game from

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.330
‘89, which means it should rightly be praying
for my death.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.070
Instead, it feels much more like a kid’s
game, almost... too much... wait, this isn’t

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.149
edutainment, is it?

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.510
No, no, it’s just a cute platformer, with
a mechanical dinosaur shouting at enemies

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.510
to stun them.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.649
You can’t actually destroy oncoming hostiles
- not until you get equipped with the SUPER

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.840
WAGYANIZER halfway through the game- but you
can freeze them into inaction and even use

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.950
them as steps.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.460
By collecting the little Wagyan icons distributed
throughout the courses, you can power up your

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.280
voice, turning your initial piddly little
“wa-” into a more emphatic “Gya-”

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.300
into a trouser-soaking “GA-” into a world-rending,
sanity-imploding “GYA-”...

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.100
All of which just improves projectile size
and stun duration.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.260
But get a fourth power-up, and Wagyan there
goes into hyperdrive, turning invincible and

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.630
gaining a significant bonus to movement speed.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.490
Ain’t no one who can stand in his way...

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.370
except for bosses, who - in a stark contrast
to the rest of the game - stop down all the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.220
action and challenge the player to a VOCABULARY
EXERCISE.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.069
Yes, rather than epic boss fights, you’re
challenged to word-chain contests.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.470
Did I mention it’s Monday?

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.790
And that I might’ve been slacking on my
vocab practice?

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.170
And that some of these pictures might have
two readings, depending on how much of a jerk

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.569
the computer feels like being?

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.600
You’re at a bit of a disadvantage from the
jump, compounded by the fact that it’s in

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600
a foreign language.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.830
Not every boss results in a word game, though;
some prefer Concentration battles (which are

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.750
usually too easy since the board is mirrored
somehow and easy to predict).

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.290
I knew it.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.840
It IS edutainment.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.760
And it’s actually pretty darn fun.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.849
The physics are bit shaky, so don’t come
in expecting Mega Man levels of platforming

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.650
accuracy, but if you feel the need to break
up your language practice with video games

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.200
- and who doesn’t - Wagyan Land is there
for you.
