00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:03.770
Man 1: Oh, yeah.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.819
Instructor: That was a sinker pitch.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.849
It ends up down in the dirt because it looks
like a fast ball that drops off the table

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:13.849
right at the end.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.880
In a way, it's the opposite of a riser.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.420
It's different from a curve ball, so instead
of a curve ball, it's going to break down.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.390
A sinker is going to come in and just drop.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.060
So, it's just going to come in, straight in,
drop.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.890
And this is because opposite of riser you're
going the holes on top, the solid part on

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.680
bottom, and the spin is going to be coming
like this.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.190
So it's going to create higher pressure on
top, low on the bottom, which, with enough

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.100
rotation, literally the air comes out from
under it and it just drops.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.710
So instead of breaking it just drops.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.920
So let's break it down on the grip.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.770
So, just take it, do exactly.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.210
. . Imagine this seam around.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.510
Two fingers, same basic grip as every other
pitch.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.860
Line it up.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.530
Don't let the knuckle touch, but you're going
to have the holes facing towards the sky,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.190
facing straight up.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.190
Alright.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.930
Now the key with the sinker is the delivery
is going to be a little funky.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.810
It's going to be almost three quarter to the
side, so when you end up, imagine you want

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.790
to create a spinning top like this.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.140
So you want the ball to be moving like this,
alright?

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.770
So if you throw overhand you'll just end up
throwing a weird half slider that doesn't

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.870
really work, it's just going to hang there.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:47.290
So to create the sinker, do it to the side,
and we're going to flick it so that the ball,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.410
so that the holes are still facing up the
entire time.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.000
So that's the goal when you're practicing.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Alright.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Alright.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.729
That's the sinker.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.039
That one's a little higher than I wanted it.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.479
You can see it goes in, dives down.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.550
Man 1: Dives to the bottom.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.220
Instructor: Alright, that covers specialty
pitches, but there's more to whiffle ball

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.770
than just pitching.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.000
There's the flipside, the hitting.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.090
Man 1: Hitting.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.030
Instructor: We've shown you all these pitches.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.060
You can imagine a pitcher pitching you these
pitches.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.320
You've got to be able to hit them to win.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.940
So let's go over here to the batting box and
cover the hitting.
