00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.000
On the night of January 28, 1981,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.440
the L.A. City Fire Department 
Task Force 60 in North Hollywood

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.580
responded to a structure fire at a restaurant.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.300
There was four of us up on the roof.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.780
And all of a sudden i heard a big and i felt a big shake,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.180
and I looked back and 
the roof just dropped from the north side.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.640
Here’s the parapet, here’s the roof

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.020
and it went just like that.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.300
This particular fire changed the course of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.820
a lot of people’s lives because

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.880
it was set by an arsonist

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.780
and it took the life of one of our own brothers, L.A. City apparatus operator Thomas Taylor, that night

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.640
I could hear him yelling, i knew he was in big trouble,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.560
and one of the guys that had scrambled up the aerial when they knew what happened,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.220
he reached down his hand and he couldn’t hang on to it.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.440
It was just too much weight and the gloves were all wet,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.680
and he dropped and that was it.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.460
A captain met me

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.520
on the apparatus floor and said

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.160
I’d like for you to come to the office.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.840
They said there’s been an accident

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.280
and your brother’s involved.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760
I finally pressed this one captain that I know,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.900
"Just don’t sugar coat this thing. Is he dead or not?"

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.380
And he goes, "Yeah, he’s dead."

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.860
So it was

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.680
a real bad day.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.660
To kill an L.A. City firefighter or any firefighter for that matter due to arson ... due to a crime

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.740
It just seems to take it to another level.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.760
A guy named Mario Catanio did it.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.500
I mean he actually lit the fire. He was contracted.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.120
This restaurant was failing.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.180
They were losing money. It was costing them $4,000 a month to keep it open.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.700
They gave him $2,500 and the keys to the restaurant

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.260
and he says parting that evening,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.140
“Tomorrow you won’t be 
in the restaurant business anymore.”

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.280
In my opinion, he’s a hired assassin. That’s all he is.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.360
He got 25 to Life and 
he started going to parole hearings in 2004.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.440
He wasn’t even at the 25-year mark. 
He was at the minimum.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.100
Coming up on June 28th (2013) there’ll be a parole hearing in Blythe at Chuckwalla Valley State Prison.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.300
We’re urging you to please write a letter to the Parole Board urging them to keep Mario Catanio behind bars.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.760
They’ve convicted three arsonists 
in the last couple of years where people had died

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.040
They’re getting the death penalty, and Mario didn’t.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.260
He’s nowhere near, in my book of serving his time.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.340
He affected so many lives.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.280
Tom Taylor is dead.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.800
Two boys ended up without a father.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.400
A wife without a husband.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.420
A brother and father broken hearted.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.840
We want to send a message to other arsonists that firefighters don’t forget.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.060
That firefighters band together

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.060
and will always come through for one another.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.920
We’ve got to make dire consequences for the people that commit these acts.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.960
They’re going to have to pay for their sins.
