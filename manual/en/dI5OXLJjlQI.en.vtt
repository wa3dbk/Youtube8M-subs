00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.709
We're going to talk a little bit about the
differences between traditional French braid

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:14.469
and then what I would call a reverse French
braid, also known as a Dutch braid or an inside

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.469
out braid.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.550
The main difference is the French braid, when
you're braiding the hair all of the braid

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.990
is inside of the hair and you can just see
the seams almost to the braid.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.189
With the Dutch braid or the inside out braid,
the braid is on the top of the hair.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.890
You can see the braid; you can see where it
folds under and all of that.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.059
So we're going to start and I'm going to show
you how to do just the French braid.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.829
The funny thing about it is we all know how
to do one type so you may not have ever known

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.199
that the other existed but it does.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.500
So we're broadening our skills.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.890
So I'm going to take a section of hair here
in the front and we're doing just a French

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.760
braid so I'm going to break it into three
sections.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.370
They all start off the same.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.600
When you're doing it a French braid what makes
it an actually French braid is your outside

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.360
sections you're actually pulling it over the
top of your center section and vice versa.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.480
So top goes over, bottom goes over the middle
section and you'll do that the whole way.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.000
And the bottom will go over the top in the
middle and then the top goes over the top

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.420
of the middle strand.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.080
So now I'm going to pick up a little bit of
hair here.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.810
And I'm going to go over the top of that middle
strand.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.210
So now you're going to take a section from
the top and incorporate it in your top braid

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.390
and you're going to cross it over the center.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:02:03.240
So we're just incorporating over the center.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.050
Incorporating over the center.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.650
Incorporating over the center keeping our
braid tight as we go along.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.989
Incorporating over the center.

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.120
So the reason you would choose to do a traditional
French braid would be if you wanted to keep

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.200
the braid really flat and tight against the
side of the head.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.720
Sometimes we like to do this if we want to
exaggerate the shape another part of the hair

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.720
style.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.879
So maybe you would keep it really flat and
then you would have this big toss and play

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
on the other side that would keep this really
flat to the head.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.250
Or maybe you would have it really flat and
then you could kind of do a bouffant, top

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.459
hat, or something fun with a larger shape.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.819
It's just an interesting way to kind of play
up shapes.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.000
You would also do this type maybe if you wanted
to do some smaller braids on the side of the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.890
head like cornrows style.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:11.909
Now I've incorporated from the bottom and
then over the top of this strand.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:20.939
Last section, over the top of that middle
strand, so now I'm out of sections so I will

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.560
just continue braiding down the hair.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.370
And sometimes when we talk about a French
braid or an upside down French braid the biggest

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.590
way is how you hold your hands and you can
see that pretty clearly with how you braid

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.169
just a regular braid.

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.319
So I'm going over the top, over the top, over
the top.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.170
If I were doing the other one it would be
underneath and you would really see that clearly.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.930
Put a clear rubber band at the top to secure
the ponytail.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.759
So this is the French braid.
