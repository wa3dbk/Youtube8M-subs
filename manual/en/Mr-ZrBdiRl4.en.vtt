00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.360
(Music)

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.390
(Music continuing)

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.300
Okay.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360
(Tires screeching)

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.000
(Engine revving)

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.750
(Tires screeching)

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.480
(Engine revving)

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.510
That's power.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.690
That's great throttle response.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.720
A pure shot of adrenalin,
right there.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.030
Beautiful.
Absolutely beautiful.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.360
Amazing!

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.480
(Engine revving)

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.780
(Tires screeching)

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.570
MAN:
The car is fast.
The steering is fast.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.000
You really have to be ready
for the next turn.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.690
Lots of power
in the corners.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.150
Really flat turning.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.060
That's awesome.
That's a great drive.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.870
My driving partner
is car sick.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.300
(Laughing)

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.360
Handles good; it's tight.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.060
It steers sharp;
the breaking is great.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.270
I'm really impressed.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.000
I don't get to do this
at home.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.180
(Tires screeching)

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.810
You know what?
I could have gone harder.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.570
Love it.
Lots of fun; good handling.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.630
Excellent. Very agile.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.840
(Engine revving)

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.210
(Music)

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.180
Kind of hard to do this
and not have fun.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.420
Everybody is loving it.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.660
Hi!

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.150
Feeling good.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.000
MAN:
This is an STI, after all.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.360
It's a rally-bred machine.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.600
So, it rips.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.060
(Engine gunning)

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.420
It was so fun!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.300
I love that car.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.600
I think I'm going to have to go
to the dealer on Monday.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.000
It's the definition of
confidence in motion.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.660
It'll take you there.
It's awesome.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.090
It's awesome.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.480
Can't resist- I'm going again.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.660
(Tires screeching)

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.570
This is too much fun
to explain right now.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.180
