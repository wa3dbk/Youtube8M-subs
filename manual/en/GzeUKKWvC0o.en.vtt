00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.639
If you are like most doctors you've probably heard something
about a government incentive program

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:10.490
encouraging physicians to implement electronic
health records,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.279
however you're probably a little fuzzy on the details.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:18.400
Well,you're not alone the let's take a closer look
and see if we can help you make sense of it all.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.830
On February seventeenth two thousand nine,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.619
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.450
also known as the Stimulus Package

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.929
was signed by President Obama into law.  

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.020
Contained within it's pages is new legislation
known as the Health Information Technology

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.790
for Economic and Clinical Help Act

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.330
That's a mouthful so we'll just call it the HITECH Act.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.730
So what exactly is the HITECH Act;

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.210
and how does it affect you, a physician?

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.600
Well very simply it uses financial incentives
to encourage physicians to adopt Certified Electronic

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.850
Health Records

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.770
or EHRs.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.070
Through the increased use of EHRs the government
hopes to achieve the goal of a national health

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.979
information network

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.840
that will result in improved quality of care,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.290
patient safety and lower costs.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.680
What kind of financial incentives are we talking
about here?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.990
Perhaps as much as thirty four

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.660
billion dollars.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.390
So now you're probably asking yourself

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.850
two questions.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.980
One, how do I qualify for this money?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.770
And two, just how much of that thirty four billion is 
available to me?

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.410
Well the answers to both of these questions
are actually quite simple.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.100
To qualify for a piece of the HITECH money

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.880
there are two things you will need to do.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.240
First

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.510
your practice must purchase and use a government
certified EHR.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.980
Secondly

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.340
your practice will need to demonstrate

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.850
meaningful use of this EHR.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.250
This means that you will have to prove to the government

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.150
that the EHR is being properly implemented

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.490
according to their criteria.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.420
This criteria is detailed in a list of twenty five
requirements issued by the Department of Health

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.609
and Human Services.

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.640
It is broken down into two sets of objectives
and measures;

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.070
a core set 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.870
and a menu set.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.950
A core set consists of fifteen

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.909
non-negotiable objectives

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.389
that all physicians must comply with.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.249
In the menu set however,

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.979
providers are free to choose five items from
among a menu of ten to implement.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:26.129
In all this means physicians must meet twenty total objectives in order to demonstrate

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.639
meaningful use.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.849
Fail to meet even one of these meaningful use requirements

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.599
and you become ineligible for the incentives.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.399
Now that you know how to qualify,

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:41.299
let's find out how much of that thirty four
billion you can get your hands on.

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.250
The answer to this depends on which incentive
program you're eligible for.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.499
HITECH provides two separate programs,

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:48.749
one for Medicare

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.499
and one for Medicaid.

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.990
With Medicare physicians can earn up to seventy
five percent

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.010
of their Medicare allowable charges

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.930
up to a maximum of forty four thousand dollars.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.150
With Medicaid

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.200
close to sixty four thousand is available to physicians

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.799
who see more than thirty percent of Medicaid
patients.

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.849
That number is reduced to twenty percent if you're a
pediatrician.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.390
Keep in mind

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.879
this incentive is for each eligible provider within a practice.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.430
For example;

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.180
have five providers on the Medicaid program and your practice can receive up to three hundred

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.739
and twenty thousand dollars in incentive funds.
Unfortunately though the

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.430
HITECH Act is not just about handing
out free money.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.160
Delay

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.489
or even decide not to implement a certified EHR

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.149
and you will be penalized.

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:41.949
Not only will you lose out on the incentives,

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.420
but the government will also begin decreasing your
reimbursement rates

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.139
by as early as twenty twelve.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.699
So as you can see at its core the HITECH Act
is not that complicated at all.

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.739
Simply purchase and use a government certified EHR,

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.749
meet all the meaningful use requirements

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.879
and you'll be eligible for the HITECH incentives.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.459
And on a final note beaware of the fact that commercial insurance carriers are

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.440
already talking about jumping on the meaningful use bandwagon

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.340
and requiring providers to meet the same criteria

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.179
for their pay for performance programs.

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:18.209
Hopefully this has given you a clear understanding
of the HITECH Act

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.679
and what it means to you and your practice.

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:23.910
Over the next several years EHRs will
change the way

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.080
we as health providers keep patient records.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.659
Change is coming fast;

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.460
act now to make sure that you don't miss out on your
portion of the HITECH money.
