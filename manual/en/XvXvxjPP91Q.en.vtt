00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.740
So in this clip I'd like to show you how to
do what's called feather marbling. So feather

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.990
marbling is a very messy technique. So what
we're going to do, and normally you would

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.350
try this over a sink, but today I just sort
of put out some paper towels for myself so

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.370
I don't smear my table with paint. So the
whole thing with feather marbling is basically

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.640
taking wet paint, taking two colors, having
it wet, sort of drenching your piece and actually

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.430
shaking the piece into its marbling. So it's
playing with the movement of the paint itself.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.719
So what you normally do is take about 2 different
colors, although you can use more, and what

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.910
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to be
drizzling the paint onto whatever you wanted

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.729
to marble. And then picking it up and actually
shaking it and moving it. So let's get started.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.629
So what we're going to do is I'm going to
take a white and a blue. That's what I've

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.859
chosen to marble with today. And I'm literally
going to pour the paint in no particular order

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.420
onto my tile. And then go right ahead with
my 2nd color and sort of try to fill in areas

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.390
that I missed. So now comes the messy part.
So now we have a load of paint on our piece

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:28.410
and all I'm going to do is I'm going to start
to tip it and run it and shake it. And then

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:36.890
we're going to end up getting some really
neat marbling. And if you've got to much color,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.950
like I think I have a little too much blue
and I'd love to throw a little bit more white

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.880
in there. So all I'm going to do is I'm going
to add a little bit more white to the top

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.369
and then just shake the piece down and then
you'll sort of get all these nice little drifts.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.520
And you can sort of play with the drifts and
rock it back and forth. And go back and add

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:09.800
some more if you want to create some new sort
of shapes. And then you sort of find little

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.220
drifts and little marbling that you like.
And then you can sort of leave it whenever

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.220
you want. Another thing you can do when you're
feather marbling is actually taking a pin

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:28.180
and sort of drawing into, just like food artists
do. All I'm going to do is I'm going to work

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.120
with these swirls a little bit more. Creating
more defined shapes. And this does create

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.940
really neat texture. And this will actually
keep during the firing. A lot of people ask

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.870
me when they're doing feather marbling, if
it will actually stay because some paints

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.340
do change while they're being fired. But this
does hold up remarkably well. So all I'm doing

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.400
is just almost like a little fire works sort
of design here. And then I'm just going to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.620
pull the other way. And that's how we feather
marble.
