Hi I'm Amelia and on behalf of expertvillage.com
I'll be talking about using thermal styling

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.980
tools. The really popular look for spring
and summer has been the beach wave look that

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.689
sought of tousled really bundled hair that
looks like you could of spend a day at the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.439
beach and didn't wash the salt water out.
How to get that on my favorite tool for that

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:30.300
is really the flat iron again you just twist
and pull and this time you want those curls

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.550
to be a little looser you want them more on
the lower half. And you don't have to do your

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.510
whole head because it's not suppose to look
uniform that?s the last thing in the world

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.110
you want is for it to look perfect. So you
just grab your sections kind of move around

00:00:48.110 --> 00:01:00.870
the head
just adding wave more or less to the ends

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.659
just make sure that you got your thermal protestant
in there and you can have the hair go in different

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.130
directions to. Because your trying to make
this look like a natural looking wave so it

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:20.240
doesn't look like you worked on it. It's amazing
work we go through to make it look like we

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:33.229
didn't do any work at all. Now you can do
this with a curling iron I would choose a

00:01:33.229 --> 00:02:10.729
larger barrel curling iron

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.660
just make sure that when ever you do curl
it with a flat iron you always use your finger

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.540
and sought of finish that curl off because
sometimes they can be a little lazy if you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:34.659
wrap it around your finger you can get a little
bit more action and have it,

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.260
and I'm taking pretty big sections and I'm
really just, again just trying to get a real

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.709
not uniformed tousled look because what?s
really going to finish it off is the product

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.350
you used. Your going to want a product that?s
going to really help kind of bundle these

00:02:49.350 --> 00:03:00.379
curls together add some separation and some
shine

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.800
I'm just picking up random pieces as I go,
some I'm doing a little tighter some a little

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:19.550
looser, and if you don't like how one is done
go back and re-do it. It doesn't need to be

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:28.630
perfect
and I'm leaving a lot of her ends out because

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.239
they've already gotten nice movement to them
naturally so I really don't need to do a lot

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:52.330
of work with them. So now I'm going to go
in with a styling cream

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:03.909
and I'm also going defy it in my hands a little
goes along way and I scrunch it in. And you?re

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:38.440
looking for that messy bed head "see" Lauren
looks like she could have just come off the

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.850
beach.
