your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today I am

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.260
going to show you aloo mutter samosa you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.240
know this is a very basic samosa it is

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.060
available all over the greatest is the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.859
simplicity and the flavors and the taste

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.380
that go into it very simple very tasty

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.480
you can eat lot of these samosas in one

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.940
go because they are so delicious so for

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.190
this first we are going to make the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.559
masala to make the masala always add

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.920
less oil not more so just add  little

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.280
bit of oil and when the oil is slightly

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.559
hot we are going to add  little bit of

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.870
cumin seeds in this we're going to add

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.710
finely chopped green chilli yes little

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.379
extra for me in this we're going to add green

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.120
peas okay also add salt pinch of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.270
turmeric in this we're going to add

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.330
coriander powder, chopped coriander,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.900
little bit of chili powder and pinch of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.270
garam masala this is optional okay and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.009
once you add this just toss this you

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.380
want this masala to be slightly roasted

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
like this that is when your samosas will

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.350
be nice and flavorful in this add boiled

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.329
and mashed potato okay so making this

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.970
aloo masala samosa is so simple and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.860
we're going to make many variations

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.100
there are kala masala samosa,  potatoes

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.960
that are fried and made even the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.820
Bengalis make it differently the samosas

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.950
in Kerala are different in Maharashtra

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.140
again their flavors are different so we're

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.810
going to learn all of them but this is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.670
the basic samosas if you have seen

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.770
earlier i have also added samosa

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.049
masala, ginger garlic paste it is up to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.689
you you know how you want to do it but

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.399
this one is very simple and tasty now in

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.829
the last they're going to switch off the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.739
flame then squeeze in little bit of lime

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.900
juice and one more thing is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.120
whenever you boil the potatoes remove the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.829
potatoes when they are fully done and

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.189
when the water is hot if you let this

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.980
potato sit in that water moisture will

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.019
be absorbed by the potatoes and you will

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.599
have very mashy potatoes and that's not

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.150
really good for making good samosas you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.970
want very well cooked potatoes and the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.459
potatoes have to be dry now the masala

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.000
is all ready but making the dough for the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.730
samosas is also very important so let me

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.290
show you how to make that, now i am going

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.049
to make this by taking around 300 grams

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.810
of flour in this for the flavoring i am

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.049
going to add ajwain in the dough ok

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.450
there are  couple of variety of doughs

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.670
people make some people like to add

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.549
cumin seeds that is jeera but you know

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.700
ajwain is the most popular flavoring and in

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.540
this add right amount of salt in the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.569
sheet now make a well and pour around

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.349
100 grams of vegetable shortening oil or

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.829
ghee whatever you want to make now add

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.680
water and make it a stiff dough that is

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.209
like puri dough not like chapati, chapati

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.730
is very soft the poori is a tighter

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.139
dough so we are going to add water and

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.169
we are going to make the dough now the

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.959
dough is ready all you do is just take a

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.959
clean wrap or a cloth and just wrap it

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.650
and after resting it for you know 30

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.940
minutes we are going to make the samosas.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.519
Once you rest the dough divide them into

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.829
the portions you want if you want bigger

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.840
samosas you may have to take bigger

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.810
portions if you want small samosas take

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.900
it lemon size because each dough you

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.930
will be able to make two samosas now

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.239
roll it first little bit rounds okay for

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.909
rolling the poori's or samosa dough you

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.280
never have to use flour because if you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.989
use flour first thing oil spoils and

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.930
you know if you use the right amount of

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.720
shortening in the dough then you will be

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.539
able to roll the sheet easily look at

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.820
this first make it slightly round and

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.450
then now make it elongated like egg

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.950
shape make it slightly

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.070
thinner look at this once you roll it and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.410
you will be able to see kind of

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.620
literally the bottom little bit that is

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.440
when you cut like this and you have the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.320
dough ready for two samosas got it now

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.510
the masala is ready the sheets are ready

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.640
so take a sheet just make sure you apply

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.750
water on all sides okay only the edges

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.160
we do not need anything in the center

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.580
that making samosa is no big art very

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.550
simple just make sure the top overlaps

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.290
okay like this and meets at the center

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.370
okay now look at this perfect now take

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.590
the potato masala which ever one you

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.410
know I made this lil bit spicy but you

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.170
can make it  little bit milder too okay

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.960
one important thing is just press the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.230
masala then start folding it from one

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.570
side then fold it next okay like this

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.840
okay see the overlap look at this we

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.360
call them sitting buddha samosas because

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.870
the fold and then the shape on top so

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.800
this is your awesome looking samosas so

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.410
make bunch of them and fry it and the

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.200
beauty is you can put the samosas on a

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.330
plate put in the fridge and fry it only

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.700
when your guests arrive lot of people

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.890
think shaping the samosas is an art

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.410
for me frying the samosas at the right

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.750
temperature is art do not fry them at a

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.320
hot oil you know make it medium hot when

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.450
the samosa is dropped that is how it

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.120
should be the slowly the bubbles have to

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.610
start coming up that is when your oil is

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.250
perfect and you will be able to fry

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.580
samosas okay if you fry the samosas in

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.830
really hot oil the color will come but

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.740
you want to get the nice the bite the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.810
samosa bite it is not the shortcrust

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.120
bite it is not kachori bite it is the

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.580
samosa bite when you get that that is

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.440
when your samosas will be perfect don't

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.870
you worry just let the samosas get

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.460
coloring slowly thats when they will

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.290
come out really really good I told you

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.300
frying is an art but make

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.569
sure you get the samosas correct color

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.580
and when you start frying them at a

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.190
little bit lower temperature then the

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.470
samosas will get even coloring so now

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.240
you know high temperature uneven

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.940
coloring and not that crispiness slow

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.139
start from a little bit lower

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.180
temperature even coloring and they're

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.879
nice khasta that is crispy, the beauty of

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.069
a well fried samosa is look at the bite

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:11.099
the bite means it has to be crispy but

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.229
the bite has to go inside just like this

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.090
it should not the dough should not

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.479
stretch even a bit that is when you have

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.310
a perfect samosa dough look at this

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:31.680
