00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.734
(Jan Ward) I'm Jan Ward and this
is my husband Dan, and we're the

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:07.633
primary caregivers for my
mother Lila Crutchfield.

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:12.467
(Delana McNac) The husband died
when I was still his chaplain

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:15.600
and when I left the
hospice sometime later

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.133
his wife was diagnosed
with terminal cancer

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.400
and became a hospice
patient herself.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.066
(Jan Ward) My mother
spoiled those dogs.

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.400
She was their mom.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.033
They were literally her life.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:31.166
(Dan Ward) When she really
started to deteriorate she

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:35.867
expected Jan to give them the
attention that she gave them.

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:38.633
And not only was she trying
to care for her mother

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.700
but was expected to do
these special things

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.300
the dogs got all the time.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.367
(Delana McNac) There actually
came a point in time when they

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:51.333
were considering finding
the pets another home.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.867
I think that would have
been devastating for her.

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:58.133
My name is Rev. Delana Taylor
McNac and I am deacon with

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.066
Haikey Chapel Indian
United Methodist Church

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.900
here in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.734
I started the Pet Peace of Mind
Program back in 2007 because I

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:14.300
saw a need for trying to help
patients and pets stay together

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.266
during the time a terminally-ill
patient is on hospice.

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:21.867
(Jan Ward) And she said.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.900
"Now, what's going to
happen when I die?"

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.600
And I said. "What do you mean
what's going to happen?"

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.100
I said. 'You're going to go to
heaven and you know we'll

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.066
see you someday."
She goes.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.600
"You know what I mean. I'm
talking about my dogs."

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.033
(Delana McNac) ...so the hospice
brought the dogs from an

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.934
adjoining town and
would take them every
day to come visit her.

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.700
(Jan Ward) They were there the
day before she passed away.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.066
They were so comforting to her.

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.967
She knew that her dogs
were taken care of

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:50.967
and she really appreciated that.

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:54.467
I could not have done what
I done for my mother,

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:56.633
provided the level of care, if I
would not have had them

00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:00.066
and the Pet Peace of Mind
program involved in helping

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.700
take care of her dogs."

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.300
(Delana McNac) One of the things
that I tell our new hospice

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.633
coordinators about is how
important pets are to children

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.066
in the homes of
hospice patients.

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:15.567
A case in point is a family
with a single mom and her

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:17.600
eight-year-old son named Brady.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.967
(Brady) Grandpa's been sick and
he has just been sleeping

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:25.967
in his room all day.

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:29.000
(Mom) Dad was in the hospital
doing really bad and the doctors

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.066
said hospice is
going to talk to you.

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.667
And I was like, "Oh really."

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:34.367
(Brady) He has
like "Six months."

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:37.734
I heard, "Yeah" and so it
just feels kind of sad.

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:41.367
(Delana McNac) The stress of
being a full-time caregiver,

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.367
that's a lot for an
eight-year-old to manage.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:46.266
But fortunately they
have a cat named Lucas.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.867
(Brady) My cat's not
like any other cat.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.667
If I feel sad then he
comes up and plays with me

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:54.333
and makes me feel happy again.

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:58.066
(Mom) He just seems to sense
that Dad's not feeling well.

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:00.533
And he always seems like he
wants to be in there with him,

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:04.400
looking after him
in a funny way.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.033
(Brady) Since I can't always be
here, because I got school,

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:13.367
I like how he just goes in there
and just lays with Grandpa

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:14.967
since I can't.

00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:19.367
(Delana McNac) And so Brady's
mother Donna was faced with how

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.433
to care for this cat that
meant so much to her son.

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:26.233
(Donna) He was at an age where
he needed to be neutered.

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:28.967
And it was something
I definitely had to consider and

00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:30.867
I was trying to figure out, how
am I going to get this done?

00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:33.667
If anybody out there knows what
it's like to have a pet they

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:37.233
know those things are not, they
can be expensive especially

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:39.533
when you're on a
strained budget.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:42.433
(Delana McNac) Pet Peace of
Mind came into the situation and

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:45.934
offered to have the cat
neutered and up to date on his

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:49.533
vaccinations so that they would
be assured he was healthy.

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:53.433
(Donna) So it's been a
huge burden lifted

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.066
throughout out this time.

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:58.100
(Delana McNac) His antics
lighten up the room.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.033
You would almost be able to
forget for a while that there

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:03.166
was going to be a
loss in that home.

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:05.166
(Brady) It would just be really
hard to live without him.

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:09.967
(Delana McNac) Hospice patients
unfortunately find themselves

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:12.767
having to deal with
everybody else's reaction

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:14.600
to their illness.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.066
People come to visit them who
are actively grieving

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:20.600
and the patient is put into a
position where they have to be

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.867
the one to comfort people.

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:27.767
So, to have someone in their
lives who doesn't respond to

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:31.900
that, who treats them the same
as they always have, who doesn't

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.467
care if they are having a
good day or a bad day,

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:37.467
is a very important spiritual
and emotional resource

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:40.033
for a dying patient.

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:43.233
What we want to do is help
hospices see that pets

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:45.300
are part of the family.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.967
We have in mind changing the
face of hospice care

00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:50.533
in the same way that our
culture has changed.

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:53.567
So that when people consider
pets important

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:57.133
to their well being, that
hospices understand that

00:04:57.133 --> 00:05:02.500
and have the resources that
they need to make that happen.
