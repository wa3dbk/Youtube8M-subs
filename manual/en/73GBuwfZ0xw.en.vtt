00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.330
I'm Rich Harris, and welcome back to my Simply
Gourmet series, where I'll be showing you

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.620
how to take the fear out of entertaining,
and take your dinner parties to the next level.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.690
In this episode I'm showing you how to make
a luxurious goat's cheese mousse, with a warm

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.840
pickled beetroot salad.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.190
[Music]

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.369
So the first thing I need to do is whisk up
some egg whites.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.350
So I've got two egg whites and a pinch of
salt.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.890
I need to whisk those to stiff peaks.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.180
That's what we're looking for, nice, stiff
peaks that hold up really, really well.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.070
So just scrape those into a bowl.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.330
So into our mixing bowl I've got 200 grams
of soft goat's cheese.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.899
Make sure you use the rindless goat's cheese,
it's nice and soft and smooth, and to that

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.610
I'm adding a hundred mills of double cream.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.649
For a full list of ingredients, check the
description box.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.100
I'm just going to whisk that nice and slowly,
just so the cream and goat's cheese are combined

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.460
and nice and smooth.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.949
As they start to combine you can whisk a little
bit harder.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.999
So now that those are combined, we need to
add some milk.

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:13.009
I've got some milk just gently warming on
the stove, and to this I'm going to add a

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.200
sheet of gelatin, and that's going to help
to set the mousse, and also to set and trap

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.399
all the air that we're going to keep in there.

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.450
Just one leaf of gelatin that's been soaking
in cold water for about ten minutes.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.329
Squeeze out the excess moisture, add it to
the milk, and just give it a gentle swirl

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.029
around, just to melt that gelatin into the
milk.

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:36.039
I'm just going to pour that in with the goat's
cheese and cream,

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.619
and just whisk again, nice and slowly.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950
So that's what we're looking for, nice and
smooth.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.529
I'm just going to add the goat's cheese, about
a third at a time.

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:50.279
First though we're going to really beat it.

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:53.719
Fold the egg whites in a third at a time,
keeping in as much air as possible, to give

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.340
it a really nice light goat cheese mousse.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.919
So the egg whites are folded in.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.789
It's really luxurious and smooth.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.939
All that's left to do is pour it into a bowl
and transfer it to the fridge for about an

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.929
hour to an hour and a half, just to chill
until set.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.040
Now to go with the Goat's Cheese Mousse, I'm
going to a do a really simple warm Pickled

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.530
Beetroot Salad.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.069
So I've got some shop bought cooked beetroot,
and that just needs to be cut into diced cubes.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.290
Because this is such a simple dish, we want
to keep everything looking really pretty,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.890
so just chop the rest of the beetroot into
nice, even cubes.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.680
So now that our beetroot is ready we need
to heat up some sugar and sherry vinegar in

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.680
a pan.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.569
Sherry vinegar and beetroot are a match made
in heaven, really nice and sweet but sharp

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.569
as well.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.250
I just need plenty of sherry vinegar, and
a spoonful of sugar.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.080
You can always adjust the flavors to taste.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.030
A pinch of salt,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.370
and then add the beetroot.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.660
As the beetroot is already cooked, it just
needs warming through, so just cook gently

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.150
for a couple of minutes and then strain the
beetroot off,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.040
and then pour the liquid back into the pan,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.219
and just reduce it for another couple of minutes
until it's really nice and sticky.

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.709
When you're cooking out vinegar like this,
it can be quite potent, but don't worry, it

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.230
will taste great against the goat's cheese.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.450
So that's what we're looking for.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.019
So just reduce the heat and set aside.

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.430
So the goats cheese mousse has set nice and
firm, and is going to be really light and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.040
smooth and creamy.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.120
I've also made some little croutons: all I've
done is slice half of a baguette, brushed

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.140
it with a bit of oil, and baked it in the
oven until it's nice and crisp.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.819
So to our warm beetroot, we just need to add
some tarragon.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.230
This is something you want to do right at
the last minute because the warmth of the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.730
beetroot will actually wilt the leaves of
the tarragon.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.040
Because this is such a simple dish and there
are some really vibrant colors, we want everything

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.599
to sing on the plate.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.969
So when plating up, we need to make it look
as good as we can.

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:07.580
So just take a small bit of goat cheese mousse,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.060
take one of the croutons, and that will stick
it in place.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.650
Then take a hot spoon and just drag it through
the goat's cheese mousse, and sit it on top.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.570
Add another crouton,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.010
and then just a nice little spoonful of our
beetroot.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.810
And now just a little bit of watercress for
an extra bit of color,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.139
and finally, some of that nice reduction we
made on there.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.180
So there you have it: my Goat's Cheese Mousse
with Warm PIckled Beetroot and Watercress.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.680
If you've enjoyed this recipe, I hope to see
you back in the kitchen again soon for another

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:53.780
episode of my Simply Gourmet Series.
