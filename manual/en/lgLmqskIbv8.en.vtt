Hey Guys! Welcome to Inspire to Cook!

00:00:01.884 --> 00:00:05.189
Today we are going to combine some milk with some Nutella

00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:08.811
I am going to show you how to make Nutella Hot Chocolate

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:11.295
Nutella Hot Chacolate really doesn't need much introduction

00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:16.168
Whether you need a midday pick-me-up, or you need some comfort drink

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.500
Let's do it!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.037
I am going to show you how to make one cup, if you need 2 or 3, just multiply the proportions

00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:24.230
and you should be good to go

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.980
you really don't need to much for this: just one cup of milk

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:29.891
the nutella or any hazelnut cream

00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:33.051
I am also going to use some cinnamon and marshmallows 

00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:36.166
small marshmallows, I actually chopped up the larger ones

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.376
and you can substitute them with some weep cream

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:42.081
Of course we are going to need the "кастрюля", a pan to warm it up in

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:43.763
and a cup to put it in when it's ready

00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:48.159
first thing we'll do is we'll turn up the heat to medium - medium/low

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.447
you can start with medium

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:51.424
and then switch it up with low as we go

00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:53.354
we are gong to pour in the milk in the pan

00:00:54.886 --> 00:00:57.846
and we are going to start mixing it right away

00:00:58.252 --> 00:00:59.372
as its warming up

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.761
Our milk warmed up some so

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.537
our recipe calls for one table spoon of nutella

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:06.961
well, we can't violate it so

00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:08.677
I just like it a little bit sweater

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:14.032
And I will put one but a large table spoon of nutella

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:16.355
and we will continue mixing it

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.300
Well, our milk starts getting a color of chocolate

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.900
And I will share the secret: you can share with the temperature that you like

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.258
and pour it in the cup

00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:28.845
but what I will do is actually...

00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:32.140
warm it up to the point until the milk will start rising

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.218
when we'll p[ick it up from the cook top, the milk will be so much more creamier and so much more hot chocolaty like

00:01:38.218 --> 00:01:42.120
as you see the milk becomes much fluffier so it's about time it will start rising

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.939
you can actually hear it's starts boiling a ltttle bit

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.058
you see? it starts coming up a littl

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:49.275
so you can pick it up and mix it

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.003
it became very reach and fluffy

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.006
we are going to pour it in into our cup

00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:57.403
if you could only smell it?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.820
it's time to put in just a little bit of cinnamon 

00:02:03.134 --> 00:02:04.494
mix it up just a notch

00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:09.851
and then you throw either the marshmallows or the whipping cream on top of it

00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:13.126
and it looks amazingly delicious

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:17.971
I tell you, this is the best drink you've ever tried

00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.861
super creamy, true hot chocolate

00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:28.004
Nutella hot chocolate, not one of those powdery thing you buy at the store

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:32.631
and if you put the marshmallows in, guess what, you chew them up, they are so melty

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:36.906
you guys try it and let me know in comments how it went

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.185
and we'll see you next time
