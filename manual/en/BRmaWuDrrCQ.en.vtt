00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.970
Today in this boat trailer we&amp;#39;re going
to install part number DM5402.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.990
The Demco hydraulic brake line kit for single
axle trailers.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.900
A couple of things to know about this trailer
before we start off that the axle already

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:30.590
replaced for new axle, so we need to add our
brake line kit to this.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:49.590
Our first 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:01:04.170
step is 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:18.720
to go ahead and remove the 
original brake 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:45.630
line that&amp;#39;s inside 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.590
the frame.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:20.480
Cut off one end from the master cylinder and
go ahead and help pull 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.169
it out.

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:41.870
Once 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:56.319
the 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:15.730
old 
line removed we can 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:42.510
go ahead and install our new line 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:04:04.569
that 
goes up to 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.959
the coupler.
