00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.110
The original Joe Danger for the PSN was a
heck of a ride - fluid, fast and packed full

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.310
of collectables and objectives to complete,
it was joy to play.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.350
Now Hello Games have brought their stunt-riding
racer-come-high-scorer to the App Store and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.980
while it can take some getting used to the
manic pace, Joe Danger Touch is no less addictive

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.460
or fun than its bigger brother.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.030
Where the original title had more of an exploratory
edge to its gameplay (akin to a hybrid of

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.440
Excitebike and Trials HD), the touch version
tightens up the stages, adding an auto-runner

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.019
aspect as you constantly plow forward.

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.489
With basic movement handled for you, all that's
left is ducking, jumping and performing various

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.699
stunts such as wheelies, endos and flips.

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.570
These are easy to pull off thanks to a basic
one-touch system of tapping to duck and jump

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.920
(hold to duck, release to jump) and swiping
to perform the rest.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.870
Of course this wouldn't be a high-scorer without
some sort of challenge, and Joe Danger is

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.980
all too willing to help you out by placing
all manner of interactive objects in the world

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.150
for you to 'take care of' in order to keep
Joe rolling.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.320
Most of these will require a basic tap to
collect or destroy, though swiping can also

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200
be used to switch lanes.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.360
As such you'll need to develop a sort of two-fingered
approach to simultaneously control Joe while

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.890
looking for hazards and collectables alike.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.630
Once you've mastered the basics you'll be
well on your way to conquering the various

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.370
objectives set for each level, ranging from
getting a 'perfect' run by performing all

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.420
the stunts asked of you, to collecting all
the coins on a stage, and sometimes even a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.369
series of letters spelling 'DANGER'.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.049
The payoff for all of your hard work is an
ever-increasing challenge that tests your

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.289
multitasking abilities, as well as copious
amounts of coins that can be used to buy new

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.850
outfits for Joe.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.630
These impart special bonuses such as higher
score multipliers that require the player

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.320
to constantly perform stunts to keep it active,
as well percentage based score and coin boosts.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.100
The addition of stages that require a specific
costume to play them means you'll be kept

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.869
busy for a long time.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.290
In short, Joe Danger Touch is exactly what
mobile gaming should be about - small bites

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.380
of challenge, presented with all the care
the platform is capable of, while also making

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.480
excellent use of the touch screen.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.610
This doesn't even touch (pun not intended)
on the social integration that means you and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.160
your friends can spend entire afternoons trading
high scores.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:28.750
An absolute must play for iPhone and iPad
users alike.
