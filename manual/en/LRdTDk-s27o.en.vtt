00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.893
- [Sean] Hey, what's up,
Sean here, co-founder of

00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:05.581
THiNK International, and
creator of YouTube for Churches.

00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:08.677
(Guitar and clapping)

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:10.223
Let me ask you some questions.

00:00:10.223 --> 00:00:13.466
Do you want more people to
find your church locally

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:16.183
as well as extend the reach
of your message globally?

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.638
Are you already using online video,

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:19.190
but finding that your content is just not

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.821
getting very many views?

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:22.489
If you answered yes to those questions,

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.236
then YouTube for Churches is something

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:26.227
you might want to check out.

00:00:26.227 --> 00:00:28.133
YouTube for Churches is an
up-and-coming training course

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.282
that will help you get
better search results on

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:33.210
the world's second largest
search engine, YouTube;

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.566
that will help you connect personally with

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.925
first-time guests, or
potential first-time guests

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:39.752
before they even set foot in your church;

00:00:39.752 --> 00:00:41.293
will help you get more views on

00:00:41.293 --> 00:00:43.198
the content you're already creating;

00:00:43.198 --> 00:00:44.980
and ultimately help you extend the reach

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.069
of your message locally,
and even around the world.

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:50.471
So you might be wondering,
how did all this get started,

00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:53.109
well, since 2005, I've been on staff

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.182
at two different churches, and I've worked

00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:57.336
with other churches and
ministries to help them

00:00:57.336 --> 00:00:59.288
get better results online, that lead to

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:02.458
new guests discovering them locally.

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:04.934
Then, in 2010, I co-founded
THiNK International

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:06.887
with Jeff Moors, which quickly became

00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:09.782
the number one channel for
Christian leadership and

00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:12.555
creative content on
YouTube, with video views

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.075
nearing half a million
right now at the time

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.754
of shooting this video,
and dominating a lot of

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:19.902
popular search terms and keywords such as

00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:23.654
creative leadership,
social media ministry,

00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:26.195
Christian leadership,
church video announcements,

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:28.932
narrative storytelling, church staffing,

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:31.409
church media, church marketing.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.913
So people have always asked us,

00:01:32.913 --> 00:01:35.189
how did you guys do all that?

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.119
So that's where YouTube
for Churches comes from.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.708
It's all the tips, best practices,

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:41.336
and proven strategies that I have

00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:43.934
gathered, tested, and
implemented over the years,

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:47.390
condensed and simplified
so that you can apply them

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.644
in your local context and
achieve great results.

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:52.428
So if you want to make
it easier for guests

00:01:52.428 --> 00:01:54.176
to find your church or ministry

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:55.994
or you just want to
start getting more views

00:01:55.994 --> 00:01:57.039
and start being more effective with

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.414
the content you're already creating,

00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:01.054
head over to youtubeforchurches.com,

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.962
and enter your email address

00:02:02.962 --> 00:02:04.913
so I can let you know
when the course comes out.

00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:06.455
And if you're already here, just enter

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:08.688
your name and email address below,

00:02:08.688 --> 00:02:10.683
the course is currently under development,

00:02:10.683 --> 00:02:12.025
but I'll be sending you a ton

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:14.228
of free content in the meantime.

00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:15.061
