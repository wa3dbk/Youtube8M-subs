00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.080
Prosperity isn't usually a problem

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.280
but growing global populations mean

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.840
but demand for energy, water and food

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:12.278
will increase in the coming decades.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.480
By 2050, the world may require 60%

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.238
more food than today.

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.518
In that time, the gap between energy supply and demand

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.920
could grow to the size of the energy industry's

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.520
total output in the year 2000.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.440
By 2030, fresh water supplies could

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.158
fall short of demand by 40%.

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:33.518
The solution seems simple.

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:36.038
To grow more food, generate more energy

00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:37.918
and increase water efficiency.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.680
However, the 3 resources are intertwined

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.240
in a complex web that Shell calls

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.760
the Stress Nexus.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.158
Led by Maike Boggemann

00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:48.918
Shell's Strategy and Scenarios Team

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.480
identified over 100 interconnected factors

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:54.158
that create the Stress Nexus.

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.958
These range from how biomass resources are used

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.280
to the price variability of food

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.158
to technological innovation in water efficiency.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.078
So what's being done?

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.798
Across the wide world

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.118
exciting people and companies are stepping up

00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:10.038
to the Stress Nexus challenge.

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.078
In the energy sector, companies like Shell

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.560
are investing in natural gas which produces

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.600
lower CO2 emissions than coal

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:19.718
when used to produce electricity.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.280
The energy companies' also stimulating debate

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.400
with its annual powering progress together conferences

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.000
which bring together leading thinkers from business

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.640
government and society

00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:31.438
to address energy challenges.

00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:34.038
In addition, Shell holds an annual competition

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.080
called Shell Ideas 360.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.520
This student initiative aims to champion innovative ideas

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.800
greater energy, water and food economy.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.640
Elan Musk's Tesla Motors is working to develop electric cars

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.280
seeking to reduce the car industries current reliance on

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.480
liquid fossil fuels

00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:52.838
and in the UK

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.918
a start-up called Azuri is combining mobile phone and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.440
and solar technology to provide solar as a service.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.320
Rural users can pay for the usage of a solar panel

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.558
over time.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.360
Rather than in an expensive single payment.

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:08.078
In the water industry

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.080
Chilean industrial designer Alfredo Zolezzi

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.800
has created a plasma sanitation system

00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:16.878
that cleans 35 litres of water in 5 minutes

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.478
and costs less than 1p per litre.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.278
US based Okeanos Technologies

00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:25.998
is developing a more efficient way of removing salt from water

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.240
using an electronic chip, the technique creates an

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.920
electrical field to de-ionise sea water

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.800
forcing the salt ions out on a molecular level.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.840
In food production

00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:39.438
Bright Farms works with US grocers

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.080
to harvest salads and herbs

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.880
in giant urban hydroponic greenhouses.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.320
It recently opened

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.360
a 9,300 square metre rooftop farm

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:50.238
in Brooklyn's Sunset Park.

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:53.278
And in Brazil, organic sugar producer Balbo

00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:55.518
is developing a farming system it calls

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.400
Ecosystem Revitalizing Agriculture.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.080
It's hoped the method can help protect soil and crops

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:02.718
from resource depletion

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.880
and improve their pest resistance.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.120
The next 50 years will be a time of both huge change

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.798
and opportunity.

00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:13.038
The Stress Nexus is a way to understand these changes.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.640
But action around the world must be matched

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.558
by international cooperation and

00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:18.838
and policy.
