00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:33.660
first of these abuse it ca appeared on
the as in the base of booty

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.300
album in the sixties or seventies by
stefan grossman

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.520
we're not going to really learn this
piece of music which is going to play

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.489
the very first part of it we're going to
use this piece of music too

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.559

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.550
the damage to the curtains between the
fingers on

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.870
will lead you may have frozen in space
for a while with his mouth open

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.480
it was good like that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.740
even though and i'm going to learn this
piece in great detail we're just going

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.760
to look at the first two or three phases
to try and get get some idea of the the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.640
dance between the phone the fingers will
just take a look at the chords that we

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.230
use so that you know what kind of
progression way using

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.650
we have a basic g cord

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.260
and where would recall of the without
g_-seven

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.100
we have a c simple secord another full
secord where both the basement settled

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.610
down

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.350
sometimes if welding the basic secord
down laughing ahmad move over to the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.280
base of the inform the court do you see
at the beginning of the second row

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.410
and then we have c_-seventeen

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.650
the normal eighty seven would involve
the second fret

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.900
and then i'm off of a d seven

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.960
always played d seven on the basis that
if i don't

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.100
play the last note so i don't fret it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.380
and here we have four variations on the
f court

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.620
you can see that most of the f_ core
displayed not as a full-court but uh...

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.990
played in a way that leaves a little
finger free to move around on the treble

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.470
strings

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.840
listen to the music again

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.840
and try to separate the phone beat and
the travelgate

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:23.659
begin here there's two things going on
you hear the phone beat

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.739
must know that the other couples

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.739
the formby is actually sound like this

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:50.639
uh...

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.469
so you can see it

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.260
instead of just alternating on the basis
of

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.289
simply

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:26.839
is dancing itself is making some a
little too

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.409
at the same time

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:35.409
the basic mentally sound like this

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.459
uh...

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.639
which is a very simple course from here

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.979
both the base

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.090
and the firm dates and looking to be
together

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.109
reduces listen good patient between the
two

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.289
melodies

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.870
it's a little bit more complicated than
that because of all what they've been

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.639
elevated one finger

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.639
and it sounds like this

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.579
inorganic abuse it more interesting

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:04.379
so instead of playing the basic melody
one finger ms dot introduce the second

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.789
thing that

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.060
advantages grace notes in between the
bank notes

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.060
this is how this happened wanting to
play in the melody

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:24.590
collaboration truman before made notes

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.610
now this means instead of using the
first thing for the melody the whole

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.430
time

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.129
will be using the second thing too
because the first thing will be getting

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:39.129
the graceful before it

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.330
nichols if we introduced to many grace
notes

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.230
and becomes a little complicated

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.660
and it was his attractiveness solely to
use them sparingly just included with an

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.719
attractive

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:19.649
power

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:21.499
fairy with these great still superior

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:25.349
so that have variations throughout music

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.830
it's on his cell for the new piece of
rights on the using color to make it

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.560
kind of music that needs usual to make
the phone

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.810
bear this in mind and work out how you
can make the for more interesting

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.979
introduce some syncopation make your
thumb down is a little bit

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.990
if this wave of original music

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.209
well below the average

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:45.690
just take a little knowledgeable

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.759
and this is a little progress

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:49.959
phone i'll see you next time
