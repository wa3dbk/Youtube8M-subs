Hello, in this video I will show you how you can burn every ISO-image to an USB-Stick.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
All you need is UNetbootin, the link is in the description, 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
just download and install it or just start it

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
if you have the stand-alone-version.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I will shortly demonstrate it with my pmagic 6.4,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I just downloaded it from the internet.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And of course you need an USB device,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
my USB stick is drive e.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I've started UNetbootin, you have "image" and "choose ISO",

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
select the file on your computer, then open it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now check if drive E:\ is correct.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Click "OK" at the end and then the transfer is starting...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
After that we have to restart our pc if we want to boot from the USB device.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Of course I will just shortly demonstrate it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In the boot menu just choose the right entry.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In that case choose removable devices and press enter.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Thereupon we get our boot menu at the usb-stick.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If we just leave it like that the booting starts automatically.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
That's different and depends on which image you have.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Otherwise I would have chosen "default settings".

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Just wait a moment.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And right now we can use "Parted Magic".

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
As stated before, it works with nearly every image,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and you can save a lot of DVD or CD-disks.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Okay.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
