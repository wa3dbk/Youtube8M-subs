00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:10.080
Rick Gropper: Over the past several years,
the economic development has really caused an increase in

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.189
the amount of money it takes to live a comfortable
life in New York City. Affordable housing

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:21.100
is important to me because I’ve seen people
being priced out of the areas that they work in.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.180
Ron Moelis: There’s been more need for affordable
housing as living costs have skyrocketed.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.820
There seems to be an insatiable demand for
affordable housing, both for a moderate middle

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.820
income class and also for some of the people
who need places to live and don’t have the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.820
income to be able to even pay moderate or
middle income rents.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.180
Alan Wiener: When I met Ron, Ron was developing
low income housing. Affordable housing is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.320
difficult to put together, and Wells has gotten
the reputation in this market of being able

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.620
to seamlessly put those transactions together
and execute.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.480
Ruthann Visnauskas: Creating affordable housing
in New York City is very challenging. You

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.809
have to be very creative, and you have to
be very determined. It often takes five or

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.400
ten sources of funding to create a deal, and
that is not for the faint of heart.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.060
Ron Moelis: Wells has been a great partner
in the affordable housing world because they

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.630
are able to think out of the box. Oftentimes,
you can be as creative as you want - if you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.090
don’t have an equity partner or a lending
partner who’s willing to work with you,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.580
and be creative with you, all your creativity
doesn’t matter.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.840
Duane Mutti: We have to bring a flexible approach
to the financing. We deliver not only construction

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.679
loans, we provide investments in low income
housing tax credits. We have to understand

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.669
the underlying needs of the project and of
the community. These projects are very important

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:41.799
to the city, and at Wells, we really think
in order for Wells Fargo to thrive in a neighborhood,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.079
the neighborhoods have to thrive.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.460
Rick Gropper: The greatest sense of satisfaction
is seeing a building built, but it goes a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.549
step beyond that. It’s seeing people on
the street, and looking at the different services

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.200
that are brought to an area that complement
housing. So we’re not only thinking about

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.480
building housing, but we’re also thinking
about building communities.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.700
Ron Moelis: Having grown up in the New York
city metropolitan area, and lived here

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.180
for the last fifty some odd years, I’ve
seen a city that’s very diverse, both ethnically

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.440
and economically, and what we want to create
and enhance is that diversity in this city.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.180
