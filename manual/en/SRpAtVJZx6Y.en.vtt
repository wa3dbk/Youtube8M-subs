00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.450
lacy p event

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.340
for fear that they would be leaning
independent voters

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.960

so now understand the people running the
convention might be a little

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.689
upset and with that's

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.619
dismay speculating that we don't have
reporting out but might be a little

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.690
upset

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.260
the president african-american present
was supposed to come address them that's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.329
the same president told of a thank you
for having my back always have your back

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.450
and all the sun right before an election
he can show up to the that

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.859

that idea that no matter who you are or
what you look like or where you come

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:22.599
from america is the place where you can
make it if you try

different speech now here's what they

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.809
were part

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:52.489
the audience reaction when the tape is
over

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.159

and i'll send our deepest regards

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.059
look they might have some of the might
step back but that was about its

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.120
lukewarm applause i've ever seen

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.840
well over president let alone for now
retired president and that was to be

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.069
convention sold out by contrast

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.739
joe biden comes in and they this at all
right fine when i say the president

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.599
wilson though white vice president said
which is fun and a couple of different

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:35.760
levels

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.410
he's got the crowd going

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.730
this is actually any of it

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.749
the speech that's fiery and passion and
and obviously one that was well received

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:46.389
remember

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.179

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:50.799
with this score

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.699
was all about

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.589
why this word is issue his core

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.899

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.259
this about free agent

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.419
it was about the right to vote

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.969
figures what you have the right to vote
have the right to change things

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.529
headway

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.949
the president not and eric and all of us

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:18.669
we see a future where those rights are
expected not diminished

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.029
where racial profiling except they have
the facts

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:29.319
were access to the palace expanded and
unencumbered

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.699
cdm that's a speech okay

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.560
and that's a good reaction to it

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.120
they didn't want to send the president
has it in one of my president say

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.180

profiling y

always in freight also hearing like that

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.070
the cases that anyway letter what you do

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.189
bag is by and continued to rumble mop

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.209
let me close

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:58.790
my friends

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.659
by saying

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.290

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.930

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.089
mansion

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:14.969
with the romney justice part will look
like

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:15.909
madyun

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.180
when his senior adviser on constants
issues

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.919
is robert work

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.669
matching the recommendations for who is
likely to be picked as attorney general

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.439
of the head of the civil rights division

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:34.919
for those of other incredibly important
positions of justice

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.330
a magic

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.740

most critical issues in this election

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.120
a mansion

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.619
