00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.250
An early content patch for September 16th,
new cosmetic items, a new chest, CK's particle

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.930
effect error gets fixed, and more!

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.150
Hey guys, Jess here - and it's been a while
for the Dota 2 Update!

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.960
The Curse video team has been traveling non-stop
for the past month, but now we're ready to

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.339
get back on track.

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.829
First up, the possible drop list from the
Treasure of Rubiline sheen was revealed.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.190
This new chest has a chance to drop the following
items:

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.960
Style of the Occult Protector, Star of Silence,
Mistblad, Mistral Braid, Luminous Edge, End

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.570
of Order, Last Judgment, Obsidian Golem, Izoku,
Diffusal Lance, Enchated Manglewood Staff,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.620
Arcs of Manta Pack, or an Exceedingly Rare
Special Item, such as an unusual courier.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.489
Couriers unboxed from this chest have a special
Unusual Ruby Trail effect.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.059
You can click the link in the video description
to view images of these items of CyborgMatt's

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.320
post and see what they look like on the character
models.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.960
Next, CK's particle effect error got fixed.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.729
While the giant cloud of red X's was amusing
to some, it was a result of his item schema

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.640
getting changed before the particle layout
got updated accordingly, but those have now

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.640
been synced.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.610
Moving on to the competitive scene - several
weeks ago MLG announced that Dota 2 will be

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.410
added to the 2013 pro circuit - the NA League
matches have been going on over the past few

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.210
weeks, and the top four teams from these matches
will compete live on October 18th at the Fall

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.340
Invitational at Full Sail University.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.350
The first place team from the Invitational
will receive $10,000 and an invitation to

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.759
compete at the MLG Fall Championship in Columbus,
Ohio November 22nd-24th.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.430
And what's so special about this?

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.680
Well, it just happens to be a certain video
host's hometown, meaning that I get to go

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.360
home to visit friends and family, AND can
cheer on my favorite team NaVi in person.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.240
That's right, MLG has just announced that
several amazign teams will be competing at

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.890
the Fall Championship, including Alliance,
Na'Vi, Fnatic, EG, Team Liquid, and more.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.990
I look forward to seeing you guys there!

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.480
