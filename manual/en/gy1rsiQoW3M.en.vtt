00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.470
How to Make Miso Soup.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.940
This delicate but intensely flavored soup
is like chicken soup for the Japanese soul

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.200
— minus the chicken.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.680
And it's just as easy to make if you have
the right ingredients.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.220
You will need 4 c. fresh, cold water A 2 or
3-qt. pot A hotplate or stovetop A long piece

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.700
of konbu seaweed 4 tbsp. bonito flakes A small
mesh strainer 1/4 lb. soft tofu, cut into

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:48.550
small cubes 2 wakame seaweed 4 red or white
miso paste 3 chopped scallions A small ladle

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.370
A spoon or whisk and a medium-sized bowl.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.539
Step 1.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.960
Pour the water into the pot and place it on
the stove or hotplate at medium heat.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.290
Step 2.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.970
Break off a 4 to 6-inch piece of konbu and
add it to the water.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.920
Konbu—also known as sea cabbage or kelp—is
available at most health food stores.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.030
Step 3.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.909
Simmer the konbu for 15 minutes, then remove
it from the water and throw it away.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:21.909
Step 4.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.340
Add bonito flakes to the pot and simmer on
medium-low heat for 5 minutes.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.049
If you prefer a more intense fish flavor,
steep the flakes for 10, 15, or even 20 minutes—the

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.880
longer you steep them, the stronger the flavor.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.880
Step 5.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.939
With a small mesh strainer, remove the bonito
flakes and discard them.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:41.939
Step 6.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.420
Add the tofu chunks and wakame and simmer
for 5 minutes on low heat.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.210
When making miso soup, never bring the broth
to a boil—it will muddy all the distinct

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.490
flavors.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.979
Step 7.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.740
Ladle about a cup of the broth into a medium-sized
bowl containing the miso paste, and stir with

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.729
a long chopstick or spoon until it dissolves.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.790
Step 8.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.710
Once the miso paste is dissolved, pour the
broth back in the pot and stir.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.610
Miso paste will keep in the fridge for nearly
a year; bonito flakes, wakame, and konbu will

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.040
last indefinitely in the cupboard.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.180
Step 9.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.600
Keeping the heat on low, add the chopped scallions
and simmer for a final 5 minutes.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.520
Ahhh, miso.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.029
Did you know Miso soup is routinely served
at breakfast in Japanese homes and restaurants.
