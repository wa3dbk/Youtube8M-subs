Hi, this is Betsy from Classroom Teacher Resources.

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.269
Today, I’m going to show you a Father’s
Day project.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:19.220
You know, it’s been my experience that we
commonly do Mother’s Day activities in the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.510
classroom with students.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.910
They make a little gift for their mom.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.480
It’s in May.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.289
We’ve got loads of time for that.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.140
But then Father’s Day comes right before
the end of the school year.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.210
Poor dads get left in the dust and they don’t
get any sweet little reminders of how much

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.700
their children love them at home.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.050
So I came up with Father’s Day ties that
- it's pretty quick and easy little project

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.110
that you can make in your classroom.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.590
It’s available on my Classroom Caboodle
Store, and I’m going to show you the parts

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.970
of that today.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.230
So what you’re going to get is a packet
that includes four different style, black

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.470
and white ties.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.970
You could just choose one and let the students
just all do the same one or you can provide

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.860
a variety of them.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.720
I usually print them out on white cardstock
for students so they’re a little bit more

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.390
durable, and I let students choose whichever
tie they wished to color for their dad.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.990
Also, on each page with the tie are directions
so students can practice reading procedures

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.460
and following the steps.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.920
And there’s also a little mini cut-out card
with a "My dad is the best" poem, so students

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.261
can color and cut the tie, they can sign the
card and cut it out and fold it, and the tie

00:01:51.261 --> 00:02:00.030
and the little card fit perfectly into a standard
envelope that you can get probably in your

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.229
school office.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.640
So I’m going to make a tie real quick and
we’re going to put it on fast forward, and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.200
I’m going to have it done like that.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:24.630
So watch this.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:03:01.450
All right, so what you end up with is a colorful
little necktie for dad with a sweet little

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.450
card.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.569
I always encourage my students to read that
poem to their dad as they’re tying the tie

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.770
around his neck.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.520
I’ve gotten a few pretty funny pictures
emailed to me with dads wearing their fancy

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.020
neckties.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.870
So students would tie that around their dad’s
neck, take a great family photo on a very

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.520
memorable day.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.140
So it’s a fun activity that students really
love.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.590
It’s quick,it's easy right at the end of
the school year.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.770
It’s a lovely way to celebrate Father’s
Day.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:43.260
You can find it on my Classroom Caboodle Store.
