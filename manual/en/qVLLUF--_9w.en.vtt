Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this segment
we are going to talk about how to transplant

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.879
orchids. Now orchids are such a beautiful
plant and they do so well in certain situations.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.910
I have some on my East facing window in my
kitchen and they do so beautifully they just

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.720
grow year round and they bloom periodically
and they're just a beautiful plant but they

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.210
do get big over the years and get a little
bit crowded for their pot so there are some

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.410
simple rules when you transplant them that
you should follow. So this orchid came in

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.420
a pot just like this and it is probably not
even too big right now to leave it in the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.149
pot. They like to be root bound so being crowded
is a good thing for them but they also like

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.589
to have a lot of room for the roots to grow
and in this pot they seem to be a little stagnate,

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.569
it doesn't seem to get a lot of air into the
pot and there is no drainage and so I'm going

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:57.260
to put them into a regular pot and I think
that they'll do better. They do better in

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.159
pots where they can have drainage and have
a little more air. So with orchids especially

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:08.310
the most important factor is good drainage
so put in some rocks or some gravel on the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.580
bottom of the container or marbles or moss
or anything so that the water dries out. This

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.310
is the best thing that you can do for them
and then basically the two materials that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.910
I have used most for my orchids are straight
bark dust plant them right in the bark dust

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.380
and then straight moss so I just get moss
out of some of my other plants or around the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.850
house under trees and I just put some moss
in big chunks in with the orchids and sometimes

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.420
I'll put some soil in with it too because
it seems to like it and then it is always

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.590
nice to separate the roots of it too, these
roots don't look that healthy they haven't

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.850
had a lot of oxygen so by just giving it a
little more air I think it is going to do

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.890
a lot better so I am just going to put that
right into the pot and then I have found too

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.170
orchids like a little bit of soil, they seem
to do better with a little bit of compost

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:07.480
so I mix it with some moss and I'm just putting
a top layer with it as well and I bet you

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.640
that this orchid is going to do ten times
better now that I have given it a little more

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.480
air in another pot. I bet this orchid will
do a lot better now that it has gotten a little

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.660
more air and some fresh moss and some fresh
soil and I'm going to put it back into the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.920
kitchen and hopefully it will bloom next Spring.
