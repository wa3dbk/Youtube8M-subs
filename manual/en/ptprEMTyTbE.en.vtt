00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.150
I was in first grade and our first-grade teacher
asked everybody you know what do you want

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:21.680
to be when you get older and everybody put
doctors and teachers and firemen, astronaut

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:32.630
and I put I want to be an Olympic athlete
and and that's a true story.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:42.770
So I played sports ever since I was a
young girl.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.260
In college I played field hockey, basketball
and track.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.080
I didn't know what sport I was gonna pick
to go all the way.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.960
I decided that you know maybe triathlons and
you know I wasn't

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.480
sure so I tried that out and a lot of people
you know noticed me running all the time they're

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.480
like “oh you a fighter?”

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.680
I was like “no I am not a fighter.”

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.840
I keep training for triathlons “are you
a fighter?” and I'm like “why is everybody

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.290
asking me if I'm a fighter” you know.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.570
I was like you know
what I'm gonna give this sport a try as well.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.060
It was such a humbling experience because
I wasn't just great at it.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.980
You know I knew that this was a sport that
was going to take hard work and it's

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.170
gonna take a lot of practice and I was up
for the challenge.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.430
I'm number one in the nation right now.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.581
I got the gold medal at the USA national championship
so now I'm on Team USA.

00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:39.020
A 
decision to stay drug-free really molded my

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.460
whole life.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.010
I definitely had a lot of opportunities and
times in my life where I could easily have

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.831
chose you know the easy route you know to
try to

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:52.950
be cool or by doing drugs you know.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.700
But I didn't choose that.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.220
To me that wasn't cool and to me that coolness
would not last and wouldn't get you anywhere

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.299
and wouldn't amount to anything and I had
a friend in college that was smarter than

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.090
me could you know was a genius English
major.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.849
He was smart he was getting all A's his papers
were amazing.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.910
He's getting better grades than I was and
then he started hanging around with the wrong

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.980
crowd and smoking pot.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.750
He started skipping classes because he was
too lazy to go to class.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.750
It just got so bad that he flunked classes.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.320
He had to retake classes all over again.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.690
I don't even know if he even graduated You
know it really ruins your name and who you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.990
are and what you're going after in life.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.550
And you know that's it's really important
to just stay focus and be around you know

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.020
positive people and you want to be remembered
as somebody that was a hard worker.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.489
They accomplished a lot of things they tried
new things and that's what's important.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.500
I really like setting goals and achieving
them and looking back at them and saying wow

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.069
I did that, wow I completed that, rather it
be a goal and let's just say when I started

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.460
boxing I said to myself right when I started
the sport “I'm going to be a professional

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.460
boxer.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.950
I'm going to be in the Olympic Games” and
five years later I'm I stuck with it and all

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.360
that hard work is paying off and I'm on Team
USA now and I'm on my route to the 2016 Rio

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.599
games
I'm Daniel Wolff and my natural high is boxing.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.169
What's yours?
