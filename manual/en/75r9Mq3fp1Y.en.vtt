00:00:09.322 --> 00:00:12.367
This is because Nature's Prophet didn't level up enough,

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:15.165
Crystal Maiden is going 1 on 1! 1 on 1!!

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:16.441
Freezing Field~~~~

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.137
He was stuck in reverse~

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:19.583
Almost got it~~~~~

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:21.303
What happened?

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.918
Q : It was impressive that you killed Nature's Prophet 
even though you played as support.

00:00:26.918 --> 00:00:28.344
The reason is....
Well.. Nature's Prophet didn't power up very much

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:31.192
And I was much higher in level than him.
Well.. I think I did very well overall

00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:32.837
He is too excited at the moment.

00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:34.363
However, Crystal Maiden is so strong now!

00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:35.149
Wow!!!

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.184
Freezing Field!! He got it!

00:00:37.493 --> 00:00:39.949
Q : Can you give some tips for Dota2 beginners 
regarding the Crystal Maiden?

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.568
Since Crystal Maiden is very strong in early games,

00:00:41.568 --> 00:00:44.435
You can score a kill if you go to other lanes.

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:45.223
So I think it’s better go to other lanes often.

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:51.335
Blink Dagger, Shadow Blade, Black King Bar for now

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:53.373
Earth Splitter worked! Got it.

00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:56.205
Luna's Black King Bar worked pretty early.

00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:57.528
Ah this time!

00:00:57.528 --> 00:00:58.638
Wow~

00:00:58.638 --> 00:00:59.417
Last shot!

00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:02.814
Easy~ Huh?

00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:07.932
Interview after the first match

00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:10.660
It's getting really cold outside~

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.735
But it's so hot here in GOMTV studio 
beacuse NSL is going on.

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.007
Interview after the second match

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:21.286
Wow~ I think there's aren’t any teams without faults.

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:22.493
Today you won against EOT gaming.....

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.650
Hello

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.821
Did you change your clothes?

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.506
Yes! I tried a schoolgirl look today for Halloween.

00:01:31.506 --> 00:01:32.704
How do I look?

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:34.496
Do I look good?

00:01:36.613 --> 00:01:38.451
Waiting room before the second match interview

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:41.893
Why are you so happy?

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.792
Because Halloween is later this week.

00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:45.931
So I wore schoolgirl uniform today.

00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.294
Schoolgirl uniform?

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:48.371
Yes

00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:50.246
Can you show it to us later?

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:52.139
OK

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:54.771
Maybe you’ll be surprised at how good I look in it?

00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:56.035
I'm sorry!

00:01:56.035 --> 00:01:57.317
Sorry?

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.733
No. I said nothing.
