00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.060
Let’s talk about eggs, baby.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.150
Let’s talk about 2 or 3, let’s talk about
all the good eggs and the bad eggs, and the

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.170
ones in between.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.009
Let’s talk about eggs!

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.690
Hey everybody, this is Matt Lieberman filling
in for DNews.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.690
I love eggs.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.860
They’re kind of the perfect food.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.650
They’re easy to prepare, they’re delicious,
and they’re packed with protein.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.520
However, a debate has raged for years about
whether or not the yolks, which contain 186

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.410
milligrams of dietary cholesterol, are harmful
to your body.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.290
And those fears are justifiable.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.090
LDL, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
puts your body at risk for heart disease and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.150
lowers fertility rates at high levels.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.090
However, HDL, or High Density Lipoprotein
cholesterol, is vital to a healthy body.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.690
Did you know that cholesterol is an important
structural element in the membrane of every

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.610
last one of your cells, and also helps create
steroid hormones like testosterone and estrogen?

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.931
In fact, cholesterol is so vital to human
existence that your liver produces it on a

00:00:58.931 --> 00:00:59.931
regular basis.

00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:04.250
Actually, when you consume dietary cholesterol,
you aren’t adding cholesterol to your body

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.400
by a large margin.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.080
Your liver detects the change in cholesterol
intake and lowers production accordingly to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.880
keep your body on an even keel.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.420
Now, the long-prevailing opinion of doctors
is that adults should consume under 300 milligrams

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.880
of cholesterol a day, and 2-6 egg yolks a
week.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.980
However, there is abundant scientific evidence
that these limits are largely unwarranted,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.750
and that it is dietary fat, not cholesterol,
that raises LDL levels.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.610
In several studies, large groups of people
are split in half.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.770
One half eats 1-3 whole eggs each day, and
the other eats an egg substitute such as egg

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.770
beaters.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.510
Over a period of months, egg eaters saw their
good HDL cholesterol levels climb, while bad

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.280
LDL levels remained stagnant in 70% of participants.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.990
The remaining 30% saw slight increases, but
nothing drastic.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.330
Also, those that ate pasture-raised eggs enriched
with omega 3 fatty acids saw drops in triglycerides,

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.190
a major risk factor for heart disease, and
all egg-eaters saw significant increases in

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.979
antioxidants such as Lutein in their blood.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.580
Now it is important to point out that these
studies were all conducted on participants

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.220
eating no more than three eggs a day, so I
can’t say with any certainty what would

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.590
happen to you if you ate more than three daily.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.950
However, egg yolks are packed with vitamins
and nutrients.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.779
Vitamin A, B2, B5, B12, selenium, calcium,
iron, potassium, zinc, manganese, folate,

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.230
the list goes on!

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.969
They also contain choline, an important nutrient
that the body requires to produce the neurotransmitter

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.519
acetylcholine.

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.480
According to a 2004 US dietary survey, 90%
of Americans do not consume their recommended

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.859
amount of choline.

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.629
Eggs also deliver a fat shot of protein that
has an amazing amino acid profile, including

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.049
9 essential aminos that cannot be produced
by the human body and MUST be gotten from

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.049
diet.

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.719
So, people, in closing, your friend who read
that thing, and then that other thing, and

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.390
that other thing about how eggs were good
and bad and good and bad again, tell them

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.379
to go suck an egg, or two or three.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.049
They’ll feel a lot better.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.980
So do you feel more confident consuming whole
eggs, or are you still concerned about cholesterol?
