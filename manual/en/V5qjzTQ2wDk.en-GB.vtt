00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.850
Hi there guys
So today im gonna do a different video than

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.420
usual
Erm, i've had a few people asked me how i

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.320
do my hair for which is similiar to Harry
Styles

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.250
So i thought i'd do a full on step by step
tutorial on excatly what i do and exactly

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.960
what products i use as well.
But firstly i just wanna say it depends what

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.280
kind of hair you have
If you have straight thin hair then it might

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.580
be a tad hard to do to obviously having err
like me thick curly hair that would definitely

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.370
help
So this is the final product, this is what

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:37.891
it looks like at the front, and the side,
side and we've got the back there all Harry

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:42.190
like i presume
So err yea lets take you from the beginning

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:54.770
and see how we get to this!
So firstly you wanna wash your hair and while

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.410
its wet i like to just put a comb through
it to get the curls and knots out

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:10.979
Also while it's still wet i like to put in
an anti frizz product, which is called frizz

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.320
ease
Just obviously to keep the curls a little

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.389
relaxed and less frizzy if the weather isn't
too good outside

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:22.130
And being that i have a little bit more curly
hair compared to Harrys

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.729
So I just squirt a few pumps onto my hands
and put through all my hair without touching

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.029
the roots
Then i like to let my hair dry naturally instead

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:34.700
of blowdrying As this tends to give it abit
more volume

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.279
So now we'll just fast forward to the dry
stage

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.750
Ok so now that your hair is pretty much dry
with a little bit of dampness we can start

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.049
blowdrying it all downwards
While running your fingers through your hair

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.560
and getting the basic shape which it needs
to be

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.340
With the sides coming forward and the back
just going straight down

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.009
Once the top part of your hair is nearly dry
you can now sweep it all back and blowdry

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.170
the quiff
Keep blowdrying and running your hands through

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.540
until you get the shape you want, while still
paying attention to getting the shape of the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:27.140
sides and the back
Now for me personally i like to straighten

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.830
out the sides and the back of my hair just
because i think that my hair is a little bit

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.530
more curlier than Harrys errmm
Like particularly the longer it gets the more

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.110
kind of dreadlocks kind of form
So i don't particularly wanna straighten them

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.620
really straight just to kind of relax them
a little bit

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.090
And just to kind of get more definition instead
of just like pig curls so to speak

00:02:50.090 --> 00:03:08.010
So we're just using some ghd straightners
and erm just give that a whirl really

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.800
So once it's all dried its time to put a product
in and i like to use wax

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.440
Erm now over the years i've used lots and
lots of different waxes

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.790
Erm it's quite hard for me to find a decent
one because i want one that can actually hold

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.710
the hair but at the same time doesn't look
greasy

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.680
And it seems that i always seem to find a
greasy wax

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.550
So at the moment im using Kiehls erm i think
that's how you say it anyway

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.819
Erm it's only a little tub, i bought it for
about Â£16 erm when you think about it, it's

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.700
only wax soooo it is a bit expensive but you're
only using a little bit at a time so you should

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.660
get your moneys worth really
Now you dont want to use alot of this, literally

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.310
you just want to use a pea size amount
Erm and i like to break up my hair into 3

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.010
different sections so you got the top hair
so that'll be 1 pea size amount, the sides

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.840
so that'll be 1 size
And then the back that's another pea size

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.850
amount so altogether you've got 3 pea size
amounts that you need to use and this should

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.060
theoretically not look greasy at all
So this is what a pea size looks like, not

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.319
too much, not too little
So you just want to rub through the palm of

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.579
your hands and just literally sweep evenly
through the top part of your head

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.900
Erm creating the quiff
So you just want to keep sculpting and shaking

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:32.460
to create volume to get the quiff that you
want, with also paying attention to the roots.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.710
Then next you want to get another pea sized
amount and now want to focus on the sides,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.599
getting into the roots again and bringing
towards the front of your face

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:49.919
While twisting the hair to get the sides to
flick outwards a little

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.759
Then lastly you wanna use your last amount
of wax for the back, running all through evenly

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:05.860
while paying attention to the ends and flicking
outwards

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.849
Now lastly i just like to use a very small
amount of spray to give it some hold, i like

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.860
to use the ultra hold shockwaves spray and
just spray a tiny amount all over

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.210
And thats pretty much it!
Now again i just wanna say that these are

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.330
all the things that work for my hair pacifically
erm

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.669
You need to do what's best for your own hair,
everyones hair is different so whatever works

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.400
best for you, do it that way
But if you want to know anything else i do

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.569
or if you even use any other better products
then me, let me know in the comments section

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.219
