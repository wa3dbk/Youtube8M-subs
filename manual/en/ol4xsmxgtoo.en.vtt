00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.060
Hey there guys!  Now, this is a little-known piece of gaming trivia,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.840
but the songs in Ocarina of Time actually HAVE lyrics!

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.140
They just didn't include them in the game because of technical limitations.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.420
With that said, I'd like to show you my next project.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.940
Introducing: Arlo Sings the Hits of Ocarina of Time!

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.740
Join Arlo as he croons to those classics we all know and love!

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.280
Saria, Saria! Now you know the song.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.120
It's stuck in your head...forever.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.320
Epona...

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.320
how do you...

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.720
ge-et here so fast?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.860
Beating...go run away...

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.160
trample cucoos all day...

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.020
Sing along with Koji Kondo's original lyrics

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.660
and relive one of Link's greatest adventures!

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.900
Bolero of Fire.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.840
Bolero of Fire.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.660
Bolero of Fire!

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.940
Everybody knows Bolero of Fire

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.420
is of course the best song

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.340
out of all of the war-ping songs...

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.440
The Sun Song, the Sun Song,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.580
hope you weren't trying to sleep!

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.880
By lending it his voice, Arlo recaptures

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.200
the spirit and the emotion

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.520
of the experience we all shared.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.480
Water Temple sucks...

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.640
Water Temple sucks...

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.820
might as well quit the game right now...

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.480
Please don't make me fight Dead Hand.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.540
Please don't make me fight Dead Hand.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.860
Please don't make me -

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.680
AHHH! AHHHH! NO!! AHHHHHH!

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.340
The songs we all forever keep in our hearts are back and better-than-ever

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.840
in this comprehensive collection

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.400
featuring all of Ocarina of Time's best!

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.320
Song of Storms, Song of Storms,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.180
make it rain a bunch right now!

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.860
You don't care about the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.800
local ecosystem!

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.860
Song of Time...

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.160
Song of Time...

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.420
move some blocks, but

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.000
don't actually move through time...

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.380

Why are there turnips everywhere? This is weird!
