00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.650
Well now, how do we bring these skills alive?
But first of all, would you like to try...these

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.940
young people who are going to play, would
you like to just try feeling the resistance

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.026
of the key? Come over here and try.

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:18.820
First 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.750
of all...

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.789
And sit on the seat, and feel heavy on the
seat. Feel light with your arms, very light.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.940
Student: Am I at the..., I feel kinda high
with the seat...

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.770
You're too high.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.870
You'll adjust it when you play.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:55.970
So then, now you're going to...take your hand
up the way it is and turn it over. That's

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.880
the first rotation.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:18.700
Now, you can play a c major scale.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.560
[playing]

00:01:23.560 --> 00:02:02.450
No, now do it with an exaggeration first.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.310
[playing]

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:30.189
There, you turn back for the thumb, you see.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.840
[playing]

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:48.079
That's it. That's all there is to it, to the
rotation. But, sometimes there are more complicated,

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.450
uh, passages. Would you like to try?

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:58.049
Real heavy on the seat, real light everywhere
else. Ah, that's not...that's not light. Really

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:07.549
light., really light; like a ballet dancer.
Just real buoyant. Floating. Like you're floating.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.579
That's it. Alright.

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.939
That's it.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:11.939
[playing]

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.650
No, you see...

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.650
[playing]

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.719
That's not right 'cause you...

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:18.719
[playing]

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:19.719
oh...

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:20.719
[playing]

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.719
And back...

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:22.719
[playing]

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.800
The only, the only catch is really the...,
this thumb.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.439
How about the other student?

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.439
[coughing]

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.439
[playing]

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.370
Looks excellent. Have you had some training
on this...before? [laughter]

00:03:30.370 --> 00:04:15.790
Very, very good. I wanted to...while you're
here, let's just show the resistance of the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:27.900
key. Now, have you been taught to raise your
fingers or have you been taught to stay on

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.900
the keys?

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.150
Student: A little bit of both.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:44.099
Alright, well then supposing your just get
your hand on the key...and you could do...

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.280
[inaudible]...er, ...you see, the key wants
to stay up. And you want to put it down and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.719
make a sound. And you feel it as it goes down.

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:49.719
[plays note]

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:50.719
[student plays note]

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:51.719
You see, you can't... it doesn't want to be
on your finger nail. And that's the important

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:52.719
thing. It's not on your fingernail. It's on
that pad, that real nice thick pad.

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:53.719
[student plays note]

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:54.719
That's it.

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:55.719
[notes]

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:56.719
That's good. Now, see if you can make more
sound. And that means that you'll just...

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:57.719
[notes]

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:58.719
Yes, but your hands are looking a little bit
"like that." And they don't want to because

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:59.719
you want to get the full benefit of...the
full benefit of this little pad.

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:00.719
[playing]

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:01.719
That's excellent. Now, do it with rotation.

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:02.719
[playing]

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:03.719
But not by coming off very much.

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:04.719
[playing]

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:05.990
Perfect, perfect. That's fine.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.409
Well, that's really the story. And then you
will see - it seems like a very little story,

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.970
but it actually turns out that it's very big
when you're applying it to music because you

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.900
have so many opportunities to get subtleties
and different durations and all that stuff.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:31.260
So then, I think we're going to start with
some playing.
