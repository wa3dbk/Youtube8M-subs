00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:09.462
let's come to the test run.

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:11.705
During the trial run, we try to find out

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:15.050
how many containers we need to maintain a constant humidity

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.791
of 60% and 80%.

00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:19.544
To check the humidity,

00:00:19.544 --> 00:00:20.987
We first have to verify that the hygrometer

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.356
show the correct numbers

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:26.985
The left Hygromether for example shows a humidity

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:29.658
67, the right 57%. So one of them isn't

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:31.162
working properly

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.197
to check the hygrometer we wrap them

00:00:34.197 --> 00:00:38.646
in a damp cloth and wait 30min-1hour.

00:00:38.646 --> 00:00:42.310
The hygrometer should be at a humidity

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.750
of 95%, if this is not the case we

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.686
adjusted the hygrometer according to right value or ads/subtract the difference.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:56.359
If it shows 100% but it should be 95%

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.529
we have to deduct 5%

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.331
Now that we know the hygrometers are working

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:07.895
we can put them in the incubator and turn it on.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:10.502
The surface area of water within your incubator

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:14.769
will influence the humidity. The depth of the water

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:17.067
has absolutely no bearing on the humidity

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:20.805
I'm using for 60% humidity two plastic cups a 0.2 ml

00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:24.145
If your humidity is to low you have to

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:25.704
put more water surface in the incubator

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:26.548
either through a sponge

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:28.313
or by adding additional containers

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.416
If you have too much humidity you take out water surface

00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:36.611
I would recommend to let the incubator

00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:38.986
run for 2 hours

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:40.040
and then check the values again

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:42.530
In the first 14 days you should have a humidity

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:45.300
of 50-65%, which I have now reached

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.870
Therefore, one can now look

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:51.110
how much container we need for 80%.

00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:55.010
For me it's two more 0.2 ml cups

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:59.440
2 hours later the

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:01.650
humidity is at 74%

00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:05.120
in a few minutes I would have reached 80%

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.750
but because I want to upload the video today I will stop here,

00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:12.230
the temperature is not a problem thanks to the thermostat

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:17.220
without a thermostat you have to try around.

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:20.120
for the thermostat I use the on temparatur of

00:02:20.118 --> 00:02:28.350
37.6 ° C and the off temperature is also at 37.6 ° C

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.970
there is then a fluctuation

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:34.390
between 37.3 to 37.8 ° C, which is ok,

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:38.900
a Motor breeder should have a temperature of 37.6 degrees

00:02:38.897 --> 00:02:42.470
and a Incubator without fans one of 38.3 degrees
