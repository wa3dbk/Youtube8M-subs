00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
She's Victoria she's a year and two months old,

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:29.001
she changed my life completely.

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:35.002
Being a parent is very difficult but it's an amazing responsibility.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.003
I think it was a good change in my life. She arrived in a great moment.

00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:45.004
Well if she wants to i'll tattoo her.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:57.005
Seeing rock bands that were all tattooed, that caught my attention,

00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:06.006
then i saw a cousin that tattooed and i started to interest on everything that had to be with tattoos.

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:14.007
My first tattoo was for a cousin, I tattood him an aztec calendar and well it didn't come up so well.

00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:29.008
Tattoing is a way of expressing a lot of things, it can just be an ornament,

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:39.009
or the memory of a moment, a story. It can also be to thank for something

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.010
or to remember a person, there are so many things that a tattoo may represent.

00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:54.011
I've had the chance to tattoo people that are paying a promise,

00:01:54.012 --> 00:02:04.012
I tattooed some young guys that were kidnapped and the promise was to get Jesus' face tattooed.

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:15.013
To another girl, I tattooed her the Virgin of Guadalupe as a gratitude for being released after being kidnapped.

00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:43.014
I was in another store, there I got the call form PUMA and they told me

00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:50.015
that they'd love my work especially because it represents mexican art, you know? 

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:57.016
the little sugar skulls, the revolutionary skulls, like everything very mexican.

00:02:57.017 --> 00:03:01.017
They liked my work and they called me for this project.

00:03:01.018 --> 00:03:06.018
In tattooing is very difficult to get this kind of recognition,

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.019
especially in Mexico where tattooing is still a tabu,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.020
it has grown a lot, i've been tattooing for 17 years now and at the begining I had to hide, 

00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:22.021
hide from my parents, hide from society so now having a brand like this one

00:03:22.022 --> 00:03:29.022
calling me to express my art, my country, it's so cool.

00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:46.023
I took the skulls because is something so typical of Mexican culture, you know?

00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:56.024
To keep laughing at death, then the shield, the eagle devouring the snake,

00:03:56.025 --> 00:04:04.115
this skull that's breaking this chains as a symbol of liberation and freedom.

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:26.116
This is a 'charrita,'you know? a mexican girl but very tattoed.

00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:53.117
I love my country, I like my culture so much, I love the art that's done in Mexico,

00:04:54.118 --> 00:05:02.118
from prehispanic era to these days, every day that I go out I find 

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:07.119
something new that can be sketched or designed to put it in a tattoo.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.120
For me it's very cool that people trusts me to tattoo them

00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:37.121
something i sketched on their skin with absolute freedom to choose the lines of the size i want,

00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:43.122
 the colors of the size i want because at the end they've seen my work and they know that 

00:05:43.123 --> 00:05:49.123
respect will always be there, that i'm going to do a good job

00:05:49.124 --> 00:05:54.124
and that i'll give my best even if it's a tiny work o a whole back.

00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:04.125
Well the tattoo i'm going to do it to Manolo. Manolo is a good customer, a good friend,

00:06:05.126 --> 00:06:11.126
has a good amount of tattoos related to mexican themes, prehispanic,

00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:17.127
things that are very characteristic of mexicans and I'll try and do it the most alike

00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:22.128
to the desing we already did for PUMA.

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:33.129
Every time I finish a tattoo i thank the person, really is something that i'll never stop doing,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:41.130
It's being humble with the gang i'm so far away of saying I already tattooed you, get lost!

00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:45.131
No no no, it's more like thank you so much for trusting me.
