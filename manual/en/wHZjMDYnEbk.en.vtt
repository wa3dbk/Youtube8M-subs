Hi, Steve Vandertuuk here, we're down
here at volunteer park in Romeoville, Il.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.580
Here today to check out the new Bushnell
Speedster III Radar Gun, and today

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.880
we're just going to show you a couple of
the finer points of this brand new

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.880
machine.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.380
Let's take a look at the new Speedster III,
a couple things you're going to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.750
notice right off the bat,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.469
we don't have a whole lot going on here.
We've got one button here which is going to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.850
set our modes, we have one trigger here which is
going to clock our speeds, very simple

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.109
operation. Nice thing about this, when
you're ready to go click the trigger

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.510
once, you're already in continuous mode. I
can hold this anyway i want

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.240
and I'm going to get a clock speed.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.970
Now, important things to remember here when
your clocking speed, angles are very

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.900
important.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.220
You want to be straight as you can be

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.490
behind or in front of the pitcher.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.920
You want the ball or whatever you're
clocking coming directly at you. You will

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.340
get perfect, exact, and instant readings
with this unit as long as you are

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.330
straight onto your target.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.400
Nice thing about the Speedster III, it
will do both miles per hour and kilometers per hour.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.000
Simply hold the trigger, push your button,
it's going to switch your modes, it's that simple.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.890
The Speedster III isn't just for baseball
or softball. We use it for a variety of

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.140
sports, anything that's moving you can
pretty much clock this: tennis balls,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.120
soccer balls, NASCAR which is real big
now. This can clock a car from over 1500

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.520
feet away accurately up to
200 miles an hour. For you NASCAR fans

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.770
they average about 196, so
you're right on the money with this.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.700
All of this comes together in this nice
little package at a very affordable

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.420
price, I think you're going to be
surprised.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.070
We hope you found this video informative,
this product is available on OpticsPlanet.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.070
I'm Steve Vandertuuk, thanks for watching.
