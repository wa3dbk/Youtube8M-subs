00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.720
How to Transform Hair from Frizzy to Smooth.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.650
Say goodbye to frizz – and hello to luscious
locks – by embracing the science of smooth.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.500
You will need Smoothing shampoo, conditioner,
and styling products Blow-dryer with diffuser

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.730
Curling iron or flatiron Cotton T-shirt (optional)
and brush (optional).

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.730
Step 1.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.690
To achieve all-day smooth, start with a conditioning
shampoo that penetrates hair to the core and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.370
helps protect each strand from breakage.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.080
A conditioning shampoo will also help align
the strands, reducing the inter-fiber spaces

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.100
that can make frizz seem even more unruly.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.100
Step 2.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.500
Apply a moisturizing conditioner; it's important
that your shampoo and conditioner work in

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.820
unison.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.079
Conditioner lubricates the hair surface, providing
a barrier between your hair and the environment

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.980
-- helping to lock in good moisture and keep
out the humidity that causes frizz.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.980
Step 3.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.300
Rinse your hair thoroughly.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.140
Then, gently blot excess water from your hair
with a clean towel.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.689
Aggressive towel-drying can damage cuticles.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.920
For a gentler option, try blotting hair with
a cotton T-shirt.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.920
Step 4.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.530
Apply a leave-in cream with humidity protection.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.990
By repelling moisture in the air, it provides
yet another barrier to the elements.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.990
Step 5.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.360
If you want to keep your curls, use a diffuser,
scrunching the ends as you dry.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.670
If you want a straight look, blow-dry it until
it's 95 percent dry and then blow it out with

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.710
a brush.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.870
With either texture, smooth just the ends
with a curling iron or flatiron for a more

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.979
finished look.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.711
Make sure your hair is completely dry before
you leave the house; if it's still damp, it

00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:43.890
may absorb moisture from the air, resulting
in frizz.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.940
Step 6.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.700
Help lock in your smooth look with a hair
spray formulated to keep out frizz; its fixative

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.340
polymers will help keep each hair in place.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.090
Once sprayed, refrain from unnecessarily combing,
brushing, and touching your hair.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.090
Step 7.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.420
Enjoy those smooth tresses.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.810
You and your hair are ready for anything!
