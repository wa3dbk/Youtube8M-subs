00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Let's Go!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
You're doing it wrong
When you're brushing your teeth

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:04.625
Remember this song
For the proper technique

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:07.695
It's the modified bass
And it's all up in your face

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:10.704
Do it two times a day
To keep the decay away

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:13.705
Get that dirt off, your shoulder
Get that food out, your teeth

00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:16.664
Brush 2 minutes, or longer
To keep your grills clean

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:19.564
We're attacking the plaque
And we don't barter with tartar

00:00:19.564 --> 00:00:23.244
No gingivitis inside us
All our smiles stronger

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:27.344
Chewing surface easy
You just give it a brush [ah]

00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:29.215
Brushy-Brush [ah]
Brushy-Brushy-Brush [ah]

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:32.455
But for the inside and outside
You got to get your gum-line

00:00:32.455 --> 00:00:35.604
Toothbrush at an angle
Hold it 45!

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:38.585
Hold in place, and you give a little shake
[ah]

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:42.144
Then you brush it down as you flick it away
now

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:44.915
Flick it away, flick it away, flick it away
now

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:47.485
Repeat for every tooth
And just flick it away now

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:50.674
Now you're doing it right
When you're brushing your teeth

00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:53.514
Remember this song
For the proper technique

00:00:53.514 --> 00:00:56.615
It's the modified bass
And it's all up in your face

00:00:56.615 --> 00:00:59.755
Do it two times a day
To keep the decay away

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:02.675
Get that dirt off, your shoulder
Get that food out, your teeth

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:05.724
Brush 2 minutes, or longer
To keep your grills clean

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:08.495
Keep attacking the plaque
And never barter with tartar

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:12.285
No gingivitis inside us
And now our smiles are stronger

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:15.065
Now you're doing it right
When you're brushing your teeth

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:17.945
Remember this song
For the proper technique

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:21.025
It's the modified bass
And it's all up in your face

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:24.025
Do it two times a day
To keep the decay away

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:27.085
Get that dirt off, your shoulder
Get that food out, your teeth

00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:30.144
Brush 2 minutes, or longer
To keep your grills clean

00:01:30.144 --> 00:01:32.934
Keep attacking the plaque
And never barter with tartar

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:36.945
No gingivitis inside us
And now our smiles are stronger

00:01:36.945 --> 00:01:41.934
You might as well call me Rick Floss or Fluo
Rida.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:45.305
The way that I'm spreading this dental knowledge.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.305
Peace!

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.805
Hey everybody.

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:51.504
Thanks for watching the Modified Bass Dental
Rap.

00:01:51.504 --> 00:01:55.165
Secret note, if you listen to the song while
brushing your teeth, it will be the right

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:56.964
amount of time that you should brush.

00:01:56.964 --> 00:02:01.284

00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:09.965
Thanks for watching.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:10.585
