00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.800
The pistol and mantis shrimps are both crustaceans
that snap their claws and perform magic.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.240
Well, at least a sound and light show: the
jet of water squeezed out from between their

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.360
claws travels at such speeds that it cavitates
- the liquid water under negative pressure

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.360
is literally pulled apart into bubbles of
water vapor.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.380
When the bubbles collapse in on themselves,
they give off a loud "snap," and amazingly,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.310
a small flash of light.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.300
The shrimp use the sonic shock wave to stun
or kill prey, but physicists are far more

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.500
interested in the flash of light, because
we still don't exactly know why it happens.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.160
Collapsing bubbles can also be created in
a laboratory simply by using sound - since

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.360
sound, as we know, is basically just molecules
repeatedly pushing against each other and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.990
then pulling apart, if the sound waves are
intense enough, the low pressure will again

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.210
be low enough to pull the liquid apart into
vapor and cause cavitation bubbles.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.190
The bubbles then collapse, and under certain
circumstances, they produce light even brighter

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.190
than the shrimp.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.620
This phenomenon of turning sound into light
is called "sonoluminescence."

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.090
We know that the light flashes are incredibly
short - lasting only about 100 picoseconds

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.439
- and are surprisingly high energy, meaning
the collapsing bubbles may be up to 10 times

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440
hotter than the surface of the sun.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.760
We don't know for sure, though, how the inside
of the bubble gets that hot, or what exactly

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.120
is giving off the light.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.490
The bubble collapses so quickly that the gases
inside are heated by compression, but the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.170
increased pressure might also cause water
vapor in the bubble to rapidly condense back

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.010
to a liquid, releasing large amounts of latent
heat.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.720
And the flash itself might come from glowing
red-hot Argon or Xenon gas in the air bubble,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.340
OR from heat tearing water vapor apart into
hydroxide and hydrogen ions which then recombine

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.119
and give off light, OR from the whole interior
of the bubble getting hot enough to become

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.659
a glowing plasma - OR it might be a combination.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.890
Either way, the cool thing about sonoluminescence
is that it's still not fully understood despite

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.400
being fairly simple to create - I mean, you
can buy a basic sonoluminescence kit off the

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
web!

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.229
Or just get a pet mantis shrimp.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.780
If you want to hear about more unexplained
phenomena in science, a whole bunch of youtubers

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.150
like vsauce, veritasium, thebrainscoop, and
so forth have made videos about "unanswered

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.350
science questions" which you can find listed
in the "All Time 10s" video of the same name.
