00:00:01.221 --> 00:00:02.582
Hi.

00:00:02.582 --> 00:00:06.290
Whether it's for Shabbat,
a Jewish holiday,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.520
it's cold outside, or
you've got a bad cold,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.500
chicken soup is always
perfect for the situation.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.150
So today, I thought I'd show
you how to make chicken soup.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.780
And it's very, very easy.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.940
First thing you need to do
is take about 3 to 5 quarts

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.180
of water, depending on
the size of your pot,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.240
because the most important
thing is the water

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.500
has to cover your chicken.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.440
Take your chicken and
put it into the pot.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, this is a chicken
cut up into eighths.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.910
I know some people like to use
just the backs and the necks

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.920
and the wings.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.900
But I like to use all
variety from the chicken

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.130
because it adds full
flavor to the soup.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.090
Not only that, but you've got
a lot of variety of chicken

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.310
that will be perfect for
eating chicken salad.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.730
So there we have it.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.770
That's all you need to do
for the first 30 minutes.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.379
You're going to let
it come to a boil.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.460
And then we' ll skim the top.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.560
Now, what I want you to see is
that this chicken was fatty.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.040
You want it fatty.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.320
I know, you're looking
to have something

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.370
that's healthy and
nutritious and low-calorie.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.530
When the chicken soup
is cold, the chicken fat

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.100
will come to the top, and
you can scrape it off.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.680
But for now, the chicken
fat will add good flavor

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.520
to the soup,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.270
It's now been a half hour
since the chicken's been

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.900
cooking in the plain water.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.050
So I remove the lid.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.640
And I notice that there
is a lot of-- actually,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.160
this one's pretty good.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.250
But there is a lot of
residue on the top.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.550
This comes from the coagulation
of the blood and the bones

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.090
from the cut pieces of chicken.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.699
And it discolors your soup.

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:52.740
So you want to remove it.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.230
So what I like to do is use a
skimmer or even a mesh strainer

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.690
and just go like that,
and then the particles

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.260
come right into the strainer.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.010
And then I get it
out of my soup.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.306
It's as easy as that.

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:09.710
Now that I've gotten the
residue, or the scum,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.540
off the top, I'm about
to add the vegetables.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.690
So I'm going to take one
turnip that I peeled,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.522
whole, one onion-- whoops--
one onion that I peeled, whole.

00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:34.570
I've got fresh
dill, fresh parsley,

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.640
two celery stalks with the
leaves if you have them,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.465
and about three carrots
cut into about 1-,

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:46.511
1 and 1/2-inch lengths.

00:02:46.511 --> 00:02:48.010
And you can cut
them on the diagonal

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.590
as long as you don't
make them so thin

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.010
that they'll fall
apart when cooking.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:04.900
To that, I add some salt. Now,
I tend to under-salt, one,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.820
because I'm using
kosher chicken,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.880
and kosher chicken
has been salted,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.670
so it has a little
bit more salt.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.310
And the other reason is I'd
rather add salt at the end

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.980
than at the beginning.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.640
Some people add
whole peppercorns.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.930
Some people add white pepper
so that you can't see it.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.750
I don't really care
about that too much.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.780
And I add some grindings
of fresh black pepper.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.830
Stir it a little so that I can
submerge all the vegetables.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.510
This is probably a little
bit more water than you need.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.420
But that's OK.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.020
It'll boil down.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.520
So that's it.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.255
Put a lid on it.

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:48.320
Put it on simmer.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.720
Leave it alone for
about two hours.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.230
After our soup is done,
we'll strain the soup

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.470
and remove all the vegetables.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.950
You can munch on them
later, but save your carrot

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.990
to put into your soup.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.540
And save your chicken for
making delicious chicken salad.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.730
So here is our chicken soup
ready to go, nice and hot.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.966
Eat in good health.
