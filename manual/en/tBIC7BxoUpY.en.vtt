00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.731
Recently, I’ve had a few Art students ask
me for advice for what to do after they have

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:10.639
finished their studies and go out into the
world with a degree tucked under their arms

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.960
- looking for a job.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.750
Well, It’s a long time since I started and
things have changed a lot.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.370
Back then there was no internet - just the
Artist’ and Writers Year book that contained

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.520
a lot of addresses and phone numbers.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.410
I made a list of all the companies I wanted
to work for, phoned them up and made appointments

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.230
to see the art directors.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.980
Then I trudged around London showing my portfolio.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.899
Sadly, it just doesn’t work that way anymore.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.929
Art Directors are under a lot of pressure
and pretty much rely on Agents to do the sifting

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.530
and sorting for them.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.550
There didn’t used to be illustrator websites
either - I don’t subscribe to them.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.510
Little pictures of your work on a site like
that, look just like everyone else’s.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.580
The only calls I ever got from illustrator
sites were from other illustrator sites wanting

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.509
me to show my work there too - and pay for
it!

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.490
I asked an influential Art Director last week
just how much has changed, and this is what

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.250
she said”

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.280
“The sad thing is, there are so many 100’s
of budding artists all trying to get their

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.509
work seen these days that I could employ someone,
full time, just to see portfollios or answer

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.859
illustrators’ emails.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.630
It feels so harsh to say it, but in these
tough times, we simply don’t have the resources

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.170
to see illustrators unless their work shows
a unique commercial promise.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.390
Artists can certainly email or send in samples
to Art Directors and Publishers and, in my

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.310
experience, they all get looked at.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.200
Sadly, the majority will get a “thanks but
no thanks” reply, but if the work looks

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.799
exceptionally promising they’ll either get
a request for more samples or be invited to

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.780
show their work, in person.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.520
The key words here are UNIQUE and COMMERCIAL
PROMISE if they want to be seen.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520
?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.520
And there you have it.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.430
If you want to work as an artist, making work
to sell or to be commissioned, you have to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.700
be commercial.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.640
I’m afraid your degree is not going to help
you, unless you are going into art management

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.030
or other full-time jobs where qualifications
may be taken into account.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.140
Your degree has bought you three or four years
to experiment and find your true purpose in

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.210
life.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.130
A degree in art is pretty much a certificate
of attendance.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.489
It is your work and your portfolio that really
counts.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.000
I’m not saying that degree is worthless
- you need the time, guidance and the companionship

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.570
of like-minded people that a degree offers
to develop you skills and ideas.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.330
But please don’t think the world owes you
work and riches just because you have that

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.080
piece of paper in your hand.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.590
If you are still at college, the best thing
you can do is to learn about marketing and

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.909
and start planning your final degree show.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.959
A final degree show is not just a nice exhibition
to show your parents what you’ve been doing

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.629
for three or four years, it’s a serious
show case.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.269
You can’t rely on your teachers or professors
to do it for you either.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.010
Start planning a humdinger of a show.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.690
If you are miles away from the centre of the
art world, hire a place near where the buyers

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.230
are and start targeting them to make sure
they come and see your work.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.660
You may be in a sleepy backwater university
town that has been lovely and delightful for

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.569
the past few years, but Art buyers and commissioners
are not going to go out of their way to come

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.480
and see your show!

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.620
You need agents to see your show too.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.900
They probably all live somewhere fancy too!

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.980
Are you getting my drift?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.590
Go and read about how Damien Hurst organised
the Freeze exhibition when he left College.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.469
I’ll put a link below.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:18.060
It rocketed him and his college friends to
almost instant stardom.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.799
He and his friends are really successful now.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.360
It would be hard to repeat what he did, but
you can learn a lot from his tactics.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.800
While you have college or university facilities
available start producing business cards and

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.889
posters to send to people.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.710
Start getting in touch with agents or, if
you are a bit of an entrepreneur, start to

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.070
learn something about business and marketing.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.550
It is not rocket science, and you are allowed
to be the master of your future success.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.789
There is no law that says you must have a
gallery or an agent.

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.190
Starving artists starve because they don’t
make work that people want to buy.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.919
Successful artists make stuff that people
want and they learn how to market it and sell

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:08.919
it.

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.120
Do not get seduced by the starving artist
in the garret idea.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.630
This fantasy was dreamed up by the writers
of romantic operas whose audiences loved to

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.920
wallow in stories about bohemian failures
dying of TB in rat infested attics.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.990
This is romantic nonsense.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.270
Artists are allowed to earn a living as much
as anyone else and they do not have to suffer

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.440
for it.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.350
Like anyone else trying to make a success
of their lives, you may have to make a few

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:44.259
sacrifices but you don’t have to wallow
in artistic pain - this is a lie devised by

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:49.740
devious agents and gallery owners to keep
artists on a tight leash.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.349
More than anything else keep making the work
and keep making it better.

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.740
Know who you are - know who you are making
it for and make your work for them - they

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.690
are the ones who are going to buy it and make
your future the success you so desire.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.440
I’ll talk more about marketing in another
video because I don’t think people really

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.080
understand what that term means.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.690
Until then, keep drawing drawing drawing,
practice practice practice - keep making the

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.820
work - keep making it better and I’ll see
you next time.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.170
You take care now, bye bye.
