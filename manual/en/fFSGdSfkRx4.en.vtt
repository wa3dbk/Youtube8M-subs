Running shoes are all the fashion rage
these days, and, interestingly enough,

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.963
white soled running shoes
are pretty darn fashionable.

00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:13.305
The issue is white soled running shoes
get dirty really quick and can be

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:16.301
a bit of a challenge to take care of.
So, in order to get your running shoes

00:00:16.301 --> 00:00:20.317
in Jerry Seinfeld condition,
I'm going to show you a few quick

00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:22.721
and easy cleaning tips on how
you can bring your shoes

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.810
back to looking beautiful.

Everybody wants
to know how to clean

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:31.985
their running shoes,
and I get this question a lot.

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:36.745
I would love to give you a one size fits
all answer, but unfortunately because not

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:40.598
all shoes, shoe materials, and shoe
manufacturers are created equal,

00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:44.813
there's not one easy answer.
But what I can do is give you

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:48.598
a couple of good pointers
or starting places so that you

00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:50.687
can get your shoes
as clean as possible.

Since white soles are sexy,
[whistle] I'm going to show you

00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:59.150
exactly how to make sure
that these look amazing all the time.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.412
So these are relatively new shoes for me.
They're not that messed up.

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:07.113
But if you look at these, they definitely
have a little bit more wear in them.

00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:10.132
So the way to get these
absolutely clean is to make

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:14.184
a solution of equal parts
baking soda and laundry detergent.

00:01:14.184 --> 00:01:16.889
I'm using scent free
and color free, but you can use

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:19.860
whatever you feel good about using.
Mix that together in a bowl

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.935
and then apply that to the stained area
using a cleaning toothbrush.

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:26.606
Now you don't need too much
product here, just enough

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:28.811
to make sure you can start
agitating that dirt off.

00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:31.203
So rub it a few times
with the toothbrush.

00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:33.536
Then you're going to use
a sponge, rinse it with

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:35.672
a little bit of cold water
and pat it to dry.

00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:37.797
You should see those
stains come right off.

Here's a quick little cheat for you
to keep your runners clean on the go

00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:49.175
if, for whatever reason, you don't have
access to the actual cleaning materials

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.682
I just covered.
Get yourself one of these.

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:54.097
It's a white eraser.
You can pick it up at an art store

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:57.080
or an office supply store.
Don't get a pink one or a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.691
custom shape or character.
Just this one is exactly what you need.

00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:03.837
What you'll do, and this will work
on leather and this will work on rubber.

00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:08.306
Just find the area that's affected,
aka a little bit dirty, and literally

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:10.837
start erasing that stain
the same way you would erase

00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:14.807
a long division homework issue
that you have been having.

00:02:14.807 --> 00:02:17.419
I know you're going to start carrying
one of these around in your purse

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.776
or your pocket.
I carry one around in my purse,

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:22.922
and my life has definitely
been improved ever since.

There's no sense in having beautifully
clean shoes if you're going to have

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.616
really raunchy laces.
So what you can do is

00:02:32.616 --> 00:02:35.228
simply pre-treat the
dirty areas of the laces,

00:02:35.228 --> 00:02:37.353
because God knows
where these things have ended up.

00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:40.348
You can use a bit of laundry detergent,
a bit of dish detergent, a little bit

00:02:40.348 --> 00:02:42.960
of stain pre-treater.
Whatever you've got handy is fine.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.928
Then just find yourself a delicates bag.
Again, this is why I talk about them

00:02:46.928 --> 00:02:48.994
all the time.
You use them for absolutely everything.

00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:52.883
Throw your laces into the delicates bag.
Wash them as you normally would,

00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:55.249
and your laces will be good to go.

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.780
Now, while they're washing,
what you can do is clean

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.368
the little area where the
laces go, those little holes.

00:03:00.368 --> 00:03:04.072
You can use a cleaning toothbrush
with a little bit of laundry detergent

00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:06.184
and a little bit of water.
Give then a quick scrub

00:03:06.184 --> 00:03:08.344

them and you'll be good.

If you notice that your shoes
are crazy dirty because, big surprise,

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:16.609
you're one of the people that
actually wears running shoes

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.613
because you exercise, what you
can do is let those shoes dry entirely.

00:03:21.613 --> 00:03:24.620
Then you're going to get yourself
a cleaning toothbrush or perhaps

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.813
a brush that's a little bit bigger,
I just don't have one handy,

00:03:26.813 --> 00:03:30.517
and you're literally going to take
your shoe and the brush and start

00:03:30.517 --> 00:03:33.488
dry brushing that dirt off.
It's a lot easier to deal with

00:03:33.488 --> 00:03:36.565
once it's actually dry.
So let that all fall to the ground.

00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:40.965
Once that's done, you'll have a little bit
of dirt left, and you can make a solution

00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:44.634
of a teaspoon of laundry detergent
to about a cup of water.

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:48.557
Dip your cleaning toothbrush
or a cleaning cloth or a sponge

00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:53.445
in that solution and then just lightly
start to clean the dirty areas.

00:03:53.445 --> 00:03:56.092
The idea is you don't want
to get the shoe too, too wet.

00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:58.959
Again, some shoes really
can't sustain any water.

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.347
And then, once that's done,
you're going to take a clean sponge,

00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:06.586
you're going to take some clean water,
you're going to rinse off any of those

00:04:06.586 --> 00:04:09.674
extra suds, and then you're going
to leave your shoe to dry.

00:04:09.674 --> 00:04:11.706
Now you're not putting it
under artificial heat.

00:04:11.706 --> 00:04:15.199
You're literally just letting it
air dry and do it's thing.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:21.013
Now, interestingly, you can do
the same exact thing for your sock liner.

00:04:21.013 --> 00:04:24.321
If you notice that it is
a little bit on the pungent side,

00:04:24.321 --> 00:04:27.909
you can take that mixture
of laundry detergent and water,

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.834
just scrub a cleaning
toothbrush in that mixture

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:33.423
and then start cleaning the sole.
Rinse it well.

00:04:33.423 --> 00:04:36.987
Lay that flat to dry and that
should smell a lot better.

00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:39.761
And if you want to be really special,
you can sprinkle a little bit

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.339
of baking soda on that
while it dries overnight.

The video explains exactly how
to use it, so definitely check that

Just make sure that you always label

your bag of foot powder because,
frankly, bags with white powder in them

And like I always say, if you want to

00:05:13.683 --> 00:05:17.676
actually clean your shoes at home,
just check the manufacturer's website

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:19.812
and see what they have to say
about it, and then you can

00:05:19.812 --> 00:05:22.642
sort of use what I just said as the
guideline, combine that with what

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:25.196
you read on the website, do your thing,
make some cleaning magic,

making fun of stupid fashion trends.

Not saying this is a stupid fashion trend,
but I am curious to know: Do you think

wearing running shoes with like
a pretty nice outfit is a good trend?

00:05:55.551 --> 00:05:59.533
Or do you think it's like totally weird,
and we all look silly and ridiculous?

00:05:59.533 --> 00:06:02.041
Personally, I love the fact
that I can now get away with

00:06:02.041 --> 00:06:04.050
