For the Yemeni, hospitality is sacred. 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.040
Guests are welcomed with good coffee

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.040
made with leaves and with a touch

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.840
of the more classic Arabica blend 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.440
obtained from toasted coffee beans. 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.840
Sanaâ€™a coffee is made following age-old recipes. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.160
The aromatic effect of the spices is enhanced 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.640
by toasting, as taught by the Indians.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.560
The Arabica beans are crushed with the spices.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.640
The blend is then poured into boiling water and sugared.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.920
The brew is left on the fire until it boils over.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.320
The coffee is now ready to be served 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.920
as a welcoming gesture.
