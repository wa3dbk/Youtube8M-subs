00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.650
It is a fairly daunting environment with the IRB Tournaments, 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.840
you know, you’ve got 16 countries competing at those tournaments, 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.110
and there are some rugby powerhouse’s such as New Zealand and England. 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.590
And there are particularly in the women’s game countries 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.690
that aren’t perceived as Rugby power houses, but they do 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.890
have very strong women’s programs.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.970
(Push out.. Play on, Play on. Go again!)

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.660
We do a lot of on field training in relation to our 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.830
individual skill work and our team play. 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.840
And then, lots of education sessions with the girls as well. 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.010
And obviously the recovery is a big part as well. 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.020
Being able to recover from the first session of the day, 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.070
and be ready for the next session in the afternoon.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.480
The beauty of this group is they help each other 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.550
out really well. A lot of our girls come from either touch 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.660
or Oztag backgrounds, so they haven’t got the contact 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.230
skills as such. But they do have very good catch-pass 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.730
skills and very good spatial awareness.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.200
So it’s a very young squad for us to be taking away. 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.400
We’re a bit unlucky with injury, but it’s a great 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.670
opportunity for these young girls to step up now. 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.970
I think our team is very good, but very young. 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.870
We can take this opportunity though, and our back 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.370
line is pretty slick – we’ve got touchies in there. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.760
Also our forward’s are fairly experienced, 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.120
so I think it showed from our training session today 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.130
that we all kind of gelled and it felt really good, 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.530
so we’re on a great path towards London.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.600
My first major tournament was about six weeks ago, 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.500
and that was in Hong Kong and China. 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.300
That was where I debuted on the World Series Circuit

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.270
but London is obviously going to be another big tournament for me. 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.170
It’s still all new to me, so, I take it 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.740
very seriously and it will be very big.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.670
While the World Cup in Russia is our immediate focus, 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.250
you know, the ultimate big picture is Rio, 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.320
and all this development we’re doing and the talent

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.720
 ID that we’re doing is aimed at Rio. An example of that, 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.730
we’ve got the Sydney Youth Olympic Festival that 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.630
was on in January. We had some good success there, 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.800
and girls from that squad were invited into various 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.410
training camps here at the AIS. 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.670
And they’ve forced their way into the squad.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.870
Oh I love, I love coming here. Just to train, eat, 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.170
sleep and that’s all I want to do.(Laughs) 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.740
I’ve learnt so much from Laney and Scotty. 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.550
Just the way my running lines... It’s totally different to fifteens.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.720
And you just have to think.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.790
The day’s pretty full on, there’s not much downtime. 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.600
And then at night time we’re pretty much looking over 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.300
our video analysis, so, it’s pretty full on but we’ve 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.170
got the facilities here that help us out to recover 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.870
well and get us to train together very well.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.940
(Make an early call. You see him switching, you make that early call)

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.950
This camp has probably been one of our better 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.920
preparations for a tournament. You know, I’m quietly 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.590
confident of going to both London and Amsterdam 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.090
and giving a much better display than what we put on in China.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.390
(It’s in the five, it’s in the five! Yes!)

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.360
