00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.320
Hi everyone. So it would seem that
Microsoft is

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.880
rather desperate to bring out some exclusives for their Xbox One

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.559
console in 2015.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.210
They've done a deal with Crystal
Dynamics, makers and creators and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.609
publishers of Tomb Raider

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.269
to bring the new Tomb Raider game
exclusively to Xbox

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.160
in 2015. Now one thing I noticed during the conference was how quick they were to add the words 2015,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.670
that does suggest to me that this is a timed exclusive not a locked-in

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.020
exclusive. Essentially we should see
Tomb Raider

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.250
appearing on the PlayStation consoles
in 2016 I would say.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.129
Now Microsoft must have ponied-up a
substantial amount of money

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.350
right now to do this deal because I can't
see any

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.860
reasonable publisher saying to itself
hang on a second, 5 million consoles there,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.090
10 million consoles there. Why don't we sell for both and have 15 million

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.500
potential copies of this game sold. What
Microsoft must have done

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.730
is underwritten all of the sales they were
expecting to get

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.760
on Sony's console and then thrown in some extra cash as well.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.840
Will this make a difference for
Microsoft?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.810
Does having Tomb Raider sell consoles?
Mmmm

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.509
I don't think it does. No matter the
quality of the new Tomb Raider games

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.500
that are being produced,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.780
it's not really a console shifter. It's a
very single player game

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.470
at the end of the day. It's going to be 
interesting to see what the sales

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.210
numbers do with this

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.650
I would expect to see it in bundled Xbox
One and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.810
Tomb Raider special edition of some sort
around the game's release

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.479
but I don't think it's going to shift
consoles. Microsoft has a real problem

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.020
right now.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.020
None of the games that have appeared in their slate have really

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.299
screamed to me, I want to buy an Xbox One console.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.720
I already own one, obviously. But from a
point of view of mass consumers none of

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380
these games that I saw at Gamescom from
Microsoft really

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.670
gave me that... ooh, they've done it, this is
the game that

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.329
everyone is going to want to jump on and
play, I don't think Tomb Raider also can

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:55.950
be included there

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.950
really. Thanks for watching, do please
