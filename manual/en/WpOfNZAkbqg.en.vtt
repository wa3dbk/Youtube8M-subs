00:00:09.153 --> 00:00:10.511
H Everybody. Welcome again

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.683
to one of the videos by Loudest reviews

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.129
Today we're going to be showing you

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:17.639
 a re issue of the Epiphone Wilshire

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.077
This a classic design that Epiphone

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.256
started doing in the early 60s.

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:25.112
Originally came out with some other

00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:27.685
humbuckers, the P90 single coils

00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:30.167
Later on on 65, 66 they

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:31.806
they switch to this type of humbucker

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:33.349
the mini humbuckers

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.311
and that became a classic among rock artist

00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:41.508
From Jimmy Hendrix, to Jhonny winters, Paul Gilbert 

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:42.632
and it became really 

00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:43.692
after it got discountinued

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:45.502
 a very sought after model

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:48.980
One of those in the vintage market, it will cost you

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.023
a lot of Doe, probably 5 to 10 grand for one of those

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:53.694
60s Wilshire models

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:56.130
and they actually sound amazing

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:58.013
This is without a doubt

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:01.415
a faithful reproduction of those

00:01:02.053 --> 00:01:04.051
or at least one that sound really, really great 

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:29.509
All right!. It's sounding a little loud in the studio

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:30.695
We're rocking!

00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:33.566
As you can see the Epiphone Wilshire

00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:36.154
excels when using distortion 

00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:38.372
and the bridge humbucker

00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:40.632
I particularly love the very balanced

00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:41.866
a little compressed sound

00:01:42.348 --> 00:01:45.156
that of course has to do with the Fender Tone master

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:46.113
that I'm using now

00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:50.149
It's a classic, you know, Marshall distortion

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.599
I think it particularly sounds amazing

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:54.070
with the minihumbuckers

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.451
in the bridge position

00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:57.637
I'm going to play some other

00:01:58.293 --> 00:01:59.727
power chord so you can

00:01:59.727 --> 00:02:01.614
hear the distorted sounds that you may use

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:04.812
From classic rock, to more modern rock

00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:06.342
even to some heavy styles

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:10.029
where you could apply, heavy, heavy distortion

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.303
to this humbucker

00:02:31.178 --> 00:02:32.066
Combination of both

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:49.382
and when you go to the bridge

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:57.841
 a little more mellow

00:02:57.841 --> 00:02:58.945
If you don't hit it hard it will sound

00:02:58.945 --> 00:02:59.787
less bright

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.313
This is more of a sound for soloing that I will try now

00:03:22.573 --> 00:03:24.048
It sounds pretty interesting...

00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:25.527
I like it!

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:36.509
If you want it you could

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:38.352
get a lot of harmonics

00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:39.895
by doing the guitar thing

00:03:43.954 --> 00:03:46.387
I think this is a guitar, could be use for any

00:03:46.387 --> 00:03:49.349
rock style, wherever you're into blues

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:50.894
or more hard rock

00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:57.461
The bat, the batwing

00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:59.164
it looks a little bit like a batwing

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.518
and it gives it a retro look 

00:04:01.518 --> 00:04:03.751
that seems very cool to me

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.388
I like the appeal

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:07.664
you have the gold letters of Epiphone

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.119
and of course the classic logo

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.147
it features in this model 

00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:12.642
die cast tuners

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.375
I found them

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.573
in my few tunning sessions here at the studio

00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:19.256
that they are very very precise

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.408
 and they do not move

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:25.620
they don't let the string get out of tune very easily

00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:28.054
I tend to check for tunning all the time

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:30.143
having played with guitars that go out of tune

00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:31.142
very easily

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:33.388
and I have to say that this one stays in tune

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:34.685
perfeclty well

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:35.821
You'll have to abuse it a lot

00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:37.476
so it could go out of tune

00:04:37.853 --> 00:04:40.845
also the headstock angle helps a bit

00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:43.142
to keep the tunning in place

00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:46.134
The guitar is made out of Mahogany wood

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:49.768
the body and the glued in neck

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:51.892
In this case the finish we have is the

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:54.063
worn cherry red

00:04:54.373 --> 00:04:56.997
Of course the fret board is Rosewood

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.226
Very balanced, when you switch

00:05:07.427 --> 00:05:09.397
from one to the other

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.937
Neck

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.247
The combination of both

00:05:17.615 --> 00:05:18.020
and now

00:05:18.692 --> 00:05:19.413
the bridge

00:05:21.546 --> 00:05:23.043
This is a little more 

00:05:23.418 --> 00:05:25.540
High sounding

00:05:31.468 --> 00:05:34.011
and something else I really like about the guitar is that

00:05:34.213 --> 00:05:35.836
when you use the combinationof both

00:05:36.824 --> 00:05:37.848
each volume and tone

00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.186
That's marked with the letter V and T

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.671
Of course this volume and tone correspond

00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:45.383
to the neck pickup

00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:45.573
and this two to the bridge

00:05:45.573 --> 00:05:48.753
They can be combined

00:05:48.753 --> 00:05:50.001
kind like a mixer

00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:51.345
If you reduced the volume

00:05:52.154 --> 00:05:55.102
It adjust exaclty the amount of volume you provide from

00:05:55.102 --> 00:05:56.600
each microphone to the output

00:05:56.927 --> 00:05:59.893
All in all, I would name this Epiphone Wilshire

00:06:00.298 --> 00:06:02.028
re issue that Epiphone has

00:06:02.418 --> 00:06:05.647
very generously sent over, we're going to send it back

00:06:05.647 --> 00:06:06.395
don't worry, shortly

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.295
a winner. This is a winner guitar for sure

00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:15.602
very inexpensive, affordable for all kinds of

00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:16.615
guitar players

00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:19.720
and it provides with quality of a very expensive guitar

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:21.795
Another important thing to mention

00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:23.588
is that it's a very light guitar

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:25.039
I used to have a teacher that said

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.740
anything that's heavy is good. and I kind of agreed

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.752
with him

00:06:28.752 --> 00:06:29.687
most guitar players

00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:31.999
think that a heavy guitar is a good guitar

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:33.197
This would be an excemption

00:06:33.197 --> 00:06:34.507
this a very light guitar

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:35.898
that sounds amazing

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:37.551
and it's very well constructed

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:39.115
Without a doubt I 'd give it a shot

00:06:39.422 --> 00:06:42.137
 and test it if you have a chance to do so

00:06:42.137 --> 00:06:43.353
See if it fits your style

00:06:43.681 --> 00:06:45.960
Most probably will. Because

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.253
it's a versatile instrument

00:06:47.253 --> 00:06:48.398
that can be used

00:06:48.398 --> 00:06:49.765
in most any style i'd say

00:06:49.765 --> 00:06:51.264
Signing off, once again

00:06:51.264 --> 00:06:52.468
Gervasio 

00:06:52.468 --> 00:06:53.837
Thanks again for watching loudestreviews

00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:54.555
support it

00:06:54.865 --> 00:06:55.553
and see you soon.
