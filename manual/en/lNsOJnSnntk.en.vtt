The Best Cheap Tripod Bag
Hey guys Chris Winter here for another DSLR

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.490
video tip.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.940
Now I’ve been getting a few questions asking
how do I store my DSLR equipment because in

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.850
my last video I kinda showed how I did my
lenses and stuff but, obviously as DSLR film

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.300
makers we’ve got a lot more equipment, so
today I’m going to be showing you how I

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.550
store my DSLR equipment, my tripods, my monopods
pretty much anything that’s huge like my

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.099
boom poles as well.

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.340
Okay so this is how I do it.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.340
This is a fantastic fantastic tripod bag,
it’s padded and we’re gonna have a look

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.320
at it right now.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.899
Okay so this is my tripod bag it is an absolute
beast I think this is about as big as you’re

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.620
gonna get.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.280
This version is a 100 centimetres long and
is 20 centimetres wide which is really the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.420
most important thing because that means you
can get a lot of your stuff in there.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.900
Now I’ll open it up and I’ll show you
the amount of things that I can keep in this

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.360
bag.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.240
Alright, so right now I have a boom pole which
is a pretty small one.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.080
This is a Ktech traveller boom pole which
is probably one of the smallest boom poles

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.080
you’re gonna get.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.630
It still goes out to nearly 2 metres which
is really really good and it’s got a rode

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.079
NTG2 in there, what else have we got?

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.100
We’ve got this Velbon monopod which I’ve
actually turned into another boom pole with

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.100
this adapter.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.500
I’ll be doing a review on this one soon.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.040
This is really cool way if you want to make
a boom pole that’s wireless this is gonna

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.439
be happening very soon.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.740
I have the monopod which I’ve been reviewing
this for the last couple of days you guys

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.469
have been seeing this with the feet, this
is a fantastic monopod, I’ll put a link

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.780
here if you want to watch the review but that
fits in there as well.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.429
I’ve got a, I think it’s a 6 metre XLR
cable and this is just such a big cable that

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.459
you know it’s gonna fit in here.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:13.540
I have a mount for when you want to put the
rode NTG2 pistol grip which works there and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.950
I’ve got my Konova K2 slider which also
has the feet right here which I tape up, which

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.650
I, it’s a rubber band tape up and I’m
definitely gonna be doing a review on this

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.409
because I love this slider it is such a good
little thing to add to your film making kit,

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.680
so yeah that fits in perfectly.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.370
Now I’ve also got the tripod which is holding
my camera right now and the head which also

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.010
fit in this tripod bag but yeah it’s really
fantastic thing and you wanna be kind of being

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.989
able to use and carry all your stuff without
having to break it down that’s for me at

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:49.989
least.

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.329
Now the bag is really well made which is one
of the things I like as you can see here I’ll

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.239
give you the shot, the zipper, it’s a really
big zipper which means it’s probably not

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.599
gonna break, it’s also got the carry handle
here and a shoulder strap here which is a

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.390
really nice thing I just wrote my email address
which you’re all gonna see now just in case

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.010
I lose it.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.790
Other than that it’s gonna be fitting absolutely
everything I have and it also means when you’re

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.540
storing your equipment you know that anything
that’s kind of relatively long like a boom

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.219
pole or a monopod, or tripod or a slider is
gonna be in this bag so it mean you’re not

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:34.420
gonna be losing your stuff and that’s really
important guys, so that’s my tripod bag.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.519
So that was my review on this fantastic tripod
bag, look guys I can’t recommend enough

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.590
you need to be storing your tripods and sliders
in a good tripod bag because otherwise they’re

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.440
just gonna get broken especially sliders,
I’ve had a few troubles with them before

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.980
so keep them safe.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.680
Now I’ll put a link in the description box
below to a travel bag similar to this or the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.170
exact one I’m not really sure.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.810
If you want to pick up one for yourself but
yeah definitely recommend it.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.910
