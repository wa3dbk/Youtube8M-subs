00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.530
 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.920
hey guys this is Doug from Carson and today
we're going to check out a professional

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.429
level biological microscope of ours
called the MS-160.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.630
the MS-160 comes with a set of 10 power
wide field eye pieces which are great for

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.430
all around research. we've also included
a 16 power wide field set for an even

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.430
closer view.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.300
the benefit of having a wide field eye
piece is being able to inspect your

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.300
slide with a much larger viewing area.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.449
the eyepieces sit on top of a fully
adjustable binocular head that can

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.610
rotate 360 degrees.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.719
the frame of the microscope is made of
metal. it's well built and very sturdy.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.719
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.239
the fully adjustable binocular head can
be positioned to fit anyone. being able

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.109
to have two eyes on your specimen will
make locating and focusing much easier

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.769
and will also decrease the amount of eye
strain when used for a long period of time.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.769
 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.490
this microscope comes with four
different objective lenses

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.270
to choose from.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.480
a 4 power

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.570
a 10 power

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.440
a 40 power

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.500
and a 100

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.060
oil lens.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.600
this particular lens functions by using
the oil immersion technique.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.700
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.840
just place a tiny drop over your slide
and carefully submerge the objective

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
lens into the oil.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.120
this process will bring out details

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.120
that were impossible to see otherwise.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.120
 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.820
the results are also

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.200
strikingly clear.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.730
to figure out the magnification

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.330
range of your microscope just
multiply the power of the eyepieces with

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.400
the power of each individual objective
lens. in this case our 10 power wide field

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.700
eye pieces will give you a range from 40
to a 1000 times.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.920
to get deeper into your research, the 16 power wide
field set has a range of 64

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.920
to 1600 times.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.700
something as basic as a leaf sample can
bring you incredibly detailed results.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.930
the chart above represents the eight
different magnification settings that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.930
you can choose from.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.660
this microscope comes equipped with a
mechanical stage that allows you to

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.350
easily navigate through your slide. the
knobs are stacked to the right of the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.350
stage and add a ton of precision and control.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.050
 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.250
we've also added linear scales on the
sides to help you measure how far your

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.250
slide is actually moving.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.989
another feature included with this
microscope is an adjustable diopter. this

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.890
will compensate for any differences that
your left or right eye may have and is the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.890
first step towards getting the sharpest
image possible.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.360
the coarse and fine knobs can be found
on both sides of the microscope. they

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.080
have a nice fluid field that's great
for getting the stage to your ideal focal

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.350
distance.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.160
as for conrolling your light source, you're able to adjust the LED to any setting that you'd like.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.510
to give you even more control of
your light the MS-160 includes a

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.170
built-in iris for regulating how much
light passes through the slide

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.470
change the contrast

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.280
or background color of the light by
adding a colored filter into the holder

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.170
found underneath the stage.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.170
we've included a blue filter to get you
started.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.180
also this microscope comes with the
universal AC adapter that can work in

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.180
other countries where the voltage may
differ.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.300
the MS-160 is a professional level
biological microscope that packs a ton

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.370
of power and comfort.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.330
i recommend this to any professor,
scientist or enthusiast.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.420
i hope this video was helpful and i'll
see you next time

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.420
