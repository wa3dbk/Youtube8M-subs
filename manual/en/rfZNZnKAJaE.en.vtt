00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.710
Hi my friends! Look:  today we do

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.340
a tie or bow

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.370
for gifts.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.709
I have done this, as shown,

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.659
which incidentally I still have to match clothes,

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:18.509
but you can do it in newspaper,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.560
plastic, into a tape
lace ... een end: what you will. Is very

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.169
easy once you've gotten the hang,

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.030
and once you learn will no longer be
never forget.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.800
Let's do this:

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.630
the first thing I've done has been a
template.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.700
I've done in EVA but you can do it perfectly

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.609
in a carton,

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.230
plastic, or whatever you want.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.000
We passed it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.360
the EVA and we cut. Once
which is made

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.790
the bend a little and you will
do

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.070
two cuts. He is a star of seven
tips

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.720
and as you see a star with seven points in front of each end always remains an

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.930
corner.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.780
Why do I say this? because there are not tip against tip. So

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.270
we must look well

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.759
because we will always pass the loop from the point where

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:12.740
we are

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.230
We left wing tip

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.190
on the right. Always at the tip
we have the right to enter forever

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.530
to the side

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.770
board on the side of right.
Now we're going to see a lot more

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.960
clarity.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.530
We started to pass the tip of the loop

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.620
wherein the tape is

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.620
at both ends. We will leave sufficient room

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.620
because then it'll do the auction.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.860
We are going to work

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.080
on the opposite side: the side that
We leave a bit. He went through the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.730
right side of the tip. The tip has two sides,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.470
We went through the right side, we're in front, to the opposite corner,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.970
and passed through the tip of the right.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.570
We're going to go through the front and
side

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.110
tip

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.750
right side.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.190
We always go in front and corner
that makes us

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.329
we will use the bitch that is to
through the right side

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.839
always right corner
in front

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.739
right side.

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.419
So what we will do to

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:24.449
and spend all the time
com about minimum three times

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:25.909
For each

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.839
our tip

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.209
our star.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.569
We do

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.309
a tip of the star, we go
the opposite side, and the two

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:37.529
remaining tips

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:38.379
let's take

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.029
right side.

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.299
Good: once you are done

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.239
we get the star, we get the loop

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.069
and carefully holding it with one finger

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.049
we will give
stitches.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.129
As you see the piece we had left

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.980
At first it was to make the
auction, to the downtown loop.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.830
We stitches

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.359
(Could be a staple if paper
or something like that)

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.529
I've done it with a few stitches.

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.199
We cut

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.959
and now it's the only thing left is to remove all tapes

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.179
They have been locked.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.250
You see it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.660
super simple, it is very easy and see how beautiful it is. I'll cut this

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.330
bit

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.249
And now I teach.

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:36.019
Well you see that looks nice,
is the factory and can

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.939
do with this system

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.249
many many links too easily.

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.699
I hope you liked it and see
in the next video. Please
