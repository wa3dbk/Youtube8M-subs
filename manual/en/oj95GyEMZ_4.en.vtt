00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.080
My name is Avril. I'm married
to Vaughn and we've been fostering

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.640
for 30 years
but in the time that we've fostered

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.560
we've adopted two of the children
that we cared for.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.200
We especially like fostering children
with disabilities.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.040
So we've ended up
with quite a little family.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.520
Dominic was a very tiny baby
when we first met him.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.840
He was a very much loved
member of our family

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.960
for a couple of years,
getting stronger and stronger

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.560
and getting ready
to have some heart surgery.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.680
And when it was nearly time
for the heart surgery,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.400
one of our other adopted sons
came up to us and said,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.160
'Mum, we can't let him go.
Can we adopt Dominic as well?'

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.560
So that's what we decided
we would do.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.480
Didn't we?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.560
Yes, we did.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.160
That was quite an exciting thing
to do, wasn't it?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.880
Quite an exciting experience,
you mean, Mum.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.000
Yes, it was.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.000
It's very difficult for local
authorities to find permanent homes

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.880
for children with disabilities.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.800
And we feel that there's a real need

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.680
to find people
who can cope with a disability

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.480
And those children bring an immense
amount of joy to families

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.720
and they're almost looked over

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.920
but actually people are capable
of doing it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and they need to be aware
of what they can do

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.640
and what's there to help them
achieve that adoption.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.320
He's the most delightful little
character ever, aren't you?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400
Yeah.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.280
And he's an inspiration
to a lot of people.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.680
We've found that he changes
the atmosphere in a room,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.360
and every morning we wake up
and he tells us he loves us

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.800
and it's just lovely.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.320
Virtually every child
that comes into care

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.000
has got a sad story of abuse, neglect
or something else behind them.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.600
I think it's really important
that adoptive parents are open

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.520
about what's happened to their
children before they came to them.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.040
Children naturally
will ask questions:

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.280
Where did I come from?
Why did that happen?

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.400
And Dominic will ask, 'Why did my
mummy not look after me properly?'

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.920
And I have to explain to him
what happened

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.080
and why it was necessary
for him not to stay with his mum

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.400
because, quite honestly,
he knows he wouldn't have survived

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.200
if he'd stayed there.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.240
And that's a sad fact.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.600
But if we hid it from him
that would be unnatural and wrong

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.920
because he wouldn't then
know why he came into care

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.680
in the first place.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.920
We have
been through the process twice

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.720
and it is hard and difficult
but having had birth children as well

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.120
I would say it was probably
on an equal setting of difficulties.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.760
I suppose the second time
it was a little bit harder

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.920
because we were a little bit older

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.920
and I think we felt that we would
probably not be able to adopt

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.560
if we were in our 50s
but that proved not to be the case.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.600
Social Services at the time seemed
to feel that it was the right thing

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.640
for Dominic to be adopted by us
who he knew and he loved

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.080
and was a well-loved
member of our family.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.000
So it was absolutely
the right thing to do.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.160
In our fostering career we fostered
many children from different races

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.080
and we've enjoyed and learnt so much

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.720
and yet these children
have been in care for so long

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.000
because they haven't been found
an appropriate placement.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.600
But now I think it's changing
and people are actually being able

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.120
to adopt the children
that they've perhaps fostered

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.080
or they know and the children can be
placed with different race families.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.560
To be able to turn round and say I've
actually changed that person's life

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.200
and the course that
that would take for the better

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.600
is really, really very rewarding.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.240
But to see Dominic
who was so close to death

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.720
being like he is now,
well, what else could you ask for?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.800
It's wonderful.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.160
I wouldn't ask for anything else.
