BIG BIRD: Gee, Snuffy, what a
great idea you had bringing

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.850
your camera over here so we can
have a picture of the two

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.210
of us together.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.240
SNUFFY: Yeah, it was a swell
idea, wasn't it, Bird?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.540
BIG BIRD: Yeah.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.210
OK.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.650
Let's take that picture.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.960
You and me together, old pal.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.100
SNUFFY: Here we are.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.280
BIG BIRD: Let me just
line it up here, and

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.520
I'm gonna snap it.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.870
We're all ready here.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.620
One, two-- wait a minute.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.000
SNUFFY: What?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.550
BIG BIRD: I can't see
me in the picture.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.300
[CHUCKLING]

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.900
How silly of me.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.450
How could I be if I'm over
here behind the camera?

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.310
And I can't--

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.800
[LAUGHING]

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.270
I'm gonna try to--

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.330
obviously I have to be over
there to be in the picture.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.000
SNUFFY: Of course, Bird.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.810
I knew that something
wasn't right.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.790
BIG BIRD: Yes, uh.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.250
SNUFFY: Why don't I go over
there, and you come over here.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.310
BIG BIRD: Oh, that's great.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.930
I'll be in the picture with you,
there, and you can snap

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.400
the picture.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.120
SNUFFY: Yeah.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.370
Good thinking, Bird.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.440
BIG BIRD: OK.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.040
SNUFFY: Yeah.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.300
All ready, Bird?

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.580
BIG BIRD: All ready.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.718
You and me together, pal.

00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:18.430
SNUFFY: Uh, Bird, one of us is
missing from the picture.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.670
BIG BIRD: Oh.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.820
Right.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.280
Weren't we silly?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.570
SNUFFY: Huh?

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.480
BIG BIRD: Why don't we just both
get in the picture, huh?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.220
That's what we wanted.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.090
SNUFFY: Of course, Bird.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.520
BIG BIRD: Come over here--

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.750
SNUFFY: I'm not in
the picture.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.590
BIG BIRD: --old pal, old
buddy, old Snuffy.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.890
Snuff-a-roo.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.270
[LAUGHING]

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.800
SNUFFY: Here we go, Bird.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.690
BIG BIRD: Yeah, here we go.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.300
OK, now, your best
smile, Snuffy.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.930
Let's get ready for
this picture.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.180
Ta da.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.445
Wait a minute--

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:47.970
this isn't gonna work.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.680
SNUFFY: Huh?

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.186
BIG BIRD: Now nobody's
taking the picture.

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:52.670
Ah.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.300
I've got the simple answer.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.070
I'll go take the picture.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.490
SNUFFY: Good idea, Bird.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.180
BIG BIRD: Yes.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.320
SNUFFY: And I will help you.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.470
BIG BIRD: Hey, what a pal.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.406
Come on.

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:08.342
SNUFFY: [LAUGHING]

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:09.592
Yeah.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.960
BIG BIRD: Uh oh, pal.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.200
Take a look in there.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.380
SNUFFY: Uh.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.850
BIG BIRD: Do you see
what I don't see?

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.100
SNUFFY: Yeah.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.070
I don't see it either, Bird.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.273
BIG BIRD: Neither of us.

00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:29.765
SNUFFY: Oh, no, what
are we gonna do?

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:30.490
GORDON: Hi, guys.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.040
BIG BIRD: Oh, hi, Gordon.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.060
GORDON: What's up?

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.540
BIG BIRD: We wanted to take
a picture of the two of us

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.380
together, but we can't do it.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.710
GORDON: Oh, sure you can.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.710
I'd be glad to take
it for you.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.670
BIG BIRD: You would?

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.812
GORDON: Sure.

00:02:43.812 --> 00:02:47.630
You know when people want to
take pictures together, they

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.511
usually get someone else
to take it for them.

00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:55.345
BIG BIRD: Oh, Gordon,
you are so wise.

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:57.500
GORDON: Well, why don't you get
over there, and I'll take

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.480
the picture, OK?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.760
BIG BIRD: OK.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.390
GORDON: Go ahead.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.370
SNUFFY: Yeah.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.816
BIG BIRD: Boy, we're lucky that
Gordon came along, huh?

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:07.500
GORDON: OK.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.530
BIG BIRD: How's this
over here?

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.960
GORDON: Yeah.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.540
OK, move over just a little
bit this way-- that way.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.270
That's it.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.600
BIG BIRD: OK--

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.880
whoops.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.020
Hey, Snuff.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.100
OK.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.110
GORDON: OK, nice and close.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.770
Hold that.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.830
BIG BIRD: OK.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.430
Two pals together.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.530
GORDON: Hold that position.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.120
All right.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.530
Smile, and one, two, three--

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.780
got it.
