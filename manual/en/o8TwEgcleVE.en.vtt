00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.020
Hey welcome back.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.130
Let's go ahead and get our hands dirty.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.350
In this video I'm going to show you how to
install Tomcat on Microsoft Windows.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.210
All right, so the first thing we need to do
is we need to download Tomcat.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:26.730
In my browser I'm going to visit tomcat.apache.org.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.730
This will take me to the Tomcat website.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.590
Over on the left hand side there’s a download
section where we can actually download some

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.430
of the software.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.840
At the time of this recording Tomcat 8 is
the most current version.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.550
However there may be a new version.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.340
Simply download that new version for your
operating system.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.410
All right, I’ll select the link for Tomcat
8.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.470
I’m on the Tomcat 8 downloads page now.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.430
I’ll move down to the section for binary
distributions and I'll choose this 32-bit

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.290
64-bit Windows service installer.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.360
This is the normal MSI file that will install
Tomcat as a Windows service.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.800
I’ll go ahead and select this link.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.101
Right now my browser will start downloading
it to my file system.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:14.450
All right, great, so now we have it downloaded.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.210
Let's go ahead and open up our Windows Explorer
and I’ll move into this Downloads folder.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.579
There's the file that was just downloaded,
Apache Tomcat 8, so that's the actual installer.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.159
Let's go ahead and run this installer just
by double clicking it.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.359
This will start up the installer.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.310
I’ll hit yes.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.920
Here I’m at the first step of the wizard.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.749
I’ll go ahead and click next, I'll all agree.

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.109
Then here we choose our components.

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.630
For the components I like to choose full just
so I can get all the examples and the host

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.630
manager.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.240
Again, a nice thing about this Tomcat installer
is that installs it as a service, so I’ll

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.670
make sure that the service thing is enabled
or checked there.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.969
I'll go ahead and hit next.

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.880
By default Tomcat listens on port 8080.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.880
Feel free to change that.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.310
I like to keep the defaults.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.159
Then you can set up a administrator log in.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.850
For now I’ll just say admin admin.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.500
Again, you can give any username and password
that you want.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.700
Then I’ll hit next.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.739
I'll accept the default installation here
for my JRE.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.000
I’m using Java 8.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's fine.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.170
I’ll hit next.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.670
I'll also accept the default installation
directory.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.019
You can feel free to change this, but I’ll
go ahead and keep the default installation

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.379
directory for Tomcat and then I'll hit install.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.629
At this point I’m going to through the process
of installing the software.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.670
Now it says, "Hey, the software is installed."

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.849
I'll turn off the option that show the Read
Me.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.780
I'll hit finish and now it’ll actually start
Tomcat as a Windows service.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.750
All right, great, so Tomcat is started.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.010
Let's go ahead and verify our installation.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.170
We can verify it by viewing a website localhost:8080.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.180
That's where our local Tomcat server is running
right now.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.060
If everything works out right it should bring
up this page that you see here.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.340
Let's see Apache Tomcat version 8.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.239
Then also they even give you a message, “If
you’re seeing this, you've successfully

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.239
installed Tomcat.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.370
Congratulations.”

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.879
We know that we're okay so Tomcat was installed
successfully and Tomcat is up and running.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.250
Good job so far.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.739
Now I want to show you one other thing you
can do, is you can actually configure Tomcat.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.400
You can just right click on the little Tomcat
icon in the bottom right and say right click

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.170
and hit configure.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.629
This will bring up the configuration window
for Tomcat.

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.939
You can change like the display name for the
service, you could change the actual description,

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.260
at the bottom it shows you the status if it’s
running or stopped, you can play around some

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.170
log in stuff, a lot of other things you can
play around with.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.660
But for right now I’ll just go ahead and
keep everything as the defaults and I’ll

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.280
just hit cancel right now.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.540
Another nice thing is that you can actually
administer Tomcat via the services Control

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.540
Panel.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.969
I’ll go ahead and click on Services here.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.599
It will bring it up and we'll see in the list
we have Apache Tomcat 8 that's listed as a

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.609
service and it’s currently running.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.750
Just like any standard service you can just
right click, you can stop it, pause it, resume

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.090
it, restart it, you can do all the normal
things you can do with a service.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.190
What I'd like to do now is actually stop Tomcat
because we're going to run it later via Eclipse.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.660
I'll go ahead and stop this service.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.730
I’ll just do a right click, I'll hit stop
and then it’ll go through the process of

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.570
stopping the Tomcat server.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.570
Right now it's not running.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.540
But don't worry, later on we'll actually hook
up Tomcat and Eclipse to run together and

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.920
we’ll cover that in one of the following
videos.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.250
Now we were successful.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.670
We were able to download Tomcat and install
it, and then also go through the process of

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.490
verifying our installation.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.380
Then finally we went around and took a look
at some of the configs and also looked at

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.490
the services control panel.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.750
Good job so far.
