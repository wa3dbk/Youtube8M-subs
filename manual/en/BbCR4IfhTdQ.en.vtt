00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.199
new to Howard Community College in 2014

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.419
dental hygiene is a fast-growing
profession within the healthcare field

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.380
the path to becoming a dental hygienist
is a rigorous one

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.940
through classroom instruction and
hands-on experience

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.539
the program is designed to prepare
students for the licensure exam

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.420
here HCC we are different from other
community colleges because we're very

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.199
small program we accept sixteen students

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.789
there's a lot of in individualize
one-on-one attention

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.450
the students in the simulation lab
constantly have a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.489
instructor right over their shoulder and
our ratios are very small

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.059
teachers are very hands-on they do
everything they possibly can to make

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.020
sure your successful in the program

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.809
its great! Students in the classroom
receive

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.670
an excellent education. A lot of didactic
information as far as lecture

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.760
the students learn the reason the
rationale behind a certain theory

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.199
and then we go ahead and move on to a lab setting

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.960
or clinical setting and that's where
they take what they've learned 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.800
diadictically

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.159
and apply it to real-life situations.
It's been tough

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.549
just um making an adaptation to ah

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.180
getting all the work done um but

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.080
it's what I love to do and I realized
in this program

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.439
even more that's what I wanted to do.
it's a very diverse group

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.590
and I'm I feel like our instructors make
a lot of fun

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.400
they're very motivating in caring. By
starting out in a simulation lab

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.759
students are prepared to handle
real-life situations

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.490
we have simulation unit so they start
out small. They work on the simulation

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.329
manikins

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.750
and then once they show competency from that then they

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.069
move on to a student partnership work with a student partner,

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.630
show competency in that area and then
move on to live patient volunteers from

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.470
the community

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.619
and that's really later on third fourth
semester

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.509
and really user those dental hygiene skills learned early on

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.770
and apply all their knowledge. Currently
they are seeing their friends and family.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.060
They also were seeing faculty, staff and
students here at HCC

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.020
Starting in the fall we will be opening
our doors to all the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.390
community members these offices will be open on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.610
The volunteer patients had been
impressed.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.410
All of my patient and here's tell me how
great they are.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.430
They just love coming here and seeing
how you know

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.800
nice everything and a lot of them never
have had a digital

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.100
x-ray done so they've really thought
that was me

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.490
being able to see them on the computer
screen so

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.630
it's been pretty awesome! We help them to master their skills as a dental

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.380
hygienist

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.440
we do a lot of focus on professionalism
we

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.270
expect our students to follow a strict
professional code of conduct. 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.570
