Are you looking for new ways to spend quality time with your family?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
[Adrien Sharp for the Kraft Kitchens]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
One of my favorite things to do on a nice summer day is to go on a picnic.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Bring a football, maybe a kite, and everyone gets a chance to enjoy the outdoors

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and each other for an afternoon.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Hi.  I'm Adrien Sharp for the Kraft Kitchens

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
here with some great ideas for what to serve and how to pack your next picnic.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's start with the food.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Sandwiches are the original hero when it comes to food that travels.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But just because they're portable does not mean they have to be predictable.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
With just a very few simple steps, you can create your own masterpiece.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
[Kickin' Chicken Wrap] This is the Kickin' Chicken Wrap,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
perfect for eating outdoors.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The kick comes from the chipotle flavored mayo and the jalapeno American cheese.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
All you need to do is spread your mayonnaise on the bottom,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
add the cheese, next with the chicken, the lettuce, and the celery.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's all there is to it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
[Tuscan Club Sandwich] This one is the Tuscan Club on a nice ciabatta roll.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's made with shaved oven roasted turkey breast,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
bacon, lettuce, tomato, and here comes the Tuscan part:

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
sun-dried tomato and basil cream cheese on the top half of the ciabatta

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and some Italian dressing on the bottom half.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And to go with these great sandwiches, I've made some terrific side salads.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[Crunchy Bacon Coleslaw] This one is coleslaw, and it's extra crunchy

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
with crispy crumbled bacon and chopped salted peanuts.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And rounding things out, we have a very easy pasta salad

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
[Easy Pasta Salad] made with rotini, vegetables, reduced fat Parmesan,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and to complete it, some Light House Italian Dressing.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And for the dessert, the ultimate packable:  pudding snacks.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now, you want everything to be fresh-tasting and safe to eat when you picnic,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
so you will need a cooler.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
No need for a fancy one.  This plastic one on wheels does the job just fine.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's all in how you pack it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You need to keep things cold, but making sure they don't get all smooshed together

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is pretty important too.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Nobody likes a crushed club.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So let's back up, and I'll show you exactly how I packed this picnic today.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
[rewinding sound]

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
On the bottom, I put all the heavy stuff.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You have your bottles of water, your soda, 100% juice for the kids.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I even freeze a few of the juice pouches and water ahead of time

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to melt slowly, so even at the end of the day there's still something cold to drink.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Then I lay down one of these ice blankets.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
These do double duty by keeping things cold and separated.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Salads and pudding go in next,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
followed by another ice blanket.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And then last but not least the sandwiches.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And I put the third ice blanket right on the top.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now, if you don't have ice blankets, you can use gallon size freezer bags

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and fill them with ice cubes.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The key is to make sure they're sealed tightly. And do not put those on top of the sandwiches.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So there you have it, the great American picnic.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
