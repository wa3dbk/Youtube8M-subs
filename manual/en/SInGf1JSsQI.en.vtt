00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What a friend we have in Jesus,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
all our sins and griefs to bear!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What a privilege to carry

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
everything to God in prayer!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
O what peace we often forfeit, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
O what needless pain we bear,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
All because we do not carry 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
everything to God in prayer. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Have we trials and temptations? 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Is there trouble anywhere?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We should never be discouraged; 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
take it to the Lord in prayer.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Can we find a friend so faithful

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
who will all our sorrows share?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Jesus knows our every weakness; 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
take it to the Lord in prayer.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Are we weak and heavy laden, 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
cumbered with a load of care?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Precious Saviour, still our refuge, 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
take it to the Lord in prayer.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Take it to the Lord in prayer!

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
In His arms Heâ€™ll take and shield thee;

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
thou wilt find a solace there.
