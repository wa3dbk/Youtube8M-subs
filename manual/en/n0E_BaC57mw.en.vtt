In this clip we're going to speak about how
to mix bleach for hair highlighting. We have

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.840
different types of bleaches, there is many
forms of them. And in company, in this company

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.530
specifically they have a cream bleach. They
have powdered bleaches and I'm going to teach

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.410
you how to mix these different bleaches. Now
letâ€™s take a powder bleach for example.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.949
And you can mix powdered bleach, thick or
you can mix a powdered bleach very thin, make

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.670
it look watery. If you mix the bleach thicker
then you're going to have highlights come

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.039
up faster. If you mix it a little more watery
your highlights will take longer to process.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:46.780
Ok so in this clip here I'm showing you this,
one scoop of bleach and then I'm going to

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.579
measure twenty volume because they require
twenty volume. You can use ten or five in

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.260
some companies. This company requires twenty
volume. I will mix an ounce at a time in this

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:15.060
bowl. And I'm going to show you, that's very
dusty. Some bleach is white and some of them

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.490
are blue. There are companies that have even
beige bleach and stuff. So like I said everybody

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.189
has their own bleach and their system. Notice
how that bleach is thick. Bleach is thick,

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.160
it's not moving on that brush. I want to show
you example of it being very thick. We're

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:43.700
going to make it more watery now. Ok. Looser,
see that bleach is now looser, looser bleach

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.219
ok. Moves around it's loose. Ok. This bleach
as you see the more watery you want it the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:58.189
more developer we'll have to put in the bowl
for it to be even more watery, you'll have

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.420
more liquid. It will look a lighter and as
you see it becomes liquidly and creamy. So

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:13.000
now it drips as you have it in the bowl. It
drips out. Another type of bleach we use is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.140
a cream bleach and the cream bleach is a highly
conditioned. Has a lot of conditioner in it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.750
I should say. And as you see, see it's creamy,
it's not like the powder. It's a little bit

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.940
different. So I'm going to use an ounce of
this bleach if I'm going to use it, it's an

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.160
ounce but I'm just going to show you what
it looks like. You see it has like a conditioner

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.760
in it like an oil and it's creamy. Ok so it
already comes out of the tube just like this

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.330
and you will mix and equal parts ok. One ounce
of developer, one ounce of bleach.
