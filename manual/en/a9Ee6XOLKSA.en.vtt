00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980
The conditions out here can get pretty harsh sometimes

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.080
so dressing right is key. 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.880
To be able to handle any situation like this 
and any weather conditions, 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.730
a lot of skiing clothes today have 
special membranes in them

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.780
such as Gore-Tex, 
that won't let water from the outside go through

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.060
but still let sweat out when we're active. 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.080
Did you know that the inventor of Gore-Tex 
was a chemist? 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.860
It's true, and his work is used by the fashion industry worldwide. 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.980
But, what is Gore-Tex really? 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.640
Let's find out! 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.180
To find out more I went to see Helene Andersson
at Chalmers University of Technology. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.557
My name is Helene Andersson and 
I do research on biopolymer structures. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.780
Gore-Tex is a membrane made by 
something we chemists refer to as a polymer. 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.340
A polymer is a large molecule, 
composed by units called monomers. 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.130
The monomers are attached to each other 
like pearls on a necklace, 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.480
forming a huge polymer molecule. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.280
But polymers are not all the same. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.280
They can be very different 
depending on what monomer you start with, 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.480
and also how these "pearls" are attached to each other. 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.300
So depending on what small building blocks you start with, 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.410
the polymers can have very different properties. 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.730
Plastics and rubber are to common examples of synthetic polymers. 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.880
Plastics became popular 
at the end of the 19th century 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.480
in order to replace ivory in pool balls. 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.180
And polymers role in fashion 
goes way beyond the snow, 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.180
because there are many natural polymers as well. 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.880
For example, wool is a polymer 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.180
and silk. 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.100
The silk that we use for textiles 
comes from the mulberry silk worm larvae, 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.380
which makes its cocoon out of a long single strand of silk thread.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.980
Which is also a polymer. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.670
But silk is pretty expensive to make, 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.980
so chemists started to look for something cheaper to replace the silk with. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.353
And they came up with nylon. 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.280
Nylon is a synthetic polymer 
that is very similar to silk in its chemical structure, 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.835
but it turned out to be much easier and cheaper to make. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.830
The reaction forming the polymer thread 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.980
happens right here at the interface 
between the two liquids. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.053
Helene tells me that this is where the building 
blocks, or monomers, meet and link up. 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.480
Now as we pull the nylon out the reaction continues to build the thread. 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.630
Nylon was one of the first synthetic polymers. 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.980
It was actually first developed partly to 
replace the need for silk 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.230
in for example early parachutes, 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.900
but also to be used in toothbrushes 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.657
and women's stockings. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.144
Okay, time to get back to our Gore-Tex. 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.580
By manipulating how the polymer fibers 
interact with each other, 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.780
tiny pores between them are created. 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.980
And the size of these pores are about 
20 000 times smaller than a water droplet, 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.980
but 700 times larger than individual water molecules. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.680
And the result is than water drops can't go through the membrane, 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.870
but water molecules from when we sweat can. 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.480
Just like the story of Gore-Tex started with 
a chemist who had an idea, 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.470
nowadays new chemical research is resulting in 
new innovations for the textile industry. 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.080
Such as textiles that can change color 
at different temperatures, 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.010
or textiles that can conduct an electric current, 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.490
or even shirts that can measure a person's heart beat. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.880
All right, so we've learned that Gore-Tex, 
and many textiles, 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.010
are made of polymers that are 
long threadlike molecules. 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.170
And these polymers can have very different properties 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.730
depending on the building blocks, 
or monomers, that they are made up of. 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.980
We've also learned that chemists and the fashion industry 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.880
are joining forces now to find new, 
cool solutions to our needs. 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.077
Just like Gore-Tex, keeping us dry. 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.080
Can you think of any other connections 
between fashion and chemistry? 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.180
And remember, 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.570
Chemistry is all around you!
