00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:02.867
Your excellency, the floor is yours.

00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:07.497
presidents,

00:00:08.897 --> 00:00:10.197
prime ministries

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.097
and princes.

00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:16.537
They are all in Copenhagen

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:20.037
and every one of them had an opinion on what to do

00:00:20.137 --> 00:00:22.097
about a warming world.

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:26.797
Some come with stirring words.

00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:29.867
In this few days, in Copenhagen,

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:34.267
which will be blessed or blamed for generations to come.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:38.537
We cannot permit the politics of narrow self interest

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:41.537
to prevent a policy for human survival.

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.267
This were meant to be the place where the world

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:45.597
began its fight back against climate change.

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:47.997
One hundred and ninety two countries gathered

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:50.637
under the one roof in the Danish capital.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:53.297
And in the end, what they got is a deal, that many

00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:57.637
people have described as a disaster and a betrayer.

00:00:57.897 --> 00:01:00.537
What will come out is a strong political statement,

00:01:00.637 --> 00:01:03.197
a strong political declaration,  a strong political...

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:05.067
But those are only just words, aren't they sir?

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:07.097
To gather here on the question of money,

00:01:07.197 --> 00:01:08.997
this conference was suppose to be about

00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:11.337
cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:13.567
Scientists say the clock is ticking

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.797
if we were to avoid catastrophic global warming.

00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:19.897
In the race to reach agreement to the climate submit,

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:21.967
time has almost run out.

00:01:22.397 --> 00:01:25.397
In general, it's a peaceful protest.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:35.037
The world is talking about thousands of billion of dollars

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:38.997
in technology funds to combat climate change.

00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:43.467
And countries are at odds over how much who should do

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:45.537
to curb carbon emissions.

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:50.137
But meat is the main cause of global warming.

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:54.867
And going veg is the fastest way to cool our planet.

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:01.537
To turn away and pretend that we can do something else

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.967
to solve the problem is deceiving ourselves.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.067
However looking at the governments alone

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:11.597
to reduce livestock production is not enough

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.937
because the food industries have a very strong influence.

00:02:15.997 --> 00:02:19.297
But we are the consumers. We have the power.

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:21.367
When we show that we want plant based food,

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:24.367
they will change to meet the market demand.

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:28.297
Some have spoken.

00:02:28.837 --> 00:02:30.797
Some have watched.

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:33.367
And some have acted.

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:35.967
But it’s not enough.

00:02:36.937 --> 00:02:39.397
Since we are all part of the problem,

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:43.097
we all have to be part of the solution

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:46.397
in order to save our planet.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:49.137
This video is about us.

00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:52.767
This is our lives we are talking about.

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:56.467
The people have the right to know the truth

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:58.497
and decide for themselves.

00:03:00.197 --> 00:03:02.767
We have to inform everyone.

00:03:03.237 --> 00:03:05.937
We need not die because of ignorance.

00:03:06.497 --> 00:03:10.637
If a frog jumps into a pot of boiling water,

00:03:10.737 --> 00:03:13.967
it jumps right out again because it senses the danger.

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:16.037
But the very same frog,

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:19.737
if it jumps into a pot of lukewarm water

00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:21.967
that is slowly brought to a boil,

00:03:22.297 --> 00:03:25.267
will just sit there and it won't move.

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:26.537
It will just sit there,

00:03:26.637 --> 00:03:29.867
even if the temperature continue to go up and up,

00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:33.037
it will stay there until... until...

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:36.567
I want people everywhere to know

00:03:36.697 --> 00:03:39.037
the main cause of the climate crisis.

00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:41.267
Everyone has the right to know the truth.

00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:43.737
I wish everyone heard what the twenty-five hundred

00:03:43.837 --> 00:03:46.767
United Nation’s scientists have concluded.

00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:50.637
Everybody should know the consequences of meat-eating.

00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:53.737
The survival of the world is in our hands.

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:56.937
To make a real difference, everyone’s help is needed.

00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:59.237
We need to be the miracle.

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:01.837
Can we change?

00:04:02.037 --> 00:04:03.797
I believe.

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:07.197
To save the world,

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:09.697
we first have to inform the world.

00:04:10.137 --> 00:04:11.867
We have to spread the word.

00:04:11.997 --> 00:04:14.667
We can do it by making this the most viewed

00:04:14.797 --> 00:04:16.767
and talked about video in the world.

00:04:17.097 --> 00:04:20.397
And we have the mean: by using the Internet.

00:04:21.437 --> 00:04:23.997
It’s the power of the people.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:27.637
Because everyone in the world can act.

00:04:27.997 --> 00:04:30.237
To get there, we need your help.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.837
Email 5 of your friends to watch this video.

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.267
And ask them to forward to the next 5.

00:04:36.497 --> 00:04:38.967
And they forward to still the others.

00:04:40.067 --> 00:04:41.867
When enough people do it,

00:04:41.997 --> 00:04:45.897
in a few steps we can reach millions of people.

00:04:46.897 --> 00:04:50.537
YouTube has over 1 billion video views a day.

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:52.267
Now, imagine that.

00:04:52.397 --> 00:04:56.967
If this video gets featured in YouTube’s 'Most viewed' page,

00:04:57.097 --> 00:05:00.397
it will in turn generate even more hits.

00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:08.737
The time is running out.

00:05:08.837 --> 00:05:12.297
And we all deserve the one chance to get it right.

00:05:12.737 --> 00:05:16.537
History has shown that when we act selflessly,

00:05:16.737 --> 00:05:20.067
expand our love and understanding to all beings,

00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:21.367
it would ignite

00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:24.767
and catch the imagination of our society at large.

00:05:26.537 --> 00:05:29.997
It's time we response to Earth's SOS.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.097
This message has been passed on to me.

00:05:34.197 --> 00:05:36.667
And I am passing it on to you.

00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:39.197
Pass it on. Be the link.

00:05:40.097 --> 00:05:41.937
Make it our mission.

00:05:42.397 --> 00:05:45.567
Together, we can turn the world around.

00:05:49.637 --> 00:05:51.667
Let our future unfold.
