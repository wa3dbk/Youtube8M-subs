00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.720
in response to the peace we did on a
recent show

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.099
about yet another these religious right
winger saying people choose to be gay

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.519
I got a letter from anonymised David
Pakman show viewer i mean i I know who

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.589
he is but I'm keeping his identity
private who said

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.090
I am gay and I chose to be gay I've
never gotten a letter like this before

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.789
the summary did she David

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.260
I'm a sixty year old gay man out since
my mid-twenties

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.449
until that time I enjoyed emotional and
physical relationships with several

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.070
women

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.210
I also had some interest in men sexually
which I pursued

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.600
partly out of curiosity and partly to
avoid

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.649
fathering children gay relationships
then became my preference

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.230
I truly believe I had a choice in this
matter much as I support gay rights

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.010
I think exception to a lot of gay groups
that fervently insist gays

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.710
all gays are born that way for some that
may be true for many others my

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.329
experience has taught me it is a chosen
behavior

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.719
regardless of why someone is gay people
who try to defend sexual orientation

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.260
insisting we have no choice

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.369
should stop arm I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.340
am fascinated by this because if we look
at the language

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.180
there is no indication here that it was
a choice to be attracted to men

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.299
let's let's be very clear you can make a
choice

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.409
about whether or not to engage in
romantic or sexual relationships

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.640
with the man with women with both with
neither that is not the same thing

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.189
as making a choice about who you find
yourself attracted to you so when you

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:31.890
say

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.079
I enjoyed emotional and physical
relationships with women

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.049
I also had some interest in men sexually
you did not choose

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.899
to have that interest you chose to
pursue or not pursue the relationship

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.320
and when I read this Louis

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.040
I'm reading the story of someone who is
bisexual

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.720
that's exactly what I got for me so I
mean the point is when you are attracted

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.500
to someone

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.340
it's not going to be your choice and
when they're attracted to you

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.240
as well don't want should be telling you
that you can't be happy together

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.930
the the other thing is that the letter
doesn't say

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.489
up for any number of reasons it may not
say it that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.890
you were only attracted to women

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.270
and then became attracted to men or vice
versa or that you're not still attracted

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.140
to women or whatever the case may be

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.200
it seems here that the choices you made

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.239
were with regard to the gender UHV those
who you wanted to be in relationships

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:30.739
with

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.560
not those not that not a choice about
attraction

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.290
and by the way they're really are
straight men

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.800
that I've ever met who would have sex
with men

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.780
rather than women simply to avoid
fathering children I mean you know

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.060
Lewis has even said is not interested in
in a kid

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.540
if he accidentally had a kid he would
probably love the kid

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.540
but to avoid fathering children Louis is
not saying

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.730
maybe I'll just have sex with men in
other words he would have to have been

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.519
born

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.290
with an attraction to men so Lewis I
find this letter to be fascinating but

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.830
going

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.560
only by the the vocabulary and language
used here

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.940
this letter is evidence is someone who
is probably bisexual

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.739
or may be gay and simply made choices
about who he wanted to pursue

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.849
relationships with

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.090
writing in the case this individual

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.400
I mean you were attracted to both so you
better we did have a choice so well

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.180
which ones do I wanna go with

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.220
but a lot of people I don't have that
choice because they are attracted to one

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.830
or the other

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.170
send me your thoughts on this letter I
know I will hear back from the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.830
individual who wrote me the letter

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.620
and I hope to hear from other people as
well is my analysis of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.250
is there something in this letter which
really suggests that this is an

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.920
individual who chose

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.010
to be gay as opposed to made a decision

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.080
about the relationships he wanted to
pursue

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.790
on my way off on this am i right send me
your thoughts I'm very curious to hear

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.629
from people

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.900
and I'm also very curious to find out
how many new members we will have by the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.019
