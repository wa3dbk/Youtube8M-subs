When you are looking on where to store cutting
boards, there are a lot of different options

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.840
you can as, you can lean them against the
wall on your counter space, you can leave

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.799
them out on your counter space if you, especially
if you have a lot of counter space. It's a

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.340
great idea to find a spot where you just have
your cutting board out all the time. And a

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:27.800
lot of people keep them behind their, their
sink leaned up against the wall. That way

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.190
it's out and ready to use, but once you wash
it you can just stick it up there to dry.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.140
It's an easy place to let it dry. These are
my cutting boards and I kind of keep them

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.730
in different places around the kitchen, just
based on where I'm using them and why I'm

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.920
using them in the space. These smaller cutting
boards for instance, I use over on the counter

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.280
the most, so I'm going to keep them over there.
And I keep, I actually keep this one in my

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.291
drying rack, because it's the one that I use
most of the time. So I just keep it there

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:16.430
most of the time. And these other two, slightly
smaller cutting boards I store behind the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:27.940
drying rack, because I can put them there
when they're wet and the water will run off

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.950
of them, but I don't use them as much as I
use this one that I just am keeping out all

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.200
the time. And I have this really big cutting
board which I don't use as often unless I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.759
am making a really big meal and so, and if
I use it then I am usually actually using

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.950
it over here, sometimes I use it on that,
the counter space by the sink. But I keep

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.660
it over here and just lean it up against the
wall right there. Mostly it's out of the way

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:05.920
there and it's, that wall space works, it's
the biggest wall space in my kitchen at this

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.509
point to be able to keep something like that.
