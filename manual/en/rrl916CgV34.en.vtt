Hello, my name is Luis Estrada, and I am a
software developer. In this clip, I will show

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.000
you how to make columns on HTML. We are working
with the same file with some basic HTML tags.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.830
In order to create columns; firstly, we have
to introduce a new HTML tag, the table tag.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:40.070
Let's specify that the table borders should
have 2 pixels of size.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.610
This way, you can see the columns better.
A table is composed of rows, which are horizontal

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.899
and columns, which are vertical. When defining
a table we have to create tags that would

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:01.809
represent the table from top to down. We use
a table row tag for each horizontal line of

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.680
information we want, no matter how many columns
we have. Inside this tag you could use an

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:22.930
align tag. Inside the table row, we define
the table data tags.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.500
We define a table data tag for each of the
columns that we want on the table. Also, let's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:41.150
give them a width of 200 pixels. Let's say
that we want only three columns. Then, let's

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:52.439
define three table data tags by copying the
first column tags. Now, let's enter some data

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:07.860
on each of the tags. Copy the table row tags
and paste it two times to create a total of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:17.050
three rows. Now, we have a three by three
table. For each of the table rows you can

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:37.150
define a different alignment.
Now, save the file and refresh your browser.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.330
I am Luis Estrada, and I've just shown you
how to create web pages using HTML.
