Hi YouTubes! Welcome to a new tutorial!

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.340
I was sick for more than a week but now I’m almost better again so it was time for me to do a new tutorial for you

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.960
and today I want to show you the velvet nail manicure

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.820
and I wasn’t really sure if I was going to do this tutorial because

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:26.240
sometimes I see the velvet manicure and I don’t really like it, and sometimes I see pictures and think “hmm this does look good”!

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.980
So the only way to find out if I would really like it was to order it myself

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.660
and to try it out of course

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.720
And what I’ve ordered is this one, and this is the flocking powder from BornPrettyStore

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:50.920
and what I’ve noticed that I think it’s looks pretty classic if you use the darker colors, so the black, dark blue or the red one

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.120
so that’s why I like this one, but the lighter colors I don’t really like that much.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.700
but of course that’s my opinion so use whatever color you like.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.780
There are many colors that you can choose from and what you get is this little jar with flocking powder

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.640
and I already did my nails and as you can see it’s still full because you only need a little bit so you can make many manicures with this.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.160
Also what you’re getting is this sort of tweezer thing, so it’s not an actual tweezer but it looks like it

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.680
you use this to apply the flocking powder onto your nail

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.720
and what I also got is this small brush

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.180
this is what you use to remove the flocking powder that’s on your skin, so this is really helpful.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.540
and what I also have is of course a nail polish and use a polish that matches your flocking powder the most

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.060
you don’t have to use a polish that the exact color but use one that’s really close

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.980
and I’m using OPI Little Red Wagon

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.400
and those are the only things you need so lets take a look at the tutorial.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.820
Make sure you have a piece of paper underneath your nail because It’s going to get a bit messy

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.540
I’ve already applied the polish one time.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.340
Now I’m going to apply the second layer and I’m going to apply the flocking powder.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.660
Make sure that you cover the whole nail

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:14.940
Now press the flocking powder onto your nail. Don’t press too hard but also don’t do it too soft because otherwise it will fall off later

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.260
so press it hard enough so it will stick into the nail polish

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.960
When you’re done remove all the excess flocking powder with the brush

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.740
So we’re not going to going to spill any flocking powder that’s on the piece of paper. We can just put it back and use it next time.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.980
So when you’re done with all your nails this is the result

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.940
do you like it?

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.420
So for those who are wondering yes you can still wash your hands and yes you can still take a shower.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.460
Because I’ve tried it and the flocking powder stays on your nail perfectly,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.700
It just looks a little bit weird but it dries in a few minutes and then it’s back to normal again.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.900
So I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and see you next time. Bye bye!
