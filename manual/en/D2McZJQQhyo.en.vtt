00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000
[Water Flowing... Fire Crackling...]

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.000
Do you know how it feels?

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.000
Afraid of moving on...

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.000
Not knowing what you’re waiting for, But ready or not, your past is gone

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.300
Whether the sun rises or sets, On the path that you take.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What really matters most is that the path is one that you have made.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Take a chance, take a step... you’re dreams are up ahead.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Stand up! Everybody put your hands up!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let it set your heart on fire, Like you’re dancin’ on a wire!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Shout it out! Life is all about the ups and downs.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.300
Like you’re dancin’, like you’re dancin’ on wire!

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300
Hey! Yeah You! Yeah I’m talkin’ to you!

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.380
I see you standin’ in the corner like you don’t have a clue.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You start to hesitate and recreate emotions that can complicate,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.000
but buried deep inside you is the fire that will drive you so much higher!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Let it fill you with desire!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Take two steps forward and forget the step back.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.000
You’ve come this far... Don’t you ever look back

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.200
Stand up! Everybody put your hands up!

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.000
Let it set your heart on fire, Like you’re dancin’ on a wire!

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.000

Like you’re dancin’, like you’re dancin’ on wire!

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:29.000
They say that fortune favors the bold, So let’s live young, before the doors close.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.400
Take a chance, take a step... Your dreams are up ahead!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000

Like you’re dancin’, like you’re dancin’ on wire!
