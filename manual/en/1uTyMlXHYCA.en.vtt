00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.510
So a lot of what's common in rock-a-billy
music and early music like that, a lot of

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.730
Western music, Country and Western music,
early country, was the use of a large reverb,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.509
but most commonly it was a slap back delay.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.520
And that's an effect that was more or less
honed in on over the years and you can get

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.930
that effect with a delay pedal.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.640
To achieve that setting what you want is you
want a very quick response from the note or

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.920
chord that you played.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.440
It's not a stereo effect, but it is a direct
sample that happens in you know, a millisecond

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.440
later.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.679
You're not really thinking about milliseconds.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.010
You're really just trying to get the quickest
response; so that it sounds like the note

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.269
or chord you played is bouncing off a wall
right back at you or you're in a cavernous

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.159
hall or recording studio; to get that effect
of space.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.930
So what I've done here in order to achieve
this slap back delay is I have the; let's

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.170
start on the right; I have the blend setting
right about 12 o'clock, so that I'm getting

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.090
an even amount of clean sound from my guitar
versus the effect level.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.620
The middle is the feedback, which is pretty
far down, I'd say about 9 o'clock.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:29.430
If you listen, what ends up happening is it
reacts with the delay setting which is next

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.430
to it.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.200
The delay is; let's go over here to the knob
on the left.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.200
Now you're hearing a little bit of the pitch
shift and that is very common in the analog

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.200
delay pedals.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.930
Because the tape delays that they had such
as the Echoplex; when you would adjust the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.530
delay setting and the speed you would slow
down the tape; and you would get almost like

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.090
the loop would slow down, so fast that you
would almost a pitch shift.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.210
That's not intentional, but it is an effect
that you can use with these pedals that's

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.680
pretty cool.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.850
So as I increase the delay setting, you hear
that?

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.860
That's the delay time, so what you're hearing
is you're hearing the amount of time in between

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.660
each note, increasing or decreasing in speed.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.700
As I decrease the knob, you hear it's pretty
quick.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.450
Now if you adjust the feedback setting, let's
see how that is.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.409
So now what we're doing is we're increasing
to a minimum and maximum level of the amount

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.790
of the repeats.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.240
Speed of repeat with the delay setting, amount
of repeats with the feedback setting.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.590
And as far as the language, every pedal has
a different way of-- a different name they

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.950
may call it, but that's basically it.
