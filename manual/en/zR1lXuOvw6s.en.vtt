00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.430
Hi, I'm Aaron Ross, and I'm here
to help you get started

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.950
in the wonderful world of Maya.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.430
I'm a professional educator.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.810
Since 1999 I've been teaching
college students, and along the way,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.509
I've also taught everyone from
high school kids to seasoned professionals.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.730
I'm an Autodesk Certified Instructor for Maya

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.540
and I've also written three books on 3ds Max.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.879
Maya is the Hindu goddess of illusion,

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.309
and that is what 3D graphics is all about:

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.150
the beautiful illusion.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.010
Maya the software is a vast,
rich and complex environment

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.309
in which you can literally
bring your dreams to life.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.460
Partly because of its complexity,
Maya has a very steep learning curve.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.650
It's notoriously difficult
to learn Maya on your own

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.510
because it's almost like learning
a foreign language.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.869
That's where it helps to have
a native speaker as your coach.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.930
I'd like to share with you what I call
the "oral tradition" of Maya:

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.780
the practical working knowledge

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.250
of how to best use Maya's
vast set of tools.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.920
Here's what you'll be able to do after
watching this free series of five videos.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.410
Our main goal is to get familiar with Maya,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.690
so our first project is a simple one:
an ice cream cone.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.100
This is a sped-up timelapse video
from Part 5.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.210
I'm using a Lattice to deform the
shape of the object,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.060
and then I apply a material
to change its color.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.470
And here's the end result.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.640
So let's get started by learning to
navigate the Maya user interface.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.620
Here we are in Maya 2009 Unlimited

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.570
with the default interface and preferences.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.640
As you can see, there's quite a lot
going on in this interface.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.470
Several rows of icons at the top
of the screen and inside this panel,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.500
down the side and all sorts of
other stuff going on all over the screen.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.060
We'll be taking a selective approach to this,
and only covering the tools

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.440
that are absolutely "need to know"
for a beginner.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.890
So, Maya is very deep and very complex,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.790
we're gonna try to make it easy for you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.920
by just covering the stuff
that you're gonna want to know

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.659
just to get started.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.010
The first thing we need to look at is whether
you actually have the default preferences.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.420
If you've had Maya installed
and you've played around,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.730
you know you may have actually gone in and
accidentally closed some of this stuff up

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.670
or changed things around and
gotten kinda confused

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.170
and don't know how to get back.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.800
This is a clear example of we need to
set Maya back to default preferences.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.480
That's done by deleting a special folder
from the hard drive,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.610
and when you delete that preference folder,
Maya will reset itself back to factory defaults.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.410
So let's figure out where the preferences
are stored on my current workstation.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.800
That'll give me an opportunity to show you
the Maya Help system as well.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.550
In the upper right hand corner of the menus
you will see Help.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.060
And you can choose Maya Help, or just
hit F1, or Function 1, on your keyboard.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.130
This will open your current web browser.
In my case, I'm running Firefox.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.030
I want to find out where
my preferences are stored.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.610
So I'll go to the search engine.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.591
Now, in this version of the search engine
it takes quite a long time for it to get started,

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.700
it looks like it's reading
the entire data base

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.680
and trying to figure out what's there.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.410
That's a downside to it, but when it's done
calculating, you'll have very snappy results

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.300
when you do your searches.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:51.140
Here we go. So once we've done that calculation
up front, I can go ahead and search for:

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.800
"preferences folder"
and hit ENTER on my keyboard.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.670
Okay, and it takes me to a bunch of pages,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.260
here's one of them, this is the one I want
here: "Save Preferences."

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.319
Because that in fact tells me the path or
the directory where my preferences are stored.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.200
And you'll see it's listing all of the different
operating systems that Maya supports.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.049
I'm currently running Windows XP 64-bit.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.270
It's an unfortunate fact of life, but occasionally
the Maya Help documentation actually has errors.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.440
In this case, it's a minor
error with the path.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.400
But it's close enough for me to find
what I'm looking for.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.699
So I need to look for my "My Documents" folder.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.349
Okay, well, I'll just open up Windows Explorer,
and that takes me directly to My Documents.

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.349
Oh, I see, here it is: Maya.
I'll open that up.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.770
And there's a folder in here for each one
of the versions of Maya I have installed.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.749
Here we go: preferences.

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:53.460
I currently have Maya running, so
I should shut it down first.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.990
Go ahead and quit.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.009
I'm not saving anything.

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.129
Going back to Windows Explorer,
and I'm just going to delete

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:08.719
that preferences folder just by hitting
the DELETE key on my keyboard.

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.129
Now, when I restart Maya,

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:15.289
it will have the default interface
and preferences restored.

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.719
I'm going to create default preferences.

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.779
And we're back to the basics now.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.409
So if you ever do have a problem
with your interface,

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.460
that's the sure-fire way
of getting it back.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.740
Now, let's take a look at some of
these interface elements.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.819
Maya has a menu just across the top,
as most computer programs do.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:41.110
But because Maya has so many tools,
it won't all fit on one menu.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.509
So in fact you've got lots of
different menus to choose from.

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.479
And you can choose from all of these
Menu Sets from this pulldown list here.

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.669
So you'll see a Polygons Menu Set
and a Rendering Menu Set.

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.129
The default is the Animation Menu Set.

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:04.189
Directly below the menus is an area called
the Status Line.

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:09.770
With these icons, by default, if you
hover your mouse you will see a ToolTip.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.669
You'll also note at the extreme lower
left hand corner of the Maya interface,

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.669
you will see the same information displayed.

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.039
Okay, so this is called the Status Line.

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:26.949
We can collapse parts of the Status Line
to reduce visual clutter on the screen.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.680
I can close some of these.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.259
Collapse them down,
or re-open them as needed.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.629
Directly below the Status Line are the shelves.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.099
Each one of these tabs is a Shelf.

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:43.539
So you'll see Surfaces, Polygons,
Animation, and so on.

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:46.909
These are all visual icons
that correspond to menus.

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.240
So, in fact the Shelf isn't really necessary,
it's just convenient.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.849
For example, my Polygon Shelf will allow me

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:58.969
to create objects, simple primitives
such as cubes and spheres.

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:03.309
So here's the Polygon Sphere shelf button.

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:07.460
Click it, and I actually get some feedback
in the viewport to tell me what to do.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.830
Drag on the grid.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.939
There you go, I've made a sphere.

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:13.939
I can click on Cube.

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:19.319
Click and drag to define the footprint
of the cube, release the mouse

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:23.779
and then I can click again and drag up
to set the height.

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:24.789
So those are your shelves.
