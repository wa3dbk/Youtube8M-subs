Hi, This is video #100 I have uploaded to YouTube

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.500
and I thought I will do something Special

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.340
So what I am going to do is to

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.140
just show you the models I explained

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.880
32 Videos are out there that I created

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.260
showing you how to fold the models

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.780
And here they are....

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.060
It all started off with

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.900
and next I decided to show the Spiral Snail Shell

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.820
which is also designed by Kawasaki

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.560
Then there was a very simple model, The Traditional Lily

00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:04.774
So as you can see I have been quite busy

00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:07.534
I have given instructions to 32 different models

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.280
and also done some technique videos

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.740
just showing you some basic folds and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.400
how to get specific size  paper and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.420
Ya, and I have given obviously some clarifications,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.800
Because sometimes,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.820
my videos aren't illustrious as they should be.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.420
I am sorry for that.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.280
and I have done 2 videos, I am primarily talking

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.560
and the couple of them just show me folding the stuff

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.420
or me showing models,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.079
you know, anything I feel like doing

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.079
So, I do hope you enjoy my videos

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.660
and I will continue to show you more.
