00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.890
On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Rodney
Fielitz. I'm a certified flight instructor

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:13.459
in Cottonwood, Arizona. I'm here to give you
the basics on what it takes to become a pilot.

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.160
We're in the airplane now sitting at the end
of the taxiway. We're getting to do our run-up

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.390
before we take off. Here it says ground check.
First thing it tells me to do is bring my

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:35.130
throttle up to 2,000 RPM. So I run it up to
2,000. Next thing it says, check my mags.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.250
Well my mags is run by my key so I turn two
clicks left. Maximum drop 175, I've only shown

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.460
100 drop. Back to both, one click left and
I'm only showing a 50 drop in the RPM. What

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.460
this is doing is checking my magnetos to make
sure they're working. Next thing they want

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.980
you to check is vacuum, that's for suction.
Oil temp and oil pressure; I've got oil pressure

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.380
in the green. My oil temperature is coming
up. Air conditioner I don't have. Check my

00:00:48.380 --> 00:01:09.220
panel, make sure my lights are working. Here's
the carb heat, told you about carb heat. You've

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:27.120
got carb icing. What it does is put a little
bit of unfiltered air, chills the RPM job.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:39.370
Now I
retard the throttle to make sure that it doesn't

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.000
stall on me, I don't want it to stall. Then
I bring the RPM back up a little bit and then

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.940
it's OK. Now, take off master switch is on.
Flight instruments, check. I've got the elevation

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:03.560
set at 3,550. The directionals set. Everything
else is set pretty good. Carb heats off, seat

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:12.920
belts, mixture set, primers locked, flaps
down, trim control. I have electric trim on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.139
here and it's hard to see over there but trim
is on the back elevator I told you so I don't

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:25.709
have to fight with the air pressure. It says
I'm ready to go. I've gotten all my checklist,

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.299
airplane is ready to roll. The next thing
I've got to do is make a call. Fuel pumps

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:41.739
on. Cottonwood traffic sets in the 9704 Charlie
departing runway three-two. So, we get out

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.184
here on the runway, line up on the runway
and we give her the gas and let her go.
