00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.410
What number sets does the
number 8 belong to?

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.140
Now before even answering that
question, let's just think

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.960
about the different number
sets there are.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.360
There are the real numbers.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.640
And these are, literally, all
of the numbers we've been

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.240
dealing with to date.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.750
When we go to more advanced
topics, you'll learn that

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.880
there are such things as
imaginary and complex numbers.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.620
Or at least in the mathematical
sense they exist.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.690
But for now, real numbers are
essentially everything that we

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.925
know of on the number line.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:30.650
So if I were to draw the number
line right here, a real

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.180
number can be represented as any
point on this number line.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.300
Or it's the set of all of the
points on this number line if

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.830
you just keep going in the
positive direction and you

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.050
just keep going in the
negative direction.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.220
It's all of these point.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.390
And it includes points, it
includes numbers like pi,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.910
where their decimal
representations, 3.14159, it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.730
just keeps repeating
on and on and on.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.900
It cannot be represented as a
fraction or as a rational

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.660
expression.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.390
It just is this decimal
expansion that goes on and on

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.240
and on and on.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.580
Square root of 2 is another
one that is also a real.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.690
But everything else
is also real.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.430
So real is kind of the broadest
set of numbers we've

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.090
been dealing with.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.500
Now if we want to be a little
bit more restrictive, we get

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.750
to rational numbers.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.170
And the best way to think about
rational, there's two

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.920
ways to think about it.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:27.170
These are numbers that can be
expressed as-- you could say

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.370
as a rational expression
or as a fraction.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.640
So for example, negative 1 is
a rational number because

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.300
negative 1 could be written
as negative 1/1.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.720
0 is a rational number.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.700
It can be expressed as
0 over anything.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.360
Could be 0/10.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.810
It doesn't have to be.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.920
2 is a rational number.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.290
1/2 is a rational number.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.920
All of these are rational
numbers.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.020
What aren't rational numbers are
numbers like square root

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.660
of 2 or 3.14 or pi or e, these
numbers that cannot be

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.880
represented as a fraction.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.770
So you can imagine that the
rational numbers, it's kind of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.510
like the set of real numbers.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.455
Maybe I'll write it like this.

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:09.780
It's the set of real numbers
minus-- if you were to take

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.215
out irrational numbers.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.030
And these are like-- so for
example, we have things like

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.590
pi, e, these are
actual numbers.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.200
You know, 3.1415, e is
between 2 and 3.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.120
Square root of 2.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.300
We can go on and on and on.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.700
There's an infinite number
of irrational numbers.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.710
So it's a little abstract.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.890
But anything that can be
represented as a fraction, you

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.020
definitely know is rational.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.640
Now, if we want to get a little
bit more restrictive

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.430
than that, if we just want to
deal with the numbers that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.520
aren't fractions in the
traditional sense.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.850
That are, I guess we could use
the word whole numbers,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.420
although we want to be careful
with that word because that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.710
could also be considered
a number set.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.670
If we're thinking about just
the 4, the 3, the 2, all of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.100
the kind of-- I guess
whole numbers.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.640
Then we're talking about
the integers.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.520
We could just go from the
negative direction, maybe

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.380
negative 2, negative
1, then 0.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.610
Then we get 1, 2, 3.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.770
I think you get the idea.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.130
It's all of the positive and
negative whole numbers and it

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.910
includes 0.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.000
So if you were to do the
integers on this line, it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.110
would be everything that
I'm doing in orange.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.830
Now, there's two other sets that
are subsets of integers

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.780
depending on the interpretation
you look at.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.320
So sometimes you'll hear people
say, whole numbers.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.250
And this is a bit of an
ambiguous statement.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.880
Because sometimes when people
say whole numbers, they're

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.790
referring to integers.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.220
Sometimes when they're referring
to whole numbers,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.830
they're referring to
non-negative integers.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.810
So 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.900
Sometimes they're referring
to just positive integers.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.750
So 1, 2, 3, so on
and so forth.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.175
So this is a little
bit ambiguous.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.770
I've seen it used in all of
those different ways.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.190
But if someone says a whole
number, I generally think of

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.590
non-negative numbers.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.970
It's ambiguous, but for our
purposes, let's think of it as

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.130
0, 1, 2, so on and so forth.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.040
Now the last one to consider
is natural numbers.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.946
And once again, this one
is also ambiguous.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.430
And the reason why it's called
natural numbers is these are

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.640
numbers that you would actually
encounter if you were

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.500
to either try to order
things or actually

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.340
count things in nature.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.730
So this is also ambiguous.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:50.880
But it definitely excludes
negative numbers.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.250
And so if it definitely excludes
negative numbers,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.340
you're like, why is
it ambiguous?

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.620
Well, it's ambiguous whether
it includes 0.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.220
So sometimes 0 is natural.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:08.430
So 0 may or may not be natural,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.830
depending on the context.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.170
Now, let's answer our
actual question.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.700
What number sets does
8 belong to?

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.450
Well, 8 definitely belongs
to the real numbers.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.880
It is on the number line.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.540
It is definitely a
rational number.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.690
We can express it as 8/1, or
16/2, or even negative 8 over

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.300
negative 1.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.050
I mean you could actually have
an infinite number of ways to

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.760
express it as a fraction.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.760
So it's definitely a
rational number.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.450
It's definitely an integer.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.110
It's a whole number.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.270
It's definitely an integer.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.300
It is a whole number.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.960
I mean we're ambiguous what to
include in whole numbers, but

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.550
positive 8 is unambiguously
a whole number.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.040
It's definitely included.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.080
And it's unambiguously
a natural number.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.580
If I go out and count trees,
I can count 8 trees.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.530
So it is a positive.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.710
If the number was 0, I'd be
like, well, depending on who

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.360
you talk to it might be
a natural number.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.860
But 8 definitely is
a natural number.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.680
So it's a part of all of
these number sets.
