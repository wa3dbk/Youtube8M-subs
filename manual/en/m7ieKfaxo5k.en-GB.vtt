Hello and welcome back to the complete guide
to using you Android Lollipop Nexus 6. Today

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.100
it's user profile tips and tricks.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.400
To view profile information you can swipe
down once from the lockscreen and the image

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.110
in the top right of the settings area is you
current profile. If you have unlocked your

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.470
screen you can swipe down with two fingers
to display the same profile. Simply tap on

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.349
it to show all you current profiles and settings.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.750
To instantly switch profile tap on a user
and the handset will automatically switch

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.010
to that user. If you have security set up
on that user it will automatically lock the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.969
device.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.580
If you want to change the user profile picture
then bring up the profiles screen and then

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.070
press on more settings. Then for the current
user you can press on the image to either

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.320
change the profile picture or change the name.
You can choose, edit and crop a picture from

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.890
the gallery but I won't be held responsible
for the sort of picture you end up using.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.810
To create a new user simply bring up the user
profiles screen and then press on the add

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.140
button to create a new user within seconds.
This user will not see data and apps from

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.130
other users although they can update apps
if they end up downloading the same ones as

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.530
other users. Also bear in mind that when you
create a new user you will have to go through

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.000
the setting up of a new account just like
you did when you first bought the handset.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.950
When a new user it setup they won't automatically
have access to make phone calls or send sms

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.060
messages. The owner or administrator of the
device is the only user profile that can do

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.520
this so, as the main user, go to more settings
and you will see cogs next to each user that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.670
you can press on and then toggle the options
that allows that particular use to user telephonic

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.970
services.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.730
If you want the ability to add users from
the lockscreen when you have security enabled

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.770
on your handset, go to more settings and then
press the three dots in the top right hand

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.520
corner. There will be an option here marked
Add users when device is locked. If you check

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.800
that, when the device is next locked and you
bring up the profile screen you can now add

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.890
new user profiles.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.580
If you want to add a temporary user to the
device, the best way forward is to create

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:32.240
a guest user. This will start a fresh profile
that's not connected to any of your Google

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.840
accounts. It bypasses the regular setup screen
so it's a quick way for someone to browse

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.040
the internet, watch YouTube and take some
pictures. You can easily switch back and forth

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.700
between profiles and every time you return
to the guest account it will ask you if you

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.370
want to start a new session or continue with
the previous one. When you are logged in as

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.220
a guest you can remove the guest user at any
time.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.040
If you go to more setting from the user profile
screen you can add a new user but not have

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.720
to immediately set them up by pressing on
the not now option. To delete a user you must

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:19.340
use the device owner user profile, press on
the cog and then select the delete user option.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.220
If you want to completely restrict a user
to just one application then go to settings

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.060
and scroll down to security before selecting
the screen pinning option. Toggle it on as

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.440
well as the Lock Device when unpinning option.
Now go to the application you want to lock

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.001
and then press the overview button in the
bottom right hand corner of the device. This

00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:48.990
will bring up a recent list of applications
and you want to scroll this list up a little

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.830
bit to reveal a green pin. This is the pinning
tool and when you press that you will return

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.740
to that application and be locked into it.
The back and home buttons will no longer work

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.850
as a means to quit the application and the
only way to get out of the application is

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:13.760
to long press the overview button again. This
will of course lock the device. This might

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:25.000
be useful when you want to let a child only
play on one game or watch 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:41.090
videos 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.819
on youtube.
