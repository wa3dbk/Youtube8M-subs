00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.040
In this step, we will be putting the binding
on. However, the first step in the binding

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.140
process would be to even up the edges of your
quilt. So with a rotary cutter and your cutting

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:29.400
mat and your ruler, you would even all the
edges of the quilt.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.690
The next step in the process would be actually
measuring your quilt so you get the correct

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.579
length of the binding. Now depending on how
your sew, may depend on the size of the quilt.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:47.940
In the case of our little four patch that
we did here, its 13 X 25. The next step would

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.810
be to figure the length of your binding. Now
the width of the quilt and the length of the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.239
quilt, if they are the same, it doesn't matter
which side that you pick. But in the case

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.011
of my small piece I have here, I have one
side that is 13 inches and one side that is

00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:12.580
25 inches. So we will cut two pieces of binding
that are 25 inches long by 5 inches wide.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.330
And then two pieces binding that are 15 inches
long by 5 inches wide. The reason that they

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.150
would be 15 inches is because we need to extend
an extra two inches on either side to connect

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.759
with the crosswise binding. Once you've cut
the binding and the filler, you actually need

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:43.460
the same size filler as you?re binding, just
place that on the inside and press it. And

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.740
now you are going to want to fold your binding
in half. And we are going to press it so we

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.369
have a nice even piece of binding all the
way along here.
