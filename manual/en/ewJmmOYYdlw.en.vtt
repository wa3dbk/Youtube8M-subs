00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.920
Hey everyone!

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.480
Jaystepher with Lego Minifigures

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.580
Series 12 mystery pack.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.160
Set number 71007.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.480
Recommended building ages are 5 and up.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.980
There is a minifigure hiding inside this package.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.580
Let's see if we can find him.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.860
Here we go!

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.020
So here is the possible sixteen that we may get.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.220
Her head is double-sided.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.780
She even comes with a frog.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.460
Apparently she doesn't want to cooperate.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.820
But that means that this is the Fairytale Princess.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.180
Nice print work on her outfit.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.540
I like the hat.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.560
The hair is attached to the hat.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.480
The sleeves are two-toned.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.500
And her face is double-sided.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.240
So this is the Fairytale Princess

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.820
from the Lego Minifigures

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.660
Series 12 collection.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.320
Set number 71007.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.240
Thank you all for watching!
