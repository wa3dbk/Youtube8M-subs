00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.000
Cat Pig! Why?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Bruce Bat, you can't blame yourself
for Robin's death.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.100
Who the hell is Robin?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.500
Your former sidekick Sir.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Oh yea, well he knew the risk going in.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So were performing for a kids birthday party you say?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Uh yea something like that.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Why don't you cheer yourself up by sling shooting some crime around the city?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.500
I can't that's an Angry Bat Bird thing, not a sad Bruce Wayne Bird thing.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.500
I haven't been this sad since, since!

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.500
Since Robin passed away? Since your parents died?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.370
No! Hey! Remember when we got stuck with Canadian Netflix for like a week?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.500
Ugh I should get some fresh air.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Hey Bird Boy! What day is it today?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Why it's Angry Christmas day Sir.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.500
Not you you little jerk! The Bird Boy with the Yak Bak on his face.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Why it's the day you pay the ultimate
price Mr. Wayne Bat.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
How do you know my secret identity?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
It's written on your pyjama's.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Your name is on the gate.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.500
You also told me last night at the bar, I recorded it on my Yak Bak.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Oh your so sexy with that talk boy on your mouth. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.... I'm Bruce Wayne Bird.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.299
Well I'm not Bruce Wayne Bird so shut-up okay?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Just meet me downtown at twilight. Especially if you want to see a certain feline pig friend of yours.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.799
Her and I have become quite aquatinted lately. Also, Merry Angry Christmas. Sincerely, Bane Pig.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Cat Pig! No! So she's with Bane
Pig now?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.780
Alfred who would you rather smooch, me or Bane Pig?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Sir, I.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Answer me!

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.000
Ah damn it!

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Ah my goddamn angry bird back!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Welcome to my Christmas sale Bat Bird. The ultimate prices!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I broke my back for a sale?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
It's not Black Friday but it will do.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now the sale just ended... be seeing you Bat Bird.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Oh right, you'll be happy to know the profits are being donated to an anti-gay marriage group ha-ha-ha!

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.000
No! They should have the same rights we do.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Bruce, Bruce! Get up we have a job to do.
(background)

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500
Is it really you?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.500
Hey what's going on, Angry Bat Bird here.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.000
Man, what a twist ending. To be continued, am I right? But what was that spooky voice all about?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And what is Bane Pig's evil plot? And that Yak Bak on his face is super sexy right?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.500
And what's Alfred up to?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.800
I guess your going to have to click subscribe
to find out. Otherwise you won't get any Christmas presents.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.840
I wish my parents were still alive so I could get Christmas presents.

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.459
Alfred doesn't even get me anything. I think I'm going to fire him.
