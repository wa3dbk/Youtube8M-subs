Sam: Frodo, hold up for a second. I'm 
 afraid to walk through the corn field.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.680
In the past I've been abused by corn.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.257
Frodo: Oh. I'll just walk to you.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.600
Here you go. We'll walk hand in hand through the corn field.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.791
See. You can do it!

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.415

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:57.240
Hey Sam.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.183
You hear that!?

00:01:05.434 --> 00:01:14.350

Frodo: Hey. Illegal stowaways.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.040
What are they doing here?

00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:27.911
[crowd chatter]

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:30.929

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.830
