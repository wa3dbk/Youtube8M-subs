00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.220
Late Monday night United Airlines flight 1074
was abruptly grounded after a passenger stormed

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.900
the cockpit claiming he had a bomb while screaming
terrorist sayings the flight make a U-turn

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.560
in the sky after a passenger ran toward the
cockpit screaming jihad jihad now fellow passengers

00:00:18.560 --> 00:01:04.809
tackled the passenger and then the video was
leaked on to reddit which you can watch 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.850
now another passenger on the plan describes
the scenario she says one held his feet and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.030
the other one kind of laid on top of him and
then the flight attendants went and got some

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.200
plastic restraints for his arms at one point
when his head was down he said there were

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.130
jihadists in the cargo hold and he did say
jihad a of couple times so now we're unsure

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.710
of whether he does have any ties or ISIS or
whether he's just a sympathizer or if he's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.710
just crazy yeah but in the video you can hear
please stop please stop they said call it

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.780
off now his mental state at the time is unknown
and no weapons were found after he was subdued

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.920
as of late Tuesday morning the passenger had
not been arrested or charged with a crime

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.050
so luckily that's odd none of the it is odd
right I mean the good news is that none of

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.460
the 33 passengers or the 6 in crew flight
attendants were injured in anyway but of course

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.110
they have to be extremely shaken up after
seeing that yeah and after seeing it's interesting

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.540
in America because we arrest people if a plane
has to be rerouted because they got into like

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.550
a verbal confrontation right not about terrorism
right like if you cause a plane to be diverted

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.129
or to have to land prematurely we throw in
jail for that and so this guy look I do think

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.739
that he is just crazy but he did threaten
the plane the fact he so far at least hasn't

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.879
been charged with a crime I think is actually
pretty noteworthy yeah I mean it's obvious

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.189
that he's mentally unstable so I think that
probably contributes to maybe why he hasn't

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.420
been and this is pretty recent we don't have
a lot of the details and maybe they're going

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.489
to keep coming we can update you on that yeah
it's also interesting like you like we say

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.930
a person is crazy but I try to understand
what sort crazy he is right and like it's

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.519
one thing to have like a delusion that they're
jihadists in the cargo hold like if he ran

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.319
up and down yelling there's jihadists on the
plane like that's just a regular delusion

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.420
but for him for to also yell jihad jihad means
that maybe he is both a sympathizer not necessarily

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.439
with any ties to ISIS and he's crazy it reminds
me of that scene in Bridesmaids where she

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.801
thinks somebody is churning butter on the
on the wings I don't remember that one you

00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:13.860
guys know what I'm talking about and like
imagine being a passenger on there no yeah

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.299
you don't know if the person is just regular
crazy or if he's terrorist crazy exactly one

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.950
of the I guess the husband of a wife who was
on the plane who flies a lot she said she

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.279
texted him from the plane saying how scared
she was and how shaken up she was and of course

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:34.280
and the scary thing is that he's saying all
this stuff and what would I guess motivate

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.670
somebody to say they had a bomb if they didn't
even have a bomb crazy delusions maybe he

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.950
thought that he did have a bomb or maybe he
thought he actually did have some connection

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.810
to terrorists in the cargo hold I don't know
it is scary and it's also dangerous by the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.109
way because after the history of terrorist
attacks in the country over the past 15 years

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.079
I mean they subdued him and restrained but
they could have killed him with their bare

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.279
hands because they were worried that he did
actually have contact with terrorists so he

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:05.400
risked his life in the crazy outburst he had
yeah I like that the passengers kind of came

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.840
and took care of the situation I think that's
a good sign for the community of our country

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.000
yeah and it will interesting to see what comes
out as details unfold
