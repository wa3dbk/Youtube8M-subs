00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Welcome to this introductory walk-through of PrimeTime Draft Football. 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.000
In this video, I’m going to show how quickly and easily you can set up and start drafting using 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.539
PrimeTime Draft software.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.800
There will be other videos that go into more advanced topics

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.000
such as RemoteView, autopick, trades/keepers, auction drafts, etc.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.650
But this video is going to cover the basic snake draft.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.660
So, let’s get started.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.840
The first thing you need to do is click the “Create a new draft...” button...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.140
 name your draft... and click OK.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.920
What you see now is what we call the “Draft Management” screen. 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.940
On this single screen you will configure everything about your draft.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.110
You’ll select how many teams are in your league...

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.890
how many rounds your league drafts... 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.000
the type of draft...

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.490
we support all the most popular types – such as snake, auction, straight, 3rd round reversal… 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.000
and we also have a “manual” mode for leagues that use a non-standard draft format.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.630
I'm going to leave it on "Snake".

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.000
This "time limit" setting lets you set the maximum amount of time a person should take to make a pick.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.200
I say "should" because when this limit is hit - we don't force a pick

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.050
 or automatically move the clock to the next person if a pick is not made within the time limit.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.000
But we do blare a horn and turn the clock red so that everybody knows that someone has taken too long 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.820
and that everybody needs to start hassling them about taking too long. 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.000
"Clock direction" - up or down... some people want the clock to count up, some people want it to count down... 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.520
so select whichever you prefer.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.000
We support IDP... so if your league drafts individual defensive players layers, you'd change this to "Yes".

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.500
We have a text-to-voice feature that will audibly announce each selection as it’s made.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.000
Some people want to show "bye weeks" on the draft board, others don't... so we support either way.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.000
And here is where you would enable "RemoteView"

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.500
 which is our free web service for people who can't be at the draft party location 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500
but do have access to the internet.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.700
"RemoteView" allows them to view the draft board and even draft their own players using a web browser.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.590
"RemoteView" will be the subject of it's own separate video.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.280
Over here, we have the team names and draft order.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.500
You can highlight these default team names and change them to the names of the teams in your league. 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.300
And, you can easily drag-and-drop the teams to change the draft order.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.520
Once you have everything set up, it’s time to start drafting.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.260
 Click the “Start draft!” button.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.750
We're now viewing the draft board.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.700
The first time you enter this screen for a draft, you'll be shown this help box 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.030
which explains how to add players, remove players, change the clock position, etc.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.180
So, let’s click OK to get rid of this box and start drafting.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.730
As you can see, the draft has begun and the first team is on the clock.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.400
When the team who is on the clock decides on their pick, click on the clock to add their selection to the draft board.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.660
In this dialog box, we give you various ways to find players to add to the board.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.000
We have these filters here that let you narrow down the list by position and/or team

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.010
 and the "Sort by" option so you can control the order that the results are shown. 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.000
But the easiest way to find a player is to just start typing the player’s name in our “Smart Search” field.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.830
Let’s say the first team wants to take Adrian Peterson.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.500
Start typing his first or last name – and you'll be shown a list of players that match what you’ve typed in.

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:48.000
As you can see, just by typing an “A”, I’ve already found Adrian Peterson at the top of the list of available players.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.510
If I continue typing more of his name, the list will get smaller and smaller…

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.300
But because we sort the list by rank, often it’s only necessary to type a couple of letters to find the player you're looking for.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.500
When you click on Adrian Peterson, you'll get this nice preview so you can confirm the selection

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.280
before you click the "OK" button to add the pick to the board.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.000
The clock automatically moves to the next team based on the type of draft you are doing.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.600
Let’s say the second team wants to take Jamaal Charles.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.500
I’ll click on the clock… type “J”... and there he is right at the top of the list.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.970
Click him… click "OK"… and he’s on the board.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.059
It’s that quick and easy.

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:35.300
And you would just keep adding players to the draft board like this until your draft is complete.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.190
But let’s say, for whatever reason, you need to remove a player from the board. 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.800
No problem.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.500
All you have to do is click on the player and confirm that you want to remove the pick by clicking “Yes”. 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.500
The player is removed from the board and added back in to the pool of available players.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.000
If you want to change the team that is on the clock, just click the slot you want to move the clock to.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.200
At any time, you can click the “Back” button to go back to the “Draft Management” screen.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.449
Notice that the number of teams and rounds are locked

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.500
 since the draft is in progress, but all the other settings can be changed at anytime.

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.380
So there you have it. PrimeTime Draft is that quick and easy to use.
