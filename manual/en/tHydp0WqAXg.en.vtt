Hi, I'm Rob Mitchell on behalf of Expert Village.
Today we are going to be starting off our

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.430
series on setting up your photo studio and
lighting with a general look at some of the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.610
different tools that we have to work with.
In our studio, the most common thing to use

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.679
is the studio flash or the strobe. We will
be getting into that, but at first we are

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.779
going to start with the tungsten light. Not
very practical and not really a lot of people

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.429
are lighting with tungsten in these days because
of certain drawbacks. Mainly, the heat that

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.219
comes off it, and it's not quite as bright
as a studio strobe. But we are going to start

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.010
off with the tungsten light because it is
going to let you see the changes in the light

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.950
as we move it around the model's face, move
it closer, use reflectors. You'll actually

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.760
be able to see those. After you've mastered
and completely understand what's going on

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.309
with tungsten, then we are going to go into
the studio and we are going to use the studio

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.649
strobe. The strobe has a modeling light which
lets you have some sort of an idea of what

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.629
you are getting when you are lighting your
subject, but it's not really as easy as when

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.030
you are using a tungsten light. Therefore
you've got to understand your strobe light,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.240
you've got to understand when you move it
around your model and place it in different

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.200
places, exactly what you're going to get.
So we are going to get to all that. We are

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.229
going to cover umbrellas, we are going to
cover reflectors. A lot of this stuff gets

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.280
very expensive. You can go to a lot of the
camera stores and you can drop an awful lot

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.243
of money very quickly. I'm going to show you
a couple of little tricks that is going to

00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:27.869
save you a few dollars, too, and still make
you looking really professional. We'll get

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.630
into lighting kits, again, different types
of umbrellas, the studio strobe, the power

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.420
pack, the difference between the power packs,
why you might want one over another. The light

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.399
meter, your best friend, although today with
digital cameras you don't have to go out and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.240
spend a lot of money on a light meter. You
can just use your digital camera, keep checking

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.189
on the back, and when you get the right exposure,
that's it. But there are a lot of inexpensive

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.520
light meters, too, that you can check out.
Lighting stands, different sizes, portablilty,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.560
weight, what you should look for, as well
as tripods. Tripods start anywhere from ten

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.619
dollars for a little mini tripod that you
can put on your table, up to hundreds, well,

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.090
even thousands of dollars. I don't think you'll
really need to go that high for what your

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.000
going to be doing. But, I'm going to show
you some that are really light weight, your

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.220
going to be able to travel with, even stick
it in the suitcase. Little mini ones that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.340
we can take with us, you can put them on top
of a mailbox to shoot, on top of logs if you're

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.340
shooting outdoors in the forest. So, it's
all the versatile things that we can use here.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.650
So, we're going to get right into it. Stay
tuned.
