00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.233
- LAST FRIDAY WE MET
THE STEVENSON FAMILY

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:03.900
FROM OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON,
D.C.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.900
ALEX IS A LIEUTENANT COLONEL
IN THE ARMY

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.866
AND A PURPLE HEART RECIPIENT.

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.566
HE AND HIS WIFE HEATHER
HAVE THREE KIDS,

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.833
AND THEIR DREAM HAS ALWAYS BEEN
TO FIX UP THEIR HOME,

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:13.800
AND WE WANTED TO HELP
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.200
HI, JEANNIE,
JOHN, ANTHONY, HI.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.500
- HI, ELLEN.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.833
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY, ELLEN.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.833
- WE GOT A FEW PEOPLE HERE
WITH US, ELLEN.

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.100
[people cheering]

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.066
- I SEE THAT.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.266
AND I'VE ACTUALLY--

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.333
LOOK AT THAT HOUSE,

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.500
IT LOOKS AMAZING.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.033
THIS IS GONNA MEAN SO MUCH
TO THE FAMILY.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.433
[people cheering]

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:35.733
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.333
WE'RE SO PROUD
TO BE A PART OF IT, ELLEN.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.033
YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING
TO DO THESE HOUSES

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:40.433
WITH YOU ALL THE TIME,

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.566
AND IT'S ONE THING TO DO THEM
ON "COUSINS UNDERCOVER,"

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.900
BUT WHEN YOU'RE GIVING BACK

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.700
TO SOMEBODY WHO'S PROTECTED
THIS COUNTRY

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.966
TIME AND TIME AGAIN,

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.366
IT'S JUST A HUMBLING,
HUMBLING EXPERIENCE.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.833
- YEAH, AND ELLEN,
WE HAVE HAD--

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:54.666
ALL THE VOLUNTEERS HERE
HAVE BEEN WITH US SNOW,

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.833
RAIN, AND THEY'RE STILL HERE
WITH US

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.500
READY FOR THE STEVENSONS.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.866
THEY'RE COMING HOME!

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.266
- LET'S SEE WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.166
'CAUSE THEY'RE RIGHT
AROUND THE BLOCK, RIGHT?

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.766
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
BEFOREHAND.

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.100
- YEAH.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.033
- AND LET'S SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE NOW.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.733
LOOK AT THAT.

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.733
[cheers and applause]

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.866
AND THAT'S IN, LIKE,
A WEEK.

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.600
ONE WEEK.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.966
THEY'RE GONNA BE BLOWN AWAY.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.533
[people cheering]

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.833
- COME ON OUT, YOU GUYS!

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.166
- THEY'VE BEEN IN A HOTEL,

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.966
SO THEY HAVE NO IDEA.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.466
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- HI, HEATHER.

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.933
- OH, MY GOSH.

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.333
- HI, ALEX.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.333
- HI, ELLEN.

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.933
- HI.
- HI.

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.166
- LOOK AT--

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.300
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT THE HOUSE.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.566
[people cheering]

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:49.733
- HEY, GUYS.
HOW ARE YOU?

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:50.766
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.500
- THIS IS AWESOME.
OH, MY GOD.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.566
- I COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE
IT COULD LOOK LIKE THIS.

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:59.200
- TELL THEM WHAT YOU DID INSIDE,
ANTHONY AND JOHN.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.600
- SO WE OBVIOUSLY DID
THE EXTERIOR.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.000
- RIGHT.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.033
- BUT WE DID THE ENTIRE
INTERIOR OF THE HOUSE AS WELL.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.466
WE HAD TO GET RID
OF THAT BIG BLUE TENT FOR YOU.

00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:08.833
WE GOT A NICE CAR PORT.

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.033
- YES!

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.500
- WE WENT REALLY MODERN,
CONTEMPORARY OUT HERE.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.400
- BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.433
- IT LOOKS GREAT.

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:16.433
WAIT TILL YOU SEE INSIDE.

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:17.666
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A BREAK.

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:18.966
WHEN WE COME BACK,

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:20.866
WE'RE GONNA REVEAL
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE INSIDE.

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:22.533
WE ARE BACK WITH THE COUSINS
AND JEANNIE

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:23.733
AND THE STEVENSON FAMILY.

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:25.100
LET'S GO INSIDE
AND TAKE A LOOK.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.133
THIS IS SO--
FIRST GO TO THE KITCHEN

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:28.233
BECAUSE--

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:29.633
- OKAY, HERE WE GO, GUYS.

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:31.866
- LET'S LOOK AT WHAT
THE KITCHEN LOOKED LIKE BEFORE

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:32.933
AS THEY'RE WALKING IN.

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.233
WE'LL LOOK AT A BEFORE PICTURE.

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:40.400
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
SO YOU CAN SEE

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.833
YOUR BRAND-NEW KITCHEN.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.033
FIRST THING'S FIRST,

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:47.866
THAT HUGE ISLAND
THAT TOOK UP SO MUCH SPACE,

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.466
IT'S GONE.

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:51.400
YOU HAVE ALL-NEW CABINETS,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.500
WHITE CARRARA
MARBLE COUNTERTOPS.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.466
BUILT-IN BENCH
FOR YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:00.166
- THAT'S REALLY NICE.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:04.033
WE HAVE ENOUGH ROOM
FOR EVERYBODY TO SIT NOW.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.500
- THAT WAS THE BIGGEST THING.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.000
WE WANTED MORE ROOM HERE.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.800
AND NOW WE GOT TO SHOW YOU,
ELLEN--

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.233
LET'S SEE THAT LIVING ROOM.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.966
- LET'S LOOK
AT THE LIVING ROOM BEFOREHAND.

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:14.466
- OH, WOW.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.066
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.100
- LOOK AT IT.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.400
- OH.
- AW!

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400
- WAS THE TV TRYING TO GET AWAY?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.600
WHY WAS IT--

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.666
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT IT NOW.

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:28.566
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.633
SO NOW...

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:32.000
- LOOK AT THAT.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.266
[applause]

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:36.333
BEAUTIFUL.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.166
- WE WANTED YOU GUYS
TO HAVE ENOUGH SPACE

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.200
FOR THE KIDS,
RELAX.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.133
YOU GUYS HAD THAT BIG WOOD
FIREPLACE THAT PROJECTED OUT.

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:46.633
- IT WAS--OH, YOU GUYS,
IT'S PRETTY.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:48.900
- NOW YOU HAVE BRAND-NEW
GAS FIREPLACE,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.666
PLENTY OF ROOM.

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:52.166
- YES.

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:54.366
- SO NOW YOU, GUYS--

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:56.466
YEAH, IT GOES ALL THE WAY
UP TO THE CEILING.

00:03:56.466 --> 00:03:58.900
- THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
I LOVE THAT.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.100
- CHANDELIERS.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.000
LOOK AT ALL THE CHANDELIERS
ABOVE US.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.300
- THAT'S WHAT THIS NEEDED,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.033
WAS LIGHT, YOU GUYS.

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:06.433
- AND NOW--
AND ELLEN,

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:07.700
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.866
ELLEN, LOOK AT THESE DOORS
THAT WE MADE FOR THEM.

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:12.200
- I KNOW.
THAT'S VERY COOL.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.566
I NOTICED THOSE EARLIER.

00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:15.800
- BEAUTIFUL WOOD DOORS
THAT LEAD INTO THE MASTER SUITE.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.433
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT
THE BEDROOM LOOKED LIKE BEFORE.

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:19.900
- WE DID MOVE THE DOOR
FOR YOU.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.233
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:22.933
SO THERE NO LONGER
IS THE ENTRANCE

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:25.833
TO YOUR BEDROOM
OVER AT THE ENTRY OF THE HOUSE.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:28.200
WE DID A CUSTOM HEADBOARD

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.966
AND A RECLAIMED WOOD
JUST LIKE THE DOORS.

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:31.133
- LOOK AT THAT.

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:33.233
- AND THEN WE BUILT YOU
A CUSTOM BED.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.233
AND THEN WE WENT IN

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:37.933
AND WE DID A CUSTOM BATH,

00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:39.366
EXTRA SPRAYERS.

00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:41.200
WE DID FULL SHOWER.
WE DID A VANITY.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200
- [squealing]

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.533
- YES, WE DID.

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:47.733

00:04:47.733 --> 00:04:49.366
- YOU GUYS DID SUCH
AN INCREDIBLE JOB.

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:51.166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID ALL THIS

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.166
IN SO LITTLE OF A TIME.

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:56.566
- I KNOW, I'M GONNA TALK
TO MY CONTRACTORS AFTER THIS.

00:04:56.566 --> 00:04:58.733
THIS IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:01.066
HEATHER, ALEX,
LET'S BRING THE KIDS IN.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.533
- WELL, LISTEN,

00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:04.966

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:09.500
- THEY'RE STILL
IN THE CAR, PROBABLY.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.533
- COME HERE.

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.366

YOU GUYS HAVE SUCH
A STRONG COMMUNITY HERE,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.500
IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE TO SEE
EVERYBODY WHO CAME OUT.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.566
