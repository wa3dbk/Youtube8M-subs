00:00:06.629 --> 00:02:34.720
When you take a soil sample, you have to fill
out the form that goes along with it, it’s

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.740
important that you let the lab know what are
you growing and how do you want to grow it?

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.600
It’s a pretty standard form and it’s available
at all Cooperative Extension offices in every

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.430
county, or it’s available online at the
website that will be shown at the end of this

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.260
video.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.510
The upper information is pretty straight forward,
your name, address, city, and county where

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.040
the soil sample was taken. The first column
is about sample name, it’s just what you

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.820
call the space you just sampled, it could
be garden, front lawn, side, whatever you

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.820
want.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.380
The next column is how big is the garden,
in square feet or acres, whichever you choose.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.680
The third column is the one that’s most
important, it asks for your crop code, this

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.650
is where you’re going to tell the lab what
you’re growing. So, if it’s a standard

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.620
garden, or anything else, in your form, you
go to the green sheet and it has a list of

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.620
all the different things the lab will test
for.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.930
For most home gardeners, we’re going to
want to go to non-organic garden, the crop

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.290
codes are 391, or organic gardens, 392. But
also, if you’re growing something specific,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.950
like blueberries, raspberries, or lawn, there’s
a crop code associated with that.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.230
For most home gardens that’s all the columns
you need to fill. The remainders of them,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.150
offer things mostly for commercial growers,
whether or not forage will be tested, is it

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.260
going to be a pasture, and are potatoes grown
there? If you’re just a home gardener, you

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.240
can leave the rest of the form blank.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.320
The cost of the soil sample is $15, but the
information you get is invaluable. It will

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.759
tell you what nutrients are already present
in your soil, therefore maybe saving you money

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:22.970
from unnecessary fertilizer treatments. So,
this fall, gather up a soil box, get a soil

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.460
test form and soil test, because if you don’t
test, you’re just guessing.
