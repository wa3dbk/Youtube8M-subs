Automatically translated by machine. Welcome
to another edition of Morning Make Up where

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.910
I do my make up and we chat!
Today's look is a colour I don't usually wear:

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:24.529
coral!
Start with foundation as usual.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.050
I'm on a kick trying new things at the moment!
I didn't really know where I was going with

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.280
this one so I just started with some mascara.
Today's new thing is coral coloured eyeshadow.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.000
I was trying out this new pearly shimmy 88
Palette.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.149
I did a light cream wash over the lip and
a little under the brow as a highlighter.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.070
I love these huge palettes so much.
There is just so much variety in the looks

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:59.730
you can make with them.
They are fantastic to keep at home.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.230
I applied the bright pop of coral on the outer
corner.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:11.689
I could honestly ditch the rest of my eyeshadows
in favor of one big one like this.

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.939
I added a little darker coral to the outer
half of the lash line.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:25.420
I'm trying out different crafts at the moment
too which has been fun.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.369
Then I blended it all together.
I tried doing come interesting bleaching patterns

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.740
on some old clothes which turned out awesomely!
I was quite surprised because I thought they

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.710
were going to suck!
I lined thinly with black liner.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:49.360
And after I've been crocheting this gigantic
shag rug for out lounge because we can't afford

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.520
a real one!
I added a long wing as an after thought.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.329
I wasn't sure the rug would turn out well
but I'm almost half way and I love it!

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.409
While I was deciding what to do next I added
some pink lipstick.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.070
Do you guys try new things often?
Or do you stick with the same things you know?

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.849
Then I added some 3/4 lashes.
I think trying new things is really the best

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.840
part about life.
It didn't look quite finished so I brought

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.790
some of the coral down on to the lower lash
line.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.380
Next on my to try list are some new nail art
designs.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.200
And a little bit of the light colour on the
inner corner.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.670
Now that I'm growing out my natural nails,
I should be able to do them more often!

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.930
And some blush...
A little lipgloss and that's done!

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.550
Let me know if you have any ideas what I should
try next.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.110
See, trying new things is good, I actually
ended up really liking this look.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.920

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.769

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.189
