Hello! My name is Chris McKay with Expert
Village.com. I am going to be showing you

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.059
today how to throw playing cards, just the
basics. If you would like to learn more about

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:21.210
my work as a magician, then you can check
on my website at www.mckaymagic.com. So here

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.420
are some basics on throwing a card. Obviously,
I have got a limited amount of space to work

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.929
with here but I’ll try and show you my very
best. What’s really important though is

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.570
the grip anyway and the wrist action. So that’s
what you really need to see anyway. So it

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.580
doesn’t matter if you see how far I’m
actually throwing the cards or whatever. Here’s

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.050
all this and really the tendency with people
when you handle them a card to throw it is

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.720
they try and throw as hard as they can and
that’s a bad thing. It’s kind of more

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.760
of a graceful movement and so it requires
a little more practice before you can take

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.000
a full baseball throw with the playing card.
First of all, this is the grip that I use.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.360
I mean there are all sorts of grips I mean
and all sorts of variations and it really

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.260
doesn’t matter but for beginners this one
really gives you the most support. First you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.370
are going to clip one of the corners between
your pointer and your middle finger just like

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:27.240
that. Next you are going to grip the middle
of the card with your thumb on top in the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.070
middle and then your ring finger on the bottom
so that your thumb and your middle finger

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.520
or your ring finger are holding the card and
also your pointer and your middle finger are

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.390
gripping the corner, so it’s a pretty solid
grip of the cards. So all you want to do is

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:53.659
cock your wrist all the way back in a 90 degree
angle and as you let go of the card you want

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:01.190
to have your wrist released and so just practice
just doing the wrist at first and you will

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.739
see the cards will spin a little bit and the
more you stand with your wrist and with your

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:17.739
fingers the more it will spin.
Once you get good at that, you can add in

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.239
a full elbow motion. Even what the world record
holder takes you know three or four steps

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.720
and lifts his arm above the head and throws
the card but the micro part of this is that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.469
he is getting the card to spin with his wrist
cocked and that’s very important. Just get

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.349
a little practice and there should be no problem.
