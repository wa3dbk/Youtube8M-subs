Hello this David from Geek This.Net
Today I will show you how to draw a cone in

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.420
Google SketchUp.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.779
To begin, we will delete this person, and
draw a circle on the bottom plane.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.210
We will make it 2 feet.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.449
Next we'll grab the line tool, and draw a
line going straight up the height of the cone

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.990
we want.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.660
In this case we will make it 5 feet.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.320
Since the line tool continues, we'll just
draw a line straight down to any point on

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.530
the circle.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.790
Then from that point, back to the center.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:54.570
You should now have a triangle going vertical
on the circle on the horizontal plane.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.390
Once you have this, go to Tools &gt; Follow Me.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.980
Grab the triangle and bring it around the
whole circle.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.070
Now you have your cone.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.829
If for some reason your cone doesn't have
a button to it.

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:20.979
You can grab the line tool and draw a line
going across the whole thing.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:29.780
Once thatâ€™s done you can delete the line
you just finished drawing.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.850
Now if you want a cone that doesn't have a
point on top, you can draw a circle on top

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520
instead.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.219
To begin, we will draw another circle with
a 2 foot radius

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:52.670
Draw a line going through the center of the
circle.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.229
From the midpoint draw a line going straight
up the height that you want the cone.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.249
We'll make it 5 feet again.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:09.259
Instead of drawing a line straight down, we
will draw a circle on top of that line.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.390
We will make it half a foot.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.500
Once you have the circle drawn on the line,
you'll want to go back to the line tool.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.970
Select the midpoint of the top circle.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:45.950
Draw a line going straight out on a main axis.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.540
Zoom out, and connect that line to the bottom.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.040
Make sure you are staying on the same axis
or this won't work.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:07.750
Then draw a line going back to the base center,
and then you should have a triangle.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.870
Delete the top circle by selecting the border
of and it hitting delete.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.850
Then delete the mid line you made.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.960
Go to Tools &gt; Follow me, and once again draw
the triangle around the base.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.030
And now you have a cone with a flat top instead
of a point.
