On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Debbie and
this is Woody and we're here to tell you about

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.009
personalizing your picture frames. One of
the ways that you can personalize you pictures

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.070
is like this piece here. It's very fun and
whimsical and has a lot of color. So we've

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.230
used a lot of color in the framing. And what
we've done is we've taken some of the pieces

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.190
of the artwork, like the little ducks, and
we actually cut them out in the matting. We've

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.070
also taken the little bubbles that are coming
out of the bathtub and we've added those in

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.890
all different colors. And then we've taken
balloons, you have balloons in the picture,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.850
and we've put those in the other corner. So
we sort of used different things that are

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.690
in this picture. So can you imagine one of
your children coming home with a colorful

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.180
picture? Well, you would be able to cut all
those little designs and make their picture

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.739
a frame on the wall which you'll really be
able to enjoy. Let me show you how to make

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.680
some of these like the balloons over there.
They're pretty simple and this one I'm not

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.980
even going to draw it. And I'm going to cut
it from the base. So what I do is I just make

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:28.350
a circle like a balloon. It's so simple. It's
not hard to do. Maybe you like to do scrapbooking.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.140
Well you can use this on scrapbooking. It
is so cool. And so what I've done is I've

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.479
made it a little design that looks like a
balloon. But it doesn't look finished, does

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.611
it? It just sort of looks like a circle. So
what I'm going to do is now I'm going to use

00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:49.130
a little razor blade and I'm going to make
the string that you see on the picture. So

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.850
I'm going to put my finger at an angle and
I'm going to bring this string coming down.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:09.599
And what this does is it finishes. It gives
that just that little specialness. So now

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.340
I have the string that's coming down. But
you know it still needs a little bit more.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:33.139
So what I do is just take little tiny cuts.
Now I've made the bottom of the balloon.

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:44.040
So you can see that this is really simple
and anyone can do this with the wonderful

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.170
little Alto Mat Cutter.
