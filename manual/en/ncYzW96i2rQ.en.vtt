00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.809
HELLO, I'm Paco TÃ¡bara from reciclayjuega.com and here I am playing the guitar.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.440
Today I am going to teach you how to build a toy guitar with a plastic boat.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.609
To build this guitar, we're just going to need

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.010
A plastic bottle, a sticker, a clothespin and some markers

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.670
or "markers" that we have spent, used, old ....

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.829
The first thing we do is draw on a sticker paper two circles (one inside the other)

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.690
And then we must paint, decorate these circles.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.250
The next step is: stick this circle on the detergent bottle

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.090
Now we cut the central hole of the guitar.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.689
We also have to make some holes to put the plugs of the markers

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:19.189
We make 4 up and 4 holes down and put some markers in each of them

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.530
We will make the strings of the guitar with elastic bands.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.400
We put a clothespin to raise a little the strings and they can vibrate.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.729
We have the clothespin on and now we can start playing the guitar.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.950
Or to make noise. What we know best to do !!!!
