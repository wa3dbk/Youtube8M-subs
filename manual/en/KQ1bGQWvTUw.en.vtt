Take a bowl in which you put flour

add salt

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.989

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.000
add softened butter

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.869
Remove from the refrigerator 15 minutes before

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.070
it will be easier to use it in the dough

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.840
mix

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.840
add water and form a ball

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.090
Put the dough in cling film

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.700
Place in the fridge

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.830
spread the dough on a floured surface

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.720
put the size of your pan

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.410
there I took a mold of 31 cm

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.300
then put your dough on the mold

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.800
Then you cut the excess dough with a rolling pin

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.010
prick with a fork

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.480
and raise the dough

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.370
let's do a cooking white

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.430
use a parchment paper and set lentils or beans

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.050
to prevent the dough from puffing up during baking

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.900
as it cooks , prepare the filling

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.309
Cook the bacon

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:13.009
then absorb the excess fat with a paper towel

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.969
Now you can prepare the cream

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:27.249
Break the eggs into a bowl

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:34.249
add the cream

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:41.239
then milk

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.569
salt and pepper

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.479
add nutmeg if you want

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.839
mix

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:56.569
here's your dough once precooked

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.500
put bacon and cheese on your pie

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:14.100
