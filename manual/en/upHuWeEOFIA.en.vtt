00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.960
Until now I thought that heaven on Earth was
simply a worn out cliché and then I came

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.009
to the beautiful island of Koh Samui and discovered
a place that is so unique, so enriching and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.949
so sublime that no earthly words can adequately
describe it.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.169
Hi I’m Olivia Trussel and I’m blessed
to be here at Kamalaya Koh Samui, Thailand’s

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:32.140
award winning wellness sanctuary and holistic
spa.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.980
Located on a tranquil stretch of Koh Samui’s
south-eastern coastline, Kamalaya unfolds

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.101
amidst lush tropical vegetation, cascading
streams and ancient granite boulders, with

00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:51.420
panoramic views of jungled mountains, the
aquamarine sea and outlying islands.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.430
The land is home to a cave that for hundreds
of years served as a place of spiritual retreat

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.440
for a group of Buddhist monks.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.940
The accumulated energy of their daily prayers
seems to live on as a nurturing and inspiring

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.510
presence that is like a tonic for the soul.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.590
Kamalaya was created by John and Karina Stewart,
because they felt there was a need for places

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.880
for people to go where they could disengage
from their usual responsibilities, distractions

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.180
and habits, and reconnect more deeply with
themselves and find the resources within for

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.070
healing and a more enhanced meaning of life.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.280
