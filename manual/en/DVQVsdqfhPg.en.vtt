00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.451
It was a nice day and then rain hit.

00:00:02.451 --> 00:00:05.634
Two stroke lead after a rocky start!

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.684
2-stroke against Chad Reed's 4-stroke.

00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:11.095
My name is Travis Pastrana.

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:14.207
This is my wife.

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.631
This is where I'm going.

00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:22.896
And this is my story.

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:33.714
We are at New Hampshire
Motor Speedway right now.

00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:36.499
Travis is racing the GRC.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.872
He won this race last year
so that's really exciting.

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:52.917
I'm hoping that he repeats that
and brings the car back to victory lane.

00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:55.747
TRAVIS: It was a sunny day, 
it was a nice day,

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:58.307
and then rain hit with
only three of us left to qualify.

00:00:58.307 --> 00:00:59.525
We barely made it through,

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:00.727
I mean, it was a monsoon that hit the track.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.531
We qualified last,
next to last, and third from last.

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.154
We're all in the back row
that's got to go after that.

00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:12.877
LYN-Z: In their heat,
either of them made the final,

00:01:12.877 --> 00:01:15.118
so to LCQ they went.

00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.236
TRAVIS: Well we made the main,
won the LCQ.

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:21.936
Price came in,
we were sitting 1, 2.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:23.550
We had a mechanical 
coming out the corner

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.642
but we got one of the
Dodge trucks in the final.

00:01:25.642 --> 00:01:26.933
Main event, here we go!

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.209
We pulled it wide open,
smash everybody.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:30.597
Price, that's a great plan.

00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:32.313
That's usually the plan.

00:01:41.218 --> 00:01:43.123
Who needs tires anyway?

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:47.149
Basically did the whole final
with the tire off the rim.

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:53.102
TRAVIS: Got a win in the LCQ but
got a flat in the main event.

00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:55.105
I tell you what,
these fans up here are awesome.

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:56.727
These guys are passionate.

00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:59.270
LYN-Z: It's just really cool to see
that the fans really support him

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.973
no matter what the
outcome of the race is.

00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:06.036
It's a lot to keep smiling after a race
but these guys make it a lot easier.

[CHAD DOWLING]

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.831
So we came out to two-stroke week,
we were going to Bambam's house today,

00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:31.257
but evidently there's a tropical storm,
everything's kinda underwater.

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:33.287
So we're going golfing instead.

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:37.612
We only get two strokes deduction
for a hole because we're pretty bad

00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:39.630
and we're going to try to make par.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.373
Skies out, thighs out,
that's how we look at golfing.

00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:48.005
A little bummed on the rain,
two-stroke week starting out in the rough.

00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:51.287
Watch Dave some day,
he's not a competitive person.

00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:53.242
When he actually has to compete
and there's money on the line,

00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:55.535
like look at his face, just ruined.

00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:59.248
- You all ruin the game of golf for me. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

00:02:59.248 --> 00:03:01.205
Just love the depression on his face.

00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:03.885
Hey you're still up one stroke man,
you might win this [inaudible]

00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:07.254
My day's over.

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:10.250
I know we're in a recession,
but shoot, you can buy more balls.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:13.251
There's a lot of back sweat on that guy
that's pissing in the woods over there.

00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:15.001
[laughter]

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.523
He's got that ringer
on the Charlie Sheen shirt,

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:20.060
it appears the shirt's
grabbing on his putter.

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.891
- So...
- Yes! Yes!

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.487
And he just failed to
get it past the women's tee,

00:03:25.487 --> 00:03:27.099
I don't know what happened.

00:03:27.653 --> 00:03:29.712
That's the best naked shot I've ever seen,
usually when people are naked,

00:03:29.712 --> 00:03:31.314
they just hit the ball.

00:03:31.314 --> 00:03:32.816
WOMAN: Travis, why are 
you sweating so much?

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:34.596
I did.

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:39.079
Alright so right now for a hundred dollars
I'm down 2 strokes, one hole to go.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.745
I need my accuracy, the putter.

00:03:45.284 --> 00:03:48.250
Hey buddy, no pressure,
no pressure, no pressure.

00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:53.578
So you won a hundred dollars
and you won the most holes,

00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:55.874
so you also won money on the holes.

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:00.685
Now we get to go do jetski races.

00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:17.529
I feel pretty good, we came
straight off our golf game, [inaudible]

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.825
David's got his Hawaiian shirt,
he's got his short shorts,

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:22.161
he's looking good out there.

00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:28.737
Haha!

00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:30.006
Jetski day!

00:04:45.477 --> 00:04:47.744
Wooooo!!

We're on Lover Lake,
we're boarding the lightning!

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.982
And we're going to put 
the lap time down,

00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:55.114
and we're going to 
continue tomorrow.

00:04:55.114 --> 00:04:58.947
I've got the time to beat
so far with a 55.7.

00:04:58.948 --> 00:05:01.318
Before the tropical storm hit,
I went out there.

00:05:01.318 --> 00:05:04.493
Now, it's raining, it's choppy,
they're having a really tough time

00:05:04.493 --> 00:05:06.571
beating my time. I like it.
It's great to be winning.

00:05:09.614 --> 00:05:11.026
Where's Tarah at?

00:05:11.026 --> 00:05:13.712
- She's definitely leading at--
- 54.8

00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:17.614
It's just not fair because
I'm really competitive and everything

00:05:17.614 --> 00:05:22.009
and we come out here and get
my ass kicked by a girl every single time.

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:24.839
Girls aren't supposed
to win at two-stroke week.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.366
Tarah, you're pretty good for a girl.

00:05:28.366 --> 00:05:30.392
Easy, Pastrana.

That was awesome!

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:44.849
The fact that she got up so squirrelly
makes me kinda smile a little bit,

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.779
'cause she beat me on jetski so...

00:05:52.461 --> 00:05:55.234
We're here at Chad Reed's house,
I don't know how the neighbors complain.

00:05:55.234 --> 00:05:58.010
We are so far in the middle of nowhere
we had to go around the cows

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.871
on all the roads to get here.

00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:02.934
I'm a little jealous, I missed
the memo on the shirt situation here,

00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:04.857
what's all this about?

00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:06.770
It's two-stroke week.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.118
Chad has been
working on his shifter cart,

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.466
so they're going to go out

00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:10.814
and try to beat the two-stroke.

00:06:10.814 --> 00:06:13.864
Alright, two-stroke against
Chad Reed's 4-stroke, see what we got.

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:42.018
First moto was not good
for two-stroke week.

00:06:42.018 --> 00:06:44.706
Chad went out there and took
his four-stroke definitely to

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:46.177
pretty dominant performance,

00:06:46.177 --> 00:06:47.960
although I did run him 
off the track once.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.549
I think technically,
I mean technically, I won.

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:53.637
[laughter]
I beat your ass.

00:06:53.637 --> 00:06:55.840
Your two-stroke
didn't even last the moto.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.344
You pushed it back.
