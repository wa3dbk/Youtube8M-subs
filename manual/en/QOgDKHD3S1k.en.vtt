Evolve: Monster Guide THE WRAITH, How to Dominate and Win, All Evolutions, Abilities and Powers

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.700
Hey what is happening guys, Kris here and
in this video ill be giving you a complete

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.410
guide to the Wraith monster in evolve, telling
you about all its abilities, its general features

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.130
and how to use it effectively against them
hunters.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.419
So the wraith is the stealthy, sneaky type
of monster in evolve better suited for deceiving

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.640
the hunters and using psychic energy powers
to teleport and traverse the map. Shes a much

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.210
more agile monster than the others, traversing
the map and using some super speedy attacks

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.780
on her enemies. The Wraith has less health
and armour than the other monsters, but she

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.999
makes up for it with a higher level of mobility,
and fast hitting attacks. Instead of eating

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:50.519
her prey, she uses energy to liquidize them,
and then just simply drinks them up, her special

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.429
powers defiantly turn her into a different
monster than the others. To move around, the

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.600
wraith actually levitates and can quickly
teleport forwards, boosting in a specific

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.800
direction, this can get her out of some tricky
situations with the hunters and allow her

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.200
to cover more ground.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.270
So the Wraiths abilities are all energy related
and include abduction, warp blast, Decoy and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.330
Supernova.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.320
The abduction ability allows the Wraith to
quickly teleport in from a distance, towards

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.010
and enemy or prey, and grab them, after this
she teleports backwards and deals damage,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.900
Its a good ability to use to separate a hunter
from the others and do damage to them, and

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.470
even finishing off and singling out an enemy
low on health, delivering that final blow.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.180
Its also a good move to use the abduction
ability on wildlife running away, as you can

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.640
easily catch them this way. You need to aim
the wraith in the direction of your target

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.000
to initiate the abduction and once you manage
to grab your target, the wraith will automatically

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.660
teleport them back to your initial position,
once separated from the group, its best to

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.450
deal as much damage as you can to your enemy,
killing them if you can.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.140
The warp blast is a great crowd control ability,
the wraith flys forwards towards wherever

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.350
aimed, and creates an explosion dealing damage
to anyone or anything caught within it, the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.250
blast also pushes away everyone nearby. This
is a good ability to use against clusters

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.879
of hunters all close by each other, as you
can deal damage to several targets at a time,

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.980
its also good for quickly taking out smaller
forms of wildlife and taking out a large chunk

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.640
of health from bigger creatures.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.770
The decoy ability turns you invisible, and
the wraith summons a secondary version of

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.050
itself, this will then go after the hunters
and wildlife for a few seconds attacking them

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.730
with melee, giving you a chance to escape
or move position. The decoy looks almost identical

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.030
to the real wraith making it a really good
ability to trick other hunters, it can be

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.120
helpful when hunters are getting close to
you in the early evolution stages and you

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.230
can trick them by sending it at them to keep
them busy whilst you run away. Though watch

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.380
out if you do this as the trapper might bring
the dome up as soon as the decoy gets close

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.730
to them, so make sure theres a bit of distance
between you and the hunters first. You can

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.980
also pounce on a hunter whilst they are distracted
by the decoy and deal a heavy amount of damage.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.310
If you start to attack or teleport, the decoy
will disappear and your invisibility will

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.440
wear off so make sure that you have a good
plan of attack if youre low on health.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.180
And the last skill that the wraith has under
its belt is the supernova ability, The wraith

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.910
creates a small arena like area, in which
she gains a speed and damage boost, being

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.620
able to viciously attack her enemies in a
devastating frenzy, The supernova ability

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.910
is only effective when the wraith is within
its arena, and the damage and speed buffs

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.090
will disappear if you leave it, so its best
to use this ability when you get up close

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.489
to the target you want to damage and then
use it. The supernova ability is a really

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.680
good option to use and you should use the
ability a lot, you can kill the hunters really

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.590
quick with this one.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.590
So due to the wraiths low health and armour
and its quicker, stealthier like nature its

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.440
better suited to sneaking up on targets, zipping
in and out of combat to deal some high close

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.700
up damage and to retreat before she loses
all her health. The wraiths attacks can be

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.450
really brutal when combined and used one after
the other, a cool thing about the supernova

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.910
ability is that the supernova effect is also
given to the wraith decoy, so when combined

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.989
the two abilities can work really well together,
and itll let you and your decoy attack at

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.109
the same time. You have to act fast whilst
being the wraith as you cant stay in battle

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.430
for too long so, quick decisions as to whether
or not to stay in the fight, or run away to

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.720
rebuild your armour are often needed. And
just because you can levitate, doesnt mean

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.350
that you dont leave any footprints, try working
that one out.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.850
