00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.790
Wait!

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.520
See if you have cans that you can recycle for this project.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.010
I'm going to show you how you can recycle this can into a pencil holder.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.419
Start by washing the can thoroughly and letting it dry completely.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:24.769
Then paint at the bottom of the can with acrylic paint. Cover the side of the can with paint

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.050
past the bottom rim area. Now, I'm going to paint the top rim by dabbing

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.190
it with a foam brush to get an even coat. Let it dry completely.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.090
Cover it with a pattern paper. Place the paper below the rim at the top and just about this

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.940
much at the bottom of the can. The reason I paint the top and bottom of the

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.600
can like this is because, when I cover it with the paper, the can looks finished, as

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.190
it doesn't show the can's color. First, measure the paper.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.569
Then, cut the paper with the craft knife. Put glue on the can and then, place the paper

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:11.859
just below the rim and glue it down. You don't need to add glue to the whole surface of the

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.880
paper. Next, line up the inside of the can with a

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.289
foam sheet. Measure the foam sheet first. So, when you cut it, you'll be sure that it

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.289
will fit in the can. Use your bone folder to push the foam against

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.020
the wall of the can. Then, use a little bit of glue to hold the foam to the can.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.939
Now, let's decorate this can with a strip of felt ribbon.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.770
Measure the length of the ribbon by placing it inside where the foam lines meet, place

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.209
it about a quarter from top and bring it outside of the can. Cut the strip, peel it off and

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:54.039
stick it to the can. The last step is to put a tag, you can write

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.079
your name or anything on it. Put a dab of
glue on it and place it just below the end

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.450
of the felt strip. Last, but not least, put pearl stickers on

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.810
both sides of the tag to add more dimension and a touch of class.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.390
Here you go, a lovely pencil holder from a can that you would normally just throw in

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.230
the trash. You can save money, and help the environment,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.242
by doing this craft project.
