00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
hello namaste

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.050
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.700
another session with your VahChef at

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.830
Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.949
learn how to make gunpowder adai you

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.600
know for this first we're going to learn

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.810
how to make the batter for basic adai, for

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.109
this tuvar dal, chana dal, add rice, the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.710
red chillies and curry leaves

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.770
we're going to add water just wash it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.230
once drain the water and then again

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.930
we're going to use fresh water to soak

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.059
this ingredients, the recipe is also

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.980
very simple if you take one cup of rice,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.809
add 1 tablespoon of channa dal, 1 tablespoon

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.360
of tuvar dal but you can also increase or

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.370
decrease the amount of dals depending

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.320
on the consistency of the texture you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.899
want if you want little crispy you can

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.850
increase the rice quantity if you want

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.840
it little soft

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.329
increase the dal quantities and in this

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.689
we're going to add some salt, hing now

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.409
add so much water that it should little

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.670
be over the ice

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.810
you know you should not be too much

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.760
because we added the rice and the hing

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.830
you don't want to lose the flavor later

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.270
by draining the water you know after

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.340
adding this water you need to soak it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.830
for at least two hours you know four

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.670
hours of overnight is also possible and by

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.740
the time this all this water will be

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.259
absorbed if you have any water left over

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.840
after you know soaking it for more than

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.939
two three hours that means you added too

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.799
much water so don't add too much water

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.990
because when you make this batter

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.250
you want the batter to be slightly

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.500
thicker not like a dosa batter little

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.990
bit coarse and thicker, now look at this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.960
batter this is coarse this is what we

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.140
use to make fantastic Adais now that the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.600
batter is all ready we're going to make

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.350
this adai onto a nonstick pan just put two

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.649
tablespoon of batter and just spread

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.079
this you know not thin like dosa

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.560
but slightly thicker look at this

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.300
that should be good enough traditionally

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.430
they spread this with the hand by just

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.520
weting the hand in the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.010
water and spread it, after spreading it

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.140
just add some oil on top but what is the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.370
difference between a regular and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.670
a gunpowder adai, for gunpowder adai lot of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.350
non-Indians were thinking gunpowder

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.180
how they are using in cooking this is

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.210
made with our nuts and spices and this

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.100
will make very very tasty

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.130
so first we're going to spread this gun

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.810
powder on top of this adai and then we

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.870
will ignite and blast it then it becomes

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.980
so super super tasty wow okay spread

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.780
good amount of gunpowder and now you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.090
know we're going to make holes in the adai

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.700
there are rules in making the holes you

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.070
make one hole never two holes you make

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.250
three holes never four holes so always odd

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.560
number so i'm going to make three today

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.180
ok just one in the center one in this

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.970
side and one in this side okay and just

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.090
add some oil also in the holes, holes

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.850
need to be oiled for good thing and just put

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.730
the lid on and this will create a kind

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.250
of steam and it won't let the adai

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.430
burn and this steam will also help for

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.330
even coloring of your adais and also will let it

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.200
cook on the top part also now you can

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.060
see that sizzling has stopped and all

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.280
the  steam also once you open it it will

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.010
evaporate and trust me once you put the

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.500
lid on the coloring of these adai comes

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.310
perfect now before we turn it to the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.180
other side

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.740
we're just going to put some more oil

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.490
because this gunpowder need some oil to

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.530
make it very nice and flavorful

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.740
now turn it to the other side and just

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.860
with the wooden little laddle just press it but

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.680
we're not going to put the lid on top

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.840
because now you want the adai to be nice

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.950
and crispy

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.850
ok just you know by pressing this it'll

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.530
color evenly

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.500
ok now we're going to cook it on a slow

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.479
flame for another one minute you know

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.060
the gun

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.940
powder can get slightly burnt faster so

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.900
be careful

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.660
reduce the flame and we'll get a nice

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.310
nice awesome flavor and color when you

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.889
cook this for one and half minute after

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.630
cooking it for one and half minute

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.750
look at this, this is perfect, what an

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.430
aroma, what an aroma!

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.639
wow just for serving i'm going to cut

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.550
them into four pieces

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.780
ok just like you cut pizza and these

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.540
kind of adai is my favorite and we used so

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.490
lot of these while i was working in Park

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.040
Sheraton i'm telling you once you put

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.180
gunpowder the adai becomes exclusive wow

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.610
hmm the crunchiness from both sides

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.610
with such intense flavors, dear friends i'm

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.570
telling you of all the adai's if you ask

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.139
me what is the best adai, for me it is

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.410
gunpowder adai because it really gives a

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.350
kick in wherever it required, dear friends

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.000
