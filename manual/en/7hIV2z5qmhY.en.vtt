00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.790
[music]

00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:11.311
Just north of Beaumont

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.915
on the edge of the
Big Thicket National Preserve

00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:16.383
awaits Villag Creek State Park.

00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:19.520
The thing that really makes the
park special

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:22.821
is it being part of the
Big Thicket area of Texas.

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.658
You won't find as many plants
and animals in one little area

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:27.728
anywhere in North America.

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:31.165
From blooming dogwoods to
prickly pear cactus

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:32.800
to jack in the pulpit

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:35.603
here there are plants 
from four different ecosystems

00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:37.093
for folks to see.

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:40.141
My favorite part of the job 
is taking people out,

00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:43.076
especially kids because they're 
wide eyed and full of wonder

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.511
and absorb things like a sponge.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.843
Anybody know what kind of
plant that is?

00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:48.650
Yaupon. That' yaupon holly.

00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:51.878
The species name on it is 
Ilex vomitoria.

00:00:51.948 --> 00:00:53.755
Exactly because if you 
eat enough

00:00:53.823 --> 00:00:54.988
of those leaves or berries,

00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:56.490
that's what's gonna
happen to you.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.395
The Gibsons from nearby Silsbee

00:01:00.463 --> 00:01:01.661
"What was that?"

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.991
look and listen

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.753
when they explore the park's
numerous trails.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.905
What is it?

00:01:10.973 --> 00:01:14.341
Might be a leopard frog,
some kind of toad.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.706
Look at his neck.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:18.813
I am a visual person

00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:23.485
but hearing is a big part with
me and I like all the sounds.

00:01:23.553 --> 00:01:28.180
Wind, as I will always say,
is one of my favorite things.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.393
We hear the frogs a lot
out here.

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:35.296
We hear all kinds of birds.

00:01:36.698 --> 00:01:38.198
Oh, this is pretty.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.835
Easy going Village Creek

00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:42.170
is definitely the 
main attraction.

00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:44.338
It is just like cruising.

00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:48.538
You make one stroke and
you glide 10.

00:01:48.606 --> 00:01:51.611
It's one of the few free-flowing
streams left in Texas.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.785
It's not dammed up anywhere.

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:54.315
It's a flat water stream

00:01:54.383 --> 00:01:56.431
so it's easy to canoe 
or kayak down

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.885
and it's a lot of fun.

00:01:57.953 --> 00:01:59.546
It's something people really
love to do.

00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:03.991
It's a nice, quiet stream

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.695
even though it's relatively
close to the city.

00:02:06.763 --> 00:02:11.465
Easy access. Lots of birds
and other wildlife to see.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:13.735
There's a pileated woodpecker
in that tree.

00:02:13.803 --> 00:02:15.603
He's eating all the mulberries.

00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:18.003
They're beautiful birds.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.835
It's different every time
I'm on it.

00:02:19.903 --> 00:02:22.843
It doesn't matter what day
of the week it is

00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:24.045
or what the weather is.

00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:26.711
There's always something new.

00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:30.885
[music]

00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:33.285
It can be the creek,

00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:35.356
camping,

00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:38.258
or the quiet.

00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:42.430
Village Creek State Park
is worth the visit.
