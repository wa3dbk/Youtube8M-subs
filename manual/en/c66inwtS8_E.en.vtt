00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A long while back I made this video looking into whether or not premium PC cooling fans were worth it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.020
This raised another question however, one that some people are actually rather uncomfortable discussing.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.140
Is after-market CPU cooling even worth it? I can understand why this can be a difficult conversation.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.420
People often don't like their purchasing decisions coming into question.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.260
But in 2015, with much of the hardware development world going into less power draw and lower thermal output,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.400
Is it needed anymore? Let's find out.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:40.120
And stay tuned to our cores for gaming update where we will explore how many CPU cores are really needed for gaming in 2015.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.920
â™ªIntro Musicâ™ª

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.440
The Cooler Master Nova Touch TKL utilizes

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.280
exclusive hybrid capacitive switches
powered by Topor, and is now available at a more affordable price.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:11.320
Many a time in the history of PC builders, a young Jimmy or Jane has sat at the checkout window wondering if they should spring for a better CPU cooler at the cost of a weaker component elsewhere.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.420
Hours have been spent researching this question, but to no avail.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.940
Whatever shall they do? If they are not interested in over-clocking or aesthetics, the obvious answer is just to stick with the stock cooler and just invest elsewhere.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.960
But if they want to over-clock is it worth it? How much is worth it?

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.720
There are a lot of potential avenues to look at this from.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.860
One we won't be exploring is custom water-cooling loops.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.040
They are too expensive although there are some exceptions. They perform better although there are some exceptions.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.660
You get the point. Essentially custom water-cooling is an extreme variable because it is well ... custom.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.260
There is a metric ton of benefits of custom water-cooling, but many of it come at the cost of well ... cost.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.520
At PAX East 2015, I did a top 5 gaming desktops at the Intel booth video.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.280
One of the systems shown in the video, the Maingear one, had around a thousand dollars in just fittings alone.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.760
Now I know not everyone is doing that and if you are you know what, that's freaking awesome.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.500
And if you are interested in that, that's great! Please post your build in the build-logs section of the forum because it's probably gonna be beautiful -

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.360
and I'm probably gonna want to see it.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.400
But this video may not really cater to you.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.460
I personally water-cool, custom water-cooling but I spent about a quarter of that on my whole setup -

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.880
including all the fittings and everything.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.520
And I expect most people that are newly getting into water cooling will be getting top of the line processors anyway -

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.900
so the whole "is it worth it" question is less likely applicable to them because improved water-cooling is directly on their CPU performance upgrade path.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.260
Now if someone is getting a processor that does have potential upgrades, now we're talking.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.160
We will be testing as a Cooler Master t4 in order to represent a fairly
average example of a low to mid range

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.110
air cooler at about 30 ish dollars and a
Cooler Master Sidon, which will represent

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.390
the dual 120 millimeter rad and the
similarly performing large dual air

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.280
tower coolers like the Noctua and HD 15
at around 100 ish dollars. Last and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.450
definitely least in terms of performance
is the general run of the mill, no frills

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.220
Intel stock cooler which is bundled with your processor. The antagonist in the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.959
story will be the Intel 4690k, an
extremely commonly recommended and

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.889
purchased processor that we'll be
testing these coolers at three different

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:35.620
settings. One is the stock setting of a
3.5 gigahertz base frequency and a 3.9

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.120
gigahertz boost frequency, and next is a slight gigahertz overclock of all cores

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.660
running at 4 gigahertz, but a pretty
hefty voltage increase running at

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.180
1.25 volts, and lastly it will run
into another slightly higher frequency

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.959
of 4.3 gigahertz, and a heavier voltage
increase of 1.35 volts. Please note that

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.500
you could run these voltages and get
much higher clock speeds

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.970
I was simply cranking up the voltage to
turn up the heat. Next up we have the CMT

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.840
4 and before you comment down below that
I'm a horrible human being because I

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.930
didn't use the Hyper 212 Evo, I know. I'm sorry we somehow don't have one in

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.400
office, I honestly have no idea how Linus has gone this long without having one in

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.200
stock. Yeah, anyways, it's slightly more
expensive and performs slightly better

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.160
than the t4, and as you can see, the
general message would have

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.740
probably been somewhat similar overall. The 1.35 volt overclock resulting in a 95

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.510
degree processor and some throttling
wasn't great, but this small upgrade

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.810
allowed us to run at 1.25
volts at essentially the same

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.910
temperatures as the stock cooler at
stock speeds and voltages on the CPU.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.070
A solid improvement for just 28 bucks.
Lastly we have the Seidon 240. This

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.720
cooler was able to achieve a very nice
stock speed load temperature of 47

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.600
degrees, and tied the stock coolers stock clock thermal output, but at

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.640
1.35 volts, giving you a lot more
room to play with. But the Seidon 240 has a

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.540
really awkward price position when
compared to a 4690k because of 4690k is

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.770
240 dollars and a 4790k which is
hyper-threaded and has a much higher

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.240
boost clock with 4.4 gigahertz
it's $340 exactly a hundred dollars more.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.220
Very similar pricing to a Seidon 240.
In conclusion, is it worth it? I'll give

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.430
you a solid "maybe". From the raw
performance numbers, it looks like if you

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.880
don't want to overclock, don't upgrade. If you want to overclock but don't have a

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.260
ton of budget, get something like a Hyper 212 Evo. If you have a fair amount of

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.220
budget, upgrade your processor or if
you're already at the top of the line, just

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.770
get whatever your budget allows. But
that's not the whole story either, is it?

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.419
Some people care a lot about aesthetics. I could call them shallow, but I do as

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.470
well. Maybe I'm shallow, I don't know. And then there is some solace junkies as

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.130
well. I know people that run custom water cooling setups for just their entire

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.480
systems and don't even have an overclock, they just do it so they can turn their

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.950
fans and their pumps super low and run their computer at a whisper-quiet level.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.310
What solution is best for you? For me,
it's custom water cooling. I've had a

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.460
bunch of my kit for a while, so upgrading doesn't really cost that much money.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.900
I really like the aesthetics and it's just
fun. Are you someone who's going to try

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.720
save a bunch of money and not buy an
aftermarket cooler? Are you going to go

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.590
for, like, the affordable but kind of
badass, get a little bit more out of your

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.380
processor range, or are you pretty much already up there and just want something

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.540
cool and easy? Let me know in the
comments down below- Or even if you're

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.340
custom water cooling, which is super vast, comments down below,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.160
Over on the forum, either one totally
works, let me know. Also down below

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.190
this video, you'll be able to see a
linked for shirts that are definitely

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.950
not a Twitch Plays Pokemon shirt,
although twitchplayspokemon was awesome.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.250
Nostalgia... Anyways, over on the forum as well, there should be a "Support us" link

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.520
where you can change things like your
Amazon affiliate links to our affiliate

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.540
codes so we get a small kickback
whenever you buy things over there which

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.810
is actually super helpful, and there's
tons of other ways to support Linus

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.790
Media Group as well, like going on the
forum or watching videos. Anyways, thanks

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.700
for watching, I'll see you guys next time.
