00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.220
So you chaps after Amix too, aye?

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.040
Heh...your accent's funny!

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.860
Dude! Stop! He's helping us...sorry about that Connor.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.260
That's alright chap!

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.600
So what's your story?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.760
Ever since the E.o.M. killed my old man, I've been sailing these seas to find a rare sea weed...

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.980
that could actually cure the mutant infection.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.920
A cure?!

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.820
Dafuq was that?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.340
Bloody hell...

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.420
DOLPHINS!

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.440
It's a mutant squid!

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.560
So long chap!

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.860
I didn't know your gun could do that Sean!

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.540
Bloody beast! I trapped you! How'd you get out?! GODDAMMIT!

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.740
TYLER!

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.440
Damn...*cough*

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.740
I took a blow.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.640
Don't worry man...we got this...you're gonna be alright!

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.020
CONNOR!

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.440
He's gone, my man...

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.160
Guys look, land! The tracking device says Amix is so close!

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.240
Alright, let's go.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.200
I don't like this one bit homies...there's a real bad trap waiting for us over there.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.780
We have to do this...for Connor.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.520
Alright, let's head out.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.260
Hehehe...they are coming right at you captain!

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.660
Good...
