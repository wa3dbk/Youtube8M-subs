00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.100
[Intro music]

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.260
This easy to make sauce will add a fancy finishing touch 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.040
to appetizers, such as salmon tartare, crab cakes 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.030
or tomato salad among others. 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.120
The vinegar is reduced to a glaze and will stay fresh 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.000
in the refrigerator indefinitely. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.240
Not all the balsamic vinegars were created equal. 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.000
You will find the fake ones, which represent over 90% 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.140
of the world-wide production, and there is the real one. 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.170
The real one comes from Modena in Italy. 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.100
When it is time to make the balsamic vinegar reduction, 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.000
do not use the expensive one, the real one, 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.140
as it will be a shame to boil it. 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.260
Use an inexpensive vinegar without too many additives and 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.010
caramel in there, so read carefully the ingredient list 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.280
and use it. 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.010
This real balsamic vinegar is ten years old. 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.160
This one is 25 years old. 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.100
And this one, only the name on the bottle says it's a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.220
balsamic vinegar, but we all know that it's not. 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.260
I'm going to show you the differences between the two of them.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.270
And you will understand why people or chefs boil the inexpensive

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.250
vinegar to make it look like the real one. 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.070
So you see the consistency. It's pretty liquidy. 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:46.230
And here, if I'm using the real one, it's already thick. 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:54.100
And you will see it. Look how thick it is. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.000
So you see the inexpensive vinegar is running everywhere. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.040
And the real balsamic vinegar that hasn't boiled, 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.150
that is just pure, almost doesn't run. 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.250
So you understand now why we are boiling the vinegar. 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.110
Pour the vinegar in a sauce pan. 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.050
On high heat, bring the vinegar to a boil. 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.080
The vinegar is boiling, reduce the heat to medium high 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.070
and let it simmer for about 10 minutes 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.230
or until it reduces to a quarter cup. 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:45.200
Almost there. 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.210
Keep an eye on your reduction because when the vinegar 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.070
starts to get thicker it could burn very easily. 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.110
So here the vinegar has reduced to about a quarter cup. You see.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.280
So I'm going to let it cool for about five minutes 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.150
and then we will transfer it into a squeeze bottle. 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.230
Leave the saucepan declined while the vinegar is cooling down. 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.220
It will be easier to transfer to the squeeze bottle. 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.050
The reduction has cooled down. It's still hot though. 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.220
Transfer to a squeeze bottle. 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.100
When it will be totally cold, I will show you the consistency 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.130
and how to use it. 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.250
The balsamic vinegar reduction had totally cooled down 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.010
and the new acquired consistency, like a caramel, will allow 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.040
you to make a great designs to decorate your plates. 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.070
Let me show you. 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:57.200
So you can see that when it comes it's pretty thick. 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:14.100
You can make very thin lines or you can do a circle if you want,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.230
like a snail. 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:23.080
And it doesn't run.
