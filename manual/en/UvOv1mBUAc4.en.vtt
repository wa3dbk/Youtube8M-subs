[footsteps]

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.350
Hello everyone.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.950
I've been asked to give you
some basic information 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.150
about bone marrow
and stem cell transplants.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.550
The procedure is the same for both.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.750
The only difference
is the location

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.450
of the stem cell harvest. 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.650
So let me explain
what that means.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.450
But first,
we need to understand 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.650
what stem cells are,
and how they affect our health.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.150
[footsteps]
Lights please. 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.050
[sound of projector starting]

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.400
[Professor Boone speaks]
Stem cells are one of
the body's greatest SuperHeroes.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.450
They have the amazing ability
either to divide themselves

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.750
indefinitely,
to make new stem cells,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.450
or transform themselves
into the specific cells

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.600
that make up
our tissues and organs. 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.850
So one stem cell may grow up
to be a part of our heart,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.450
and one of it's divided selves

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.650
may grow up to be
a part of our brain.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.950
Stem cells are always at work

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.550
dividing and transforming
themselves to make sure

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.330
the body has all that it needs
to stay healthy. 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.600
[projector is turned off]

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.750
For the purpose of this discussion,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.200
we're going to concentrate on blood stem cells.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.400
[projector starts]

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.450
[Professor Boone speaks]
Most blood stem cells are born

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.650
and live in the spongy interior
of our bones

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.350
known as the marrow.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.650
Once they're ready to mature
and go to work,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350
they become either
red blood cells, 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.100
which carry oxygen
to all parts of our body;

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.100
white blood cells,
which are the soldiers

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.500
of the immune system
that fight infection;

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.250
or platelets, which seal
damaged blood vessels

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.050
and help the blood to clot
when we are cut.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.750
Their service
to the body begins

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.500
just as soon as
they enter the blood stream. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.900
We need all three
of these type of blood cells

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.400
and in the right proportion
to stay alive. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.900
Blood related cancers
such as leukemias,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.050
myelomas,
and some lymphomas

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.200
disrupt the stem cell process,
so that the body produces

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.700
either too few blood cells
or too many abnormal cells.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.300
The treatments used to kill
the cancer, unfortunately,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.050
also stops the bone marrow
from making new stem cells.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.800
This is the point
when doctors turn

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.350
to stem cell or
bone marrow transplants. 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.050
The blood stem cells
used in the transplant
come from a donor.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.200
In some cases, the donor is
actually the patient,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.820
and the stem cells are
collected and frozen before

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.900
the cancer therapies begin, 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.250
and then put back after
the treatments are completed.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.900
In other cases,
the donor is another person

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.500
either related or not. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.950
In either case,
the collection of stem cells

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.180
occurs in one of two ways.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.000
The first is the original method 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.650
that has been used
since the 1960's,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.000
drawing the stem cells from
the marrow of a large bone,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.750
usually the hip bone,
where there is a rich supply.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.900
When stem cells are
collected from the marrow, 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.150
the transplant is referred to
as a bone marrow transplant.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.550
The second method is
stem cell collection

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.400
from the donor's blood. 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.900
When this method is used,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.350
the transplant is referred to
as a stem cell transplant. 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.700
This technology was
made possible when

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.700
researchers developed
growth factor drugs 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.450
that caused
the donor's stem cells

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.300
to grow faster and move
into the blood stream 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.600
giving doctors a sufficient
quantity to use for transplant.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600
[projector is turned off]

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.200
By far the biggest issue 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.850
when dealing with transplants
is making sure

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.500
that the stem cells come
from a matched donor.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.600
Let's see if we can explain
what that actually means.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.800
[projector starts]

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.200
[Professor Boone speaking]
Most cells within our bodies 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.550
have proteins on their surfaces
called "Antigens",

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.550
that tell our immune system
that they belong there.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.800
Cells that do not have
these self markers,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.850
are considered non self
by the immune system,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.150
and are not so politely
booted out the door. 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.400
Each of us has
six primary antigens,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.800
In transplants, the greater
the number of these that match

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.650
between patient and donor,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.750
the greater
the chance of success. 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.000
Matching all six,
is considered a perfect match.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.600
Matching three or less,
will usually result

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.800
in too many complications
for the patient. 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.000
[projector is turned off]
[crowd mumbling]

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.600
Hopefully, this has given you
a better understanding

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.600
of what stem cell and
bone marrow transplants are,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.850
but we've only scratched
the surface. 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.800
For more in depth information,
check with your doctor,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.000
or the various organizations
that specialize in this area.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.050
Thank you for your time.
