00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.010
Alright so you have a 
new little fancy netbook,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.110
everybody's got them, 
they're super duper popular,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.050
just the Acer Aspire One alone is
selling 30,000 a day or something,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.850
all these people have these 
netbooks and then they realize,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.260
you know I have this old game, this
old program I want to install on it

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.560
and I have no way
to get it on there.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.690
You have to put it on your computer
and then mount it on to a flash drive

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.500
and then transfer it over and it ends
up being a big pain in the butt.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.630
Check this out, this is a really 
nice little portable DVD burner.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.360
Very nice and very attractive
little package from Asus.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.970
As you can tell it
is extremely thin

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.240
and it's also extremely capable,
performance has not been affected

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
or compromised in any way
due to this thing's size,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.300
it's actually really really
nice stuff from Asus.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.450
The only thing the model 
number is a little ridiculous,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.480
it's the SDRW-08D1S-U. Ooh wow,
they could have called it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.100
the Asus DVD writer maybe,
something like that.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.960
Anyway very cool 
device, very portable.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.400
Here is what it comes with,
check this out.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340
You get a little stand right? 
Now on the back of this thing

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.840
right over here you've
got a little tab.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.100
And whether you want it
either to leave it like that,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.970
just normal for 
completely compact,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.510
or if it's going to be at home 
pretty much you can

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.110
pull this right off of here and
it will just slide on right there.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.550
So that is one of the cool features
that comes with this little thing

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.750
but again it's not
really that important.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.920
It's just a little DVD burner,
so what is cool about this thing?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.600
Well what is cool about it 
is how you power it.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.800
Check this out, you don't have
to worry too much about carrying

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.600
a big heavy clunky 
power adapter with you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.700
because this thing is powered
completely over USB,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.080
so on one end you've
got this little mini-USB

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.670
and on the other you've 
got dual USB 2.0s.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.470
One transfers the data,
one transfers the power,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.380
so it's as simple as 
plugging this in right here.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.670
Right there you have a little
mini-USB in the back

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.780
and the other end you bring over
to your netbook of choice

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.600
in my case an M10J, 
and as soon as it plugs in

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.200
you're going to see 
the front light up there,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.860
and that's it, it's on, it's 
working and you're good to go.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.290
You push the button and 
there is your DVD drive.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.760
Very very nice little
product here from Asus.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.340
I like that a lot. And again
the most important part

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.070
is how versatile it is
and how portable.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.740
You don't have to take
that stand with you,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.640
you can just take this. And 
to get an old thick DVD burner

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.600
into your bag with
your netbook is ridiculous.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.510
It's bigger than the netbook 
almost, this is tiny,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.910
it adds just a little
bit to your bag

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.750
so it makes it very 
useful, very portable

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.910
and before I let you go
I will tell you what it supports

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.490
and at what speeds, because
DVD drives are hard to talk about

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.690
because there isn't
much to talk about

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960
so you've got to get
all the information in there

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.660
so I might as well give it 
to you. So here we go,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.680
you get, these are are 
dual-layers or single layers,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.870
doesn't matter, for every single one
that I'm about to read to you.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.470
So DVD+Rs, -Rs, ±RWs,
±RAMs and ±ROMs.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.720
It will do every single one of those,
read and write at x8 maximum speed

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.950
except for the RAMs which will
do read and write at x5

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.190
which is pretty pretty good.
So this is an awesome product,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.790
cool box, not so happy
about the model number.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.830
I think it's a little bit overboard,
I mean if the most complicated

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.400
x58 motherboard is called a P16,
why does this one have to be called

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.000
the SDR-08D1S-U. 
It's a little bit over the top

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.000
but it doesn't matter because 
this thing is very very sweet

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.070
and I like it a lot. If you need
a small little DVD for your netbook

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.010
it's really good. If you have any
questions email me.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.510
I'll see you guys next time.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.780
