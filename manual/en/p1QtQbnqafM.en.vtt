Hey everyone. It’s Jeff Salzenstein here

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.960
and I’ve got a great video tennis tip for you
that’s going to help you with your backhand

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.840
especially if you have a two-handed backhand.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.060
If you have a one-hander,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.400
you’re going to have to wait for another video

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.540
for me to help you with your one-handed backhand

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.920
but go ahead and watch the video anyway,
because this tip is one of my top tips.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.840
It really jives with the tennis system that I’ve developed

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.960
which is based a lot on relaxation.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.420
The best athletes in the world know
how to go from tension to relaxation.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.100
Just watch Roger Federer: he is a master

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.420
at being graceful and relaxed on the tennis court.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.300
Now, if you looked at last month’s tennis magazine

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.780
with Caroline Wozniacki on the cover

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.940
you might have noticed her fancy outfit,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.640
you might have noticed the pose,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.660
maybe the footwork, maybe the swing,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.920
but did you notice what her bottom hand
was doing on the racket at the end of the swing?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.020
Go ahead and take a look at that magazine

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.460
and see if you can pick that up.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.560
So they key

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.400
The key to what she’s doing with her bottom hand, or her off-hand,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.420
on the racket when she’s swinging,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.420
is her fingers are opening up a bit,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.400
and that is showing me that she knows
how to relax on her backhand,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.120
and she is using her non-dominant hand

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.860
in my case, as a lefty, I’m using my right hand

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.920
to hit an amazing backhand with a
relaxed bottom hand at the end.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.940
Now, I could’ve used this tip

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.820
during my junior career.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.320
I had some great coaches that were having me hit right-handed forehands

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.300
but I never really got the feel on my
backhand of what I needed to do

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.880
by using that drill.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.420
The drill that made all the difference for me

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
was actually swinging with two hands

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.280
and then relaxing the fingers at the end of the swing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.620
so I still had the stability of both hands on the racket

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.260
with that relaxation component at the end.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.920
So, I want you to go ahead and try that.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.620
Leave a comment if you liked this video and
you feel like this is going to help your game.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.700
And then, I want you to go out and try it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.720
and then come back to me, and
leave me a comment to see if it works,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.400
because I want to learn with you.
I want to help you get better at tennis,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.340
and I’m pretty confident, based on
the results I’m getting with my own backhand,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.920
and with the lessons that I give,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.160
that if you relax your bottom hand
at the end of the swing

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.060
like Caroline Wozniacki, Andy Murray
does it, David Nalbandian,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.940
several other two-handers on the tour, if you do that,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.760
you’re going to have amazing results.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.460
So, I look forward to seeing you at the next video, and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.300
I really want you to go out there, improve your backhand,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.620
relax that bottom hand at the end of the swing,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.220
and let me know how it goes.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.000
Leave me that comment, because I really
want to help you, I want to learn with you,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.400
and find out what works best for your game.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.420
So, we’ll talk soon, and thanks again.
