Hey everybody

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.609
I'm Gabe Graziani and I am your community developer
on Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.389
I'm here at E3 conducting an interview
with a our Associate producer

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:27.300
Jeff Blovin

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.320
and our Creative director on the multi-player
Stéphane Bodet.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.110
-	Thank you for joining me gentlemen.
-	My pleasure.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.180
So we've collected some questions from the
Community.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.810
The first one the key thing that people
want to know is

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.000
where does Assassin's Creed Brotherhood pick up
after Assassin's Creed II?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.500
It picks up right after the events of
Assassins Creed II, at the end

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.360
of Assassin's Creed II when you go head-to-head

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.049
with Rodrigo Borgia.

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:58.350
That brings them back to the Villa Auditore
so it's basically his family Villa,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.160
at which point he, sort of takes a quick
break, you know following the events.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.749
And meanwhile the Borgia are setting
up a counter-attack, a very huge counter-attack

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:16.050
and that will bring him to Rome to the center
of the Borgia influence.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.140
Now, we've heard a lot about

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.689
the Brotherhood.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630
Ezio is going to be amassing

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.030
an army of assassin's, a group of assassin's 
to help fight him and our community was curious to know

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.200
how much differentiation are we going to see among those assassins.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.870
Are they're going to be different
specifically or will they be more generic?

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.170
The entire Assassin's Brotherhood part…
But there is the entire…

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.120
You know Assassin's Creed it’s also Desmond story
so that part of what's happening right now

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.929
in the very early future,

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.360
and we'll talk about that in a minute.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.260
Like I said Ezio is going to be forced
to go to Rome the center of the Borgia

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.290
influence and power and corruption.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.679
He goes there and Rome is decrepit,
the people are starving,

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.299
there are guards everywhere
and he can't basically do it all by himself.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.319
so he'll be,

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.579
in sort of a safe citizen type of manner, 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.270
he'll be recruiting

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.479
assassins and sending them out on missions
to train them.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.910
So they're very easy missions at the very beginning
and they go up to very difficult missions

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.590
all historically set.
So for example you have

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.210
a Vasco de Gama mission.
 
0:02:19.210,0:02:20.349
And then when they come back

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.339
they get experience points,

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.239
which you'll be able to spend

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.630
uniquely on each assassin. But there
is this entire part of meanwhile

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.680
Yeah meanwhile

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.779
Abstergo while Ezio is building his brotherhood

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:38.769
the war between the Assassin's and
the Templar is reaching new heights

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.629
and so the Templars are recruiting new

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.179
subjects

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.409
to be trained to the art of the Assassin's as well.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:52.099
So the idea around that, I don't know if you
remember during AC2

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.460
when you were escaping from Abstergo industries,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.089
you've seen that

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.410
there was a huge room

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.889
with what you call the Animi, 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.719
which is the plural for Animus.

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:04.760
This is where

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.909
they are training their new subjects and that’s where

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.259
the story is for the multiplayer part.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.289
Now are we going to see any changes in a combat
system?

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:20.289
Oh yes very much so. And that's one of
the things that came up a lot from

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:21.609
our fans.

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.049
AC2 was all about diversity
in one on one and we got that pretty much down.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.499
People liked the diversity as opposed to AC1.

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.020
One thing that came out a lot

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.440
from the fans was: ok the fight system is
a bit sort of slow pace, it's a bit

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.330
a question of

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.890
waiting and it was a little bit more defensive-
oriented.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.820
And now we wanted to reward those who strike
First, strike fast.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.749
Those who actually are very offensive.

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:50.620
So you have a lot more combo, it's a
lot more visceral far more fast paced.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.760
If you do a combo move or a counter kill

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.870
in AC2 you couldn't get that interrupted
it was like a one shot one kill guaranteed.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.760
This time around you will be able to

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.380
be attacked from the back

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.030
and as you'll see in the demo I think we
killed twenty people in twenty five seconds

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.830
or something crazy like that. So it’s a lot more
fast pace. We wanted to reward those

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.859
who are really good with
their technique of fighting.

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.740
Now of course the biggest question on our
Communities’ mind

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.620
since we've put up the Assassin's Creed Brotherhood's
website with all the weapons and things, 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.180
they are very curious about what kind of new weapons
and devices we'll see in the next game.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.360
Can you give us any information on that?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.310
Sure there's

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.520
a bunch of new stuff obviously.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.470
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
is a full single player game and has full

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.819
Multiplayer component to it.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.539
So we wanted to add 
all that new stuff.

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.610
One of these things are the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.919
exotic gameplay elements so last time around
we had the flying machine,

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.919
this time around we have the cannon gameplay.
That's just an example of

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.250
the different machinery that you'll be able
to use. And there's a lot of environmental things

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.749
-	that we've added as well.
-	Tools like the lift.

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:59.509
Basically

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.190
to reach the roofs quicker because

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.880
the pace of the multiplayer was so intense

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.160
that we definitely needed something 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.999
to go quickly on the roofs and to go very fast,

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:10.889
to cope with the pace of the game.

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:11.659
And we wanted

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:14.530
just like Ezio to have like a sort of 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.240
personality for each character.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.669
So we've made hand-crafted weapons

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.229
specific to each multiplayer character.

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.749
And it's also good to hear that Leonardo is back.
I'm sure a lot of our fans are going to

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:30.189
-	be very excited! 
-	And it’s a really cool twist 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.540
what happens with Leo this time around so stay tuned
for more to come.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.050
Well great thank you very much for joining
me today gentlemen.
