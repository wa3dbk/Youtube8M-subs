00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.910
Alright, from Lenovo comes the G530. This is
part of their 3000 series,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.150
of laptops and this thing is absolutely great. 
And I'll tell you why. It brings a lot of value

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.980
to the table. Has a lot of features, has a lot of
hardware on it, 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.490
but it's extremely extremely affordable. 
It's not for everybody.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.560
It's not for people that want to be playing
games, or editing videos.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.060
It's for people who want to get on the web, they
want to do their Word documents 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.930
and their Excel spreadsheets, and their 
 PowerPoint presentations.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.170
Do your basic computing needs, and get it all
done at a great value,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.300
still have enough money leftover to buy a laptop
bag, and maybe some other peripherals you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.320
might want to get. It's got just about everything 
you need. Still got a Dual Core Processor,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.310
still runs in the latest operating system, has
plenty of memory, plenty of hard drive space,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.060
it's got all that good stuff, but it's in a brand 
new laptop, it's clean,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.560
it's from Lenovo. It's a reliable brand, it's
got a great warranty, you're not buying a refurb, 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.860
or a crappy old computer with a single core, this
stuff is ready to go. 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.200
Alright now, as you can see this thing is running
Vista Home Premium,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.440
so that's a nice plus. It's better than Basic, you
 get to have Arrow and all the cool stuff...

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.400
What's the point in having Vista, if you're
not going to get the cool features like Arrow.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.940
So, you do have Vista on here, you do have 3
gigabytes of memory, 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.010
you got that Dual Core processor, that is
 a Pentium Dual Core,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.690
you have a very good sized 160 gigabyte 
hard drive. A pretty sweet package I might add.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.160
It's very simple very 'minimalistic'. Doesn't have
a lot of extras, any gizmos or gadgets. 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.630
It does have multimedia keys, up here at the top.
It's got your regular full size keyboard

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.660
a nice track pad with scrolling features, 
left and right click.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.170
Over here you have activity light for your
hard drive, your power and your battery. 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.570
And your power button, and of course Lenovo
always has their one key restore,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.310
so if you ever need to restore, it's one button,
very simply. That's great for grandmothers 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.310
and non-geeks, anybody who doesn't know what
they're doing and their computer breaks,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.220
well you push that button and you're right back
to scratch. 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.090
You got a DVD burner. The actual display is
actually extremely sharp and quite bright as well.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.000
It's a 1280 by 800, 15.4 inch display, and that's
pretty much all the hardware.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.360
I'll give you a tour of the laptop, let's take
a look at what we got,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.640
when you're looking around. Starting off
over here, you have a Kensington Lock.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.640
Moving over this... It's just going to be,
pretty much a heat outlet.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.180
It's actually called a fan louvre. This is your
10100 Ethernet,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.410
a VGA output so you could hook it up to a 
bigger monitor if you so desire, 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.120
you have your Ethernet card... I'm sorry, your
ExpressCard. 54 millimeter, so if you want to add 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.090
a TV tuner, or FireWire, or more USBs, whatever
it's all up to you. 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.130
You can throw anything in there, and then 
you have these two USB 2.0s. 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.830
Now, there's 4 in total on this, and I'm going
to show you the other 2, 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.260
are actually right over here, right next to that
nifty little 56k modem, 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.840
in case you're still in the Dark Ages,
you never know.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.380
Here's your super DVD multi-drive, does everything
RAMs, ROMs, RWs, Dual Layers, DVDs, CDs, 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.380
you name it, it will burn a copy of it.
And then finally your power is right over here.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.590
Now, another thing worth of mentioning on 
this laptop, is it does have a 6 cell battery.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.530
So you will get approximately 3 to 3 and a half
hours of usage on this laptop, if you're

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.190
 pretty much cranking away at it, using the 
processor, using the memory, using the video,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.430
and that's actually really good. That's not
something you usually find in a laptop 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.410
that's priced this affordably. You usually see 
a 3 cell and you're going to run out of battery

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.880
really quickly. Now, taking a look at the top here
you're going to notice you a 1.3 megapixel webcam,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.150
with a built in microphone, so if you want to
do your Skype or your Instant Messengers, 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.510
you want to teleconference with people, it's
great for business,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.290
it's great for students who are away from their
home, at college.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.550
It's great for anybody, just for keeping in touch
with people. It's absolutely fantastic, 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.130
and it gives you an amazing, amazing image.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.070
You can see it's pretty plain, Lenovo. Looks 
great, very sharp, 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.010
very, very, large amount of value in this laptop
if you're going to college, 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.540
if you're setting up businesses, if you need
to give a laptop to a large amount of people,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.520
going from a 1000$ laptop, to something that's
 half as much, can save you thousands of dollars.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.250
Overall, this thing is very affordable, it's great
it's the G530 from Lenovo.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.860
