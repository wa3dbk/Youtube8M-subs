Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.010
Today we are going to show you how to change
the left hand slide assembly on your refrigerator

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.230
it’s a really easy job.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.969
All we are going to need is a Philip’s screw
driver.

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.130
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:22.300
Now to replace this part it’s probably easier
for you remove both crispers, give us a little

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:37.550
more room 
and we’ll remove the lower crisper glass,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:55.730
that slide is held in place with two Philip’s
screws we are going to remove those.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:06.260
Now we want to examine the existing rear what
was on your refrigerator with the replacement

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.140
one and yours may or may not have provision
for these two little extra glides.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.630
If they do not have them they are simple to
remove off of the new part, simply lift up

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:29.470
on the tab at the front and pull them out
through the back.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:41.310
That’s easiest if we insert the screw through
the hole in the rear of the slide first, just

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:52.820
hold it in place and line that up through
the hole in the liner.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:09.060
Don’t over tighten them replace the crisper
glass 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:27.680
and reinstall both crisper doors, check for
proper operation 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.950
and our repair is complete that’s just how
easy it is to change the slide on your refrigerator

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.480
thanks for watching.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.590
Good luck with you repairs.
