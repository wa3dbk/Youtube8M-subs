00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.020
Ivan Malakhov
champion of Russia in freeride skiing, 3d place in freeride world qualifier rating

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.840
During the last three years I took part in about 30 freeride competitions.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.200
In half of them I was declared as one of the winners.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.580
I guess…14 podiums.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.840
I was born in Smolensk, where there is no mountains at all.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.520
All my life I was skiing down the 200 meters long hills.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.100
It’s hard to believe how could a skier gain such level at such hills.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:57.040
When Adrenaline Rush asked what kind of dream stunt I want to perform an idea of jumping down the helicopter came to me immediately.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.480
I've never heard of anyone in Russia jumping so high...

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.820
North Osetia, Tsey spine

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.740
Helicopter made an emergency landing in mountains because of hurricane wind

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.480
Andrey Pirumov, action director

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.180
We are really fortunate… Thank God we are alive.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.900
The wind in the mountains blows with such force…

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.080
It will be very difficult to make your stunt. Really.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.700
Do you understand that everything is real but we need ideal weather!

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.540
Ideal sunny weather!

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.680
Such wind… How?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.700
Imagine how it would shake you on that thing. I am honest with you...

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.420
Moving everything to Kamchatka? I’am ready.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.420
Tomorrow. Yes, please!

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.640
After that emergency landing at Caucasus our project was under the threat of closing…

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.000
2 weeks later at Kamchatka
