00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:08.670
My first experience of anxiety, I remember
very well. I actually probably had one a little

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.790
bit earlier, but the one I really remember
was where I'd gone to a friend's place after

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.790
rehearsals. We've just signed up for a year's
contract doing a play every month, so it was

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.350
a great contract. And I'd been rehearsing
and gone off to a friend's place and I rolled

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.960
a joint with hashish, which I, you know, used
to smoke a bit of marijuana, but I didn't

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.960
smoke hashish much and I had this joint and
didn't know what had hit me. Just was so frightened

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:47.499
and absolutely terrified. So, I attempted
to drive home and then I got into bed. I felt

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.679
so shocking. So I didn't touch marijuana or
anything like that again for a long time,

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.019
for 20 years. And around 20 years later I
thought, "Oh, it can't hurt. I'll have one

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.350
puff", and I had immediately another huge
anxiety attack. But I'd had anxiety... From

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.350
once that started then I started having anxiety
attacks. You get this incredible feeling in

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.409
your stomach and you become quite frightened,
and you can't put two words together 'cause

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.460
your ability to be articulate just goes. And
it's just horrifying. It's an awful feeling,

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.850
absolutely awful. But there are other... People
have other sort of symptoms, too. People have

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.280
heart palpitations, but it's extremely...
It's like your life is in danger, like your

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.280
life is threatened. That's an anxiety attack,
a panic attack. But leading up to that, you'll

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.920
have anxiety. You'll just have... And it's
recognising those early symptoms that stop

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.920
you going into the panic attack. I didn't
get depressed 'til about 20-something years

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.960
into having anxiety disorder, which I didn't
really know I had. But that, for me, I tipped

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.980
over into major depression. Everything went
wrong with the TV show I was doing. Everything

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.659
was going wrong, just disaster after disaster.
I went out with the channel executive and

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:34.659
the executive producer and got blind drunk,
which didn't help. That does not help. I obviously

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.220
was diagnosed as having major depression,
and they said, with phobic anxiety, they said.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.489
That didn't mean anything to me. So, the depression
was dealt with. I was put on antidepressants

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.420
and things like that and of course the anxiety
came straight back. I still didn't realise

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.819
I had this thing called an anxiety disorder,
and I really didn't realise it until Brownwyn

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.659
Fox sent me a copy of her then book about
anxiety and asked me to be a patron of the

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.120
Anxiety Disorders Foundation, South Australia.
And that was a real revelation. When I read

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.620
the book, I realised what was wrong with me.
So, that was the start of the sort of healing

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.620
process. I went and had Cognitive Behavioural
Therapy and that was a real revelation. Cognitive

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.680
Behavioral Therapy is a very practical therapy.
It's not... There's a little bit of talking,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.280
not much. There's a little bit of talking
just so they can find out what you tell yourself,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.000
why you're having anxiety, why you're having
panic attacks. And then once they're on to

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.760
that, then they just give you exercises. And
the part of it that I really held on to, it

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.239
was the challenging your thinking. Making
sure you label the thought that... When you

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.609
start to feel a bit uncomfortable, what are
you telling yourself? Don't run away from

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.579
it. What am I saying to myself here? What
am I telling myself? I'm saying, "I am going

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.170
to make a fool of myself. I am going to put
my foot in it here. Everyone's looking at

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.400
me". And then when you get the thought, just
write, and you'll know, 'cause you get the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.410
feeling as soon as you get... Once you label
it correctly and you write it down, 'cause

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.880
this really concentrates you. Don't try to
do it in your head. But if you really, you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.950
write it down really, and then you look at
it, and then you challenge the thought and

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.160
say, "Well, what's the proof of this? What's
the proof I'm gonna make a fool of myself?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.160
What's the proof that everyone's looking at
me?" or whatever, and you write down other

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.820
instances where you've done a show like this
or whatever, and you've been alright. And

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.390
then your stress reduces, your anxiety comes
down, and eventually, this becomes your new

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.900
way of thinking. You learn to not go to those
areas. And if you do go to those areas, you

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.900
learn to challenge it. And you've got to get
it early. When I talk to people about anxiety,

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.780
I say to them, "You will not believe how you
feel after you've done the CBT. You will not

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.110
believe it, that you've got your life back."
And it's like, "Oh my God, I forgot how good

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.170
it was". And it just requires a little bit
of effort at the beginning, and that's a bit

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:25.170
frightening, but as long as you realise it,
you're not gonna be devoured by a lion or

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.400
anything like that. You might feel really
uncomfortable, but it's just your way of thinking

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.400
that's wrong at this time. And once that sort
of veil has been lifted, you won't believe

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.380
it. It's phenomenal. So I meditate everyday.
I meditate twice a day. It's absolutely...

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.460
It's a wonderful experience, meditating. But
also, you can then check that everything's

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.330
okay. And if there is any... If you're holding
on to something, you can then deal with it,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.440
not try and push it away but deal with it.
I do that twice a day. That really keeps the

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.440
stress levels down and I also, not always,
but I walk, which is great for people with

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.710
depression. Get up in the morning, make yourself
get out of bed, put on some walkers and go

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.710
for a half hour brisk walk and that really
lifts your spirits quite quickly. If you think

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.620
you've got symptoms of anxiety, you should
go to a GP. And the GP will have a checklist,

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.640
and then the GP can send you to a psychologist.
When I was diagnosed with depression, it was

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.990
a relief. At least I knew what the hell it
was and then you could do something about

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:48.150
it. And it was the same with the anxiety.
I mean, I've had more problems accepting that

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.410
I'm hard of hearing, I have to wear hearing
devices, see I don't even call them hearing

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:58.670
aids. I find that harder to deal with. I'm
kind of a bit better about it now. I must

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.950
admit, I'm not embarrassed about saying it.
In the end, you realise that's not where your

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.060
manhood is, you know? You can sort of say
that you get anxious, you get a bit frightened,

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.850
if something goes a bit awry, and it's...
Some women find it very attractive. So there's

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.650
a little lesson there for you guys.
