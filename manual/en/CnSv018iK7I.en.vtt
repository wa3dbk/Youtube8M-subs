00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.090
On April 30th 2007, just a little over three
years ago, Israel Today ran this amazing headline

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.860
story:

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.870
“Rabbi Reveals the Name of the Messiah”

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.439
Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri was famously know for
his memorization of the Bible, the Talmud

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.130
and other Jewish writings.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.570
He was a teacher, and a revered master at
Nahalat Yitzhak Yeshiva seminary.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.029
He knew Jewish sages and celebrities of the
last century

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.320
And Rabbis who lived in the Holy Land, who
kept the faith alive before the state of Israel

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.039
was even born

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.960
Kaduri was not only highly esteemed because
of his age of 108.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.190
But he was charismatic and wise. Chief Rabbis
looked up to him as a righteous man.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.190
Thousands visited him to ask for counsel or
healing.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.860
His followers speak of many miracles and a
student say that he was a prophet of many

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.320
disasters

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.250
A few months before Kaduri died at the age
of 108, he surprised his followers when he

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.780
told them

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.350
that he had personally met the Messiah.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.360
The Messiah appeared to him, he wrote the
name of the Messiah in a note he said.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.900
His official website had mentioned the Messiah
note.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.770
David Kaduri, the Rabbi’s 80 year old son
confirms that in his last year, his father

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.110
had talked and dreamed almost exclusively
about the Messiah and his coming.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.030
“My father has met the Messiah in a vision,”
he said,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.110
“and he told us that He was coming very
soon.”

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.200
Kaduri gave a message in his synagogue on
Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, teaching

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.340
how to recognize the Messiah.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.799
He also mentioned that the Messiah would appear
to Israel, after Ariel Sharon passed.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.799
When Kaduri died, January 28th 2006. More
than 200,000 people joined the funeral procession

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.140
on the streets of Jerusalem, to pay their
respects.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.979
As he was taken to his final resting place

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.320
Shortly before he died, this teacher of Israel,
wrote the name of the Messiah on a small note

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.100
which he requested would remain sealed for
one year.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.100
One year later, the note was opened, in 2007.
When the note was opened, it read as follows:

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.750
Concerning the letter abbreviation of the
Messiah’s name. He will lift the people, and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.810
prove that his word and law are valid.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.810
The Hebrew sentence with the hidden name of
the Messiah reads like this.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.200
The acronym of that sentence, that is, the
letter abbreviation that Kaduri spoke of or

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.580
the first initials of each word spell the
Hebrew name of:

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.580
Jesus, or Yehoshua, or Yeshua, the Hebrew
root word of ‘Salvation’

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.200
When the name of Yehoshua appeared in Kaduri’s
message ultra Orthodox Jews from his seminary

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.340
in Jerusalem

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.010
argued that their master must not have left,
the exact solution for decoding the Messiah’s

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.190
name.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.060
The revelation received scant coverage in
the Israeli media, only the Hebrew websites,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.920
News First Class and kaduri.net mention the
Messiah note.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.709
Both of them insisting that it was authentic.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.910
Israel Today spoke to two of Kaduri’s followers
in Jerusalem who had admitted that the note

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.629
was authentic, but very confusing for his
followers as well.

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.810
“We have no idea how the rabbi got to this
name of the Messiah,” one of them said.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.810
I know this, the answer of the identity of
the Messiah as Jesus, given to Kaduri, supposedly,

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.450
is absolute truth.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.450
As such, I believe it had to have been revealed
from Jesus himself appearing to Kaduri.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.190
Much the same as Jesus appearing to Jewish
Pharisee, Paul on the road to Damascus two

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.010
thousand years ago.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.010
It is amazing that the leading Jewish teacher
of Israel until 2006, would on his death bed

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.090
proclaim in a message.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.239
That Jesus Christ is the Messiah and is soon
to return.

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.120
That is astounding and almost unthinkable.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.690
It is also amazing that he was specifically
told that Jesus would return shortly after

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.800
Ariel Sharon’s death

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.509
As of the making of this narration, Ariel
Sharon is still alive in a coma.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:36.509
Could it be that this modern day apostle Paul
received from the Lord Jesus that His return

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.800
is indeed very very soon?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.000
Ariel Sharon 1928-2014

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
End
