00:00:04.657 --> 00:00:13.543
The user interface of ARCHICAD 19 offers the same, enhanced user experience on both Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows platforms.

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:20.584
The unified-window interface has now been implemented in the Mac version of ARCHICAD.

00:00:20.584 --> 00:00:27.470
This means that the user interface of ARCHICAD 19 acts as a single, resizable window.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.245
There's no need to manually move and adjust the position of various windows and palettes because the whole interface moves together;

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:38.217
every visible element adjusts its position accordingly.

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:48.719
The unified-window mode eliminates situations like overlapping windows and palettes, or accidentally clicking on applications in the background.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.276
Displaying the file-path of the document is now supported.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.359
Simply click on theTitle-bar while pressing and holding the command key on the keyboard.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:06.709
A drop-down menu will appear showing the full path to your document.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:15.038
If you want to open the folder where your document resides, just pull the cursor downwards and click again with the left mouse button,

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:21.947
and the folder will be opened in Finder.

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:28.517
ARCHICAD 19 now takes full advantage of the Full Screen mode offered by the operating system.

00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:35.928
In this mode the Menu bar and the Title bar are hidden and can be reached by moving the mouse towards the top of the screen.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:40.064
The menu bar becomes available in just a split second.

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:46.396
This way you get some extra space which better utilizes your monitor.

00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:52.377
Almost every Toolbar and Palette can be docked and undocked from now on.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.005
The exact on-screen position of the docked palettes can be easily adjusted by moving them with the help of the mouse.

00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:17.408
The graphical feedback will help the position process.

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:26.028
The grey overlay shows the future location of the element, depending where and how it can be placed based on the position of your mouse.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.347
Each visible toolbox, toolbar and palette has a grip

00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:51.737
you can drag it out or drag it in, in order to undock or dock it.

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:59.049
In Addition, you can double click on the grip to undock it.

00:03:01.788 --> 00:03:07.310
Double clicking again will dock the palette back to its previous position.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.373
By right clicking the grip, an option will be displayed to close that element.

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:22.648
For example, when a Toolbox is undocked, its size and position on the screen is remembered and stored.

00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:31.042
After docking and undocking it's positioned back to its previous location and size.

00:03:45.427 --> 00:03:52.632
As mentioned, when moving a user interface element, feedback is displayed in grey, signaling the possible location.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:04:02.475
If you moved the element accidentally, but you release it while the grey feedback is still visible, it will jump back to its original location.

00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:11.141
If you moved it out of it previous location, but you  still keep your finger clicked on the mouse

00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:17.122
you can hit the Escape key on the keyboard to abort the operation- thus the element will jump back.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:27.912
