00:00:00.886 --> 00:00:04.670
Last time we explored the laws
of exponents and we figured out

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.738
how they worked as long as we were
talking about positive integer powers,

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:12.411
multiplying numbers by themselves
over and over again.

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:19.811
We saw that if 
(a^b)(a^c) was a^(b+c)

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.957
that (a^b)^c was a^bc

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:28.727
and that (a^b)/(a^c) was a^(b-c).

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:33.420
Those laws work wonderfully as long as
we were talking about integer powers.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.282
b and c had to be integers.

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:40.172
For that matter, b-c has to be
a positive integer.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.740
We wanted a to be a positive number that
you can multiply over and over again.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.460
This time, we're gonna start to talk about
what 0 and negative powers mean.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.773
We are gonna say what does 3^0 mean?

00:00:56.443 --> 00:00:59.187
What does 5^(-3) mean?

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:03.041
What about fractional powers?
Like if I gave you 5^(5/2) or

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:07.221
3^(5/2) or x^(5/2),
what does that mean?

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:13.930
Finally what does not a fractional
power but an irrational power,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.737
what does that mean?

00:01:15.737 --> 00:01:18.472
Let's take these one at a time.

00:01:18.472 --> 00:01:21.980
We start off with the 0th power.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.010
a^0 is a^(1-1) because 0 is 1-1.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.772
The law of exponents says that 
(a^1)/(a^1) is a^(1-1).

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:43.262
This is just a/a, and of course that's 1.

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:48.571
Unless a is 0.

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:56.441
So what we've got is the law that
a^0 is equal to 1, if a is not 0.

00:01:56.441 --> 00:02:00.431
0^0 is not defined.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:06.740
You can't take the 0th power of 0 
because that's just saying 0/0.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.398
That doesn't make sense.

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:14.617
Put a box around it, move on.

00:02:15.517 --> 00:02:17.792
Now let's talk about negative powers.

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:24.267
Suppose we want the negative nth power
of something like 5^(-3).

00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:34.957
This is a^(0-n) and our law of exponents
said that had to be (a^0)/(a^n).

00:02:35.895 --> 00:02:44.105
We just said that a^0 was 1,
so whenever you see a negative power,

00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:47.476
it's the same thing as dividing
by a positive power.

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:54.896
When I say 2^(-3), that's 1 / [(2)(2)(2)].

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:59.847
I will describe this as saying there 
are (-3) powers of 2 in here.

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:05.780
What it really means is that you have 
to divide by 2 three times instead of

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.114
multiplying by 2 three times.

00:03:08.114 --> 00:03:12.076
Negative exponents means 
divide that many times.

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:16.296
Positive exponents means
multiply that many times.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.657
Then we have fractional powers.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:24.051
To understand fractional powers,
we use another of our laws of exponents.

00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:30.521
If you wanna understand x^(5/2),
let's see what (x^5/2)^2 is.

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:37.889
This is x^( (5/2) * 2),
and that's x^5.

00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:47.844
You must have x^(5/2),
must be the square root of x^5.

00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:53.244
This only makes sense if x is at least 0.

00:03:53.244 --> 00:03:56.038
If x is negative, 
x^5 is negative,

00:03:56.038 --> 00:03:59.274
you can't take the square root
of a negative number.

00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:04.285
In general, when we do fractional powers,
we only do fractional powers of

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:05.336
positive numbers.

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:08.778
We don't do fractional powers 
of negative numbers.

00:04:10.468 --> 00:04:16.961
More generally, if I say a^(p/q),
if you take that to the q power,

00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:29.621
you gotta get a^p; so that means that
a^(p/q) must be the qth root of a^p.

00:04:30.877 --> 00:04:38.167
It's also the qth root of a, to the p.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.010
Because a^(1/q) is the qth root.

00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:48.286
If you take that to the pth power,
our law of exponents says

00:04:48.286 --> 00:04:58.106
(a^1/q)^p is a^( (1/q) * p),
which is a^p/q.

00:04:58.106 --> 00:05:00.534
There's two ways to think 
about fractional powers.

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:04.432
You can either think of it as
the qth root of a^p.

00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:07.822
Or as the pth power of the qth root of a.

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.291
That's fractional powers.

00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:18.201
The last thing is what if we take a power
that's not a fraction?

00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:22.381
What if we wanna understand x^π?

00:05:23.476 --> 00:05:27.313
We have to do this with approximations
and these kind of approximations are

00:05:27.313 --> 00:05:30.108
at the core of calculus.

00:05:30.108 --> 00:05:36.658
We know that π is close to 3 so you 
figure that x^π should be close to x^3.

00:05:36.658 --> 00:05:43.878
We know that π is even closer to 3.1
so x^3 should be closer to x^3.1.

00:05:43.878 --> 00:05:46.243
What does x^3.1 mean?

00:05:46.243 --> 00:05:52.653
Well 3.1 is 31 tenths, so that's 
the 10th root of x^31.

00:05:54.905 --> 00:06:00.095
x^3.14 is the 100th root of x^314.

00:06:01.863 --> 00:06:07.813
x^3.141 is the 1000th root of x^3131.

00:06:09.991 --> 00:06:13.197
If you wanna know what x^π is,
you come up with fractions that get

00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:17.967
closer and closer and closer to π,
and take x to those powers.

00:06:20.087 --> 00:06:23.483
To get the exact value, 
you have to use a limit.

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:27.133
The precise definition of a limit,
we're gonna get later.

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:29.493
That's one of the key ideas of calculus.

00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:32.275
It's the first of the six pillars
of calculus.

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:36.125
But for now, we're gonna
hand wave it.

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:43.455
We're just gonna say if you wanna 
understand the function a^x,

00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:52.514
then that makes sense when 
x is a rational number,

00:06:54.913 --> 00:07:02.613
and then fill in the holes 
when x is irrational.
