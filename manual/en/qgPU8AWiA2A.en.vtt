00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.710
How to Buy a Suit.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.019
Every girl’s crazy about a sharp-dressed
man, so learn how to find a suit that will

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.430
help you look your best.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:20.290
You will need Flexible tape measure Good-fitting
pants Shirt and tie and tailoring service

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.290
(optional).

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.290
Step 1.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.990
Measure your upper body with a tape measure.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.110
Your chest is measured around the fullest
part; your sleeve length is measured from

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.290
the back of your neck under the collar, over
your shoulder, down your arm, to one inch

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.680
below your wrist.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.250
Measure your neck loosely around the fullest
part and round up to the next one-half inch.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.380
Step 2.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.410
Measure your lower body with a tape measure.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.350
Your waist is measured at the spot between
your ribs and hips where your body naturally

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.370
bends.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.430
Find your inseam by measuring a good-fitting
pair of pants from the top of the inner pant

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.829
leg seam to the bottom of the pant leg.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.040
Although its length can vary according to
style, traditionally a suit trouser should

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.310
fall to the heel of the shoe and sit around
the third lace on the shoe’s upper.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.530
Keep this guideline in mind when measuring
inseam length.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.530
Step 3.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.101
Pick the suit cut that flatters your body
type: the wider American cut for larger builds;

00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:17.499
the longer and narrower British cut for average,
athletic, or tall builds; or the closely fit

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:19.560
European cut for slim builds.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.619
Avoid double-breasted jackets if you are heavy-set,
short, or need versatility.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.710
Step 4.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.290
Choose the fabric of your suit.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.780
Wool is the most common and versatile suit
fabric, but linen, twill, and cotton blends

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.869
might work better in hot climates.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.159
If your suit must serve many purposes, choose
darker colors and subtle patterns; otherwise

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.420
try colors and patterns that express your
personality.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.520
Step 5.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.609
Try on suits, starting with the size that
equals your chest measurement, or your waist

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.240
measurement plus six.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.859
The jacket collar should lay flat against
your neck, and the sleeves should start at

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.599
the shoulder and extend to your wrist; your
pants should sit snugly on your waist and

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.819
cover your socks when you stand.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.409
If your suit doesn’t fit off the rack, fit
your shoulders and torso first; and then have

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.990
a tailor alter the pieces to fit.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.250
Many men’s clothing stores offer free tailoring
with a suit purchase.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.470
Step 6.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.819
Choose accessories to complete your look,
including a dress shirt and tie in complementary

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.819
colors.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.560
Shirt sizes are indicated by your neck size
and, if long-sleeved, sleeve length; if you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.200
have a narrow waist, look for trim or tailored-fit
dress shirts.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.939
Step 7.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.260
Put all the pieces together: jacket, trousers,
shirt, and tie.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.629
Now you’re ready for a multitude of social
occasions, from a job interview to a wedding!

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.799
Did you know The formal men’s suit of jacket,
vest, and breeches dates back to the reign

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.029
of French King Louis XIV, during the late
1600s.
