This is Diana Sullivan in Austin, Texas,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.700
doing some basic beginner lessons on the flatbed knitting machine.  The next hem

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.080
I'm going to show is a short-cut picot hem that I like very well

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.039
because it's a little bit less bulky than the regular picot hem.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.699
I have started by knitting on every other needle with waste yarn for a few rows.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.500
So I have a needle in B, and then a needle in A, B, A, B, A ,B, A, . . .

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.540
all the way to the other edge, so it makes this spider webby waste yarn, which I'm going to throw away

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.099
so I really don't mind that it's spider webby.  I knit one row using ravel cord.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.180
That's my ravel cord row.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.749
I'm going to put a clothespin on it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.890
to make it hang down neatly.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.540
Then I get the garment yarn. I knit half the number of rows as the depth of the hem, normally.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.560
In this case, I'm going to try knitting

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.709
six rows for the inside of hem and nine rows for the outside.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.530
See how thin and spider webby that is, but I'm going to bring out

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.429
the in-between needles after that first six rows.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.020
I'm also going to loosen the tension on the carriage by one full number,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.169
which is three clicks on this machine, and then I'm going to knit nine rows.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.680
Then I'm going to pick up the hem.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.020
I've brought the knitting to the front, where I can see it and work with it.  I've removed the comb,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.860
and going to get everything back by the gate pegs where it will hold still and be easier to handle.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.530
And I'm using the transfer tool with one eye

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.950
I'm going to pick up the loops one at a time, and I'm going to place the loops

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.650
on the needle directly

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.639
above, but it's going to be every other needle, so this is going to go on second needle .. one, two.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.260
Next loop --

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.239
skip a needle.  It goes on the fourth needle.  Next one goes on the sixth needle.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.940
Working on across.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.369
This goes very fast obviously.  There aren't that many to pick up

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.579
compared to how many stitches there are.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.899
When I get over to this side, if I have trouble seeing the loop,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.140
I just give it a stretch so that it's stretched more into the shape and position it was in when I first

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.179
pulled it and I can see that last loop.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.810
The last loop is right here.  Pick that up, put it here, and that's the hem picked up.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.520
As I've been doing on these, bring the needles forward and hold the hem back

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.789
so that it knits off very easily.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.180
and knit a few rows.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.899
You have probably noticed that I don't knit

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.049
very, very fast.  I try to maintain

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.929
kind of a slow, even speed

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.220
because it seems to make the knitting come out more even.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.600
Now I'm going to remove

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.609
this ravel cord by pulling it.  Ravel cord's off.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.459
Discard the waste yarn. This is what the inside of this hem looks like.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.299
This is what the outside of this hem looks like.  It makes a wonderful

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.729
picot hem, and to contrast, let me get the other picot hem.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.380
The other picot hem that I just did is a little bulkier and it flares out more,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.160
so this one is thinner and it lies more flat.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.850
However, this one doesn't look so good on the other side.  On the other side it's more spider webby.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:01.550
So that is a little shortcut picot hem that I love to use.   I use it on a great many of my projects.
