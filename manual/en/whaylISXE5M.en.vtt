00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:06.850
Hi, I'm George from OpticsPlanet
we're going to talk today little bit

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.389
about the Gerber MP600 multi tool.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.369
This is an,

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.419
all American made product

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.460
from Gerber

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.900
finished in a black

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.910
stainless steel.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.859
Comes in this nylon sheath,

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.890
set that aside for a minute,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.849
Gerber's got this great retractable
design. You'll notice that when it's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.140
folded up the plier is locked closed

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.990
once you extend

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.430
the jaws out

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.430
you now have full range of the handle
operation. One of the things you'll notice

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.050
first is the blunt tip pliers,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.630
wire cutter with replaceable blades,
and if you notice the small little

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.050
notches

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.430
that'll be for hard wire applications.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.920
An addition

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.120
there's a crimper back in here behind the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.040
at the back end on the inside of the handle.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.239
In addition

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.299
we've got number of locking blades,

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.520
every blade locks out individually

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.190
got a file, three flat blade screwdrivers,
a straight knife blade as well, on the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.590
other side we've got a serrated blade, a
large screw driver blade, a can opener,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.820
a phillips, and a lanyard.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.970
On the outside there's an engraved ruler
that's a three-inch ruler on one side

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.420
and on the opposite side it's in centimeters.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.150
Again one of the nice features of
this is that it folds down compactly and

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.250
drops into the sheath.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.560
The sheath has a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.680
full-size

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.790
piece of velcro so you can
actually put the tool in there both

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.710
open or closed and it'll still,
it'll stay in there.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.170
It's got a very neat

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.550
system on the back so you can fit
it to any size belt with it that you

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.160
want up to about a two and a quarter
inch belt, locking tab

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.059
two positions here so depending on the
width of the belt you want to adjust it to

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:14.629
you can actually push it down to
a much smaller belt as well.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.150
There's also fully,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.599
full MOLLE feature on the back so
if you want to thread it, put it on

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.239
thread it onto a web belt or onto a vest or

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.930
pretty much anything you
want to, onto a harness

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.079
this will mount any number
of ways that you prefer.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.089
Once again this is the Gerber MP600
multi tool available here

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.979
at OpticsPlanet.
