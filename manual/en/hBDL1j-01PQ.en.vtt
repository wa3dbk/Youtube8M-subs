Hello everyone, this is Battle Worlds: Kronos

00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:07.247
A classic turn-based strategy game.

00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:16.440
We at KING Art Games played games like Battle Isle, Advance Wars, Panzer General and 
 other SSI classics for nights on ends and loved every minute of it.

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:22.285
These games involve clever tactics, long term planing, transparent rules and hard decisions,

00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:26.520
And that's how it should be, it's a truly unique gameplay experience.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:33.512
With Battle Worlds: Kronos, we want to help the genre flourish 
 again and introduce it to a new generation of gamers.

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:40.472
Several years ago, we developed a prototype. Testers and the turn-based community loved it,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.426
But at that time, it was impossible to get outside founding for a classic turn-based game, and as an indie developer we couldn't bear the full costs.

00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:50.643
We had to postpone our dream.

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:56.021
We moved on and developed a game for another supposedly unpopular genre:

00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:59.052
The Point and Click adventure "The Book of Unwritten Tales".

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.320
And it turned out, that just because somebody says there is no interest in 
 a certain type of game doesn't mean there actually is no interest.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.707
We believe that good games will always prevail, that gamers want to have variety and 
 that the time has come for a new great turn-based strategy game.

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:19.476
This is our plan :

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.386
We take everything great about the prototype and bring the game's 
 ideas up to speed with modern graphics and new technology.

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:35.431
Battle Worlds: Kronos will contain two single-player campaigns in which you control high tech armies 
 and low tech guerrilla troops in an epic battle for planet Kronos. 

00:01:35.432 --> 00:01:42.270
In these story driven campaigns, you'll compete against 
 sophisticated enemy AI in increasingly challenging missions.

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:44.480
The game also features: 

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:48.640
Single-player challenge maps that test your skills in different combat scenarios

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.400
A live multi-player mode via internet and hot-seat

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.800
And an asynchronous multi-player mode.

00:01:55.547 --> 00:02:03.630
This last mode enables you to complete your turns in your own time, the game is 
 then stored on our server, and your opponent handles their moves in the same way,

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.700
You can then continue the match at the time and location of 
 your choosing, on PC, Mac, Linux or even in your browser.

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:15.190
As a backer of this project you get all these versions for free.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.470
Backers also get instant access to our development forum,

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.510
An easy to use level editor,

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:30.480
And based on your pledge level, Alpha and Beta builds, as 
 well as the opportunity to participate in multi-player testing events.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.590
Already exited ? We certainly are ! 

00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:40.060
So if you feel like we do about turn based 
 strategy games, please participate in our Kickstarter campaign.

00:02:40.187 --> 00:02:44.440
Back the project, join the community and tell your friends about it.

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:47.560
Thank you !
