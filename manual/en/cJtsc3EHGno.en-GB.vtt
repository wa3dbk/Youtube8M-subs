00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.160
We're here at Silverstone with some of the
world's best 1000cc superbikes we've got the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:31.269
S1000RR, we've got the new 1299S Ducati, we've got the new Yamaha R1 and, as
a wildcard, we've got Kawasaki's supercharged H2.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.900

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.840
MARC&gt;&gt; So we had fun on these four bikes at Silverstone
yesterday, now we're at Bruntingthorpe. We've datalogged them. Bruce, back to Silverstone. What were your impressions.?

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.720
BRUCE&gt;&gt; We had a great day yesterday. Three
of these bikes are pure sports bikes and the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.940
other one sort of emerged as maybe not as
good in the sporty arena as the others but it was still fun.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.509
Managing all of the power that the H2
has got was an experience in its own right.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.470
The R1 sticks out in my mind as something that
is right at the cutting edge. It's got all

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.380
of the electronics that you can tailor to
suit your riding needs. The Beemer's good

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.310
but against the Yamaha it feels just a little
bit dated, just certain areas of it.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.840
MARC&gt;&gt; And the Ducati, what about that?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:28.860
BRUCE&gt;&gt; It performs so well. The characteristic
of the engine , it's what's needed for certain

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.700
areas of the track. But there you've got the demands needed to get the best out of that

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.080
it drains me, physically and mentally, but in an enjoyable way.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.590
MICHAEL&gt;&gt; On that Ducati, you can't help but smile and think 'ah, this is something else' just

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.490
with the sound of the thing as well. And the
Kawasaki... it's almost removed from that

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.700
category where the other three are. Incredible straight line speed. Incredible acceleration. Not so much around the corners for me.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.560
MARC&gt;&gt;I did the launch of the 1299
and I absolutely loved the thing. I can't

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.200
help looking at it and admiring it. For me,
its the one I want to take home because I

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.320
get such a kick out of riding it but actually
the Yamaha... Man, that's a bike! I just love

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.380
riding that thing. If I was going to put a
watch on me, I think I'd be fastest on the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.250
Yamaha for sure. You can take the mickey with
the electronics. The chassis is amazing. Little

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.580
bit soft for me, maybe, but the more I ride
it the more I love it. The BMW is great, but

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.319
its starting to feel a bit old fashioned to
me now. Still fantastic bike though. I mean,

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.350
look there's not much between any of these. And then the Kawasaki, that's just absolute madness.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.030
Everyone needs to ride one, I wouldn't
recommend you do it on a track but man, you've got to feel that horsepower!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.790
So Bruce, the Kawasaki kind of came into its own here at Bruntingthorpe?

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.950
BRUCE&gt;&gt; You know what? I've been performance testing bikes for the past 20 years and this is the

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.150
quickest street bike I have ever tested, its
getting

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.980
It takes you to 180 miles an hour in just
over 15 seconds from a standing start. It

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.780
will do a 9.9 standing quarter straight out
of the box.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.270
MARC&gt;&gt;That's like drag bike stuff from a few
years ago?

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.069
BRUCE&gt;&gt; It's incredble. It's phenomenal.

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.290
MICHAEL&gt;&gt; And it's stable at that kind of speed.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.590
BRUCE&gt;&gt; You know, there's a lot of power there,
over 200 horsepower, but none of that corrupts

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.080
its straightline stability and you feel in
control, so even somebody who wasn't that experienced

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.259
in launching and doing naught to max runs,
they could have a good go on it. I'm sure.

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.030
MARC&gt;&gt; So, ultimately, given the keys now
which one are you going to take home?

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.440
BRUCE&gt;&gt; Do you know what? In a dark corner of
my mind, there's the H2. It's mad. It sounds like

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.389
it's possessed.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.810
MARC&gt;&gt; It's ugly though! Isn't it?

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.900
BRUCE&gt;&gt; Yeah. I dunno if I could live with
that. I don't know.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.180
MICHAEL&gt;&gt;You know, if you turn up at any bike
meet with that Ninja, or with the Ducati for

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.400
that matter, you are going to have people
flocking around. I'm not so sure about the

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.450
R1 or the S1000. Because people have seen them. They
are not quite standoutish.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.159
MARC&gt;&gt;Again, the R1. I don't think it's a
pretty thing, but what a ride! And that noise

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:07.780
really is something special. But I can't help
thinking that Ducati is. That's your porn

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.440
star, you know. The one you really want to
ride! And look at.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:19.470
BRUCE&gt;&gt; I give up with you! I'll just take
the R1.Because that delivers what I need.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:27.660
MICHAEL&gt;&gt; The R1 is the complete package...

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.160
