00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:17.359
hello everybody, today we'll talk about a plant that has

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.349
a bad reputation, but which is very useful for your garden

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.179
I mean: the nettle

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.069
in fact exactly today we'll make a slurry of nettles

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:33.529
So to achieve this slurry of nettle you do not need a lot of equipment

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.820
you'll need a bucket

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.280
that can contain

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.940
the quantity of slurry you want to produce. Today it will be 10 liters

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.360
that's why this buckets has a capacity of 10 liters (obvious)

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.960
an important thing is that the bucket should not be metalic

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.870
prefere to use a plastic or wooden one

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.960
of course we also need...

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990
...nettles

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.680
for 10 liters of slurry you'll need exactly 1Kg of nettles

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.140
If you don't know what it look like, it's this!

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.110
last but not least, you need water

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.790
try to use rain water

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.450
because it does not contain chlorine unlike tap water

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.860
chlorine might destroy

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.840
the benefits of your manure. If you have a well

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.690
you can also use this water

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.160
First step is

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.450
to cut a bit

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.550
in order to keep only the leaves

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.520
if some stem remain, keep them, it does not matter

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.670
then put them in your bucket

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.150
it make a good volume

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.680
of leaves

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.830
we can then add water, everything will reduce and the leaves will disapear

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.510
The most of the work is nearly done at this stage

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.210
we only need to add our 10 liters of rain water

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.170
and to cover all the leaves

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.170
with the totality of the water

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.120
and try to put everything in the bucket (not like me)

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.299
voila, you're done, you can mix

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:16.940
a bit

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.960
to soak it all

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.090
the initial preparation is complete

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.219
you can no cover the bucket

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.569
put a plate on top of it

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.919
or whatever that can cover it

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.999
let stand, stirring it occasionally

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.179
as you can see it's really easy

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.579
you're now done with the preparation

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.199
just let stand

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.879
nearly 2 weeks

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.930
this is indicative, there are two weeks to a room temperature

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.019
at 20 degrees (Celcius)

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.809
the higher the temperature is

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.359
the faster the fermentation process will be

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.439
in any case, every 2 days you'll need to keep an eye on it

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.059
and mix it

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.639
for instance with a stick

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.829
if you can see bubles, it mean that the fermentation process is not

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.479
yet over, once bubbles are not visible any longer

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.599
your done.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.939
after the 2 weeks of fermentation

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.029
you'll a green liquid that is not

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:29.560
smelling realy good! (that's why it's called slurry)

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.270
you'll now need to filter it

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.489
start by removing the stalks and the remaining leaves

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.289
it should not remain so much as the fermentation will consume them

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.020
and you'll get a liquid

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:49.199
looking like this, I grant you not very appetizing

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.819
you can use it right now

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.659
but if you want to keep it longer, and store it

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.389
I recommand you to perform a finer filtration

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.089
in order to avoid

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:08.309
to have some piece of leaves inside your bottles

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:10.469
because in this case, the fermentation process

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.940
will continue for some days

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.609
decompose the leaves

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.889
and then it will really stink!

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.929
In order to start using your slurry

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.879
you'll have to dilute it. They are several usage

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.940
first one to water your plants

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.919
in order to bring a nitrogen fertilizer

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.469
to make plants grow faster with stronger roots

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.039
the dilution is 10%

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.210
it means 1 liter of slurry of 10 liters of water

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.370
for instance water your tomatos when you plant them

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.219
in order to make them stronger

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.800
the second usage is as insecticide

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.979
this time use it as a spray

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.460
the dilution will be smaller around 5%

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.200
means 0.5 liters of slurry of 10 liters of water

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.830
(yes this is correct)

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.089
for instance spray it on your roses in order to create

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:17.469
a barrier against aphids

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:20.219
really usefull in the garden

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:24.899
last usage, it has been prooven that slurry of nettles is

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:26.300
a good preventive treatment

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.719
 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.979
for all diseases based on mushrooms

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.099
like the famous tomato mildew

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.669
that occurs often when it's humid

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:44.749
watering your tomato with the slurry will help them to fight against the mildew

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.789
a last usage could also be as compost activator

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.800
and to enrich the compost also

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.009
simply add it to your compost heap

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.729
and even put the remaining leaves and stalk

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.539
it will have the same effect

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.879
 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.309
as you can see doing your own slurry of nettles is not a big deal

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:12.769
it cost nothing

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:16.919
because you can really find nettles everywhere in the nature

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.340
, it's really fast to make

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.059
and it has a lot of benefits for your garden

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:27.139
 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.010
goodbye and see you soon around my garden :)
