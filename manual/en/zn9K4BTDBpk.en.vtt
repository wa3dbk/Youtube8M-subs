Welcome to podiatry orlando dot com
. where certain indications exist

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.289
hyperbaric oxygen may be of great 
benefit. Hyperbaric oxygen involves

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:45.120
placing your entire body in a large tank
 with increased atmospheric pressure and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.210
increased oxygenation in theory
, increasing the atmospheric pressure

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.789
around your body and outside of your body 
with increased oxygen

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.439
concentration drives the oxygen into the blood increasing concentrations of

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:00.660
oxygen and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.420
hence potentially increasing oxygenation 
delivery to the tissue systems within

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.909
your body this may be beneficial in
cases of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.840
praful vascular disease or non healing
wounds in the realm of wound care which

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.390
we do a lot of patients may be faced
with the option of considering

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.450
hyperbaric oxygen patients who are 
claustrophobic

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.850
may have a problem with this. Patients
 who have ear problems may need

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.140
tubes placed in their ears.Patients with 
other medical problems may not be

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.210
candidates. However hyperbaric oxygen

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.210
is known to be a benefit to a certain 
percentage of the population. Patients

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.450
who are diabetics

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.840
who have chronic wounds or perhaps
 osteomyelitis who may not be surgical

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.200
candidates or who wish to avoid surgical 
resection of bone may wish to enhance

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.840
their treatment of bone infection
 and use hyperbaric oxygen as an adjunct

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.229
therapy diabetics with bone infection
 usually undergo a course of antibiotics

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.239
either intravenous or by therapy for
 a six to eight week period of time coupled

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.409
with hyperbaric oxygen and aggressive 
local wound care involving debridment

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.379
and specific dressing change options.
 This may enhance the potential for wound

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.310
healing. There are many parameters that 
need to be addressed in patients who

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.349
have problems with slowly healing
 or non-healing wounds arterial

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.440
circulation

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.120
needs to be addressed and enhanced if 
possible appropriate antibiotics may

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.200
need to be delivered to the wound area. 
Necrotic tissue may need to be debrided 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.560
form

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.060
moved from the wound area the patient's
 nutritional status may need to be

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.169
enhanced and certainly only one of the most
important things

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.579
is appropriate blood sugar management
diabetic patient who is elevated blood

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.689
sugar levels who has been maintain
elevated blood sugar levels reduces

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.799
their chances of healing the wounds or
healing them to completion hyperbaric

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.259
oxygen maybe an option and hyperbaric
tanks can be seen in multi chamber

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.889
facilities or perhaps a monochamber

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.529
in a monochamber, the patient will placed on a gurney and slid into a

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:15.859
chamber usually in cased in plexiglass. the 
patient may stay in the tank for as much

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.040
as ninety minutes with increased 
atmospheric pressure

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.530
and increased oxygen after the ninety 
minutes of therapy

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.930
patients is returned to atmospheric 
pressure and slowly removed from the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.020
tank. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be
 rendered daily for as much as twenty to

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.819
thirty dives
