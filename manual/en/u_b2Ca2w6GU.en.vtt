I'm Nancy Frensley. I'm the training manager
at the Berkeley East Bay Humane Society, in

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.150
Berkeley, California. Today, we're going to
talk a little bit about how to adopt a dog,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.969
and what it is you need to do. I mean first
of all, there are hundreds of thousands of

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:24.340
dogs in every community available for adoption
at humane societies and municipal shelters,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:33.019
so it's real important to look at your humane
society shelters to see what dogs are available

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:41.870
that are extra. There are some really great
dogs out there. When you adopt a dog different

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.930
organizations have different types of requirements,
so very often you'll be asked to fill out

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.139
a form. Sometimes, you'll have to go through
an interview. Some organizations do a check

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:02.799
of your home to make sure that you have adequate
facilities, fencing, etc. for a dog, and they

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.270
want to know a little bit about how you're
going to deal with a dog when, you know, when

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.119
it's in your home, because a dog is a lot
of work, especially at first. They're the

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.380
greatest companions on earth, but when you
adopt a dog and first take a dog into your

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.450
home, whether it's a puppy or an adult dog,
there is some work that you really need to

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.070
do to make that dog a success in your home.
So, first of all when you go to a shelter

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.469
to adopt a dog, or go to one of the many,
many rescues look for that dog that seems

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:47.159
to want to come up to you, and even to everybody
else. That's a friendly dog. A dog that is

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.140
giving you that oh, come over here, come pet
me, come look at me; those are dogs that really,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.689
really want you to love them, so those are
good to look for. Most of the dogs these days

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.960
that are in humane societies and shelters
have been temperament tested, so the shelters

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.680
and the rescues will have some sort of history
on how the dog behaves, and whether they might

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.650
do okay with cats, and and children, and fit
in with your lifestyle. Don't fall in love

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.510
with the first dog you see. Look at a lot
of them, and really make a decision about

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.930
what type of dog and what type of behavior
will fit with your lifestyle. If you're not

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.349
a jogger you don't want a dog that needs to
run all the time. If you're a couch potato

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.069
you might want a dog that's more inclined
to hang out with you in front of the TV, you

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.340
know. If you like to go for long walks in
the woods, there are places where there are

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.610
lots of dogs you want a dog that's dog friendly.
So, you've got to really think about your

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.560
lifestyle, and the types of behavior and the
the physical type of dog that will fit into

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.900
your lifestyle.
