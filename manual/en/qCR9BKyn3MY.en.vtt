00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
This show is a "Drive" exclusive
first ever look at

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.236
the world's greatest, most
unique, most ugly race cars on

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:04.106
the planet.

00:00:04.106 --> 00:00:06.376
Not really, but isn't that
how the internet works?

00:00:06.376 --> 00:00:09.126
Big over the top statements to
get your attention and views?

00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:11.146
Have you listened to some of the
presentations in some of

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:12.276
these videos?

00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:14.296
Not the "Drive" videos
of course.

00:00:14.296 --> 00:00:17.256
Then you take all these over the
top best-ever platitudes,

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:19.986
put all that in the title,
search tags, and description.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.756
Put an attention grabbing but
out of context picture on the

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.486
title page and there you
go, internet success.

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:28.266
Stupid me, I've been trying to
make this show work with news,

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.016
info, ideas and thinking.

00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:33.906
So today the ugliest race cars
on the planet, best ever.

00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:35.746
And I ask for your
nominations.

00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:39.146
To get you through this topic
we'll discuss Moto GP, you'll

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:42.426
hear why soon enough, the
Nurburgring 24, Indy,

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:43.386
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:45.246
and Pike's Peak.

00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:48.696
Ugly versus beauty in
racing defined in my

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:50.286
mind and your comments.

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:52.046
Really now that could
get ugly.

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:03.866
Today on Shakedown the topic
is what is becoming of

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:04.916
today's race cars.

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:05.616
Ugly?

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:06.446
Awesome?

00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:07.436
OK for you?

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:10.336
And to get to that discussion
and your opinions we'll trip

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:14.076
through the Nurburgring 24, the
Indy 500 pole qualifying,

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:14.986
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:16.886
and a Pike's Peak hill
climb preview.

00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:19.696
But let's get started with
an ugly baseline.

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:21.146
Ugly an opinion call.

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:23.766
An aesthetic judgment of taste
versus current thinking.

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.576
Real cars are designed
that way.

00:01:25.576 --> 00:01:29.076
Racing, and by extension
function, often influences

00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:30.046
race car design.

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.066
And we all understand
functionally ugly can equal

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.506
race car beautiful.

00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:35.446
Really, do wings really
look right on cars?

00:01:35.446 --> 00:01:36.526
But we like them.

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:39.626
But sometimes it's rules or
budgets versus function that

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:41.076
create the eye mess in racing.

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:44.076
And when there's more than one
design option, and ugly is

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:47.176
picked for rules or low cost,
which is bad judgment, does

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:49.956
everyone understand the impact
it has to the sport of racing,

00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:52.566
its perception, and
its popularity?

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.106
Today, we're picking on designs
that are different,

00:01:55.106 --> 00:01:58.321
judgment calls on execution,
ugly ones or not.

00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.406
This is all for you
to comment upon.

00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:02.256
Let's get started with
MotoGP, and you'll

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:03.656
understand why in a second.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.316
Casey Stoner and Valentino
Rossi, because this was a

00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:09.096
battle about two guys, and
they're making statements

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.636
about the essence of racing.

00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:12.106
Then they raced each other.

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:15.316
While not a design debate, it is
a what is racing all about

00:02:15.316 --> 00:02:18.646
debate, and we can tie that to
the cars and what race cars

00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:19.806
should represent.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.706
Stoner's belief is in the
purity of the sport.

00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:24.156
That's why he's retiring.

00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:26.226
He feels that's drifting.

00:02:26.226 --> 00:02:29.326
Not drifting the sport,
drifting from MotoGP.

00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:32.496
Rossi's opinion is kind
of a corporate replay.

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:35.606
He says whatever business
dictates, I'll ride it.

00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:38.446
And while this is not a beauty
discussion of MotoGP, it does

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:41.016
set the mind for why race cars
look the way they look.

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:43.871
Are they design driven, or is
it a business decision?

00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:47.086
Let's get to ugly because it
was ugly on so many levels.

00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:49.376
I'm going to spare you the
details of poll weekend, but

00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:52.806
there was enough to go around
to make it not feel pretty.

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:55.816
But the race cars are what
we're talking about.

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:56.666
Ugly?

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:58.506
Didn't have to be that way.

00:02:58.506 --> 00:03:00.186
Here's a 1970s McLaren.

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:02.486
Of course, age and time
didn't stop ugly.

00:03:02.486 --> 00:03:04.876
They found ways too back then.

00:03:04.876 --> 00:03:05.776
That's the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:08.096
from I think '74, '72.

00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:12.326
Point is, is all this good or
bad for for ugly race cars?

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:14.196
Or am I just being an
old guy, and I'm not

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:15.656
comfortable with it?

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:16.406
Let's go to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:16.406 --> 00:03:17.306
24.

00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:18.436
That one's not ugly.

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:20.216
The race ending was.

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:23.326
Audi won, but the Porsche,
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:23.326 --> 00:03:25.966
Porsche, was about to finish
third, was running low on

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:29.706
fuel, stopped trackside after
crossing the start-finish

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:32.776
line, and got hit from behind
and destroyed and kicked out

00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:35.086
of the race by a little
Renault Clio.

00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:37.526
But the cars are beautiful.

00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:41.796
The BMW, the Asten Martins,
all of them, even the LFA.

00:03:41.796 --> 00:03:44.056
While it's not one of my
favorites, it works is a race

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:46.296
car and flies beautifully.

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:48.546
Just like the old days
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:49.526
And the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:53.026
four and five, now a hybrid,
but obviously inspired by

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:54.876
older beauty.

00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:57.406
So one of the questions is, how
much of the popularity of

00:03:57.406 --> 00:04:00.216
sports car racing is because
the cars are attractive to

00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:01.736
more people?

00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:03.696
Mile Miglia ran this weekend.

00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:06.376
Are they beauties, or just
old ugly beasts?

00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:11.066
Alfa One, this 1933 Alfa
Romeo 6C 1500.

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:13.926
The Mile Miglia runs from
Brescia to Rome and back.

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:16.116
375 historic originals.

00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:17.906
No advertising on the cars.

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:18.966
All beautiful.

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:23.246
A 1939 BMW 328 Roadster
took second place.

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:26.636
Third went to this 1933
Aston Martin Le Mans.

00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:30.006
So are they all pretty to
you or something else?

00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:32.586
Let's talk Pike's Peak,
coming July 8.

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:33.886
Team APEV.

00:04:33.886 --> 00:04:36.536
This is the Japanese Association
for the Promotion

00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:39.416
of Electric Vehicles, and
they're all over Pike's Peak.

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:42.476
Monster Tajima is coming back to
repeat his under 10 minute

00:04:42.476 --> 00:04:44.976
record, but with a new car.

00:04:44.976 --> 00:04:46.936
This time, the reigning champion
for the past six

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:50.916
years will switch from gas power
to a new EV racecar.

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:52.056
Do we like it?

00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:56.016
Functionally beautiful, ugly,
and don't do any Batman jokes.

00:04:56.016 --> 00:04:59.316
But apparently, all pavement
at the 2012 Pike's is not

00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:01.716
going to be the only big
news at Pike's Peak.

00:05:01.716 --> 00:05:02.876
Electric will be.

00:05:02.876 --> 00:05:05.516
Mitsubishi is entering two
all-electric vehicles, a

00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:08.746
regular production i-MiEV, and
this specially prepared

00:05:08.746 --> 00:05:10.426
competition version.

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:12.880
Let me add right here, ugly
doesn't help racing, and it

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.166
ain't going to help electric
vehicles' acceptance either.

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:18.936
Weird and funky may be a Friday
night date choice, but

00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:20.976
it's not a car choice
or a life choice.

00:05:20.976 --> 00:05:23.716
Well, except for you two
guys over there.

00:05:23.716 --> 00:05:26.486
OK, and it's not that Pike's
Peak was all beauty until

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:27.796
Monster or Mitsu arrived.

00:05:27.796 --> 00:05:29.366
Sorry, Paul Dallenbach.

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:31.766
That's his 2011 car.

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:35.036
OK, the point of the show is to
discuss ugly race cars, the

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:37.446
world's ugliest, because we're
doing an internet thing.

00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:39.216
So now I need to know
what you are all

00:05:39.216 --> 00:05:40.386
thinking about all this.

00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:44.256
Are the new cars good for your
eye, good to your eye, or not?

00:05:44.256 --> 00:05:46.706
Here are the two WEC
Audis and Toyotas.

00:05:46.706 --> 00:05:48.656
Or is history better
aesthetically?

00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:50.286
We all know this car.

00:05:50.286 --> 00:05:52.626
Even the old stuff got weird.

00:05:52.626 --> 00:05:54.506
But it all kind of fit,
at least in my eye.

00:05:54.506 --> 00:05:57.736
That's a mid '90s Peugout
Evo Le Mans car.

00:05:57.736 --> 00:05:59.706
F1 is so ugly, they already
agreed to fix

00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:01.936
the rules for 2013.

00:06:01.936 --> 00:06:05.066
And Indy cars we've discussed,
and Monster's car.

00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:06.386
So what's your verdict?

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:08.146
Is ugly hurting today's
racing, like

00:06:08.146 --> 00:06:09.966
Indy and Pike's Peak?

00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:13.536
And give me your list of your
most ugly race cars from today

00:06:13.536 --> 00:06:14.646
or from history.

00:06:14.646 --> 00:06:16.886
Let's see if we can create a
list, and we can create the

00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:19.106
best ever internet ugly
racecar show on

00:06:19.106 --> 00:06:20.476
the planet and beyond.

00:06:20.476 --> 00:06:21.806
I mean, this is the internet.

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:23.536
We better use it properly.

00:06:23.536 --> 00:06:24.786
God.
