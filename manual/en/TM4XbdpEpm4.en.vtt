00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
We have to start to live a more sustainable life.

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:08.501
Fossil fuels are limited.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.220
All ingredients are already there:

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.500
knowledge, skills and there are enough possibilities

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.380
but we need people who will accelerate the process

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.520
We are Solar Team Eindhoven: a team of 22 students of the University of Technology

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.100
and we want to contribute to a more sustainable world.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.780
By developing a solar-powered family car

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.680
we want to show the possibilities of sustainable mobility.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.928
This is where it all takes place.

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:39.888
Together, we develop the car of tomorrow.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.040
We are represented in different disciplines:

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.760
electrical and mechanical engineering, computer science, industrial design and the organization.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.860
We pull out all the stops to ensure we can deliver a spectacular product.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.220
In 2013 we created Stella: world's first solar-powered family car.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.680
And with Stella, we competed in the World Solar Challenge in Australia.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.464
And we didn't just compete...

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.160
... we also won!

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.920
We are extremely proud of Stella.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.760
We believe she's the first step to the car of the future.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.780
A future where cars produce energy instead of consuming it.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.060
And with this team we are ready to make the next step to the car of the future.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
Eventually, this car should be on your driveway.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.740
We designed the car even more efficient, more lightweight and more comfortable.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.680
The car is so efficient that it even produces more energy than it consumes...

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.580
... even in Dutch weather conditions!

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.640
The car is intelligent, for example:

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.020
the car can give suggestions for the optimal route

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.640
by taking your calendar and the weather conditions into account.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.700
The design is ready and now we're working on the top of our game to produce the car.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.340
Let's build this car together and help us by investing in the future, in green energy.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.460
Help us to make our world a better place.
