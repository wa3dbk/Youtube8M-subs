00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:24.250
I 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.119
consider myself more of a lover than a fighter.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.800
So normally I try to avoid confrontation.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.539
I’m also not big into miniatures.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.429
Nothing against it, just never had the patience
to paint all those little figures, even though

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.210
most come prepainted now...

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.010
Anyway, here we have Confrontation the game
for PC based off of the miniatures tabletop

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:54.120
game by Rackham.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.960
Developed by Cyanide Studio and published
by Focus Home Interactive, Confrontation comes

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.999
to life, so to speak, on your PC.

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.449
We’ve seen this done before, to varying
degrees of success.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.760
Taking a tabletop game, Dungeons &amp; Dragons,
Magic: The Gathering, Warhammer 40K, and make

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.890
a video game adaptation that you can enjoy
at home by yourself usually with a campaign,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.030
or often times play online saving you the
hassle of storing hundreds of minis, books

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:34.740
and cards and dragging them to a friend’s
place or the gaming store or something.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.130
Confrontation on PC puts you in command of
small squads up to four in a tactical RPG

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.310
style.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.450
Each unit will have different abilities and
you can utilize a pause and plan play style

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.750
to try and get the best use out of each unit,
kind of like the Baldur’s Gate and Icewind

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:05.300
Dale D&amp;D games.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:15.959
Pathing problems with narrow corridors seems
to be a frequent problem but aside from that

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:25.420
once you get a good strategy or two you can
take out groups of creeps with relative ease.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:39.019
There is a lot going on as far as the story
and lore goes, but it will all be narrated

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.319
to you rather than it actually being played
out during gameplay for the most part.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.099
This will kind of interrupt the flow of the
game at times, but someone really interested

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:56.329
in the lore of Confrontation, will probably
enjoy this aspect.

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.500
So who’s this game for?

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.400
I’d say if you really enjoy Confrontation
and tactical RPG games and want to be able

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.150
to play it on your own time whenever you want,
this would be a good game for you.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.650
For me I think I’d rather play a game like
this with some friends using minis and books

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.040
and my imagination, but like I said it’s
nice to be able to play it whenever you want.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.139
However, it’s kind of ironic the definition
of Confrontation states: The act of confronting

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.099
or the state of being confronted, especially
a meeting face to face.
