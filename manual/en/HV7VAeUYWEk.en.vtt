00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:01.700
The President: I just got off

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.533
the phone with Vice Chairman of
the

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.400
Joint Chiefs of Staff
Sandy Winnefeld to get the

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.867
latest report on the
situation in Fort Hood.

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:12.734
Obviously we're
following it closely.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:17.266
The situation is
fluid right now.

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.400
But my national security
team is in close contact

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.600
with not just the Defense
Department but the FBI.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.400
They are working with
folks on the ground to

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.734
determine exactly what
happened to make sure that

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:33.433
everybody is secure.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.300
And I want to just assure
all of us that we're going

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.767
to get to the bottom of
exactly what happened.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.633
Any shooting is troubling.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:47.133
Obviously this reopens the
pain of what happened

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.500
at Fort Hood five years ago.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.667
We know these families.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:56.300
We know their incredible
service to our country

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.533
and the sacrifices
that they make.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.100
Obviously our thoughts and
prayers were --

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.800
are with the entire community.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.700
And we are going to do
everything we can

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.100
to make sure that the community
at Fort Hood has what

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.266
it needs to deal with the
current situation,

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:15.633
but also any potential
aftermath.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.667
We're heartbroken that
something like

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.767
this might have happened again.

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:26.100
And I don't want to
comment on the facts

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.233
until I know exactly what has
happened, but for now,

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:32.166
I would just hope that
everybody across

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.667
the country is keeping the
families

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:37.767
and the community at Fort Hood
in our thoughts

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:39.800
and in our prayers.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.500
The folks there have
sacrificed so much

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.500
on behalf of our freedom.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.100
Many of the people there
have been

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.633
on multiple tours in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:53.633
They serve with valor;

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:55.200
they serve with distinction.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.667
And when they're at their
home base they need

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:02.467
to feel safe.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.633
We don't yet know what
happened tonight,

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.734
but obviously that sense of
safety

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:11.166
has been broken once again.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:12.734
And we're going to have
to find

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:13.567
out exactly what happened.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.567
The Pentagon will
undoubtedly have further

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:21.000
briefings for you as we
get more details

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.533
about what happened.

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:23.467
Thanks, everybody.
