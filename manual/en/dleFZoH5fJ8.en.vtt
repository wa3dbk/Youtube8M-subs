How to Paint Fantasy Miniatures.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.200
Bring realism to your fantasy miniatures,
which will spring to life under your skillful

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200
hand.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.809
You will need Poster board Desk or workspace
Desk lamp Fantasy miniature Small vise Magnifying

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:28.559
glass or jeweler's loupe Craft knife Small

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:37.750
Small paintbrushes Spray sealant Lighted headband
magnifier (optional) Awl (optional) and tweezers

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.960
(optional).

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.960
Step 1.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.930
Place a piece of poster board on a desk or
workspace to catch spills.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.730
Use a desk lamp in addition to any overhead
lighting.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.230
A lighted headband magnifier is a helpful
tool if you plan on doing several miniatures.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.239
Step 2.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.960
Clamp your miniature in the small vise, and
examine it with a magnifying glass.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.250
Remove any imperfections with the craft knife
and a small file.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.680
Step 3.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.500
Cover the miniature with a thin layer of primer.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.680
Keep a light hand to avoid filling in finely
detailed areas.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.149
Use white primer on light-colored models,
and gray on darker ones.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.610
Step 4.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.479
Start painting the deepest, most recessed
sections first and work your way outward,

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:30.880
covering the highest, raised areas last.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.759
Use an awl or tweezers to move paint out of
unwanted crevices.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.499
Step 5.

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:41.899
Create depth and shade by going over some
areas with watered-down black paint on a dry

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:42.899
brush.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.859
It will catch in the recesses and bring out
details, like musculature, hair, and clothing

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.049
folds.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.399
Step 6.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.729
Add highlights by adding some white paint
to the color of the area.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.369
For example, if your miniature has a silver
helmet, add a bit of white paint to silver

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.670
paint and dab it on to create the illusion
of a metallic shine.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.950
Step 7.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.080
Spray the finished miniature with a matte
spray sealant in a well-ventilated area to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.920
keep it looking fresh for years to come.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920
