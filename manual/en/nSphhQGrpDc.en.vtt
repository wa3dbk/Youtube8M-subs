00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:12.500
Hi everyone! This is Fading again. I wanted to do a little tutorial or showcase about how to load up lumber in Spintires.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.040
So first this is on hardcore mode in the Plains map.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.600
And I have two type C's here.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.880
The C-255 and the C-4320.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:47.720
Now the C-255 or the Ural has the rollcage protection and spare tyre and a long log trailer.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.840
Which is currently packed. And this is how it is supposed to look like when the long log trailer is packed.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.800
It is basically hoisted on the back of your truck.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.520
Now to extend it you first have to start your engine.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.520
And have your advanced mode enabled and as you can see the action "pack cart" is enabled.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.160
So to unpack it you just click it and hope it doesn't flip like that.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:37.200
And if you're on rough terrain you will have to drive forward a bit and then reverse to get it unpacked properly.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160
As you can see.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:08.600
When you unpack it it is trying to unpack itself but it only has such little pushing power that you have to drive forward a bit to help it to extend.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:26.360
And this other truck, this is the C-4320, I think in real life it's called the Kraz-something-or-the-other.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.520
Now lets switch to it.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:46.960
Now this has the log cart with the crane and the frontal support. It doesn't have the frontal exhaust.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.160
And in the current version of Spintires you really shouldn't use it.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:04.480
Because the frontal exhaust will only make you take extra damage on pretty much every little pump you hit.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.760
It also has the medium log trailer.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.480
Which you can see is quite a lot shorter than the long log trailer.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:28.960
Now to be able to load the logs into your trailer.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:40.360
I suppose a lot of you have tried this and always get the "position your trailer properly" notification in this window.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:57.680
If it's not positioned properly there will be a pop-up below the load up button that will tell you about it. Basically what it means.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:10.200
This. The trailer has to be straight behind the vehicle.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:28.960
It doesn't have to be completely flat or even. It just basically has to match the rear of your vehicle. To be you know straight like this.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.760
And the same goes for the long log trailer.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.280
As you can see there is no error window or anything.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:05:01.320
And from this angle I hope you can see that the trailer, it is not flat but it is straight compared to my truck.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.320
And after that you just click load up.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.560
Oh dear that's kinda heavy.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.280
So these are the long logs.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.320
Now lets load up the medium logs.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.320
Yeah it's gonna be kinda hard to move forward with these.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.120
And another point of confusion is the crane.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.720
When you start your engine you will get these different options like mechanism crane.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.680
This lets you move the crane with the driving buttons that would be..

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.240
WASD, Q, E, R and T.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.960
Now..

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:21.120
You can only use the crane to pick up logs that you have dropped.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:32.400
What are the logs that you have dropped? Well basically if you flip a trailer and your load is lost

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.320
Or you click this drop load.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.840
You can't use it to for example pick up

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.120
Those. Not possible. Those piles they're just basically static.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.840
And you can't even pick up those fallen trees over here.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.440
Not possible. Atleast in the current Spintires version. I mean I've tried and tried but it's not possible.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.520
So lets just pack this all up.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.560
Now I hope this cleared up somethings for you.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:44.720
And in my next video I'm going to try and convoy these two loads from this lumberyard to this objective.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:56.880
Again this is the Plains map on hardcore mode. I have done a little preplanning, I've sort of picked my route.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:06.440
And I have a refueling truck here which is the C-6522, this is the orange cute truck.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.200
And thanks for watching.
