most of them are already dead.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.460

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.860

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.800

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.820
*anoyed tone* give it a rest Delta

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.460
CT you have something that belongs to Project Freelancer, and you know how the Director hates to share.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.740
you two are fools.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.060
the Director is playing you, don't you see it?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.880
CT STOP IT!

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.140
we know you've been feeding Intel to the resistance for months.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.540
*Laughing* is that who he told you we are?

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.040
they aren't the enemy Carolina.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.200
we're the ones working outside the rules, not them.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.180
you don't know what the director has done, he has broken major laws.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.140
when this war ends we are all going to have to pay for his crimes.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.680
maybe some of us are already paying for them.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.000
you need to stop talking CT.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.860

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.280

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.820

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.640

Completing our objective.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.440
by killing a team mate?

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.660

we never did complete our objective.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.740
but why come out here?

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.940
