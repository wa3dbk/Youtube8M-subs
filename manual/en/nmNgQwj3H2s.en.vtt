00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.250
[Sebastian Thrun, Google VP and Fellow, Udacity
CEO] We live in an age where everything is

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.140
changing— [Singularity University] like
completely new things happening.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.610
And this is a period where the amount of change
is so immensely rapid, that things happen

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.639
today that you wouldn't imagine even 10 years
ago or 20 years ago.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:14.639
[Salim Ismail, Global Ambassador &amp; Founding
Executive Director] If you're running a big

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.910
company today, and you're not aware of what
technologies may come along and will finally

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.150
impact you, you're simply not doing your job.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.250
[Humanity has entered an era of rapidly accelerated
change] [Peter Diamandis, Co-founder &amp; Executive

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.430
Chairman] This last hundred years, the massive
improvements we've seen have been the influence

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.430
of technology.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.660
And let me tell you—it's not slowing down—
it's only accelerating.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.870
And what you can expect to see is literally
continued growth in health and wealth in every

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.640
human on this planet.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.162
[This pace of change promises to radically
transform our planet in the coming years.]

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:55.429
[Andrew Hessel, Autodesk Distinguished Researcher]
We now have the programming language of life

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.809
available with the push of a button.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.719
And I like to say, any of you can be a genetic
engineer, even if you've never done it before,

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:03.719
because all you need to do is type.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.400
[Brad Templeton, Networks and Computing Track
Chair] Self-driving cars are going to—or

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.100
as I call them, robocars— are going to be
one of the most dramatic changes that comes

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450
to the world in the next decade from computers
and exponential technology.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.860
In fact, in some ways, it's already happened.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.270
There are few projects that offer so much,
for so little.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.472
[Are you ready for the changes ahead?]

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:27.540
[Ray Kurzweil, Co-founder &amp; Chancellor] We
are now at the knee of the curve.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.400
But 10 years from now, 15 years from now,
it's going to be a very different era, and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.383
where we can really reprogram biology away
from disease and away from aging.

00:01:37.383 --> 00:01:39.960
[Avi Reichental, 3D Systems President &amp; CEO]
The really important thing is growing exponentially.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.650
Whether it's the automobile that you drive,
the gadgets that you collect and use.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.880
All of those have been designed using 3D differentials.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.960
You just don't know it yet.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.570
[Dr. Louise Leakey, National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence]
It's a very exciting time, and for you to

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.470
be here, really at the forefront, is a tremendous
thing to be a part of.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.380
[Beth Comstock, GE Chief Marketing Officer]
It takes a certain breed of courage to take

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.730
those intentions and turn it into reality.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.940
The value of an idea lies not just in the
idea, but in the doing it.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.640
[At Singularity University, we explore those
technology areas driving the accelerated pace

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.910
of change on our planet] It's an awesome event—not
only do I get to hang out with like-minded

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.550
people, but the sparks that fly and the convergence
of ideas, I think, bring about this whole

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.570
exponential experience to a whole new level.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.310
[Dean Kamen, Entrepreneur &amp; Inventor] Here,
you get the perfect plan—of the visionaries

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.660
with the big ideas, with the titans of industry
that can turn them into reality.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.620
[Craig Venter, Biologist &amp; Entrepreneur] People—they
check their egos at the door and have real

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.620
conversations.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.230
[Gavin Newsom, State of California Lt. Governor]
Singularity University is out to bring people

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.569
from every conceivable walk of life with people
that at the same time share a common aspiration

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.790
to make a difference in people's lives.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.810
[Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn Co-founder] Bringing
together people who understand the problem

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.800
and people who understand the possible solutions,
is perhaps the only way forward.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.880
[Naveen Jain, inome Founder and CEO] It doesn't
matter what industry you are in, the types

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.500
of things that are exponential technologies,
they're going to impact your business.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.220
The information is becoming available.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.400
And now, people are able to do things that
companies used to do.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.732
And companies are doing things that countries
used to do.

00:03:11.732 --> 00:03:12.732
