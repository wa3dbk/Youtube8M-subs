00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.470
My name is Melissa Wenzel and I am an inspector
with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.489
industrial stormwater program.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:24.519
As you know,

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.750
the industrial stormwater multi-sector general

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.889
permit requires all permittees to conduct benchmark monitoring.

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:33.820
Today, I will demonstrate how to collect
a stormwater sample using the

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.470
grab sample method.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.480
The process for collecting and submitting
sampling results can be broken down into

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.470
six-parts.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.020
Today, I will demonstrate part four: how to
collect a stormwater sample using the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.880
grab sample method.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.949
At the end of this video we'll provide links
for more information

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.949
on the other parts for stormwater
sampling.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.950
A grab sample is a single sample and is as
a simple placing a sampling bottle

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.670
in flowing stormwater.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.250
Today I will be collecting a stormwater
sample from a culvert.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.920
This technique will generally work for
the following locations that facilities

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.990
may be collecting for listed on the screen.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.210
If you are required to collect a
sheetflow sample, be sure to check out our

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.939
other video, how to collect a sheet flow
sample.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.149
Make sure that you choose a time and location
where stormwater is flowing. Collect the

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.960
sample within the first thirty minutes
of a measurable run-off event.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.650
Before you go outside

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.610
be sure to write the name of the
person collecting the sample and the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.300
date the sample was collected.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.020
While wearing gloves

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.380
remove the cap from a clean bottle.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.270
You do not want to contaminate the top
of the bottle.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.580
Also, do not place the lid on the ground
or in your pocket.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.930
Hold the bottle so the opening is facing upstream.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.549
Take care to not disturb the bottom of
the storm water flow or don't walk in

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.040
the discharge so that you won't
contaminate your sample.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.000
The collection of the sample should be as close
to the middle of the storm water flow as

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.050
possible to be representative of the
discharge.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.690
You'll notice that I'm not placing my fingers
or hands over the top or

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.279
inside the bottle when collecting the
sample.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.039
Otherwise I might contaminate the sample.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.739
Your lab should have instructed you

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.480
how full the bottle should be.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.969
Fill it to the level they instructed you to
fill it.

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.609
If the sample bottles came with preservatives,

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.169
add them now.

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.609
Be careful not to spill

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.829
as preservative are most often acids.

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.749
Cap the sample bottle.

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:37.919
Then, record the time the sample was collected.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.489
Place the samples inside a reseable
plastic bag

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.539
before placing the bottles into the
cooler.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.029
Place the bag into the cooler and prepare the
cooler according to lab instructions

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.149
for pickup or shipment to the lab.

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:56.759
Often, labs require that the samples be packed
in ice to help preserve the sample.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:01.259
After you've taken your sample, make sure
to take thorough notes on how the sampling event

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.269
went and facility conditions.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.249
You may want to consider taking a photo
sampling conditions after you take

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.589
your sample.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.589
This might help remind you of site conditions when
filling out the monitoring report.

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:18.589
That's it!

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.719
Today I collected a stormwater sample from a
culvert using the grab sample method.

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.650
For more information including the best
sampling methods for your facility

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.929
visit the program's website.

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.709
Go to the what's new section to find the
sampling manual.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.989
It is filled with more detailed
information about all six parts of the

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.329
stormwater collection process.
