Welcome to Expert Village; this is Kim Brown.
In this segment, we are going to show how

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.820
to set your hair for your wedding with hot
rollers and with curling iron. This will give

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.900
a really smooth look. At the moment, we have
natural curl, and we are going to set it with

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.949
setting spray and hot rollers or hot curling
iron, so that it gives you a nice smooth curl,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.910
a real workable curl, a little bit easier
to work with than natural curl as far as a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:38.000
few different styling ideas. We want to make
sure to get it combed through. The best way

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.680
to start to is with clean dry hair. When I
say clean, it could be cleaned from the night

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.090
before, or clean from that morning. Just don’t
want to start with freshly washed hair. You

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.940
want to make sure that if you are doing this
in the saloon, that the bridesmaids come in

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.570
with their hair already washed and have styling
product in it and dried. Taking your section’s

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.401
first setting is really important. You want
to have your hair really smooth, and you want

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:14.410
have plenty of working product on it. You
don’t want to your section too big, depending

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.900
on what size of curl you want, but usually
I try to stay with approximately the same

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:30.090
size and section as my curler. Then spray
your whole section front and back with your

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:46.020
setting spray. Comb it through, and you take
the roller. Usually take the end and just

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.780
warp it around. Sometimes you can use an end
paper if we need to, to get that end in there.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.890
The key is having it nice and smooth and having
the end in nice and smooth. Sometimes I mix

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.509
in doing with curling end and with rollers.
If you are going to be having the hair down

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.810
this gives a really natural look to the hair.
Then again, you just fill the hair until it

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:27.170
feels warm to touch.
Then you want to pin this in place. And almost

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.210
like your brick layering, your roller, and
then your curling iron, and they are just

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.239
a little off center, and then we will put
it on the roller underneath it .Now we have

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.069
a perfectly set bride, and she is all ready
to just cool, and then we will show you some

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.069
styles. For more information on the wedding
