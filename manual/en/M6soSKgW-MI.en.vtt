00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
(music playing)

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.867
David Karp: I had the
privilege of coming

00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:05.367
to the White House with a whole
host of folks from

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:07.767
the Tumblr community to ask
Barack Obama a bunch

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:10.066
of questions about education
and the executive order

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:10.867
that he just
signed this week.

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:14.166
The President has been
kind enough to give

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.867
us some time at his house

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:17.333
to answer some of those questions,

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:17.734
so --

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:18.333
(laughter)

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.033
The President: I just want to be clear:

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.567
my lease runs out in about two and a half years.

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:22.667
(laughter)

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:23.633
The President:
Yeah, we're constantly

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:27.500
looking for new ways to
reach audiences that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.433
are relevant to things
we're talking about.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:32.066
David Karp: This year, a
third of the Americans

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.266
that applied for a student
loan are actually Tumblr

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.233
users, so it was a pretty
natural spot

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:39.667
to open up a forum to pose those
questions

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:40.266
to the President.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.500
The President: You
wouldn't know

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.767
it looking at you, but you're
like Lebron or Durant.

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:46.467
(laughter)

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:47.133
I know you
guys don't

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:47.900
have the same physiques --

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.433
(laughter)

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:50.066
--
but they're only going

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.100
to be so many Zuckerbergs or,
you know, Gates

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.266
who are able to short-circuit
the traditional path.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.734
Even when I'm frustrated
with Congress

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:02.734
or I'm frustrated with the press
and how it's reporting

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:06.166
things, and Washington
generally, I also know

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.033
that there's something I
can do every single

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.700
day that's helping somebody.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.133
You know, we're making it
easier for a business

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.233
to get a loan, and we're
making it easier

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.333
for a young person to get an
education,

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:20.033
and we're making it easier for a
family to get healthcare,

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:24.700
and making sure that each
day I come away with

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.467
something that we've done
to make it a little

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:29.266
easier for folks to work their
way into the middle class,

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.533
to stay in the middle
class,

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.900
to save for retirement, to
finance

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.333
their kids' college educations,
that's a good day for me.

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.900
David Karp: These are real
answers that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.900
we got here today.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.734
That's a pretty remarkable
world that we live

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.900
in where those forums exist,
and where the President

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.200
is willing to field those
questions,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.700
and where that distribution can
go and hit not only

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.867
the people that asked those
questions,

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:51.834
but everybody else who was
sitting on those same questions,

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:53.266
or didn't even know they had
those questions yet,

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.600
but where that information's
really going

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.467
to be important to them.

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:56.900
Oh did you see the GIF?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.367
It went up?

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:58.400
First of all, there was an
executive order;

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.133
it's a GIF now.

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.367
So he made the decision,
just so you know.

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:03.767
The President: A GIF.

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:05.734
I'm all on top of it.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:06.333
David Karp: There is.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.000
So you've made
up your mind?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.500
It's GIF?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.467
The President: That is
my official position.

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.000
(laughter)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.633
David Karp:
All right, it's done.

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:12.233
We're going with it.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:15.100
The President: I mean, I
pondered it a long time.

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:20.033
I think that one's
going to work.

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:22.767
David Karp: Yes.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:23.734
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:24.567
The President: All right.
