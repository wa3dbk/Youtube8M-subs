[Intro music]

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.320
Hi and welcome once again to Titli's Busy
Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.570
My friend Vika from Kazakhstan suggested that
I should do something vegetarian this weekend.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.289
So I'm gonna cook a Vegetarian Chilli .. or
.. Chilli Sin Carne.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.400
I've got a lot of ingredients here but I'm
gonna make a lot of chillies and freeze what

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.080
we don't use.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.900
I've got 250 g of black beans.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.690
These came dried, I soaked them overnight
and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.070
boiled them for 30 minutes till they're cooked.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.219
250 g of white beans which came from a tin,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.829
250 g of red beans which were also tinned.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.160
150 g of green beans that I've topped, tailed
and cut in half.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.920
2 fennel bulbs.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.489
3 bell peppers - one of each colour.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.940
A dried red chilli.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.130
2 tablespoons of chilli powder.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.130
This is a medium-strength chilli powder.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.340
1 teaspoon of dried origano.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.980
1 tablespoon each of cumin seeds and coriander
seeds.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.300
3 tomatoes.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.830
I'm going to peel and chop these.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.460
If you're not sure how to peel a tomato, see
"Titli Tip #2".

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.890
I've also got a couple of optional ingredients.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.759
Depending on how hot you like your chilli,
you can add some chillies.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.680
I'm gonna add half a dozen green chillies
and I've got some chinese mushrooms.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.970
These give a real depth of flavour to any
vegetarian dish.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.409
They came dried, I've soaked them in boiling
water for 30 minutes

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.200
and I've kept the juice because I'm going
to add that into the chilli as well.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.190
First thing I have to do is prepare my fennel
and bell peppers.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.259
All my ingredients are ready.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.710
I've sliced the mushrooms, I've coarsely chopped
the peppers and the fennel.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.410
I've chopped my chillies and my tomatoes have
been peeled and chopped.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.599
In the pan, I've heated a tablespoon of olive
oil and I'm gonna begin by stir-frying the

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.720
seeds

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.710
and I'll just break up my red chilli into
little flakes.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.420
Stir this for just a couple of minutes.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.430
Stir this for just a couple of minutes.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.440
It's starting to go brown so I'll add in the
peppers and the fennel,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:44.989
It's starting to go brown so I'll add in the
peppers and the fennel,

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:45.989
the oregano,

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:46.989
the oregano,

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:47.989
the oregano,

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:48.989
and the chilli powder.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.100
and the chilli powder.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.020
I'll cook these for about 5 minutes until
the peppers start to go soft.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.489
These have been cooking for 5 minutes.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.880
So now I'm gonna add in the tomatoes,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:16.030
all the beans: the green beans, the black
beans,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:24.480
the red beans and the white beans

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.010
and also the mushrooms.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.989
Mix these around.

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.050
Turn off the heat.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.879
I'm gonna add in some of the liquid that the
mushrooms were soaking in.

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.260
If you didn't the shiitake or chinese mushrooms,
just use water or tomato juice.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.940
There's about a pint of liquid there.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.373
I'm gonna bring this to the boil and let it
simmer for about 15 minutes.

00:03:55.373 --> 00:03:56.373
This has been going on for 15 minutes.

00:03:56.373 --> 00:03:57.700
I'll add in the chillies.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.049
Stir it around.

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.400
Stir it around.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.239
Stir it around.

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:18.720
I'll cook it, covered, for another 15 minutes.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.030
Finally...

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.449
Just to thicken the sauce up a bit,

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:30.400
I've got 2 tablespoons of cornflour which
I've mixed into some water.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.780
Stir it around.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.139
Give that another 5 minutes and it will be
ready.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.080
I've served the Chilli Sin Carne with rice

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.390
but you could put it in a bowl and serve it
just as easily with bread.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.770
Enjoy!

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.160
Enjoy!

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160
Well there we are Vika.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160
Chilli Sin Carne.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.960
I hope you'll try the recipe yourself and
if you do,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.950
let me know what you think about it.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:05.040
Until next time in Titli's Busy Kitchen with
me Titli Nihaan.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.949
Khuda hafiz.
