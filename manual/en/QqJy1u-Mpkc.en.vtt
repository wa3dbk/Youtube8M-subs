Hey, my names Chelsea Bogazzi with suburbanheresy.com
and I'm here with my model Nicole and we're

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.240
doing some beauty and makeup tips. And right
now we're going to talk a little bit about

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.860
how to do a smoky eye. It's really easy to
transition a day time eye into an evening

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.640
eye by making it smoky. So I'm going to go
ahead and start out by using a paint. And

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.280
we're just going to apply this paint right
on type of her eyeshadow or you can just do

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.230
it you know, if you wanted to just do a smoky
eye you can do this on just your naked lid

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.370
without eyeshadow on top of it. But with Nicole
I'm just going to go ahead and put this right

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.230
on top of what she already has on. The secret
with the smoky eye is to make sure that it's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.190
really blended and also very clean because
there is a big difference between a smoky

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.739
and a black eye. And you don't want it to
look messy because then it won't look like

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.110
a smoky eye, it'll just dirty. It'll look
like you slept with your makeup on and didn't

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.399
wipe it off. So I'm going to start with a
dark purple. You can use any dark color. You

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.809
can use dark brown, you can use black, you
can use dark purple, you can use any color

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.710
that's dark for a smoky eye. And I'm going
to use a deep purple. And this is a cream

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.420
to powder eyeshadow. You can use a regular
eyeshadow or a cream to powder and I'm probably

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.380
going to use a little bit of both. So I'm
going to start with this with a firm brush

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:47.820
and I'm just going to apply this right here
to her lid. I have this right on her lid and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.020
then I'm going to go ahead and blend that
out, by using circular motions, because we

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:15.040
want to make sure it's really blended. We've
got that blended. And that's the top of the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.310
smoky eye. It's really simple. People think
it's really hard but it's simple. You just

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.480
put it on and it's really blended. And then
underneath, I'm going to use a flat liner

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.750
brush. I'm just going to use a little bit
more of this cream to powder. Look up for

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:44.730
me. I'm going to apply this right here on
her lash line.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.950
And then using a pencil brush I'm going to
smudge it in really good so that it's nice

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:59.440
and blended.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.660
And the last thing I'm going to do with the
smoky eye is I'm going to fill in the water

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.349
line with a black eyeliner. The water line
is the inner membrane on the eye and it tickles.

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.770
So be gentle when you're doing this because
it's a pretty sensitive area. It's pretty

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.210
normal for your eyes to water when you're
doing it. I'm going to go ahead and do that.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.709
Squeeze your eyes together. And when she squeezes
her eyes together that's going to put that

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:39.980
liner on the top lid of the eye as well. open,
look out to the side. Alright, there we go

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.030
and we've got a smoky eye. I'm going to go
ahead and do that same thing to the other

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.370
side.
