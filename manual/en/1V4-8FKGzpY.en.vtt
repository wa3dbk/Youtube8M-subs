00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:10.602
Two Generation A6 ago,  Audi launched the Allroad. I know it well. I had an intership at AutoWeek at 2004. So

00:00:10.602 --> 00:00:14.847
And I tagged along with a fotoshoot with this car with V8. Against a Cayenne S!

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:20.936
Quite a day for an intern...  I loved it. 

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:31.538
So now, two generations further, it is no longer called Audi Allroad, but Audi A6 Allroud. That is because the A4. 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.624
So the concept worked. What does it add? Quattro of course, but you can order that on the normal A6 Avant.

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:48.095
So it is higher, and you get those bodypart on the side. You notice them less on this black car, but here. 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.917
So, the practical use, that is what I am looking for. 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.909
So this is the 3.0 TDI with 204 pk, the slowest A6 Allroad you can get. You can only get it with V6. 
9
00:01:10,080 --&gt; 00:00:05,716
One petrol (the Aud S4 V6 with supercharger)  and 3 diesel engines, with 204 being the slowest. 

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:25.611
You can also get it with 245 and with one more turbo, over 300 PS: the new bi turbo diesel. 

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:35.276
But on the road, this 204 is more than enough. I only need more power above 170 km/h. Some days, I don't reach that...

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:45.005
You have so much torque, you can do what you want If you tow something. So just stick with the 204 PS and save money.

00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:56.537
With STronic gearbox off course, works great also at low speeds, always smooth departure. 

00:01:56.537 --> 00:02:07.775
So what is the use of this car? It drives basically the same as an A6 Avant. Of course with driveselect you can choose the drive mode. 

00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:14.053
This car adds air suspension, which increases the differences. And you can change the height aswell. 

00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:22.201
Low for high speed and higher for terrain. More space under the car. 

00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:43.617
So does a model like this add something? Or is it just for the looks. 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.923
So will you use this car one something that deserves the name Allroad. I can see some use. 

00:02:49.765 --> 00:03:01.608
And that is because this car makes more sence than most SUV's. You never need that in the Netherlands. 

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:07.971
For a little off road, this car is good enough and it drives better than an SUV. Like of you need to tow a horse trailer.

00:03:09.236 --> 00:03:16.033
Or for that last part during ski season with snowy road. A SUV is overkill, this makes sence. A little higher and quattro. 

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:28.321
it offers the same as an SUV than, but more stationwagen driving. the parts where you really need Range Rover off road.. when does that happen?

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:42.058
That makes this car the perfect wintersports model. Higher for roads with snow, quattro for traction...

00:03:42.058 --> 00:03:47.395
And very comfortabel driving over there with a lot of space. And the luxury is really nice. Ergonomics, finishing.. wow. 

00:03:51.218 --> 00:04:04.995
Seating is great, steering wheel rather small, which is okay. Steering is like most Audi's: could be better, but they are improving. 

00:04:11.256 --> 00:04:20.996
All those good thing, come with a price. And I mean that. Take a look... A general point about Audi's. 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:36.692
This car costs in the Netherlands: 72.000 euro. and with options..............................  

00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:49.301
in the end full option: 110.329 euro.... Well quite. for the slowest A6 Allroad out there. 

00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:59.648
that is a LOT of money. I will never be able to afford it. 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.150
the slowest car really is fast and good enough. But still only for those who do well. And have horse trailers. 

00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:14.095
+ Great traveling car. Very good drivetrain. - Full option really expensive. Value over A6 Avant with Quattro not that much. 

00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:05.716
