00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:07.796
I had a chance to come to
Southern California

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:10.236
so I brought the CTX to do some
beach detecting.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.956
I'm going to go out for about
30 minutes and see what I find.

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.556
Before I go out, I'm going to set
the machine up

00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:18.276
in the factory presets,
choose the Beach mode

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:20.916
and I'm going to make one small
change to the Beach mode.

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:24.156
I'm going to discriminate out
modern US clad pennies

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:26.196
because I really don't want
to find those.

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:28.516
I'll come back in about 30 minutes
and see how I've done.

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:33.396
I've chosen not to use the Seawater
setting in my beach program

00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:35.876
because I'm not going to be going
into the surf

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:39.276
where water and sand are washing
back and forth across the coil.

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:41.196
If I was going to be in the surf
detecting,

00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:44.156
I would turn the Seawater mode on
because that's what it's for.

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:46.596
The constantly changing conditions

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:50.716
with the saltwater and sand washing
over the coil back and forth

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:53.516
will make a lot of machines
unstable

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:56.236
but with the Seawater setting for
the CTX 3030

00:00:56.276 --> 00:00:59.956
it smoothes everything out and
makes it a very stable detector

00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:02.396
in the radically changing ground
conditions

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:03.916
that you can get in the surf.

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:36.996
OK, I went out for about half
an hour and detected

00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:40.636
and came up with a handful of clad
coins, no real surprise there,

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:45.516
except for one thing - I found
a 1971 Kennedy half dollar.

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:48.396
Nobody carries these any more so
I'm not sure how that got there.

00:01:48.436 --> 00:01:51.676
The CTX performed really well on
both dry and wet sand.

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:54.036
The stability of the machine means

00:01:54.076 --> 00:01:57.596
that you don't mask targets by
ground memorisation changes

00:01:57.636 --> 00:01:59.356
that you would with other machines.
