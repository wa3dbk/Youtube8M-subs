00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.880
Mike plans to build a porch
with the floor plan below.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.620
In order for the porch to be
up to city code, it cannot

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.670
have a perimeter that is
greater than 300 feet.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.510
Let me underline that.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.840
It cannot have a perimeter that
is greater than 300 feet.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.050
Or another way to think about
it, the perimeter has to be

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.290
300 feet or less.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.200
Find the perimeter of the porch
using the floor plan

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.160
below and determine whether or
not its perimeter meets the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.010
city's code requirements.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.665
All right, so we need to find
the perimeter of this porch,

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.260
and just as a reminder, the
perimeter is the distance

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.570
around the object.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.550
Or another way of thinking about
it, it's the sum of the

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.630
lengths of the sides
of the object.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.150
So to find the perimeter of this
porch, we just have to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.810
add up these lengths of
the different sides.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.700
So let's do that.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:54.960
So we're going to add up 40 plus
20 plus 55 plus 30 plus

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.950
95 plus 50, and we're adding,
just to make sure we know what

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.130
we're doing.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.040
We make sure we've aligned
them by place,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.890
which we've done here.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.370
The ones places are
all aligned.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.040
The tens places are
all aligned.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.820
So now let's start on
the ones place.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.830
What is 0 plus 0 plus 5
plus 0 plus 5 plus 0?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.600
Well, that's really just the
same thing as 5 plus 5, which

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.980
is 10, right?

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.960
The 0, carry the 1, or another
way of thinking about it,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.640
regroup the 1, which is
really a 10, right?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.390
It's 10.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.630
The 1 in the tens place
literally represents 10, so we

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.550
put it in the tens place,
and now we add up

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.270
all of the tens places.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.690
So we have 1 plus 4 is 5, plus
2 is 7, plus 5 is 12, plus 3

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.770
is 15, plus 9 is 24,
plus 5 is 29.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.280
So the total perimeter of Mike's
porch here is 290 feet,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.940
which is less than 300 feet,
so it meets the city code.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.840
It could have even been equal to
300 feet, so we could have

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.880
even said it just has to be
less than or equal to 300

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.280
feet, and we meet
our city code.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.419
So he can go ahead and
build this porch.
