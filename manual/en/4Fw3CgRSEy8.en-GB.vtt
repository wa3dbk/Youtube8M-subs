00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.780
Today I'm going to be attempting to do a dip
dye colourful ombre effect. Hopefully to get

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.171
something similar to this picture here which
I found on Pinterest and I really love. I

00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:24.900
love all the purples and the pinks and that
little bit of turquoise in there. I'm going

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.929
to be using Directions hair dye because I
did a lot of research into what semi permanent

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.739
colours are best and a lot of people had good
things to say about Directions. So I've got

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.440
them in cerise, flamingo pink, violet and
turquoise so that I can hopefully get a nice

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.540
range of colours. I've also got some little
pieces of tinfoil torn up and some gloves

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.570
because I don't want to get colourful hands.
And also some sectioning clips just because

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.760
they're gonna come in handy. I didn't want
to bleach my hair anymore than I already have

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.739
for doing this so I'm just going to see how
these colours turn out on my ombred hair as

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.380
it is bleached a little bit, maybe up to there-ish
already so we'll see how it goes.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.409
First you need to wash and dry your hair but
only use shampoo, skip the conditioner, and

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.360
skip any heat protectant when you’re drying
(i know that’s really bad) but you don’t

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.220
want any product on your hair so that the
dye can stick properly.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.810
Then section your hair, and there’s no avoiding
looking silly doing this. I took pieces about

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.409
as thick as I might take when I curl my hair
with the idea that I’m going to be alternating

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.670
between the four colours for each section
to get a multi coloured look.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.780
So I took a bit of tinfoil then painted on
the first colour of dye using a dye brush

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.640
from boots. aaand then I just decided to use
my fingers instead. I sort of smushed it around

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.579
a bit at the top of where I’d put the dye
so that I wouldn’t get a harsh line of colour

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.640
and it would have more of an ombre effect.
Then wrap up that strand up in tinfoil and

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.530
move on to the next one.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.539
The reason i decided not to use the brush
was because with four colours I was gonna

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.259
have to wash it every time and that was going
to take a long time and I was able to work

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.729
it into the strands just fine with my fingers.
What I did do was change gloves so I used

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.430
a different pair for the purple, the turquoise
and one for both pinks just so i didn;t mix

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.241
the colours together too much and get some
sort of weird mucky brown colour. And then

00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:05.610
I just repeated that process for all the rest
of my hair making sure I didn’t get two

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.979
colours too close together so that they were
all mixed up and getting that multi coloured

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.650
look. The good thing is you can kind of tell
what colour is like, beneath the strand you’re

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.650
dying cos the tinfoil has reside on it thanks
to my weird fingerpainting style of dyeing.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.849
All up I think the dyeing part took me around
an hour because I was doing such small strands.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.270
As you can see even though i used gloves i
still managed to get dye on my hands, but

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.270
it came off pretty easily.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.050
Next i took my hair dryer and blasted the
tinfoil for a bit because I’d read that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.671
heat really helps the dye develop, and that
it’s also good to let the dye dry on the

00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:39.030
hair as much as possible before you wash it
off.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.501
Then i hung around looking like an idiot for
about 2 and a half hours before taking the

00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:46.959
tinfoil off, blow drying the ends a bit more,
then washing out the dye and using a conditioner

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.360
on the ends to seal the colour.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.580
When the dye was washed out I styled my hair
the way i normally do which is actually just

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.680
copying the way my friend Tara from shop style
conquer does her hair. She made a video on

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.220
the routine so I’ll leave a link to that
down below if you're interested.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.439
And there’s the finished result! The camera
doesn’t quite show the colour properly so

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.349
head on over to my blog to see some pictures
with a more accurate colour.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.680
I'm really happy with how the colours turned
out it's pretty much exactly what I wanted

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.519
and I just feel like it's so fun and summery.
I hope you liked seeing the process. I wanted

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.379
to make this video because I couldn't find
one that was doing exactly what I wanted to

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.991
do so hopefully if you're after achieving
this look too then this video will help and

00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:28.120
if there's anything about the process that
I wasn't clear on or anything that i needed

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.710
to explain more then please feel free to leave
a comment down below and I will answer that

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.629
there. I'm also going to leave a link in the
description box to a blog post about the process

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.500
which will include some photos of how the
dye lasts across the weeks cos by the time

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.720
you see this video i will have had it dyed
for a few weeks so you'l be able to see how

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.310
it fades. Please make sure you give this video
a thumbs up if you liked it and let me know

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.239
what you think of this new look down below
in the comments, and I will see you next time.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:50.409
bye!
