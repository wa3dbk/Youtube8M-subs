00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.560
So why are we here again? I'm not
supposed to tell you. why? Oh come on I

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:21.740
mean now that's all intriguing Nicholas
you have to tell. Oh my god okay so I

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.310
wasn't supposed to tell you but Eve
Randall is making a surprise appearance

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.539
today. Hello Chiapet.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.710
We're ready miss Randall. Good. As you
probably noticed things have been less

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.680
than professional since Mr. Chiapetta
took over. What is this? Are you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.930
kidding me? No it's no joke. Alina I told
you that I trusted you and you've been

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.220
targeting me this entire time? Yeah me
and Eddie have been working together to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.150
prove you're incompetent. Which is
exactly why we're having this meeting. I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.740
really wish i could have been there in
person. Is he sweating Eddie? A little.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.920
Not more than usual though. How could
you betray me like this? You're my

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.619
brother. Stepbrother. What did I ever do
to you? There's a little thing called

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.340
sabotaging my lemonade stand. That ring a bell? Lemon Eddie was gonna be

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.259
huge. You ruined it because you were
jealous. What are you talking about? I was

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.119
inspired by that I started my own a pink
lemonade stand Lemon Nick. You told

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.649
everybody than my lemonade gave them cooties! That was not me that was Lisa

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:55.800
Miller. She was the worst. Those braids. You're telling me that the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.520
entire time I thought you were taking
something away from me you were looking

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.910
up to me? Yes I mean you were my hero. You're my older stepbrother.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.179
Brother.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.760
Miss Randall could we get back to firing
Nick please? Nobody's getting fired. It's

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.260
not your decision Eddie. You've been
abusing your power for far too long if

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.129
anybody should be fired here, it's you. Really. Don't bother coming back you're fired.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.269
You know what? I know about a dozen
employees who can attest to your verbal

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:43.150
abuse. Haha. Prove it. Well they said it
and I heard it. "Dress you up like a

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.310
street tart and bring you down to Chinatown and parade you around during Fleet Week.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.569
Well that is very specific and elaborate
and scary. You will be hearing from one

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:06.549
of my 17 lawyers. Dershowitz, baby. Wait
you're still gonna fire Nick? I get

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.200
my job back you know you can't have your
old job back. No.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.019
I quit. We do can open a
lemonade stand together together. Oh I

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.610
like that. You know we're gonna need some temps.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:34.840
Temp to perm. That's a
good exit. That's a

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.110
metaphor right? The lemonade stand?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:49.780
Of course that'd be stupid there's no money
in lemonade. Oh hey congratulations

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.800
on getting your job back.
