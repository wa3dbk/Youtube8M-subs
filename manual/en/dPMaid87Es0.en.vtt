00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.059
How to Make Sushi. You may think sushi is
just raw fish, but you’d only be half right.

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.780
It’s actually the combination of fish and
rice – and how it’s combined is an art

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:26.020
form in itself. You will need At least a quarter-pound
of trimmed, uncooked saltwater fish A sharp

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:42.170
knife A cutting board A dollop of prepared
wasabi A bowl of water 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:50.840
and some ice or a refrigerator (optional).
Step 1. With a very sharp knife, slice the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.930
trimmed fish slab into individual portions
so each piece is a rectangle approximately

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.850
2-inches long and ¼-inch thick. To make things
easier, cut all your fish at one time, but

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.329
keep the pieces cold until you use them —put
them on a plate and keep it in the refrigerator

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:12.520
or on top of some ice. Step 2. Moisten your
hands with water from your bowl, and scoop

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.729
an ounce of sushi rice—about the amount
that will fit into your palm—and roll it

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:24.380
into a ball. Step 3. Shape the rice ball into
an oblong by squeezing it with firm but gentle

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.330
pressure. Your rice should be about the same
size as your cut piece of fish. Step 4. Pick

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.369
up a piece of sliced fish. While palming the
shaped rice, scoop up a tiny amount of wasabi

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.329
with your index finger and gently dab it onto
the middle of the fish. Step 5. Press the

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.829
shaped rice against the fish and gently but
firmly cup the two together until they adhere.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.249
Step 6. Firmly squeeze the sushi together
until the fish and rice become one. Tap with

00:01:54.249 --> 00:02:01.590
your right index finger as you go to create
a uniform shape. Step 7. Place the finished

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.210
sushi on a serving plate or sushi board, and
continue making pieces until all the fish

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.640
is used. Step 8. Garnish the plate with a
mound of Japanese pickled ginger and a smaller

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.260
mound of wasabi. Pour some soy sauce into
a small dish and get ready to dunk. Did you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.860
know Real wasabi is notoriously expensive,
so most sushi restaurants just use a mixture

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.730
of horseradish, mustard powders, and food
coloring.
