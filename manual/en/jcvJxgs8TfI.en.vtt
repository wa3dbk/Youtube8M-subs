00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.640
title art education for the blind

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.030
An art therapist prepares materials for
an art workshop. When beginning an art 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.769
project with students

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.249
teachers are encouraged to offer of a
variety of materials

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.130
beads,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.210
feathers, wood, 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.019
old scarves, 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.359
even tape could make this creative
experience a fun one.  There's sound, 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.460
it's tactile and the color will
elicit allot of imagination so there's a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.600
lot of people with vision impairment do have color concepts even if they're completely blind.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.560
Students sit around a table working on
our projects.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.920
Then art therapist Jennifer Drower
speaks.  Many students choose the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.800
materials they want to use. It's an
important part of art making

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.400
especially for students who are blind or
have low vision.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.720
With these kids

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.300
so many decisions are made for them

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.940
it's so important for them to be able to choose 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.820
want they want to do,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.100
they're able to make choices

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.570
and authentic choices that will help them
to best express whatever it is that they want to express.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.740
It's important to have items in separate
containers

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.630
so they can then discern

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.460
what's what, it gives it a boundary.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.500
So they have a focus point for what
they want and they know where to go.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.349
Now a series of shots

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:26.399
a student manipulates clay, another
places colored shapes on a white sheet

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.189
of paper, another student in a wheelchair
applies paint with a brush to a canvas

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.750
on an easel.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.550
ms dreylinger students can choose to
make a heart that relates to their

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.040
museum experience

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.570
Then Ms. Drower. Students can choose to make art that relates to their museum experience, a life experience,or one that comes from their imaginations.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
Talking or writing about their artworks
is another way to spark creativity.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.030
Freedom of expression is the most
important element in this exercise and

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.590
one that helps foster self esteem
especially for those who have been blind

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.509
since birth. It is a vehicle in which one sees
oneself reflected back. 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.490
It builds a sense of self 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.309
that is evidence of who they are

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.279
and that is so important

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.719
in anybody's development

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.339
and often with

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:18.370
people with vision impairments

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.359
it's difficult to get that feedback.
Next, raised line drawing boards are

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.860
distributed to students seated around a
table.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.870
First the narrator speaks then museum
instructor Leah Fox.  Artmaking need

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.680
not be complicated.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.989
Raised line drawing boards are a good way
to begin.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.949
A raised line drawing board is constructed
of a clipboard with a rubber surface

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:42.829
covered by a plastic sheet.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.599
When writing on the plastic with a pen
the friction of the rubber against the

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.089
plastic creates a raised surface,

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:54.749
this way the artist can feel what they
have drawn. A boy holds up his drawing and beams.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.780
Then a raised line drawing of two pattern
dresses and a pair of high-heeled shoes.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.800
Next, Doctor John Kennedy of the
university of toronto speaks while

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.889
holding a drawing of a woman in a chair
her feet on a stepstool.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.750
Children who make art for the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.250
first-time often show a great interest
in this form of self-expression and if

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.279
encourage can learn to draw at a
very early age.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.439
This is a drawing by a blind girl

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.969
aged eight. 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.809
How come she draw so well?

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:30.529
Well from the age of two or three

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.319
she was encouraged to draw

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.529
by her mother.

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:39.510
Now a series of shots. A brown clay
sculpture of two figures embracing,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.659
a white clay dinosaur, a wall display of
line drawings in broad brush strokes,a

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.760
collage of red blue and purple strings
whirled on a bright pink background,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.289
a green reptilian monster bears it's
fangs while winking. 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:58.749
Then Ms. Drower speaks. Teachers are
encouraged to display the students' art

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:01.849
but it is important to first ask
permission.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.169
A lot of what comes out of here may be very personal

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.789
as it is with any artist.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.169
If i don't get

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.159
their permission

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.209
then i wouldn't be a respecting them as
people. The most important aspect of any

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.430
art making class

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.599
is very simple

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.460
anything goes. In our sessions where they
just focus on making art

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.069
it is all about them 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:25.270
and they can do

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.499
nothing wrong

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.589
and that's a therapeutic part.

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:33.830
There can't be rules in artmaking. It is
something that comes from the soul.
