Hi, my name is Lillian, I am with Salon of
Scottsdale in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.269
on behalf of ExpertVillage.com, I am here
to show you today Microdermabrasion tips,

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:22.170
filters and hepa filter. Just a little bit
more detailed information. For each treatment

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.570
we attach a clean sterilized diamond tone
tip, these tips come in fine, medium, coarse

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.489
and extra coarse depending on the type of
treatment that the patient is requiring at

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:46.370
the time. What you do is you put the tip,
attach the tip onto the filter and it is ready

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.809
to go. Before though you start the treatment,
there is a hepa filter located in the back

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:03.010
of the machine, the tube is on the other end
of the hepa filter and you remove the tip.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.940
You get a little disc, which is called a mini
filter, get it with tweezers and insert it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:20.150
into the filter. Then all that you do is pop
that back on, stick the filter back in the

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.070
back of the machine and you are ready to go.
At the end of the treatment whenever you turn

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.730
the machine off and you have completed the
treatment, you take the filter out, you stick

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.850
the tweezers back in and remove the filter
and you can actually see the dead skin that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.900
has come off during treatment. The old machines
use to have aluminum oxide crystals that would

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.920
shoot onto your face and a vacuum would suck
up the leftover crystals and the dead skin.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.140
They have kind of done away with that because
of the controversy of the aluminum and that

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.310
is why they have gone to the crystal free
treatment.
