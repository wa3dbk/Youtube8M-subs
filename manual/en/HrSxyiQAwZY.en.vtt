00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.410
It's morning at Cygnet Bay.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.960
Time for a bit of breakfast.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.960
One of the biggest things that I find about
being in the bush is you want to spend less

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.050
time cooking and more time out there enjoying
what you've come to see. So what I'm gonna

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.550
do is, I'm gonna cook up something quick
and simple. Now it's called coconut chocolate

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.440
pancakes, how's that sound? Coconut chocolate
pancakes. So first of all, you're gonna

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.000
need some self-rising flour. 2 eggs. Crack
'em in. Vanilla essence.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.590
Coconut. Don't forget the coconut. Sugar.
You can grab a bit of sugar, a bit of raw

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.590
sugar, that's all I use. So we mix that.
And then what we need is a bit of milk. You

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.960
want it runny. So I'll just show ya.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.290
That's the consistency that I'm lookin'
for. Now the trick to pancakes is turn on

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.960
the gas. Spray oil. Cooking spray. Like that.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.840
We're gonna make big pancakes. I don't
like making pikelets. Otherwise you're sittin'

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.090
here, you're sitting here all day making
these little suckers. I just make one big

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.000
sucker. Stack 'em up. Easy.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.520
Alright, now I suppose you're wonderin',
where's the chocolate come into it. Now

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.070
we get the choc melts and we drop 'em in.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.320
And like your mummy used to say, you gotta
wait for the bubbles to come up, then we flip

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.570
her over.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.440
Now I think we're very close. Let's have
a look. Oh yeah. It's probably, this is

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.930
the hard part. Ooo yeah. Oh, let's have
a quick look at our pancake. Oh, lookin'

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:29.379
good. Lookin' real good. We're ready to
go. Alright, here we go. It's the tricky

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.340
part. Look at that.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.950
Now that, it's a delicious meal. Now the
trick is, cook a few more, have a couple for

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.709
breakfast. Have a couple for breakfast and
then save a few, stick 'em in the fridge

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.340
and then have 'em for smoko. Now that is
a treat in the bush.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.139
We'll polish this off, and then head down
to the beach in the ATVs.
