00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.340
The other day I was riding the bus to my 4
p.m. class on North Campus, when I realized

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:17.720
I had made a grave mistake. I realized I was
on the freshman filled Bursley-Baits bus.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.920
Now, for those of you who have never had the
distinct pleasure of riding on the Bursley-Baits

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:35.799
bus let me tell you it is quite an experience.
Stepping on the bus as a senior is a bit like

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.880
taking a time machine back to your own freshman
year, where you must confront your former

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:50.160
bewildered self. There you can here students
list there current struggles. For example,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:00.920
"My English 125 paper has to be a whole six
pages" and "I'm from California I had no idea

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:09.490
it got this cold in Michigan." To my favorite, "how was I supposed to know I didn't need

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:22.060
to ask to go the bathroom?" On this bus, turn
time machine, I overheard two students griping

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.170
about how their professor was really pushing
them in one class. When we finally reached

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.500
Pierpont Commons, I pushed my way off the
bus. But what those two students were saying

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:46.910
really stuck with me. Michigan does push you.
Michigan pushes you farther than you ever

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:55.760
thought possible. It pushes you onto buses,
through classrooms and onto the field. It

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.200
pushes you to challenge your assumptions and
your insecurities. It pushes you to dream

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.200
bigger, think more critically, and connect
deeper with the world that surrounds you.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.640
Michigan pushes us to ask questions, to demand
not the easy answers but the more difficult

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.080
ones. Questions like: will there really be
a snow day tomorrow? 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:39.400
How much caffeine is too much caffeine? And do you think it's a bad idea to put my name down on so many 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.900
Festifall listservs, I mean how long could they possibly
email me?

00:02:48.320 --> 00:03:00.780
 And just as Michigan pushed us, we pushed back. We pushed back, we pushed back for a more inclusive 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.100
university, that will hopefully one day be an accurate representation of our ever changing diverse world.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.320
 We pushed back for a more responsive
university and we pushed back against the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:34.280
general admission seating policy at football
games. And now we are being pushed out the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:43.200
   door. Pushed out into a rapidly changing world,
but our world is no more uncertain, no more

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:54.749
daunting than it was for Wolverines who graduated
in 1864, 1944, or 1964. Yes, we are graduating

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.790
into a world with injustice, a world with
division. A world facing grave environmental

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:09.059
challenges and probably, most troubling, a
world that doesn't allow for midday naps.

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:19.809
But Michigan has pushed us to look past those
realities and to demand better answers. 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:29.479
While this need to push is embodied in each in every
Wolverine, it is perhaps best seen through one

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:39.159
Michigan graduate, Edward White. While the
world slept on June 3, 1965, White became

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:46.999
the first American to walk in space. After
spending a grand total of six minutes outside

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:56.259
the safety of a spacecraft, White concluded
his brief foray into space. His final words

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:08.380
as recorded by mission control were "I'm coming
back in and it's the saddest moment of my life."

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.820
 Leaving a place that has so inspired
you and changed how you view the world is

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:23.270
indeed a difficult task. And while I do not
seek to compare a walk in space with a walk

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:31.590
down State Street, I do sense some striking
similarities. Our time in Ann Arbor has hopefully

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.590
changed some of our perspectives and made
us realize our assumptions can be wrong and

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:47.859
that our realities can sometimes be painfully small.
But we have also learned that we are eminently

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.860
capable of individuals who are able to rise
to the occasion. 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:08.640
This university has simultaneously ennobled and humbled us, much the same as White's space walk did for him. 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:22.479
The memories we leave here, a sunny afternoon on the Diag, a jog through the Arb, a tense night of cramming,

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:29.479
those long conversations with our absolutely
amazing friends, are beautiful and unique

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:40.469
to us. However we leave here knowing there
is no singular Michigan experience, what

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:54.319
unifies us, as Wolverines is our need to push.
We leave knowing that it is always been and

00:06:54.469 --> 00:07:01.469
always will be great to be a Michigan Wolverine!
