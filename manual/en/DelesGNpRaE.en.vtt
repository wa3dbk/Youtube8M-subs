It is five days before the Passover.  Jesus and 
 His disciples make their way from Bethany to Jerusalem.

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:19.062
(Intro to Song)

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:28.579
Multitudes are gathered in the city now to see the entrance of the King.

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:36.722
Spreading garments in the way and waving palms, 
 they've lined the streets to honor bring.

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:42.266
King of Kings is He, the Son of God on high.

00:00:42.753 --> 00:00:46.088
Shouting out hosannas as He passes by,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.951
they lift it to the sky.

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:55.906

Hosanna to the King!

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:24.676
Oh how much excitement fills their hearts as now 
 they see Him from across the way.

00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:33.455
Riding on a colt, we see the Blessed Son 
 of God has come to us today.

00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:40.340
King of Kings is He, the Son of God on high.

00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:44.240
Shouting out hosannas as He passes by,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.870
we lift it to the sky.

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:53.900
