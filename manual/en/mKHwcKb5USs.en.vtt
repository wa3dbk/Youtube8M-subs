00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.900
We are at the Lol-Ha Snack Bar in Akumal, Mexico.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.000
And a very special lady named Margarita

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.000
Is going to show us how to make hand patted corn tortillas.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.750
I’m going to learn, we are going to have some fun.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.900
So come on! Let’s go find out what it’s about.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.900
First, we are going to go into the kitchen.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Hola.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.000
Hola.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.500
She is cooking the tortillas on the hot plate.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.500
Can you make them for us as well?

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.000
Let’s see how you make them.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.000
So first she pats them down and smoothes them out.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.000
Pulls them off and puts them on the stove.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.000
And see how they bubble up?

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.750
That’s how she knows when they are done.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Margarita, muy bueno.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.000
Very good.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.900
And so it is on a tortilla smasher,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.000
But she is not smashing them.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.000
She’s doing it by hand. They’re so thin.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.000
Alright, so what she does is

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.900
Takes a little bit. Yeah.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.000
She’s going to show you.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.000
Put your hand on the edge.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It’s a little better.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.000
Very slow.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.150
When we do it.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.000
Okay. Samara, you want to give it a try?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Is that good?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So I smash it out?

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.000
Oh no.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.001
Oh no.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.750
Now, Samara is a baker.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.000
Never with this.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.000
Como do you say baker?

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.000
You say la panadera.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
She’s a la panadera.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.000
That’s what she does for a living.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.000
Ut oh.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.000
Ut oh.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.000
You are still needing skills.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.150
Yeah, no. Not with this.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.000
Oh, my hands are too wet.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.000
Oh, that is not a good one.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.000
Put it on the stove.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.000
Ut-oh. That’s not good. It’s too thin.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.000
Is that too thin?

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.150
No, it good.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.750
Oh, you did it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Oh, I'm done.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.000
What about you kiddo?

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.000
Okay, the kiddo is going to put hers on too.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.000
Oh, that’s good.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.000
I am going to do uno mas. See how it works out.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.150
Okay, so you first pat it out.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.000
Put it down flat.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.750
And then you hold your hand and twist it.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.000
Is that right Margarita?

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.000
Sí.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.000
Oh Margarita, I am no good at this.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.750
I am so slow.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.750
Margarita, how many anos have you been making tortillas?

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.750
Diez anos.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Ten years.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.150
Ten years she has been here making the tortillas.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.500
That is a long time to, this is hopeless.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.900
Really, oh.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.000
I am leaving it for you.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.000
Gracias.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.000
Thank you very much Margarita.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.000
There is no way to fix that one.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.000
No, she threw it out.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.900
Cuántos tortillas?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Seis kilos.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.900
Six kilos per día?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.500
Sí.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.750
Per day?

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.000
Wow!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.900
That is a lot of tortillas.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.150
Mucho tortillas.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.000
Wow!

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.000
Very good. Yea!

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.500
Thank you Margarita.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.250
Adiós!
