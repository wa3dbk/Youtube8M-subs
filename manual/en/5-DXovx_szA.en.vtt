00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.580
My name is Bill and I served
in the Marine Corps.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.070
I served in Vietnam.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.020
I was in the Marine Corps
for 3 years, 9

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.840
months, and 20 days.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.570
I was in Vietnam from
'67 to '68.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.180
Certainly killing human
beings changes you.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.720
I remember the first time
I killed two NVA.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.820
And that was on the strip.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.300
And I was elated, actually.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.320
I didn't smile or laugh or
anything, but I was inwardly

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.630
elated that I finally
killed the enemy.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.350
Little did I know that now I
would be feeling actually

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.940
remorse or sadness.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.900
I asked for a college cut to get
out of the Marine Corps,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.870
and I received it,
and I attended

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.850
Ohio State very briefly.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.160
And I couldn't find my mind
wrapping around academia.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.680
I couldn't concentrate, couldn't
study, and I really

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.080
couldn't focus on
the whole thing.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.360
And I couldn't understand what
was wrong with me because I

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.540
always felt nervous.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.800
I felt like I was tapping
my feet all the time.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.050
I couldn't sit down.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.090
My head had a swivel on it.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.770
I was always watching
everybody.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920
And whenever somebody
came into a room or

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.400
something, my head was--

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.010
I was watching them before
they saw me.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.090
And I couldn't understand
why I was like that.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.420
Anger was something that
I would come from

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.790
0 to 60, and fighting.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.350
And if I thought somebody
was irrational, I became

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.690
completely irrational.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.150
A lot of fighting.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.000
I didn't have time for fools,
I always said to myself.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.980
And I thought nobody
understood me.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.470
I thought I was alone.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.580
And really, actually, for the
most part, I was alone.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.090
After my bypass I talked to a
psychiatrist. And he talked to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.750
me for about five minutes, and
he said Bill, you have PTS.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.880
I said, well, how in the
hell would you know?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.820
I said you've talked to me
five minutes and you can

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.700
diagnose me?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.390
And he says, well, I've
done this before.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.440
So I looked at him.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.900
And he stared at me right in the
eye and he didn't flinch.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.820
And I said, well, maybe there's
something to this.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.090
So he assigned me a
psychiatrist, assigned me a

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.670
therapist, and I started taking
therapy sessions and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.090
going to groups and talking
about this.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.700
And I found that well, I have
all these symptoms.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.380
By virtue of the PTS--

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.970
what is called Post-traumatic
Stress-- it happens years

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.810
after you come back
from Vietnam.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.140
And if you stay busy, you
may not think about it

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.580
for 20 to 30 years.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.405
But it's going to come back
and bite you right in

00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:07.060
the you know what.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.770
I think these young warriors,
the OIF and OEF warriors, have

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.560
a really difficult
problem now.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.040
They've got so many
deployments.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.840
But when they come back, they
don't have that respite from

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.030
the war, because they have
to stay in training.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.950
They have to stay in the
mode of going back

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.790
and fight that war.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.210
They know they're going back.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.650
So they stay in that mode, which
severely imprints them

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.540
as far as combat
stress and PTS.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.000
And they're not getting the help
from the mental health

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.290
clinicians.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.990
They're not getting the help.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.280
And hopefully, this message here
is going to get out and

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.170
make a difference.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.750
And I can tell you the
VA has stepped up to

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.950
care for the veterans.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.640
And I just hope that the
education and the word gets

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.580
out to these combat veterans.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.560
Because I had a general
one time, General

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.360
Kelly, who told me--

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.680
he was the chief of the special
operation forces--

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.660
he said Bill, if anybody tells
you that they're never changed

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.310
by war, they're lying.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.350
If you are human being, then
war is going to change you.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.100
It's going to impact you,
and it will change you.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.490
Get some help.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.680
I don't care if it's
at the VA.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.840
Hopefully it's at the VA,
because they have some great

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.735
programs. Don't listen to
your buddy saying the

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.030
VA's screwed up.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.800
They're not that screwed up.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.290
You're the one who's screwed
up, and you need

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.330
to go get some help.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.580
And if you can't get it
yourself, find some veteran as

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.070
a mentor, so as an
advocate for you.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.100
For example, American Combat
Veterans of War,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.420
that's what we do.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.990
We guide you through what
we call the VA maze.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.970
Now it's not a maze because
they want it that way.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.700
It's a maze because combat
veterans make terrible

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.700
advocates for themselves.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.490
So guide your way in there
if you want to.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.040
If you're a current warrior,
you go to the Vet Center.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.020
The Vet Center is anonymous in
their reports to the VA and to

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.010
the military.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.230
So don't deny that you've got
some problems. You're feeling

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.500
that way for some reason.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.980
You need to ask for help.
