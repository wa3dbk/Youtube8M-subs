Marc: The Wood Whisperer is sponsored by

00:00:02.672 --> 00:00:05.873
Powermatic, the gold standard since 1921.

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:08.843
And by Rockler Woodworking and Hardware,

00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:10.877
Create with Confidence.

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:16.316
(lively jazz music)

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:28.495
Well my new split-top roubo
workbench is nearly complete,

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.130
and this was one heck of a project.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.832
I had a great opportunity to practice

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.167
some old skills and learn some new ones.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.069
In fact, one of those new things I learned

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.506
is the concept of tapping holes in wood,

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:41.074
basically cutting threads
so that we can use bolts

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.810
instead of using things
like nails and screws.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.813
There are some powerful
applications for something

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:47.881
like this so let me show how we used it on

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.083
the bench and then
we'll cut some together.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.486
Pretty much all of the
leg vice components from

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:56.589
Benchcrafted attach via
bolts that go into threads.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.192
It's really a cool thing
if you think about it.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.495
These are movable parts, things may break.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.931
At some point we may
need to replace the chop.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.467
You may need to make an
adjustment to the hardware.

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:08.569
It's good to be able to take it apart.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.503
Here's another example.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:12.372
This roller guide down here
needs to adjust to hold

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.642
the parallel guide in
just the right position,

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:17.811
so we need to make fine
adjustments up and down.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.115
Having threaded bolts here
allows us to loosen things up,

00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:23.350
make the adjustment,
tighten it back down and

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.952
know that we're not
really doing any damage

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.621
to the wood because it's in a thread.

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:30.491
Let's take a look at some
traditional ways of using

00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:33.160
hardware to hold wood
pieces together and why

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.930
they might not be as
good as a threaded hold.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.965
Let's look at nails first.
Nails are pretty much a brute

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:41.168
force way of holding things together.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:42.736
A nail is driven into the wood,

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.339
splitting and compressing
the fibers the whole way.

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:48.008
Over time, natural forces
will cause the wood to

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.645
compress even further and
eventually the two pieces will

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:54.219
come loose because the nail
has nothing to grip on to.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.883
One step up from a nail is a screw.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.852
When you rotate the screw
into the wood it pulls

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.888
itself in and essentially
threads itself into the fibers.

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:05.092
The good thing about screws
is they are removable,

00:02:05.092 --> 00:02:07.227
but over the course of
years if you loosen and

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.930
tighten one you wind up
widening those threads.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.998
You may even wind up
destroying the threads,

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.221
which whole thing goes
to poop at that point.

00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:16.837
Now the star of our
show, the threaded bolt.

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:18.872
Once the threads are cut
into the wood you could

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:21.808
put this bolt in and out
as many times as you need

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.678
to and it really doesn't
do any damage to the wood,

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:27.848
because the bolts threads
are sized perfectly to fit

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:30.851
nice and smooth into the threads
that are cut into the wood.

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:33.353
This is perfect for
applications where you may need

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:36.690
to loosen and tighten
this thing over and over.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.592
It's going to last much, much longer.

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:43.504
(groovy music)

00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:45.262
All you need to make a threaded

00:02:45.262 --> 00:02:46.846
hole is a drill bit and a tap.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.302
These are basically a matched pair.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.104
You want to make sure
that the drill bit clears

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.574
most of the material out
and leaves just enough

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:56.443
so that the tap can cut
threads appropriately.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:59.479
If you want, you can actually
buy the tap and the bit

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.282
in a set so you know you
have the perfect match pair,

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.251
but typically these are
sized, you can look them up,

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:05.852
and you can make sure you get the

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.854
right tap set with the right bit.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.724
And of course, you want
to make sure that the tap,

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:11.458
the threads it winds up cutting,

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:14.328
are perfect for the bolt
that you're going to use.

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.263
Because I was my hole to
be nice and straight and

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:18.632
perfectly perpendicular
to the surface I'm going

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:21.101
to use my drill press to
do the initial drilling.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:26.005
(drilling)

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.543
Now this is where the magic happens.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.146
Typically you would take the tap and

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:33.914
put it into a special tap wrench.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:35.883
It's basically a T-handled wrench

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:37.851
that gives you lots of leverage,

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:39.654
and you can twitch this guy down and

00:03:39.654 --> 00:03:41.555
slowly but surely cut the threads.

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.325
I think we can do better than that.

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:46.526
If we take our time we
can use a power drill and

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:49.762
get this done with quite
a bit less elbow grease.

00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:52.099
I'm just going to very
carefully place the tapered

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.469
tip into the hole and
very slowly start to turn.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.839
Let the threads do the cutting,

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.641
you don't really have to push down.

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:03.810
You could speed up once you get started.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.180
Obviously you want your
drill on its slowest setting.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.518
Once you get going ...

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.320
Let's pick up the speed a little bit.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.796
Now we're pretty much at
the capacity of the tap so

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:26.165
now we can reverse the direction
and slowly pull it out.

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:30.670
You can't go too fast here,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.606
if you go too fast you
will strip everything

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.577
out and just have a nice
hole, what you don't want.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.978
You're backing out these treads as if

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:40.280
you were backing out an actual bolt.

00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:54.428
Here we go. Let's give it a shot.

00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:02.753
(squeaking)

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.373
Just as an example I
just took a scrap piece

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:08.141
of wood and put a hole in it that's big

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.577
enough to take the bolt without catching.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.213
This will serve as our
example of something you might

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:16.182
want to connect when you're
putting two pieces together.

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:19.485
Kind of like our roller
brackets for the workbench.

00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:22.622
One you get down to the bottom
of the hole and your bolt

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:25.325
starts to make contact with
your washers, you're going to

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.961
find this thing getting
real tight, real fast.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:34.635
That is going nowhere.

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.537
Check it out. Just one bolt,

00:05:36.537 --> 00:05:39.439
these two pieces are
together and this is no joke.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.177
These things are really
tight. I can't even move them.

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:46.279
Again, one bolt. Imagine
if you had multiples,

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.915
you would have an incredibly secure fit,

00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:51.518
and you would be able to
loosen it and move this

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.521
piece if you needed to.
Incredible possibilities.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.456
Of course one alternative here would

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:58.491
be to use threaded inserts,

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.394
and I've used those in the past too.

00:06:00.394 --> 00:06:02.462
The problem is they tend to come loose,

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.232
and not the threads themselves.

00:06:04.232 --> 00:06:05.999
The threads themselves are made of metal.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.767
You basically drill a hole and drive

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:09.669
the threaded insert into the wood.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.471
It's the method that the
insert is attached to

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.273
the wood that tends to
come loose over time.

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:15.475
I don't really think those
are the best solution either.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.812
I think now that I know
about this method I think

00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:20.146
I'm going to use this a
lot on jigs and fixtures,

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:22.783
and any project that I
have a part that needs to

00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:25.318
be loosened and tightened
again, and I want to make

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:27.488
sure that it lasts for a good long time.

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:30.145
Here's the other thing
that's great about this.

00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:32.826
These taps are very cheap,
only a couple bucks a piece.

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.694
And they're going to last forever because

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:37.230
you're not drilling into metal,
you're just tapping wood.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.765
You should have no problem with

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.867
these taps lasting for decades.

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:43.336
You'll probably pass them
on to the next generation.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.672
Spend a few bucks, get a couple taps.

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.340
Let me know what you think if

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.075
you include them in your project.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.044
I'd like to thank Benchcrafted by the way,

00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:53.347
because they introduced me
to this entire technique.

00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:55.233
I would have never thought of
doing this in wood projects,

00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:57.109
so I'd like to thank them for that.

00:06:57.109 --> 00:06:59.819
By the way, if you're interested
in this roubo workbench

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.288
build we're doing it
right now in the guild.

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:04.316
Go to WoodWhispererGuild.com and

00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:06.141
you can see what it's all about.

00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:08.612
We have a plan and we're
giving you just a ton,

00:07:08.612 --> 00:07:10.248
a buttload, I like that phrase,

00:07:10.248 --> 00:07:12.858
a buttload of video content
for you to check out.

00:07:12.858 --> 00:07:14.618
That's at WoodWhispererGuild.com.

00:07:14.618 --> 00:07:15.910
Thanks for watching.
