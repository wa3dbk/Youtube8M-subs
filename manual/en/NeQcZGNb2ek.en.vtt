Today well be installing part number TH500
from Thule.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.760
This is the Xsporter Pro truck bed ladder
rack.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.200
Weve got a lot of parts.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.930
Were going to start off all our parts laid
out for one half of the ladder rack.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.310
Well start off by taking one of the crossbars
and go ahead and install the rubber strip.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.400
Well line it with the edge and work our way
over.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.550
Next well go ahead and take one of the uprights
and add one of the saddles to it, and see

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.810
how they fit together.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.460
Then well install the hardware.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.570
Lets go ahead and repeat the process one more
time for the other one.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:05:27.770
