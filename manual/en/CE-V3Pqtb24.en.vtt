00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.500
Undoubtedly, the Order: 1886 is one of the most discussed games and hottest PS4 exclusives of 2015.

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:51.200
You are watching the Unboxholics show with Sakis Karpas and this is the Blackwater Edition of The Order: 1886. I've already published my review of the game and you can check the description of this video if you'd like to read it.

00:00:51.781 --> 00:01:09.100
The Blackwater Edition ships in a rectangular paper black box with gold details, which also has artwork from the game decorated on it and it is covered by a slipcase.

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:27.420
The first and most important item of the Blackwater Edition is the retail copy of The Order: 1886. Inside the retail copy we found downloadable codes for the Knight’s Arsenal DLC, the Official Game Soundtrack with bonus tracks and unreleased behind the scenes footage.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:44.180
Another item of the Blackwater Edition is artwork postcards which are inside a wax sealed envelope. Check out some close up shots of the postcards.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.900
Further on, we found two Woven coat of arms patches for Isabeau &amp; Galahad, two important characters of the game.

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:16.400
The last item of the Blackwater edition is the Replica Knight’s vial pendant. Even though I'd wish it would be a real pendant and not a replica, it is quite detailed and it has a qualitative chain.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:55.600
The Order: 1886 Blackwater Edition is available now at Seven Spots for €87.90. The Blackwater Edition is a good deal for anyone looking to buy the game since it only asks for €20.
