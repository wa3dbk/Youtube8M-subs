Hey guys, this is Tim from opticsplanet.com and today I wanted to talk to you about Thermal Imaging Products.

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:16.168
What we have here today are various thermal imaging units from weapon sight, a camera,

00:00:16.168 --> 00:00:19.652
a monocular, and a clip-on unit and these are units that allow you to see the

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:24.658
differences in heat in the environment throughout the day, at all the materials around us

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:28.981
absorbing irradiate heat, at different temperatures, and these units allow you to see the

00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:29.805
differences in them.

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:34.014
One of the questions we get are common myths on thermal imaging. Thermal imaging cannot

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:38.215
see through solid objects, it cannot see through walls, it cannot see through clothing

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:40.088
and it will not see through glass.

00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:43.786
Despite what Hollywood shows you, you cannot hide from thermal imaging by covering

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:47.805
yourself with mud because thermal imaging sees differences in heat.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:52.128
We receive a lot of questions about the differences between night vision and thermal vision

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.420
Night vision is the tradition green images that you see.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.952
One of the biggest advantages to thermal imaging over image intensifier night vision is that

00:01:00.952 --> 00:01:04.899
thermal imaging does not project anything and is passive night vision.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.288
Image intensifier night vision often uses IR illumination in order to see

00:01:08.288 --> 00:01:12.923
because it uses small amounts of visible light. When using image intensifier night vision,

00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:18.586
with an IR illumination source, certain animals and anyone with a night vision device can see you.

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:23.069
With thermal imaging, since nothing is projected, animals will not know that you are there.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.895
Many of the thermal units we sell have one expandification: we have additional units

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:32.142
that have 3.5 magnification all the way up to 6x. Another difference in these units is the

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:37.462
refresh rate. A refresh rate is the amount that the unit updates the picture it's seeing to your

00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:43.911
display device. Common refresh rates are 9Hz, 30Hz, and 60Hz. The lower the refresh rate,

00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:48.998
the less amount of time the unit updates to the display. A low refresh rate, like 9Hz,

00:01:48.998 --> 00:01:54.184
is kind of like looking in slow motion, where a 30Hz or a 60Hz is kind of seeing in real time.

00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:59.104
If you're going to be hunting, you're going to want a rail mounted unit such as ATN Thor or

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:02.342
FLIR RS weapon scope. Both of these units come with optional magnification

00:02:02.342 --> 00:02:07.928
and have reticles built into the unit. This particular unit has 1x magnification and would be

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:13.082
great for hog or coyote hunting. Another option for hunting is to buy a clip-on unit, such as this

00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:16.656
ATN unit here. The advantage of this is that it clips directly on the  Picatinny rail

00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:20.054
in front of your daytime optic, converting it to thermal weapon sight.

00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:22.723
The advantage of the clip-on unit is that you don't have to change anything

00:02:22.723 --> 00:02:26.544
about your daytime setup, allowing you to later remove it without losing 0 on your

00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:31.303
daytime optic. If you're looking for something for exploring or scouting, you'd be better

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:35.400
served by going with a hand-held FLIR unit. This would be better suited for you rather than

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.251
a riflescope with a reticle and they are more compact for field replacement

00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.296
Hand-held thermal units are useful for building inspection, allowing you to check your

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:47.005
insulation for heat loss, this will lead to huge energy savings.

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:51.525
If you need a hands-free unit, the ATN Odin will be a perfect option. This unit

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.719
is in a PVS14 body and allows you to use the same accessories as with PVS14

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.961
scope, meaning it is great for hands-free applications. As you can see,

00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:03.532
there are many different options for thermal imaging. I hope this video

00:03:03.532 --> 00:03:08.957
helps make your decision easier. If you have any other questions, please leave us a comment or

00:03:08.957 --> 00:03:12.745
send us an email. I'm Tim. You can find all these products at opticsplanet.com

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:13.649
Thank you for watching.
