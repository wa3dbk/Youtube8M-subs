Hi, I'm Charles Stewart Jr, and I'm going
to show you how to begin an Illustrator drawing.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.040
Adobe Illustrator is a really awesome program.
If you've ever played with PhotoShop it's

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.719
a lot different than you would think. It goes
about things a little bit different than PhotoShop

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.650
does, and really Illustrator is used for designing
print work and ads and stuff like that. And

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.480
there's really a lot of cool stuff you can
do with it. So first you want to open Adobe

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.070
Illustrator up, so you just click on the icon
and it'll load up. And then just click new

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.559
document, and then from here it'll tell - you
know give you the parameters in which you

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.520
want to work in. You know if you're, let's
say you're creating a flier for a band or

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.532
something like that. You could say you know
the dimensions of your flier, you can say

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:55.399
well, size, it's a letter, or you can go for
screen size or whatever, but, for the sake

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.920
of this, by default, it's just letter sized,
which is your standard eight by eleven, you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.050
know you can go in and name your project,
we'll just call this temp. And then CMYK Color

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.700
RGB. CMYK is used for print work. Printers
print CMYK and RGB is more what your monitor

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.170
displays. So if - let's say you're going to
do something with Illustrator, and then move

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.280
it into PhotoShop, you'll probably want to
stay with RGB, but if you're wanting to print

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.270
whatever you're making here, stick with CMYK.
So, just hit okay, and then it'll create the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.300
art board that you're going to work on. And
really, it's hard to sum up exactly everything

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.130
Illustrator does in one clip. The best thing
to do is to go in and start playing with it.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.071
Again like you can choose from different shapes,
stars, all this stuff, square, and you know,

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:52.090
just make it, and then just get creative with
it. Start playing with all the tools in there,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.101
you can change colors around, do all kinds
of cool stuff with it, and make you know,

00:01:57.101 --> 00:02:03.410
it lets you choose fonts, you can create words,
and really make a cool flier, or advertisement,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.910
ads, stuff like that. So get in there and
play with it, and this is pretty much how

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.100
to start an Illustrator drawing.
