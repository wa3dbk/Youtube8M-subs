00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:15.529
Hello everyone. So there's been widespread reports of wifi issues with the Samsung Galaxy S4.

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.539
I really wanted to address them because

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.500
there seems to be a bit of confusion as to
where the problem lies.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.019
First off...

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.049
the Galaxy S4 is packing one of the latest wifi chips and it also

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:28.259
includes the new AC standard

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.890
which is very very very very very fast wifi. In theory it will

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.820
hit up to a gig a second

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.450
kind of speeds, gigabit speeds, should I say,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.910
which is roughly comparable to what you would get

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.930
over a gigabit ethernet cable.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.180
Obviously, there's a few things there that can get in the way there

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.250
things like interference etcetera.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.560
But crucially where we're seeing the problem on
wifi is with older wifi routers and

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.570
access points.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.950
The problem seems to stem from

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.519
the fact that the access points and routers are using

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.860
an older standard

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.790
sort of, of wi-fi.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.020
When the various standards for wifi come out there's always a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.570
time delay between the kind of working paper of how this new technology will work

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.860
and then it being ratified as being yes
that is exactly how it's going to be

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.560
delivered. And

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.310
a lot of the technology companies tend to jump ahead and what they'll do is as soon as this

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.829
paper, this white paper is published about how this new technology will work

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.810
they rush out equipment that meets that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.120
supposed standard.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.900
Unfortunately there can be a bit of a change between

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.229
that initial white paper under discussions and how
it's actually ratified in the end.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.740
And normally the differences are minor and sometimes the differences are quite large,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.850
What I think is happening here is that we're dealing with

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.420
routers that are using

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.620
the not 100% ratified standard

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.869
so when the Samsung Galaxy S4 is trying to connect to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.390
N version routers and wireless equipment

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.429
it's attempting to connect using

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:58.700
absolute standard

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.439
and what it's finding on the other end of the
router end is not quite the standard and

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.679
so we're getting different compatibility problems and these symptoms are everything

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.250
from the S4 simply won't connect to the access point or it will connect momentarily

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.859
pull up one page of data and then just stop and not pull up anything else, all sorts of

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.059
strange little things.

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.530
Now in most cases

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.730
buying a new router not always the best option but buying a new router which

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.159
because it's latest edition as it were is

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.570
going to be used in the most up-to-date standards

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.389
and will have you using the ratified ones correctly

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.840
or alternatively have a look at the manufacturer's website for your router or

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.589
access point

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.930
and just see if there's a firmware update available.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.669
Most people buy their access points and routers and they never check them for updates

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:45.299
and normally you will find there will be security patches, extra features and more

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.220
importantly tweaks to the standard as the
manufacturer originally

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.019
rolled that out within the hardware. To bring it
 more into what's actually going on

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.089
in the real world of how that technology was finally ratified.

00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:00.510
So, if you're having wifi problems, don't blame your Samsung Galaxy S4 initially

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.769
it's working on the latest standards.

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.040
However,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.469
do have a look at your access point in your router see if you need a firmware

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.319
update.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.329
If you can't get a firmware update or if

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.699
the firmware updates that are available don't fix the problem for you

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.549
go round to a friend's house try their access point and what you're realistically looking for

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.399
here is getting  your S4 connected to anything. If you can get your S4 connected to an

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:26.639
access point or router then it's your current equipment at home that's causing your problem there

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.809
or

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.769
the wifi access point you're using, at, you know, an open access point

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.459
just hasn't been updated, there's some really old access points out there.

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.369
If that's the case you're going to need a new router, it's as simple as that.

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:39.329
And as I've found,

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.599
if you tend to buy a router that was released within the last year, you simply won't

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.989
have a problem it will work absolutely fine. We run VirginMedia home hubs

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.210
we run a lot of D link equipment here as well

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.570
and we don't have any problems. Normally I usually find when a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.069
new

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.620
mobile device comes through certainly there's at least one device every year

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.109
that precipitates either a further update or a new router.

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.140
In this occasion it's

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.060
the Samsung Galaxy S4, there will be
other devices throughout the year that working

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.689
on this new AC standard that again

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.259
may very well have some compatibility problems
with the fall back to

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:15.609
N and 54G. But if you're having problems there's a few places that you can start

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.049
looking. Don't just blame your Galaxy S4, don't send it back just yet, go and test it

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.949
on a few other routers and access points and just
see what you're getting.

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:28.100
Like I say, in most cases I've found, it is not the Galaxy S4

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.939
that is at fault.

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.459
Sure, there's been one or two with bad wifi chips that have come out but those are

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.479
very very rare so far. In nearly all cases

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.070
it's down to your routing equipment.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.649
It needs a firmware update or you need to replace it I'm afraid.

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:45.389
But there you go, there's a solution for you.
