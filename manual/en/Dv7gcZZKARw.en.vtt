00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.560
Next, we're going to take our serger from
a four-thread to a narrow three-thread.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.549
When we say narrow, that means we're going
to use the right needle.

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.960
When we say wide, we're going to use the left
needle and take out the right one.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.610
Today I'm going to just clip the yellow thread,
clip, and pull it out.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.750
Now when I am not using a thread, completely
take it off the serger.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.550
If you leave this thread hanging and dangling
from its little thread stand up here, it will

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.170
find its friend and go back in and come back
to haunt you later.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.410
I always leave just the threads I'm using
on the serger.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.710
Open up your front door, that’s where that
small little screw driver is going to be hidden.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.300
We're loosening the screw at the top.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.470
If you haven't done needle changes, we have
the video of how to change your needle.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.960
Loosen the left needle screw, catch that needle
on the way out, and when you’re done tighten

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.960
that screw.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.180
It’s going to go a lot further back in than
what we loosened it for.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.100
Give it a nice tighten, because if you leave
this loose the vibration of the serger, sometimes

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.729
makes those screws actually find themselves
all the way out and lost, and that’s not

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:11.729
good.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.240
Find yourself a little place and hide your
needle, and we are ready to do a three-thread

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.240
edge.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.850
A three thread edge is great when you just
need to go around all your edges and take

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.600
care of the unraveling edges.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.299
I'm going to do this quick serge and we'll
see how my cutting blade is set up here.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.470
I have a little bit extra, so I'm going to
go ahead ... See the little gap in between,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.240
which we will because now we just have a single
layer filling that in.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.090
It doesn't usually fill in a lot, so I'm going
to go ahead and move my knife a little bit

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.390
further to the outside.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.549
We'll just go ahead and do the other side.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.710
If you don't want to cut anything off you
can just run the fabric right next to the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.710
blade.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.409
You can move your seam guide, by the way if
you want this out you can just go ahead and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.550
slide it out, but it’s kind of nice because
you can set this up.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.719
Slide that back in so that it’s even with
your knife, and then not be trimming off very

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.719
much.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.370
If you do trim off just a little bit, it is
going to give it a nice little edge.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.510
Ooh, that’s pretty.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.220
See the difference, now it’s filled in where
before it had a little bit extra there.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.070
You can go all the way around the edge.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.230
I would also probably lengthen the stitch
line because we don't really need it this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.700
tight, so we can make that a little bit longer,
and spread it out.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.410
Here is a great example.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.870
I've got a coat that I actually had ... See
it’s a beautiful silk.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.430
I just had it quilted, silk on the top, silk
on the bottom, with batting in between.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.010
Then what I did was I cut my jacket out of
the silk quilt that was quilted.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.690
This is a fitted jacket, so what I did was
of all the pieces that I cut out, all the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.620
little sides, the fronts, the little parts
underneath my arm, I went ahead and just went

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.910
around them all with a three-thread edge.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.909
Then that way as I handled them, I didn't
have to worry about all those silk strings.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.800
If you’re doing any garment construction,
velvets are another thing, satins are another

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800
thing.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.100
You usually don't want to trim off the seam
allowances because those are probably going

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.640
to be on things that are more of a fitted
item, or maybe just fun.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.280
It is nice to be able to serge around them
with the three-thread, and then come back

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.560
to your sewing machine and sew the seam.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.230
That way if you need to alter it in or out,
you still have the full seam allowance that

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.090
was allowed with your pattern.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.670
That is really going to be the best choice.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.150
Yes, your taking two times, but look at how
pretty and professional the insides are.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.640
Also that does allow you to press these seams
open and not just to one side, or the other

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.010
because they haven't actually been closed
up.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.900
I have had people just take ... They'll sew
everything together, then they'll come back

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.239
with a little three-thread and just serge
all the seams together.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.640
Whichever way works best for you.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.450
I prefer to do it more on the individual pieces,
and then go back and sew them together.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.611
We will have a video on how to do coves both
inside and outside curves and corners, so

00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:07.170
you know how to work around something that’s
not just a straight edge.
