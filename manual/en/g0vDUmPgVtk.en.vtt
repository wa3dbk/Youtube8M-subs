00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.850
How to Build a Coffin.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.120
It's time to up the ante in the neighborhood
competition for Halloween decorations.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.599
Put the finishing touch on your lawn by adding
this spooky casket.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:21.119
You will need Shelf paper Pencil T-square
Measuring tape 3 3/4-in.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:30.990
x 4-ft. x 8-ft. hardwood plywood panels Table
saw Wood glue or biscuits Drill 1/2 lb. 1

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.990
5/8-in.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.449
wood screws Wood filler Stain and polyurethane
or paint 48-in.

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.090
piano hinge and tape (optional).

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.300
Step 1.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.690
Lay out the shelf paper and draw a line lengthwise
down the center, 75 1/2 inches long.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.550
Using a T-square, draw another line, perpendicular
to the first, 34 inches long.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.619
Cross the first line 17 inches from one end.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.140
Step 2.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.140
Draw a 24-inch line at the top of the cross,
extending 12 inches on either side from the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.650
center of the cross.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.470
Then draw a 17-inch line at the bottom of
the cross, extending 8 1/2 inches on either

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.750
side from the center.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.440
Step 3.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.370
Draw lines connecting each end of the line
at the top of the cross to the corresponding

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.270
ends of the 34-inch cross line, and then draw
lines to connect the line at the bottom of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.310
the cross to the 34-inch cross line to complete
the outline of the coffin.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.810
Step 4.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.530
Using the dimensions and angle specs from
the template, measure and cut the 6 side pieces

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.320
from one of the 4-by-8 plywood panels.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.380
Step 5.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.700
Draw another template on shelf paper to use
for constructing the bottom base.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.480
Make the long line of the cross 74 inches.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.020
16 1/4 inches from the top, draw a 32 1/2-inch
cross line.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.930
Make the line at the top 22 1/2 inches, and
make the line at the bottom 15 1/2 inches.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.320
Then connect the lines as you did in the first
template.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.830
Step 6.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.909
Copy the dimensions from the template onto
the second 4-by-8 plywood panel, and cut it

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.909
with the saw.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.429
You can also tape the template to the panel
and cut around the outline.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.489
Step 7.

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.150
Dry-fit the side pieces to the base and secure
the connecting points with glue or biscuits.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.860
When the glue is dry, drill pilot holes and
counter sink screws through all the side panels

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.270
into the bottom panel to provide strength
and rigidity to the coffin walls.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.480
Step 8.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.240
Use the finished coffin base as a template
and scribe its outline on the remaining 4-by-8

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.240
panel.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.010
Cut out the cover panel.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.550
Step 9.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.120
Fill any holes with wood filler, sand the
coffin, and apply stain and polyurethane or

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.300
paint the coffin.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.190
Attach the piano hinge and set the coffin
up on your lawn to scare the kids on Halloween.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.260
Did you know People in the U.S. spend more
money on Halloween than on any other holiday

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.270
except Christmas.
