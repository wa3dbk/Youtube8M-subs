00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.680
Varun, you ready for the exams?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.180
Yes Ofcourse

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.680
Do you know what I did?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.520
Before I left the house, I ate dahi

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.200
Then I broke glass for goodluck

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.600
Then I tied three threads to my hands

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.860
I have also changed my name.Now there are 4 V's in my name

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.640
Then I went to the Temple and stood on my hands all night

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.740
That's not all. I am also wearing my lucky red underwear

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.940
I called the vet and got all the black cats killed

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.536
We are standing below a tree. If a crow takes

00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:46.036
a dump on me, even that's lucky.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.179
take a dump na

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.320
But did you study?

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:50.834
No no, He is there na

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.954
Till black money is not bought back

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.874
nothing will happen in India

00:00:56.874 --> 00:00:58.608
All these politicians keep making money and 

00:00:58.608 --> 00:00:59.396
keep giving it to switzerland

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:00.515

How do you like the house?

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:06.266
We loved it. I think we should close the deal now

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.839
Ofcourse ofcourse. So total cost is 5 crores

00:01:10.713 --> 00:01:13.313
You have to give 20% in cash

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.515
Take 40% in cash

00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:21.776
Don't forget to give a discount!

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.820

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660

00:01:54.717 --> 00:01:56.957
I saw a car coming so I honked twice

00:01:56.957 --> 00:01:58.554
I even gave the signal twice

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.460
He was still speeding and he hit my car

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.240
When I said to come to the police station

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.940
They started harassing me

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:09.776
Sir I really want to catch them

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:13.298
Madam, don't cry,don't cry. I will take care of it.

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:16.312

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.940
Guy driving the car saw your leg

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.540
Will he look at your leg or the road?

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.714
He will look at the leg. How will he drive the car?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.240
What did tell you me before? You gave a signal

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.460
Now I get what you mean by signal

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:02.957

00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:04.821

about a 15th Century Maratha warrior

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.700
Won't work. There is no gravitas in your script.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.440
You know what gravitas means? No. It's ok.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.860
Gravitas means Dum, Dum nahin hain

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.680

Benzer? I haven't heard of it

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.015
I think if you go ahead a bit you will find it. Go everywhere

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.660
Take a left or a right, the building will be somewhere.

00:05:46.665 --> 00:05:48.742
Go straight down the slope and at the end of the slope

00:05:48.742 --> 00:05:50.702
There is National Bank, Evershine Nagar Branch

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.260
from National Bank take a right and bang opposite that 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.575
you will see Benzer apartment

00:05:55.575 --> 00:05:56.955
So you definitely don't know?

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.694
How do you spell it? It's B E N

00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:00.194
I will ask ahead It's ok

00:06:03.234 --> 00:06:03.954
God Bless!
