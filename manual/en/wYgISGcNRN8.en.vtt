00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.020
Voice off Screen: Scientists around the world have their eyes turned 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.050
to the sun this week as it reveals a massive active region that could affect

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
us here on Earth. And here joining us from NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
in Greenbelt, Maryland is Dr. Alex Young. Thank you for joining us.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
Dr.Young: Thank you. Voice off Screen: So what is a sunspot and why 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.140
is this one so special? Dr.Young: Well sunspots are these regions 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.150
of really, really intense magnetic field, they're massive areas they're

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.160
slightly cooler than the surrounding sun so they appear dark.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.210
This one is of great interest for us because it's the largest one we've

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.250
seen in almost 24 years. It's more than ten times 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.290
the size of the Earth.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.320
Voice off Screen: Why do we want to learn more from this sunspot ? Dr.Young: Well,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.340
this one is really intersting because generally sunspots of this size

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.360
produce a lot of activity that can have direct impact 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.380
on us here on Earth. This particular one 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.390
though its produced some activity, has not produced the kind of activity we

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.410
expected. So this has been a very intresting puzzle for 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.450
scientists to study, so that we can better understand sunspots in general.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.480
Voice off Screen: Will it affect us here in Earth?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.510
Dr.Young: The sunspots can throw out huge blasts of 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.540
light, we call solar flares, sometimes big blobs of material.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.570
It doesn't impact us directly but all of this is 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.580
electromagnetic in nature and therefore it impacts our technology. 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.600
Sometimes it can disrupt communications, it can cause 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.620
problems with GPS and even impact our power grids 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.630
if the storms are strong enough. Voice off Screen: What is NASA doing

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.670
to understand sunspots better? Dr.Young: Well in particular we have 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.700
several spacecrafts such as the Solar Dynamics Observatory 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.740
which is looking at the sun twenty four hours a day providing 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.780
great amounts of data for us to study it. We also have this huge 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.810
fleet of spacecraft that is studying not just the sun, 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.830
but also the suns interaction with the Earth, the other planets

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.850
and throughout the solar system. Now, next year we're launching 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.850
a new mission called MMS, which is four spacecraft,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.900
that is going to circle the Earth and study;

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.940
using the Earth's magnetic field study this particular

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.980
phenomenon that happens both at the Earth,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
on the Sun and sunspots and also through the entire solar system.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.030
Voice off Screen: Where can we learn more? Dr.Young: If you go to 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.060
nasa.gov/sunearth you can learn more about this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.080
other missions and you can also find a lot of great imagery videos

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.090
and all sorts of articles about the kind of research we do 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.100
here at NASA. Voice off Screen: Dr. Alex Young thank you so much.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.390
Dr.Young: Thank you.
