00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.570
Researcher Kanesa Duncan at the University
of Hawaii is studying Scalloped hammerheads.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.440
She catches the sharks when they are just
pups, only a few weeks old, in Kaneohe Bay

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.860
on Oahu.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:29.960
She uses a hand line and a barbless hook baited
with squid to catch the baby hammerheads.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.980
By holding the shark upside down, she places
it in a kind of trance called Tonic Immobility.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.570
Many sharks can be immobilized for handling
in this way.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.880
Nobody knows why it works, but it makes shark
handling a lot easier.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.430
She frequently puts the pup back in the water
to aerate the gills.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:03.660
Once aboard the boat, she first measures the
shark while an assistant records 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:16.000
the data.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.869
Next she implants a small visual tag with
a number on it through the shark's dorsal

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.990
fin.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.029
This does not hurt the shark at all.

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:31.079
The fin is almost completely made of cartilage.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:42.639
Next, she weighs the pup.

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:51.810
Finally, Duncan releases the baby hammerhead
back into the ocean.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.579
Hopefully, she will catch it again in a few
months and be able to determine how much it

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.989
grew.
