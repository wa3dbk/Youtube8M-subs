00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:09.240
Hey Cookaholics, Chef Kendra here and today
we’re making Cherry Ice Cream.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.690
We’re using heavy whipping cream, milk,
sugar, egg yolks cherries, vanilla, and salt.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.380
You want to wash, pit and roughly chop you
cherries.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.660
You can use frozen cherries but thaw them
and chop them first.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.720
You can find the recipe at chefkendraseasycooking.com.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.529
We’re pouring everything in this pot except
the vanilla and cherries.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.120
We’re turning the heat to low.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.629
I like this technique because it removes the
whole tempering process of adding just a little

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.019
hot milk cream mixture to eggs then returning
everything to the pot step that’s often

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.260
associated with making ice cream.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.530
Once we have all the stuff in we’re going
to stir it from time and cook it until it

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.370
reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.989
It will thicken up some.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.679
Now we’ve got a strainer over a bowl and
we’re going to strain the ice cream base

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.190
so we’ll have a smooth Ice Cream.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.680
The reason we’re doing this so we can make
sure there is no egg yolk bits in out delicious

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.730
cherry ice cream base.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.939
Next we’re going to cover the bowl with
plastic wrap and let it chill in the refrigerator

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.590
for a couple of hours.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:23.219
Now we’re going to add our vanilla extract
to our base and stir that in, the last thing

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.679
that goes in is our glorious summer cherries.

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:32.259
If you’re using fresh cherries make sure
they’re very sweet.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.920
We have our ice cream maker ready.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.530
This is one of the best kitchen gadgets I
own.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.320
I’ve had it for years and it never let me
down.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.720
Anyway I put cylinder in and the top on.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:02:06.140
Nothing left to do but turn this baby on and
pour the ice cream in, just like so.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.610
Right around 20 minutes the ice cream is ready
to be moved to its freezer container.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.599
We’re going to shut of the ice cream maker,
remove the top, and the cylinder and have

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.090
our big spoon ready.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.459
Once it’s all in the freezer container we’re
going to put some plastic wrap right over

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.500
the top of the ice cream.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.610
Slap the top on this boy and slide it into
the freezer for 4 hours and then it’s ready

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.260
to stuff in face.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.640
Now it’s time to enjoy this tasty ice cream
guys, do you want a scope?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
Please share my videos.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.290
Alright that’s all for this week.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.560
I’ll see you next week Chef Kendra is out.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.459
Peace.
