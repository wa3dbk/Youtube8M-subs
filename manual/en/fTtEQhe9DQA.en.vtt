00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:07.310
Here we are in step number eight of the single
box braids style and that I will show you

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.680
how to safely take down and remove your single
braid extensions to begin you want to make

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.960
sure that you have a pair of hair cutting
scissors to help the ends of your braids have

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.590
been sealed by water you can go ahead and
take them down by hand and also use a pair

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.599
scissors to help you do so also if you sealed
the ends of your braids with a braid sealer

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.049
and I must that you at least cut off the melting
and at the bottom of your braid to help you

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:44.010
take down your hair to begin I'll show you
how to take a braids down with scissors since

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.130
the end of my braids have been sealed with
a braid sealer to begin taking down your single

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.530
braid extensions you can simply to start taking
them down right away if in fact they had been

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.620
sealed by hot water this is my braids have
been sealed with a braid sealer I have to

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.020
at least try off the sealed ends of the braids
so for example I will take one of my braids

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.390
and show you how to remove your braid so you
simply want to make sure that you have your

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:22.540
scissors and you trim off the melted end of
your braid to take down your hair 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.960
once you have cut the end of your braid you
could simply continue to take the braid down

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.390
by hand depending on how long or how short
your braids are will determine how long it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.520
will actually take you to remove your braids
my braids are extremely long so if I want

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.310
to I can just go ahead snip off the end and
take them down by hand or you can simply cut

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:53.240
up a little bit higher but you must be careful
so as you can see my braids here my hair is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.020
way shorter than what the braid length is
so if we go up to the top of my braids its

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.850
kind of difficult for me to see where my hair
is but I noticed that I have a few pieces

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.869
of hair that stick out so I would say at the
least my hair is probably about this long

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.069
even though I can see my hair.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.400
But to make sure that I do not cut my hair
out going to double this length and actually

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.620
cut a ways down to trim my weave this ensures
that you will not cut your hair in that you

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:31.270
cut a safe length so that you can take down
your braids so you are going to cut here and

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.840
this is optional you can simply just cut off
the bottom end alone or go up a little bit

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.760
of ways on the braid and cut the hair as well
so now at this point is going to take your

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:59.280
fingers in unravel your braid until you reach
the roots of your hair 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.480
so that once you reach the top sometimes it's
pretty easy to slide the hair out and then

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.910
you are finished 
so once again I will show you how easy it

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.040
is to remove your extensions I am going to
grab one of the braids in front of my head

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.060
and I'm going to scan to see how long my hair
is and I can see my hair sticking out I am

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.569
going to estimate and say that my hair is
this long then it going to take double the

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.680
length of that space go down the braid and
that's what I will trim just to be safe you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:04:00.720
are simply going to grab your braid and unravel
by hand until you reach the very top 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.660
taking down your braid extensions is an extremely
easy and simple process you can simply cut

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.819
off the melted ends of your braids or even
take down all of your braids by hand thank
