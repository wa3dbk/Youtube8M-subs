from work still real jacked about the
forum glad to see new members joining

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.020
still doing my video YouTube thing still
having some fun with this now that you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.609
guys are getting your game on with all
these plants I want to talk about

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.740
something I don't normally talk about I
want to talk about design ok I want to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.140
talk about design because I feel like
there's so much shit you can do that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.360
will just make your tank just hot with
with design so I'm going to talk about

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.899
it my daughter is playing with my shrimp
trap yeah there's no more shrimp in

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.120
there you can try to drink something but
there's not just dead shit that track by

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.920
the way caught 40 shrimp um so let's get
into design ok very very important I see

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.410
a lot of you rookies that are like
getting into it and they're like so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
close so I'm going to start with this
tank bear with me the ballast is out on

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.450
one side my boy called me on it you said
you start your tanks from left to right

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:17.840
he's right this tank starts lie goes
here down it ends here right this tank

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:27.180
left I mean to write this tank actually
add this tank sucks but left to right so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.369
with design you kind of want to have the
I directed it's very important like you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.130
need to have almost the centerpiece and
then it kind of place for it to kind of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.450
meander that's why I really really love
that that log that sexy piece of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.899
driftwood that you can hardly see now i
just really like the way that kind of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.920
just like swims through the tank if you
will I also I I want to call out a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.329
couple you guys you got your big plants
too close to the front I'm in this to 20

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.189
it works having these guys in the front
only because they're not full grown and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.600
I've got a little space so that creates
that depth this depth right here that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.950
you want to see this would look better
if this wasn't all against the glass I

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.120
would really trim that back
and I'd actually just hack it back to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.530
like here shit I should just do a
trimming and show you hack it back to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.720
hear let this baby tears kind of do its
thing and then over here hey honey over

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.860
here I want to have my life flatbed of
Crips so I don't want like big don't put

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.700
big plants in the front that screws it
all up big plants when the back little

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.680
plants go in the front and give yourself
some space to but you want to create a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.540
depth if you will like you want you want
depth so like this this blank space over

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.310
here is kind of done intentionally it
gives me a little room to like show how

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.709
far back the tank goes um the big swords
obviously help and then I've got

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.580
something to give height you know like
this tank over here you can see how the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.560
Amazon excuse me a bourbon how the dama
jungle Val I mean if you can't make a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.310
tackle a good with jungle Val you got
problems but like the jungle Val like

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.190
gives this the 90th hike that it has and
so that's kind of important i also i

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.440
have the Amazon sword intentionally put
over here so it kind of like pulls the I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.940
in from over here so they've got like
that that's actually a little I don't

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.890
know what I'm gonna do there with the AH
Cardinal Louis or whatever but that's

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.180
just some talk on design I really think
that you know with proper design you

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.750
guys can really do well let another
example creating depth see how there's

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.780
like a like a hole in that that's
intentional that makes it look like

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.100
further back if I put something in there
it would kind of ruin the effect so I

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.209
don't I don't do that up here you're
gonna I haven't aquascape this i don't

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.299
even are you doing nowa my daughter's
better grab the steps um you know big

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.519
plants in the back the mat the
Madagascar lace you know shorter ones in

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.910
the front these crypts are doing so well
good um same deal down here in the 50-50

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.600
which I'm gonna do a pull video on low
shit in the front hall shit in the back

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.959
and uh yeah so there we go tall stuff in
the back you know low in the front gives

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.820
it that effect oh fuck my daughter's
about the fall um so yeah no sorry for

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.610
swearing
so yeah that's a little bit on design

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.210
though I wanted to kind of talk about
design I think it's not you guys are

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.420
growing plants like crazy you got to get
the designs going so that's it design

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.480
