[PAIGE] Hi I’m Paige with OneCall.com and
we’re going to be discussing the Canon A3100

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.890
Image Stabilized camera. This camera is very
compact it ould be very good to fit in even

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.130
the smallest of purses, in your pocket or
to take with you on vacation. The Canon A3100IS

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.210
is available in blue or red. This 12 megapixel
digital camera will help you capture very

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.199
large and detailed photos. Also with the smart
auto feature the camera will choose between

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.640
18 different scene modes, depending on the
lighting, the motion, the different faces

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.989
in the picture to make sure you’re getting
the best picture possible. It’ll really

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.949
help you look like a pro. When using Canon’s
new super vivid mode you’ll notice very

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.940
intense colors. The low light shooting mode
helps you to improve your image quality in

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.600
low light situations. The 28mm wide angle
zoom lens is great for capturing more from

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.200
the left to the right, and fitting more people
into those group photos. With the 4x optical

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.440
zoom you can really zoom in there and capture
a little bit more of those images that might

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.200
be just a little bit far away. If you’re
shooting without a tripod the optical image

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.170
stabilizer will help you reduce camera shake
so that you don’t end up with a blurry photo.
