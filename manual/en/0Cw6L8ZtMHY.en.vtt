Hi! My name is Tina Buechler from Business
Growth Training, and I’m here today on behalf

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.179
of expertvillage.com. In this clip, I wan
to talk about optional sections that you can

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:16.279
have on your resume. Whether you choose functional
or chronological, these are parts that you

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.210
can include in your resume, but the key thing
that you need to think about is if I include

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.900
these other optional sections, are they marketing
me to my goal. You might have a volunteer

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.759
section. If you do extensive volunteer work,
you might want to include volunteer work that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.339
you’ve done. Some companies prefer to hire
people that are community minded. So, that

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.640
might be a section that you would like to
include. Hobbies, you might want to include

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.140
that. Interests could be included as well.
Sometimes you might want to include things

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.260
such as affiliations. If you are certified
human resource professional, you might want

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.440
to indicate that you are part of that recognized
organization. If you’re an engineer, something

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.010
like that, you want to indicate what kinds
of organizations that you are affiliated,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.800
because that’s part of your professional
development, it would be a valuable asset

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.370
on your resume. Another optional section is
to say references. Now, your references don’t

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.350
go on your resume, that is a separate document,
but you might want to include a statement

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.170
that says references are available upon request.
Most of us know that indeed, if I ask for

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.360
references, that you will provide them to
me. However, for some areas it is a good part

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.660
to include that references are available,
and you can also say references and documents

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.320
are available upon request, so that if an
employer knows that you are prepared to supply

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.600
those document to them. So, again to recap,
you can have some additional sections on your

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.130
resume, you’re trying to keep the resume
to 2 pages. If you have some space and if

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.840
it’s going to market you to your goal, you
might want to include things such as affiliations,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.420
volunteer experience, interests, and hobbies.
They can help you or if you put the wrongs

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420
on be careful they can hinder you.
