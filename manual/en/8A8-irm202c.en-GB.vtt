00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.200
Rob:
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.590
Rob

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.900
Neil:
and I'm Neil. Hello.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.940
Rob:
Hello, Neil, and what a glorious sunny day

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.869
it is today. Not a cloud in the sky! Spring
is definitely here! Now, Neil, you're a bit

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.259
of a sun worshipper, aren't you? You like
sunbathing...

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.360
Neil:
I do indeed! I love sitting in my deckchair

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.680
in the garden, catching some rays...

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.230
Rob:
Hmm, yes, you look a bit orange actually.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.190
Are you sure that tan's not fake?

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.430
Neil:
Very cheeky, Rob, very cheeky...

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.250
Rob:
Now the reason I mentioned sunbathing is because

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.270
we're discussing the sun in this programme.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.140
Neil:
Yes, that's right. The sun is our nearest

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.120
star ─ although it's a staggering 150 million
kilometres away. Earth is one of nine planets

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.620
that orbit ─ or circle around ─ the sun.
And life on Earth couldn't exist without its

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.329
warmth and light.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.969
Rob:
And we should mention... The sun is absolutely

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.089
massive. Its volume is so large you could
fit a million Earths inside it.

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.449
Neil:
That's amazing! It's also incredibly hot.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.230
Hotter than anything you could imagine.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.300
Rob:
So Neil, can you answer this question: How

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.400
hot is the surface of the sun? Now I'll help
you out by telling you that the sun's core

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.870
─ that's the centre ─ is a blistering
five million degrees Celsius. But how hot

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.550
is the sun's surface? Is it...

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.000
a) 1.5 billion degrees Celsius
b) 1.5 million degrees Celsius or

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.220
c) 5500 degrees Celsius

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.640
Neil:
Hmm. I have no idea. They all sound quite

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.640
warm to me. But ... I think it must be a bit
cooler than the core. So I'm going to go for

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.800
1.5 million degrees.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.360
Rob:
Okay. Well, we'll find out if you're right

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.660
or wrong later on. But now let's listen to
Professor of Solar Physics Louise Harra to

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.120
discover what the sun is made of.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.630
Louise Harra:
It's just a big ball of gas. And we measure

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.750
it... it's made mostly of hydrogen. So it's
roughly

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.970
90% hydrogen, it's maybe 8% helium, and the
rest of it's made up of things like iron,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.340
carbon, oxygen, nickel.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.660
Neil:
So the main gas is hydrogen, which accounts

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.540
for 90% of the sun's matter. Now, 'matter'
means what something is made of.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.400
Rob:
And hydrogen creates all the sun's energy.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.160
Heat and light energy is created all the time
in the sun's core as a result of gas explosions

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.140
or nuclear reactions. And this bit is hard
to believe ─ it takes a hundred thousand

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.750
years for this light energy to travel from
the sun's core to the sun's surface.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.209
Neil:
But once it reaches the sun's surface ─ the

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.890
photosphere ─ it can escape. In fact, it
takes only eight minutes for light energy

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.500
from the sun to reach the Earth. Scientists
these days are able to see the photosphere

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.910
in fantastic detail using powerful telescopes.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.950
Rob:
Though Galileo observed dark spots on the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.440
sun through his telescope several hundred
years ago, didn't he? Which brings us on to

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.300
another question: How old is the sun?

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.599
Neil:
Well, I happen to know that it came into being

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.360
around four and a half billion years ago.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.830
Rob:
Did you study solar physics at university,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.090
Neil?

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.349
Neil:
No, just... you know, just general knowledge.

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.840
Rob:
Well, the sun came into being ─ or was created

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.790
─ a very long time ago! We're going to hear
now from Professor of Physics, Yvonne Elseworth.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.370
What does she say about how long the sun is
going to stay the same?

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.630
Yvonne Elseworth:
In terms of its current lifestyle it's here

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.430
for as long again, so we're about half way
through. And then it becomes a different sort

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.890
of star ─ it becomes a giant star and that's
probably curtains for us, actually. It'll

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.860
get a bit warm, a bit toasty, and we'll get
enveloped in the sun, and it won't be nice...

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.050
Neil:
So the sun is going to stay the same for another

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:09.040
four and a half billion years. But the professor
also says that the sun will change. When it

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.250
becomes a giant star, it will be curtains
for our planet ─ and 'curtains' means the

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.269
end, I'm afraid!

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.650
Rob:
Yes, it does. And as a giant star, the sun

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.830
will get hotter ─ it will make the Earth
toasty. Now, toasty usually means hot in a

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.620
nice way.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.730
Neil:
That's right ─ for example, my toes are

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.770
warm and toasty in my new slippers. But in
reality the giant sun will make the Earth

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.180
unbearably hot. It will surround ─ or envelop
─ our planet and burn it up.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.630
Rob:
Well, I'm glad we're not going to be around

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.080
when that happens. Now, remember at the beginning
of the show I asked you how hot is the sun's

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:59.240
surface? Is it a) 1.5 billion b) 1.5 million
or c) 5500 degrees Celsius?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.160
Neil:
And I said 1.5 million...

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.240
Rob:
It's way too hot, I'm afraid you were wrong.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.960
The answer is actually 5500 degrees Celsius.
But still, if you're planning on visiting

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.830
the sun, remember to take your sunglasses
and plenty of sunscreen! Now, before we go,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.670
it's time to remind ourselves of some of the
vocabulary that we've heard today. Neil.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:38.410
Neil:
orbit, massive, core, energy, matter, photosphere,

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:49.420
come into being, curtains for something, toasty,
envelop

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.240
Rob:
Thanks. Well, that brings us to the end of

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.170
today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed
today's programme. Please join us again soon.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.770
Bye bye.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.110
Neil:
Bye.
