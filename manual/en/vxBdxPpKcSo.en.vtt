00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.099
Dear Emilio, welcome back.

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.659
Please call Michael Doven

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.310
and say that I figured out
on the way home, in the car at 3 am ...

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.810
Please look for my notebook ...

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.490
Do not let anyone in here, 
unless you're here. If someone has to ...

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.010
For thirty years I worked for him,
with him

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.010
in his office, on locations, 
in his house, inside his apartment.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.810
treat it very, very carefully ...

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.699
I drove him, I took him to the studios,
I took his actors to meet him

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.290
I took his daughters to school,
I took care of his cats and dogs,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.590
I took his wife to art galleries
and his parents around London.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.010
This is the last email pick up. 
I am very sad.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.900
I did so many things,
met so many people.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.050
Everyday it was something different

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.710
something new.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.600
He was my employer

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.040
but he was also my university.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.090
I couldn't have gotten through it without you.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.090
He was my friend.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.460
He was really like a father.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.630
Dear Emilio, good luck.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.790
I will miss you. Love, Stanley.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.670
He was Stanley,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.540
Stanley Kubrick.
