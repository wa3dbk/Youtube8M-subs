00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.230
Hello, my name is Jeffrey, and I work with
Hobie.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.030
We're in the Hobie booth at ICAST and what
we're looking at is the Hobie Mirage Pro Angler

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.030
12.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.670
It's the boat that won Best Boat at ICAST,
and it also won Best of Show.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.800
It's a boat where we had a 14 foot version
of this boat a couple years ago, so the 12

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800
footer is new.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.170
It has a couple new features, but what it
shares with a lot of our other kayaks and

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.000
the Mirage Pro Angler 14 is it's a pedal-driven
boat, so I'll pop this drive out.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.650
What this is, this is a Mirage Drive and it
is a foot-propelled propulsion system.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.280
So you're peddling along, these are like a
fish's fin, so when you're in shallow water

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.470
they're right up against the bottom of the
boat, and when you're peddling along it propels

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.870
you really efficiently and now your hands
are free.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.649
So what this boat offers is it offers foot
propulsion, a lot of stability, a ton of storage

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.040
space and a lot of comfort.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.000
The storage space we'll start with, a huge
front hatch.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.460
Back behind the seat there is a really big
cargo area.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.830
A lot of accessories that we sell that can
go back there or any fishing tackle you want

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.400
to put back here.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.010
The boat's really nice and wide.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.460
You can actually stand up on the Mirage Pro
Anglers.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.090
This whole area up in front is all standing
room.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.780
There's a center hatch right here that opens
up and it presents some Plano tackle storage,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.690
a little mesh gear spot for pliers or any
little goodies that you want to put in there.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.000
This is called the Vantage Seat, and what
the seat is it's a 3D mesh so it's really

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
nice and comfortable.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.990
It has integrated arm rests, and it's completely
adjustable.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.520
So what we did, this is sitting now in its
low position.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.229
If we want to lift this seat up, we actually
just lift up on the back, and we've just lifted

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.619
the back of the seat about five inches.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.670
These adjusters integrated into the armrest
actually can adjust and bring your seat bottom

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.860
up, your seat back, you can bring it forward
more or put it back.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.400
Right back here we have a Boa system.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.050
So a lot of shoes have had these, some boots
have had these.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.900
I can actually tighten this up, and I can
change the lumbar, so it's real nice and soft

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.980
right now and if I want to add some tension
I just tighten down that Boa and it adds a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.239
bunch of lumbar support to the back of the
seat.

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.380
So now we're up and high.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.720
It changes the angle of how you can peddle.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.180
You can see out in front of the boat.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.890
If you're sight fishing, if you're going to
be standing up a lot, it's nice to have the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.890
seat in this position.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.800
You can get up and down a lot easier.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.980
The steering on the boat is actually on this
handle, and you can see as I move it, on the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.739
other side of the boat, there's also a second
steering control, so I can switch the handle

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.430
to either side of the boat and make adjustments
with the rudder that's in the back.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.240
Other than that, on the bottom of the boat,
what we did to try to make it easier if you're

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.950
going to be installing a fish finder, this
is, if we were to flip the boat over, integrated

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.260
into the bottom.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.380
So it's a Lowrance ready transducer mount.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.130
We mount our transducer in here, and it's
actually going to be safe so you're going

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.739
to be able to ride the boat right up on the
beach or anything.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.440
It's not going to hurt the transducer and
it's going to be in the water, so it's going

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.360
to get temperature readings, and it's going
to make the install of your transducer a lot

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.360
easier.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.640
This is going to come up, and we have these
neat little fittings, so no longer do you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.290
have to drill holes in the boat to mount the
transducer.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.569
When you bring your transducer up, these big
mounting boards on the side of the boat are

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.659
what you're going to be screwing it into,
so any other rod holders that you want to

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.820
put on the boat, any fish finders or GPS's
just get mounted onto these boards and they're

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.920
a sacrificial board, so if you make a mistake
or if you want to change your setup a little

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.800
bit later, you can just buy new boards and
it's no holes in your boat.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.690
Then when we take a look down here, we see
also our horizontal rod storage, and I can

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.390
pop open this front hatch, and you can see
the large front hatch, and there's a little

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.470
bucket in here that you can take out.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.000
You can see the horizontal rod tubes that
come all the way forward and protect your

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.150
rods.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.000
One of the other features that this boat has
that's new for this year is if you want to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.049
run an anchor trolley kit down the side of
the boat, on both sides, front and back there

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.620
are integrated, molded in inserts.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.090
So when you install your anchor trolley kit,
there's no holes to drill or anything.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.999
You just screw the blocks right into the boat
and it's ready to go and it should make the

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.499
installation a lot easier.

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.210
I think that's about it.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.360
Thanks for stopping by and checking out the
Hobie Mirage Pro Angler 12.
