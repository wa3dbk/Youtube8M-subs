00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.480
Insect pollinators are really important for
food security their contribution to the production

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.360
of lots of different crops like oil seed rape,
strawberries, field beans is crucial and actually

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.129
in the UK insect pollination services has
been valued at in excess of £430 million

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.850
pounds per year.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.610
In our first study we were trying to measure
the contribution of insect pollinators to

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.560
apple production in the UK.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.499
We know that insects are important for production
of apples they enable pollination of apples

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:38.260
flowers but what we don't know is the value
of this insect pollution to the UK apple production.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.600
The results of the study showed that we are
also able to value insect pollination to the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.449
production of Gala and Cox apples and actually
we showed that insect pollination is worth

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.829
over £36 million to these two varieties alone.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.609
We also showed that currently the pollination
demands of some of our apple varieties Gala,

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:02.149
for example, are not currently being met by
pollination services in our orchards so these

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.330
varieties in particular would benefit from
pollinator management to improve apple production

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.980
and apple quality.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.770
Another study we have been doing is looking
at trying to identify which pollinators are

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.090
really important for the pollination of oil
seed rape and field beans which are two really

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.340
important UK crops.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.152
Our research has shown your management needs
to be targeted to those pollinators that are

00:01:24.152 --> 00:01:29.520
going to be effective pollinators of these
crops for example to improve pollination of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.010
beans you might want to manage bumble bee
abundance and diversity in the field for oil

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.540
seed they are pollinated by a diverse community
of pollinators.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.520
The third project we have been conducting
at Reading has been looking at the contribution

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.280
of honey bees or the potential contribution
of honey bees to providing pollination services

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.420
to crops and we have explored this over 41
countries including the UK and all of the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.820
EU and found that in 22 of them there were
insufficient honey bee stocks to actually

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.640
pollinate all these crops.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.370
If honey bees were to be the only pollinator
of crops in the UK we would need another 1

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:21.450
million colonies in the UK alone and the UK
is second only to Moldova in its short fall

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.760
we only have around a quarter of the honey
bees in this country that we would need to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.300
provide pollution services to all our crops
and most of this has been exacerbated by the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.060
expansion of oil seed rape particularly in
the last 5 years with the introduction of

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.080
EU biofuel policies which are greatly increased
demand for the crop both in the UK and across

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.290
Europe.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.100
So the take home of all of this is that honey
bees alone are not sufficient to provide pollination

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.459
services in the UK and in several other countries
across Europe and we do need this diversity

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.310
of pollinators to provide services not only
service delivery but service security as well

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.450
in to the long term.
