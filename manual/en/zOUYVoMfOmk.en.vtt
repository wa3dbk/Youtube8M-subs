00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:03.900
The President:
 I want to welcome these 
extraordinary business leaders

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.100
who are here
today in support

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.266
of comprehensive
immigration reform.

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.300
As all of you know,
we are at a critical point

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.400
in the debate that's
taking place in the Senate.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.367
All of these business leaders 
recognize the degree

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:22.333
to which immigration
is a contributor to growth,

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:26.400
a contributor to expansion,
a creator of jobs,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.600
but they also recognize
that the immigration system

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.967
that we currently
have is broken.

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:35.433
We have a system in which we
bring outstanding young people

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:38.600
from all across the world
to educate them here,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.033
and unfortunately,
too often,

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.333
we send them right back

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.300
so that they can start companies
or help to grow companies

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.300
somewhere else instead of here.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.066
We have a situation
in which millions

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.934
of individuals are in
the shadow economy,

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:56.033
oftentimes exploited
at lower wages,

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.934
and that hurts those companies
that are following the rules,

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:02.300
because they end up
being at a disadvantage

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.467
to some of these
less scrupulous companies.

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:08.734
And so, all of us
I think recognize

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:09.967
that now is the time

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:12.633
to get comprehensive
immigration reform done --

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:17.133
one that involves having
very strong border security;

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.467
that makes sure that we're
holding employers accountable

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:21.600
to follow the rules;

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.967
one that provides
earned citizenship

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:25.433
for those 11 million,

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:27.600
so that they have
to pay back taxes,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.734
pay a fine, learn English,

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:32.533
follow the rules,
get to the back of the line,

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:36.867
but ultimately can be part
of the above-board economy,

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:41.133
as opposed to
the below-board economy;

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.467
and a system that fixes
and cleans up

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:46.066
our legal immigration system
so that we can continue

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.633
to be a nation of laws
and a nation of immigrants.

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:50.700
The good news is,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.734
is that we've got
a strong bipartisan bill

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:54.567
that meets many
of those principles.

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:57.633
As I've said before,
it's not a bill that represents

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:59.567
everything that
I would like to see;

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:01.533
it represents a compromise.

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:02.767
And I think all the
business leaders here

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:04.934
recognize that there
are elements of it

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:07.200
that they might want to tweak
one way or another.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.667
But it does adhere
to the core principles

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:15.233
that we need for comprehensive
immigration reform,

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:18.633
and now is the
time to do it.

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:21.600
Just this past week,
the Congressional Budget Office

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.367
noted that this would
end up bringing more money

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:27.300
into the federal government.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.700
It would reduce our deficits --

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.033
people would be paying taxes.

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:34.533
It would end up
strengthening our economy,

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.333
growing our economy.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.667
And so you've got
a broad consensus

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:41.100
all throughout the country,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.633
not just business leaders 
who are represented here today --

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:45.567
many of whom are
immigrants themselves,

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:47.367
many of whom started businesses

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:51.166
and are now creating opportunity
all across the country --

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:52.800
but we're also
seeing labor leaders,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.867
we're seeing clergy,

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:57.700
we're seeing people from
all different walks of life

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.600
saying now is the
time to get this done.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.433
So I very much appreciate
all the business leaders

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.166
who are here for
making this push.

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:08.867
I know they're going to be
talking to various senators

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:12.433
and members of Congress
over the next several days.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:16.433
I would urge the Senate to
bring this to the floor,

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:19.400
and I hope that we can get
the strongest possible vote

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.834
out of the Senate so
that we can then move

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:25.734
to the House and get this
done before the summer break.

00:03:25.734 --> 00:03:29.367
And if we get this done --
when we get this done --

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.100
I think every business leader
here feels confident

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.066
that they'll be in
a stronger position

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:37.100
to continue to innovate,
to continue to invest,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.133
to continue to create jobs,

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:41.767
and ensure that this
continues to be

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:45.433
the land of opportunity
for generations to come.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.367
So thank you very much to
all of you for being here.

00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:52.500
And thank you
guys in the press.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.667
The Press:
-- Putin, and are
you confident

00:03:56.667 --> 00:04:01.233
that they'll expel --
he'll be expelled?

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:02.367
The President:
What we know is,

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.633
is that we're following

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:05.900
all of the appropriate
legal channels,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.767
and working with various
other countries to make sure

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:11.467
that rule of law is observed.

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:14.266
And beyond that, I'll refer
to the Justice Department

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:17.633
that has been actively
involved in the case.

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:18.734
Thank you, guys.
