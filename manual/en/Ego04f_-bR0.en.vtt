Hey everybody, Mike Linville
here with Black Dog Education with this week's

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.440
installment of Office Hours where we answer
your questions about web design web development

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.650
and online marketing. This week's question
comes Dean, and Dean writes, Mike I've been

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.199
working with WordPress for quite some time
and the more I play with the site the slower

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.650
my site seems to get what can I do to speed
my site back up? Great question actually because

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.070
page load times are important and we should
be paying attention the them. Slow sites not

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.820
only aggravate your visitors but are also
bad for search engine because search engines

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.000
page load times as part of their search engine
rank algorithms so you know when we talk about

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.850
slow page load time really what we' re talking
about - inefficiencies in an inefficiency

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.850
at the server level or an efficiency at your
website level so with the server level especially

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.990
if you're on a shared hosting environment
which most people are, BlueHost, Go Daddy

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.170
or HostGator, one of those are more difficult
to troubleshoot you really need somebody who's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.090
got a decent level of experience as a programmer.
Those types of issues are usually more expensive

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.350
so we're not going to talk about those right
now what we're really going to talk about

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.950
or talk about page efficiency and the reason
we're going to talk about page efficiencies

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.590
or page inefficiencies, is because they're
easy to find. Relatively easiest to fix and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.200
simple to take care without any extra tools
or experiences okay. So there are a lot of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.200
different places your website can become start
leaking performance is your Plugins. Now whenever

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.030
you load a plugin, you know and these are
these fantastic little program that help to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.670
extend WordPress right. We love them. But
when you load a plug-in what is happening

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.090
is not just the script itself is loaded there's
also template files, images there could be

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.909
JavaScript calls and sorts of other resources
so the more that you have of those the more

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.569
it takes away from your server's page load
time. So if you've got plugins on your website

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.180
which are not actually using not only do you
want to deactivate, you want to deactivate

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.019
them and delete. The second thing we want
to talk about is the images. When we talk

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:27.480
about images we want to do is make sure they're
properly sized, saved, and scaled. So when

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.970
we say properly sized what that means we want
to use images for the web that are 72 dpi

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.040
dot per inch. Let's say for example you have
a logo that you got from your printer. Printers

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.420
use files that are at high resolution 300
dpi or above if you're using something like

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.200
that make sure you get a saved down version
of it okay? Now properly saved, we want to

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.629
make sure we're using the proper format. Whether
it's a Gif, whether it's a JPEG, whether it's

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.090
a PNG those are typically going to be your
top 3. But you want to make sure that you're

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.870
saving it out properly because that can really
help with your file size. And the last thing

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.849
is that you want to make sure to scale properly
right. If you have a picture that's really

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.290
large if you load it to your website you've
got to wait for that entire picture to load

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.409
and then crunch it down into the space that
you had given it just load up a small image.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.409
It's going to make for a faster load time.
Now the third thing we're going to talk about

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:25.409
is excess content. Any time your website or
webpage displays information that's not necessarily

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.159
associated with the post or the pages you
save in WordPress it's got to make a request

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.920
to get the information. It could be requesting
your own database so for example if you want

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.010
to pull latest blog posts or show the users
out of your database or something like that,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.810
or it could be a third-party requester like
if you have a Twitter feed or LinkedIn, or

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.590
Facebook or something like that. No matter
where it's coming from every time you make

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.109
one of those requests your server slow down
a little, your page load time goes up a little

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.930
bit with each request that but if you start
getting like 10 or 15 different feeds loading

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.249
into a page, let's be honest. First of all
the site's going to look bad, it's just way

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:10.489
to much going on. Your conversion ratios are
going to be really really low because a confused

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.579
mind always says no in marketing. And the
last thing is your page load times are going

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.810
to way up, that's bad for search engine optimization.
So this is what I would suggest, and Dean

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.970
I didn't take at look at your website so I
don't know if that's your situation. Make

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.410
sure you sit down with a professional developer
and talk to them about your site and what

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.840
you want it to do and they can help you map
out the flow or how your content should laid

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.880
out in a proper format. So Dean that's all
we've got for you. I hope this has served

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.319
you, again this is Mike Linville from Black
Dog Education I want to say thank you for

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:46.590
hanging out with us today, now it's your turn.
What I want to know is, what's the number

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.180
1 thing on your site you feel is slowing you
down?
