OH, DARLING, PLEASE.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.740
JUST RELAX.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.559
I CAN'T RELAX, MOTHER.

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:08.710
MY--MY WORLDS

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.710

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.710
I'M NOT--

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.710
I CAN'T RELAX.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.050
WELL, HAVE A GLASS OF WINE.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.050

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.570
I BET THERE OUT THERE

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.570
RIGHT NOW,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.570
JUST TELLING SECRETS

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.570

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.570
BOOM.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.570
WHAT DO I DO?

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.570
SHOULD I CALL THEM?

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
I SHOULD CALL THEM.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.570
NO, NO, NO.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.570
WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.570
WAS LET MEREDITH STAY HERE

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.570
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.590
THIS ISN'T A FLOPHOUSE,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.590
DARLING.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.590
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP LETTING

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.439
FREELOADERS JUST LIVE HERE.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.439
PLEASE TELL ME

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.439
YOU SEE THE IRONY.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:34.439
(door opens)

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:35.439
MY GOD, MEREDITH.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:36.439
CASTLE DID THAT?

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:37.539
I CAN'T BELIEVE

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:38.780
THAT YOU MARRIED HIM.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.780
WHAT CAN'T YOU BELIEVE?

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.780
WHAT?

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.780
NO.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.780
WHAT?

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.780
NO.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.780
COME ON.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.780
BECKETT, THERE'S TWO SIDES

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.780
TO THAT STORY.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.780
THAT--WHAT DID YOU--WHAT

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.780
STORY--WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.780
THE TRUTH, RICHARD.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.780
CASTLE, YOU'RE NOT THE MAN

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.780
THAT I THOUGHT I KNEW.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.780
I'M THE MAN

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.780
YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.780
I'M THE MAN YOU KNOW.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.780
I THOUGHT YOU--

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.780
I'M THAT--YOU THINK--

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.780
I KNOW YOU.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.780
I'M HIM.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.780
(both laughing)

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.780
THIS IS SO NOT COOL.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.780
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.780
HE DOES LEAN TO THE LEFT.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.780
TOLD YA.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.780
ONLY WHEN HE'S STRESSED.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.780
I'VE NEVER EVEN

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.780
NOTICED THAT BEFORE.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.780
WHAT?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.780
D--WHAT LEANS?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.780
THANK YOU, MEREDITH.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.780
THAT WAS SO FUN.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.780
MM.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.780
THANKS FOR COMING.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.780
YOU HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.780
GOOD NIGHT, MARTHA.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.780
GOOD NIGHT, DARLING.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.780
(laughs)

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.780
OKAY.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.780
WHAT DID SHE SAY

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.780
ABOUT ME?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.829
OH, COME ON.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:21.829
I GET IT.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:22.829
I GET IT.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:23.829
I MISHANDLED THIS WHOLE THING,

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:24.829
AND I AM SORRY.

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.590
BELIEVE ME, I AM SORRY.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.609
PLEASE TELL ME

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:29.899
WHAT MEREDITH SAID.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.909
IS IT ANYTHING I NEED

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.270
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT?

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.270
(laughs)

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.270
YOU KNOW WHAT, CASTLE?

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.270
AS MUCH AS FUN AS IT WOULD BE

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.270
TO CONTINUE TORTURING YOU,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.270
I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.450
A LITTLE BIT MORE NOW.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.450
YOU DO?

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.450
MM-HMM.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.450
YEAH.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.450
MEREDITH IS A FUN,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.450
DYNAMIC,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.450
AND HARD-TO-SAY-NO-TO WOMAN.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.450
BUT...

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.450
AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.450
SHE NEVER STAYS HERE AGAIN.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.469
THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:51.890
OKAY.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.149
(cell phone ringing)

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.569
MM.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.040
LET IT GO

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040
TO VOICE MAIL.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040
OKAY.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.040
MM.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.040
MM-HMM.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040
OH, IT'S THE PRECINCT.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040
(beeps)

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040
WHAT?

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.040
BECKETT.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.040
(Ryan) Hey, I just got off

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.040
with the D.E.A.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.040
YOU NEED TO GET DOWN HERE

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.040
RIGHT NOW.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.040
YEAH, OKAY.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.044
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
