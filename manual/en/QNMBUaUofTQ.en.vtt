Hi, my name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
Expert Village. In these clips we're going

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:13.599
to talk about the proper way to inspect and
adjust your drum style rear brakes. In this

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:22.160
clip we're going to talk about the re-installation
of the brake drum and pre-adjustment. You

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.060
can have a brake drum machine for about $10
to $20 apiece at you local repair facility.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.590
The ones local around here in Michigan would
be a Lintz, a Midas, Tuffy or another service

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.280
center like that. I would recommend going
to shop that specializes in brakes. They're

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.050
going to be cheaper than going to a dealership.
When I talk about pre-adjustment the adjustment

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.160
is actually made here in the back (and is
a little difficult to do but it is possible.)

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.360
You just have to lay on your back, pull a
rubber plug out and use a screwdriver to do

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.230
it. In order to avoid laying on my back for
an extended period of time what I'm going

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.630
to do: I'm going to slip my drum on, feel
how snug it is, and make an adjustment to

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:20.270
get it pretty close to where I want it. The
proper adjustment is the amount of force it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.530
takes to spin the drum with the tire on it.
That should make it on revolution. As you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.140
can see this is real loose. We're looking
for a light drag. So what I'm going to do

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.860
is I'm going to slip my drum off and turn
my star wheel. This is the star wheel right

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:51.020
here. Take my side cuts or dice and give it
a couple of clicks.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.770
What I'm doing is making a manual adjustment
to close the distance between the shoe and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:17.930
my drum surface [so I don't have to close
the distance with my brake pedal.] Not quite

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:40.020
there yet. Go ahead and do a little more pre-adjustment.
We're getting close. That's pretty close right

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.050
there. That is the proper way to pre-adjust
and install your brake drum.
