00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.813
Launching aboard the four-stage Taurus XL rocket, NASA's Glory spacecraft will take its place among a

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.113
series of Earth-observing satellites collectively called the "A-Train."

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.066
Once in orbit, Glory will study the effect of aerosols on our planet's energy budget.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.110
Both the Taurus launch vehicle and the Glory spacecraft were built by Orbital Sciences Corporation and

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.310
prepared for launch at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.256
The spacecraft arrived Jan. 11, 2011, at the Astrotech Payload Processing Facility for final processing

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.953
and prelaunch checkout.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.866
Soon after, its protective covers were removed and its solar arrays were inspected... and tested.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.010
Then, Glory was enclosed in the rounded payload fairing that will keep it safe

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.343
during the critical climb to orbit.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.253
A small deployer called P-POD is hitching a ride into space along with Glory,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.626
mounted on the Taurus rocket's third stage.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.886
Tucked into the P-POD are the ELaNa CubeSats, three tiny satellites

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.893
built by college and university students.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.743
While the mission's payloads were being prepared for flight, the all-solid-fuel Taurus XL vehicle was

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.843
coming together at Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 576-E.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.450
The vehicle's three upper sections -- stages 1, 2 and 3 -- were joined together and transported to the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.396
launch site for final assembly.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.886
But first, technicians carefully guided the rocket's ignition stage, known as Stage 0, down onto its

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.220
launch mount and bolted it in place.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.756
Next came the Interstage, a structural adapter between the Stage 1 and wider Stage 0 sections.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.886
On Feb. 15, 2011, the payload fairing was added to the third stage,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.896
and the entire upper stack was installed...

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.790
...leaving the Taurus XL rocket and the Glory spacecraft ready for final testing and liftoff.
