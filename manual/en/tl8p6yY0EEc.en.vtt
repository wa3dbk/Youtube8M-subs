Bathtub Refinishing Hi Iím Paul Burns with Porcelain Tub Restorations
at BathRenovationHQ.com, We here at our shop

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.130
at Tub Potion labs. Were we develop equipment,
products and coatings for this industry. Today

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.789
weíre going to take a look a three issue
you might be interested in. First is MECHANICAL

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.150
and CHEMICAL ADHESION ñ then weíre going
to take a look at the performance of these

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.780
different products and weíre going to take
a look at the aesthetics qualities of these

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.080
products. So letís get started. When we talk
about mechanical adhesion, we are talking

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.599
about taking the gloss off. Getting it prepared
for adhesion and this tile has been de-etched

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.989
de-glossed and it now has nook and crannyís
to improve the performance of the coatings

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.809
having something to lock on to as the coating
tighten up and shrink as they cure it gives

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.329
them something to grab onto. Fiberglass acrylic
tubs can be abraded ñ etched with sandpaper,

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.159
whereas this canít touch it. You can hear
the difference in sound with the abraded tile.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.609
OK most refinishing contractors now a daysÖ
Etching used to be absolutely critical but

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:10.609
now we try or most contractor try and use
chemical adhesion to skip the step of etching.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.100
With some success and some not. Most use an
epoxy primer for the adhesion, some take it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.100
a step further by using a Silane the industry
regularly uses. This is a wipe on primer itís

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.090
a onetime use, put it on and throw it away.
Iím not a big fan of these because they gel

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.090
on contact with atmospheric moisture. And
the adhesion quality is so-so. After an extensive

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.750
search there are literally hundreds and hundreds
of Silanes available in the industry. These

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.430
were developed by the aerospace industry for
space vehicles so the coatings would stick

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.450
in space. After a lot of research we found
the Porsche of all Silanes in Germany. And

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.180
weíve added it to our line of TubPotion products.
Weíre going to take a look at the performance

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.180
issues today. Here we have a glazed tile that
represents a porcelain finish on a tub. This

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.409
is an epoxy coating an activated epoxy coating
with an activated polyurethane top coat. And

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:15.409
weíre going to take a look at the adhesion
qualities. Not very good, these were all shot

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.549
several days ago and aloud to cure. Now we
have one with a Silane applied thatís often

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.700
used in the industry. And Itís giving some
performance value. A little bit better than

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.560
the straight epoxy. Now weíre going to take
a look at TubPotion #8 on a glazed tile and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.760
this has a polyester bonding primer verses
the epoxy and it has a polyester topcoat,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.760
a very compatible system and Iím going to
show you that in a minute too. Pretty good.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.480
This is the same product with our TubPotion
#8, polyester bonding primer and polyester

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.480
topcoat on an etched tile. Just to show you
I havenít done anything to the razor bladesÖ

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:34.639
These are still quite sharp. Thatís the difference
in performance. This Silane is heads and tails

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:45.249
above the other Silanes on the market. The
performance value has greatly improved using

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.919
TubPotion #8 along with the polyester bonding
primer itís just incredible, so letís us

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:58.919
take a look at the aesthetics value. The one
on the right is the epoxy and you can see

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.650
the reflection off the lamp in the ceiling.
Look at the clarity difference when we go

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.650
to the polyester. Itís much cleaner, itís
much flatter and just a cleaner looking shine.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.970
Much more resembling the original porcelain.
As you can see the shine on the glazed tile

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.970
is equal to the shine on the coating. When
we going over here it becomes foggy and there

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.100
Best Bathtub Refinishing Company
on the glazed tile. So the epoxy- polyester

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.350
excuse me, polyurethanes just donít have
quite the same effect as the polyester does.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.350
So thatís the big difference in the quality
of the coatings. You get a much nicer look

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.790
and we get a much improved adhesion. So aesthetically
and performance wise, this is just a superior

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.790
product. Now take another look at why I donít
like epoxy- polyurethanes. Here we have our

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.970
polyester product. Iím going to add the primer
thatís been activated to the topcoat to show

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.400
its compatibility. This is an epoxy primer
activated, with the polyurethane topcoat activated.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:26.030
What happen is there not compatible with each
other. This is why I donít like to use them

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.030
for our coatings. The chemistry turns them
into jello. I just feel like itís a better

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:41.310
solution to stay within the same family of
coatings, as you can see this is still in

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:49.660
a liquid state. We achieved this by using
the same catalyst in all the products. This

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.120
is our polyester bonding primer tub potion
# 11. Then we go to our tubpotion #13 which

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.210
is a polyester porcelain white. We also have
the porcelain bone and we have a clear coat

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.190
which works great for hard water problems
with well water and such. All three are activated

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.220
with the same activator this is an aliphatic
activator high performance which keeps the

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.750
coatings from yellowing or changing color.
Along with our TubPotion #8 Silane itís a

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.930
knock out combination. So we really try and
give you a quality product here and itís

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:30.170
important to test and to prove to folks exactly
what it is your getting. OK I think thatís

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:37.170
about it, weíve covered performance issues,
adhesion issues. With our Silane and bonding

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.210
primer itís not necessary to etch, but we
still believe in giving you both types of

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.880
adhesion mechanical and chemical. Both of
these were just beautiful in the way they

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.490
performed and the way they look. So Thank
you much that about covers it. If you have

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.600
any question donít hesitate to contact us
here at Porcelain Tub Restorations, hey thanks

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.960
for watching. Best bathtub refinishing company bathtub reglazing contractor
