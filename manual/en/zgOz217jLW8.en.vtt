00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.959
You know one of the really fun things about
working at Crutchfield is playing around with

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.770
new stuff, and here we have the Pioneer AppRadio.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.940
It's the first car stereo designed specifically
to run iPhone apps, so let's take a look at

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.840
it.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.500
As you can see, there aren't very many buttons,
there's just a home key, kind of like the

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.090
home key on your iPhone and here you have
a nice prominent clock.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.820
You've got a built-in AM/FM tuner, you can
get into your iPod, you can play apps, of

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.860
course, and built-in Bluetooth for making
hands-free calls.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.390
It doesn't play CDs or DVDs.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.329
It doesn't have any other connections other
than for the iPhone, but that's really the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.380
point of this.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.720
It takes the apps from the iPhone and puts
them up here where you can interact with them

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.450
on the screen, right in your dash where you
want them.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.190
Pioneer has an AppRadio app that's free and
it takes the apps that AppRadio works with

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.770
and organizes them like so.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.950
There are some apps that are specially formatted
for AppRadio.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.299
Those give you touchscreen control over the
app right here on the screen.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.200
It will also work with other apps as you'll
see in a second.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.110
It will recommend apps for you that it works
with.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.650
We've got all the ones that it works with
right now installed.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.390
More apps will be added all the time.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.909
They're optimized for this screen too, so
they fill the screen and there's no weird

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.409
formatting or anything like that.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.680
So here we go with Pandora.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.670
And it brings Pandora right up there and you
can thumbs-up and thumbs-down just like you

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.299
do online.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.730
Nice big album art comes up and it's pretty
cool.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.270
It also works with MotionX-GPS Drive, which
for 99 cents, basically turns this into a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.110
navigation receiver.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.890
And MotionX actually, you can see the orientation
sensor on the iPhone effects the screen here,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.100
because it's really just mirroring what's
on the screen.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.770
A pretty good idea to get a mount to securely
mount your iPhone, somewhere where you can

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.330
reach it in your car.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.400
But this app is really cool.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.860
It has great search features, you can find
all kinds of stuff you want: gas stations,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.460
hospital, airports, places to eat.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.720
It's even got a coffee cup if you really need
a cup of coffee it'll find pretty quickly

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.629
find a lot of places for you to do that.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:45.980
AppRadio also gives you access to some of
your iPhone features such as Google Maps.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.933
You can get in there and use the touch screen
to interact with it, just like you would on

00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.330
your phone.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.040
You can get into your photo album.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.209
You can also check out your calendar.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.230
If you've got meetings coming up or anything
you wanted to remember that's in your calendar,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.470
there it is.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.599
You've got contacts you can go through there
and make phone calls right from the screen

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.599
here.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.580
It's pretty handy.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.849
Just by playing around, I was able to discover
that it works with Netflix steaming, of course

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.050
while you're parked, not while you're driving.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.500
But you can stream a Netflix movie from your
Netflix account through your iPhone right

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.020
up here onto your AppRadio screen.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.519
Also Youtube.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.860
Youtube videos look really great on the AppRadio
screen.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.959
Here we've got one of our product videos up
there and you can see it looks pretty good.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.959
So really, like your iPhone, it's a pretty
simple machine and no matter where you are,

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.540
just like an iPhone, tap the home button and
it will go back to the main menu.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.370
AppRadio seamlessly integrates your iPhone
with your dash.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.380
If you have any questions, give us a call.
