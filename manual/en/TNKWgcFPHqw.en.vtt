00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.330
DNA is a molecule made up of two strands

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.010
twisted around each other in a double
helix shape.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.039
Each strand is made up a sequence of four chemical bases

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.770
represented by the letters A, C, G and T.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.000
The two strands are complementary.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.800
This means that wherever there's a T
in one strand

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.300
there will be in an A in the opposite strand,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.330
and wherever there's a C

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.449
there will be a G in the other strand.

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.900
Each strand has a 5' end and a 3' end.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.260
The two strands run in opposite
directions.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.560
This determines how each strand of DNA is replicated.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.690
The first step in DNA replication is to separate the two strands.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.980
This unzipping is done by an enzyme
called helicase

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.000
and results in the formation of a
replication fork.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.470
The separated strands each provide a
template for creating a new strand of DNA.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.000
An enzyme called primase starts the
process.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.200
This enzyme makes a small piece of RNA

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.310
called a primer.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.210
This marks the starting point for the
construction of the new strand of DNA.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.120
An enzyme called DNA polymerase binds to the primer

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.109
and will make the new strand of DNA.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.600
DNA polymerase can only add DNA bases in one direction,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.500
from the 5' end to the 3' end.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.000
One of the new strands of DNA, the leading strand,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.400
is made continuously,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.600
the DNA polymerase adding bases one by one in the 5' to 3' direction.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.520
The other strand, the lagging strand,
cannot be made in this continuous way

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.640
because it runs in the opposite
direction

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.300
the DNA polymerase can therefore only
make this strand in a series of small chunks

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.000
called Okazaki fragments.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.000
Each fragment is started with an RNA primer.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.780
DNA polymerase then adds a short row of
DNA bases

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.000
in the 5' to 3' direction.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.000
The next primer is then added further
down the lagging strand.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.160
Another Okazaki fragment is then made and the process is repeated again.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.260
Once the new DNA has been made

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.000
the enzyme exonuclease removes all
the RNA primers from both strands of DNA.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.800
Another DNA polymerase enzyme then fills in the gaps that are left behind

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.800
with DNA.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.590
Finally the enzyme DNA ligase seals
up the fragments of DNA

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.000
in both strands to form a continuous
double strand.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.260
DNA replication is described as semi-
conservative

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.800
because each DNA molecule is made up
of one old, conserved strand of DNA

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.910
and one new one.
