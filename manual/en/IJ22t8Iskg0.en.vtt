00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.000
[off screen] Crew, can I have you guys silence your radios please...?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.000
[off screen] Now, we're not going to tell anybody who's in here. I think what we can do is think of

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.720
this is not Jesus. This is a person who died, but we're setting the tone of the day, the tone of this film....

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
Go ahead and pull all the barn doors out of it and kind of splash against that wall...

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.010
What we're doing today, and what we've done for the last couple of days

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.689
is do a special Chuck Knows Church

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.260
episode. Well, it was because we've garnered an incredible amount of people that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.300
appreciate

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.160
and love the series, we wanted to deliver
something special for Easter...

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.680
Okay, standby this is rehearsal! Camera rolling! 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.080
As you can see behind me, were in a graveyard so naturally one might assume

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.970
that we might be

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.059
addressing the the subjective death a
little bit, which we are.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.210
And how that pertains to Easter.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.739
Does death really have last word? Not going to tell you now,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.500
I'm going to let you watch the episode and find out. Alright, I'll give you a hint,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.729
yeah, death does not have the last word.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.000
Shhhhhh.....

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.000
Matthew, goes six inches to your left.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.200
Roll audio. Speed.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000
 Camera. Speed.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.430
Slate it. One delta, take three. [Slate slaps closed].

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.000
Why do we talk so much about death as Christians?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.540
The nature the word Easter

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.610
obviously is embedded in the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.120
word resurrection. So we're calling this
episode "Resurrection."

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.670
We're going to take the audience from that feeling of being on Good Friday and waiting for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.230
that third day to arrive.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.350
When the third day arrives Christ is
resurrected...

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.230
...we're gonna try to explore what that
would feel like.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.000
[rhythmic drums]

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.120
My roll on the Easter project,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.410
I am the band manager and drummer and
singer...

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.330
And then sax right here [hums]. All three of them.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.000
I composed along with band members.  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.170
Easter is about when Christ died for our sins 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.200
and then he rose.  

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.380
The first song, it was, you know, it's mainly about

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.950
someone just dying, someones loved ones, losing their loved ones.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.080
The first part of it we wanted kind of somber, kind of real soft,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.400
a New Orleans type of feel.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.210
We do a lot of jammin' when we play so...

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.630
I just told everybody to just put themselves into what we were doing.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.000
Then we go straight into it... [music kicks in]

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.070
The second song is more of a joyful feeling that

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.430
we will once again see them again. It may not be

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.000
on this side, but maybe on the other side. [Music kicks in again]

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.000
Is it focused?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You don't even see it! You did not.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.200
Okay, we're going to rehearse this, here we go...

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.000
Okay... action.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.700
We got some cool stuff... this has been

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.500
one the biggest, umm..., things that we've done -- oh, great, here comes the director.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.710
Shhh, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool.... 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.900
be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.230
He's standing awfully close to me, is it necessary -- it's like a big wide shot of just him next to me, right?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.000
This is like "Noah" of Chuck Knows Church.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.300
We usually do

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.930
four or five in one day and this one

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.000
has taken us two days to do one.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.950
We're just hoping for actually no rain... That's the one part about the whole

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.640
Noah story --  that we don't, we're not interested in that part of Noah -- the two by two though,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.000
we can go for that -- yeah.

00:03:49.274 --> 00:03:51.000
Animals -- Oh, the animals?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.360
Is he calling, he's calling the crew animals?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.320
[camera man speaks] This interview is going nowhere. [Chuck laughs]

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.000
[deadpan] Chuck, you think he's fun?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.100
[into lens] Somebody in there? I can see people in there...

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.600
Chuck is really a drag....

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.100
[bites apple] I just bit my lip...

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.000
He's very difficult to work with.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.500
I know it it's bleeding. You guys don't need to see--

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.300
the world doesn't need to see my bleeding
lip.

00:04:16.314 --> 00:04:19.100
I have to literally push him to be funny.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.300
[singing] The world doesn't need to see my bleeding lip.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.300
[backup singer joins] My bleeding lip.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.900
[sings] It just need to get offa' my hip.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.000
[backup singer] Off my hip.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.700
[Laughter]

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.300
It's difficult some times... but that's my job. 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.680
[Soulful singing]

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.360
One of the things sometimes happens with Chuck Knows Church is, sometimes were serious,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.400
sometimes are humorous. Depends on the
subject we're dealing with.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.520
Chuck Knows Church attempts to create a
dialogue between

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.520
the pastor and his or her congregant.   

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.100
Their congregation, and

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.480
we feel like we're somewhat of a conduit for trying to do that.
