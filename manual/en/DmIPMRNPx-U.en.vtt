00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:05.070
Okay, we tied off the rubber band here to
go ahead and create our next section. And

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.690
since we're getting towards the end, I went
ahead and rubber banded just to keep it out

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.630
of the way. So take out the rubber band and
finish our turn. And this next braid is going

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.220
to be very short because the hair is starting
to thin out towards the bottom of the head.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:33.179
So find your three pieces. And then just get
started again. Keep an eye out for your line.

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:39.649
And grab the outside ones from where you were.
And the inside turn from where you're headed

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:48.010
towards. This is the outside going under.
And the inside goes ahead and start grabbing

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.539
to where you're fixing to turn into. And just
keep pulling the hair. Make sure all stays

00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:00.529
tight. Grab out here. Keep that separated.
Try to keep it smooth and run your fingers

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:07.720
through the hair. Stretch it out and pull
it. Grab the inside from where you're headed

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:19.240
towards. Pull this down. Check where you are.
Outside, where you're coming from. Okay, now

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.540
we've turned and we're really go to the second
to the last bit of this braid. Then we will

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:36.759
be done. Just keep grabbing. Going underneath,
make sure you keep all this hair separate.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.859
Keep running your fingers through the hair.
Keep it smooth. Just pay very close attention

00:01:43.859 --> 00:02:04.030
to where you're going. Keep your part in mind.
Keep pulling the hair. Now that we are getting

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.590
towards the end, you can really see the zig
zag comes not so much from the actual braid

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.230
but from the parting is where the lines are.
You get those nice little points in between.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:24.860
And the braid comes out just a little bit
like a squiggle. Okay. I'm going to grab this

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.540
last bit. And now you have a choice. You can
either go straight down from the bottom. But

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.060
I'm going to run it at a little bit of an
angle. Also what we're going to do is we're

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:47.219
going to rubber band this off. Take this rubber
band out. And get ready to finish the braid.
