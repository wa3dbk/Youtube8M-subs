00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.670
I got fired today.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.661
I'd jaywalk&nbsp;but I can't
afford getting a&nbsp;ticket.

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:13.541
(children's laughter)

00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:17.991

00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:24.991
Change you stupid light.
Augh!

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.101
A cat?

00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:33.550
Or maybe a dog... Huh...

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.550
Guhhhhh! Guhhhh! GUHHHH!

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:48.791

00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:51.221

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.940
Hey.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.940
Hey, Deckard.
I heard you lost your job.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.251
Oh... uh, yeah.&nbsp;Too bad I can't make a career
out&nbsp;of getting fired, right?&nbsp;I'd be... like,

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:08.081
a CEO or a manager?

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.071
Which one's more impressive?

00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:11.171
Which one's more impressive?&nbsp;President?

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.821
Are you going to be OK?... Gahhhh! Ooooooo...
Oh My God!

00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:13.371
Blehhhh...

00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:16.221
Oh my God! Wait!

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:23.221
I have stuff for your stuff... I got you some ice for your crotch!&nbsp;I'm shoving the crotch ice under&nbsp;the door!

00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:41.581
Oh. You're awake. Wanna split a&nbsp;cassarole?

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.891

00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:54.590

00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:17.241
What...? Ah!... WAIT! Where are you guys going?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.891
Why does this make me feel so sad? (shattering)

00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:31.111

00:02:59.941 --> 00:03:06.551
Hello? Uh-huh, no. I didn't know that he had
a peanut allergy. Okay, well you know, if

00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:10.210
it's just a little bit of swelling then, then
just get him away from the peanuts and, and it'll

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.561
be over in about a half hour. Otherwise, call
an ambulance. Thank you, yep, bye.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:22.561
