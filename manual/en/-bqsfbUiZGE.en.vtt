00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.430
I think she's a bit stuffed, mate. What do
you reckon?

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.400
I reckon there's another couple hundred Ks
in that.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.170
Another couple hundred Ks, well, I'll leave
that one for you then,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.710
 because you might lose the whole lot.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.220
Yeah, we won't have to worry about it then.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.620
That road has literally, with the corrugation,
mate, it was a pretty rough track.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.580
It's literally destroyed the bearings. We've
lost the dust cap. And of course, I didn't

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.010
notice that we'd lost the dust cap, and of
course, all the sand and all the dirt and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.360
all the grit's gone in there and the bearing
is now collapsed. So you've gotta change the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.530
bearing, but I'll show you a few little tricks.
Now first of all, the first tip or trick is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.780
to make sure you take some bearings with you.
You gotta have some spare bearings, because

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.780
it's a long way to the bearing shop. So I'll
show you a few tricks.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.720
Now what happens with

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.290
the bearing if you leave it, if you leave
it too long, the washer that holds all this

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.500
on, it eventually starts to peel over and
of course, the whole lot comes off and then

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:49.580
you lose hub, bearings, tyre, rim. And that's
a big hassle then, because for starters, you'd

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.580
have to then carry a whole spare hub. So the
trick is to get to it before it happens.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.340
We seem to have a bit of a drama with this
hub. This hub has been flogging itself to

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:29.739
death. And of course, as you can see here,
our bearing cup just falls in. So that's a

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.599
bit of a, that's not going to work at all,
this hub now is destroyed, but I do have a

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.760
spare hub, so it's not a disc-brake hub, but
it is a spare hub, and that should do the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.810
trick for us.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.159
Alright so what I might do is whack a bit
more grease into these. And I'll show you

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:58.459
a little trick that I learnt to make it easier
to pack your bearings. Now these are just freezer bags.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.979
What? It's workin' well.

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.479
A real man just use your hands.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.669
Yeah, well you'll be covered in grease.
&gt; Really.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.600
It's not workin'. There we go. That worked
really well.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:31.939
It looks brand new.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.559
Look at that. Well there's a little tip for
ya. Here, can you pack that bearing for me

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:38.730
with your hands?

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:47.879
What you gotta do is get a bit of grease.
Don't just wipe it around the outside, because

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.749
you're not getting it down inside around the
rollers. So you've gotta force it all down

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.279
around there. Push it in.

00:03:53.279 --> 00:04:00.279
When you're finished you just Wipe me hands
on someone's shirt.

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.659
Well there you go. A little trick there with
the plastic bags and the grease. That worked

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:12.819
an absolute treat.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.239
The theory was good. Practice wasn't so much.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:26.080
Anyway, remember you gotta carry spares. Spares
are just as important as extra fuel or spare

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.080
tyres. So remember that one. And hopefully,
because we're running outta spares real quick.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.560
We've done a few this trip, haven't we?

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.139
Yeah. Anyway, catch you next time.
