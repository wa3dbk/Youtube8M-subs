00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.600
I never understood the need to change the
name of this game.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.620
Puzzle Bobble makes so much sense... well,
if you’ve played Bubble Bobble, that is,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.700
and honestly, who hasn’t?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.230
It was one of the most ubiquitous NES titles
back in the day, reimagined recently on XBLA,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.230
and some rather laughably horrible DS versions.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.290
But no, it’s Bust-A-Move now, which means
that the other game called Bust-A-Move has

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.720
to switch to Bust-A-Groove, and all of a sudden
we’re onto a whole Lord Bravery-style chain

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.559
of name changes and it’s MADNESS.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:49.559
MADNESS!

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.100
And bubbles.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.100
And puzzles.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:02.980
That you bobble... like an outfielder about
to be sent back down to the minors.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.860
Playing as either of two bubble-spitting dinosaurs
or any of an assortment of monster-looking

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.229
things, your goal is to clear the screen of
bubbles... by way of more bubbles.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.030
They can be removed either by getting a bunch
of the same color together to detonate them

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.610
directly, or by removing their means of connection
to the top of the screen, thus causing any

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.920
so orphaned bubbles to drop and score exponential
masses of points.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.280
It’s a pretty simple concept, and devoid
of any semblance of plot or explanation of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.229
exactly why these dinosaurs blow bubbles.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.509
The simple reason is: Plot wouldn’t fit,
cuz’ the puzzle gameplay itself is diversified

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:48.780
into several alternate modes for even more
strange, bubble-bouncing action.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.530
Here we have Ghost mode, where the bubbles
you shoot are insubstantial until they bounce

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.700
off a wall, all billiards-like.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.140
And Blind Mode, where you have no idea what
colors are up there until you fire a bubble

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.640
next to something... and no, it’s never
what you want it to be.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.369
There’s Running Launcher mode, where the
shooter at the bottom of the screen constantly

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.890
runs back and forth, threatening motion sickness
as well as making lining up shots a royal

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.870
pain in the bum.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.110
There’s the downright evil seesaw mode,
where the playing field itself lists to the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.441
“heavier” side after each shot; if it
goes three clicks in either direction, the

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.990
whole thing just falls over and ends the game.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.440
There’s Mix-’em-up, where the colors of
the bubbles themselves are subject to change

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.230
without notice.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.800
And then there’s Shot mode, where you’ve
got one shot - emphasised by a dramatic countdown

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.900
once you’ve laid in your course - to hit
a target in juuuuuust the right spot, likely

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.570
by applying an OED’s worth of English, bouncing
off two walls, and winning a Big Mac from

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.550
Larry Bird.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.830
All in all, there’s over a thousand puzzles
included on this disc, and while each can

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.300
be a bit on the short end of the spectrum,
they feel perfectly bite-sized for on-the-go

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.000
portable puzzle gaming.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.520
So submit to the siren’s song of Taito,
embrace your bubble-spewing dinoverlords,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.160
and grease up your shooting contraption.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:17.250
You’re gonna be here awhile.
