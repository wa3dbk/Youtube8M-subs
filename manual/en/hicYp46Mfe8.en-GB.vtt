Hello Dear Do'minators

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.820
Does your computer...

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.420
When you Open it

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.460
It starts with a white screen

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.280
The logo becomes and

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.520
It abruptly becomes pink

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.300
The solution is:

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:38.340
You need to press Option+Command+P buttons

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.020
when you are starting the computer

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.400
Normally one reboot is ok but I am going to make it reboot twice

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.460
to make sure

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.420
Congratulations. You got rid of the pink start screen

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.820
Goodbye before the next episode

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280
Take care of yourselves

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.280
And gooodbyee...

00:01:31.220 --> 00:02:03.500
