pro-competitive that will come up with a
evil character

lol will be from a company that makes
probably will later work for rapidly

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:40.260
will form that people first formats

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.520

with baby

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.840
by the way uh... it uses okay but it's
in the movie now

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.380
power and you know it quits it is that
they happen appointed in a batman movie

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.200
for the first time as the wages going up
except it's not the first time they

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.540
already had two character bain in batman
and robin and other movie

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.099
from the you know broadly the same
seriously

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.659
or did you say well a body

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.929
smoke kicked out corrupt latin adherence
live on this school the day they taught

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:14.739
a fire

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.359
forget that this is iraq this is not
coordinate

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.939
uh... it's it's ridiculous and i wanted
to set its it's it was the coon

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.439
their way before now is a more prominent
character and and there's nothing

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.709
at all to do bio movie plans were
announced in early twenty eleven

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.309
when

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:37.849
you know the primaries were just getting
started it was the carly unclear abroad

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:38.729
might win

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.469
well which companies

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.999
those scheduled launch the they were
like whether that you know as you say

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:49.109
eat me with thought maybe bachmann work
for the i_r_s_ at one point we need to

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.889
characterize arrests workers earth
summit of the others i think i think

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.759
apartments and seven eighths repairs
from texas they were thinking of calling

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:00.290
in texas club with a lot like a big
people

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.079
you know the plot added that uh...
batman creators have come up with

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.179
it's a plot to make a lot of money

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:09.790
for state that's the district say their
backs

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.129
and it is a conspiracy is going to work
so now the top of the fall fund the

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.249
movie where at the

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.909
that the bad guy is a community
organizer

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:18.560
benefit

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.269
and my voice speaking of which

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.430
batman has received criticism in the
past for being too conservative

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.800
in one of the movies batman does what
was wiretapping he's a little torn up

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.080
about a unless he does right

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.740
so at that time i guess the creators of
batman were incredibly conservative

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.220
but now they are part of the hope
datebook

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.979
this literature posits talking about

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.909
richer causes the use because of the
most conservative that matters of the

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.410
most the services that you could judge
in the country

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.179
but the smartest conservative judge in
the country right

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:53.930
he's saying look and reconsider without
your policies as recovery

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.900
i mean these people are the same people
believe in moon landings uh... are

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.819
popular sheriff joe came out and said
but now i'm positive that all bombers

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.550
uh... pursued every there's a forgery

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.529
