00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.810
Today we&amp;#39;re going to review part number
TLE1548.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.380
This is the TorkLift SuperTruss Hitch Extension
for the SuperHitch Trailer Hitch Receivers.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.759
This part number is 48 inches in length.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.650
Now, this extension will allow you to extend
the top receiver on your TorkLift SuperHitch

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.060
dual receiver trailer hitch to clear any obstacles,
such as maybe a bed-mounted camper.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.480
This is a heavy duty design system, which
will let you maintain the high towing capacity

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.820
that allows you to use a standard weight distribution
system.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.620
On most cases where you need to use an extension
on the hitch that might be underneath your

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.180
truck bed, in other words, if you put a camper
on, extends out over your truck bed, you need

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.250
to reach the hitch underneath.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:02:44.290
Most extensions would be just like a single,
a tube 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:03:44.669
that 
would 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:04:09.049
slide into 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:57.700
receiver and then hang 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:38.780
out 
this far.
