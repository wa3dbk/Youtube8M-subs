00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.020
We're going to show you how to make a parachute man

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.000
You need strong white string, not  rope or cotton

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.280
And you need a rubbish bag liner. You need to cut it off.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.180
And a man to attach to the parachute.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.560
Tie the string to each corner of the plastic bag

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.820
Tie the strings together

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.220
Attach the strings to the parachutes man.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.280
bundle him up and throw!

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.720
That is the end of that that.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.080
I am parachute man.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.280
Na na na na na, na na na na.
