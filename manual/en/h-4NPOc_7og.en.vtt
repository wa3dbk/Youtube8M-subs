00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.050
Now, we are going to cut a double window matte.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.279
We are going to use our light blue for the
outer matte and dark blue for the inner matte.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.000
Outer matte: cut your exact finished dimensions.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.699
Inner matte: cut smaller.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.980
Okay?

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.171
Our procedure is that we are going to cut
this window matte first and then we are going

00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:41.760
to tape the inner matte onto it and we are
going to cut our final window opening in that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.790
matte and we'll end up with a double window
matte.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.870
Let me show you.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.710
Okay, we are going to do our basic cut.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.519
We are going to go 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5.

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.549
All dimensions of 2.5.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:01:05.990
So we are going to do our basic four sides
cut.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:21.140
Okay, there's our outer matte.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.540
Now we are going to tape this matte onto it.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.940
We are going to make sure that this insert
can be as our backing.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.990
The first thing we are going to do is use
our tape gun, our ATG Tape Gun.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.740
Okay, now we are going to add the ATG Tape
Gun to it.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:52.540
Add just a little bit to the middle piece.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.119
Centre that.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:03.140
Press it down and now readjust our opening;
this was 2.5 and we wanted to get quarter

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.250
inch, so we are going to 2 and 3/4.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.250
Now you take your double window matte, place
it in.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.010
Lower.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.540
Perform cut.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.750
Turn it 90 degrees.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.400
Place it against the square edge.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.480
Lower.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.659
Take start of finger to edge of matte.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.739
Press blade down.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.189
Perform cut.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.389
Raise the cut assembly.

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.169
Turn 90 degrees.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.819
Lower.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.109
Perform cut.

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:43.529
Turn 90 degrees.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.569
Lower.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.889
Beautiful double window matte.
