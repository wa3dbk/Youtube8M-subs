00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:12.014
Hi, I'm Magnaomega, with another speed paint.
Using the Medibang Paint Pro software!

00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:15.628
This time will be a fan art of "Steven Universe" show
The Cristal Gem Garnet! 

00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:20.537
I had some idea of ??how I wanted she looks,
however, had to do several tests.

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.049
I started looking for several references.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.249
Until inspire me
watching a manga of Hajime No Ippo.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.150
And once defined the sketch.

00:00:57.313 --> 00:00:59.863
Immediately I started with the inking work.

00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:06.782
I really like using the pen, hardline and defined,
 like a real pen.

00:01:11.484 --> 00:01:13.884
Her fist, cost me achieve good construction.

00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:17.648
For some reason, it was took me long time...

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.770
And i decided to make a sketch only of the fist.

00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:41.112
Finally I liked how it turned out.

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:45.146
Sometimes, there are things that do not always go the first time.

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:48.445
But do not give up, you can always start over.

00:02:05.964 --> 00:02:10.514
I wanted to represent strength and power, so
bottom lines were important to do.

00:02:12.262 --> 00:02:15.062
I made manually to give a more organic style.

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:30.993
Also wanted to give power to the hilt, so i add motion lines too.

00:02:32.102 --> 00:02:36.602
I thought, if the punch coming frontal,
 the motion lines radially would a good choice ...

00:02:38.085 --> 00:02:42.061
But, in fact the fist hits a curved motion,
 so to the same direction lines it looks much better.

00:02:45.328 --> 00:02:47.928
some move lines in the body and hair.

00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:51.212
and now a add little hatch ink, this is something I want to perfect.

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:14.566
Now I give some volume on the line, give more weight.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.680
Always in the direction of the shadow.

00:03:20.913 --> 00:03:23.363
Now the color, a base color to start.

00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:26.447
This color will change during the working process

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:31.126
The colors were taken from a model sheet of Garnet

00:03:44.217 --> 00:03:47.681
All flat colors.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.819
Shaded colors and lights,
I rely on the theory of the color wheel.

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:02.888
An example, if I use red is the base,
your shadow is a mixture of blue (purple)

00:04:03.741 --> 00:04:06.191
And the brightness is a mixture with yellow (orange)

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.240
To this we must add the value of color, etc.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.099
To learn more about the color wheel,
I suggest you investigate.

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:15.729
Here on youtube you can find many
good tutorials on this subject.

00:04:17.394 --> 00:04:19.544
Bounce light is very important to me.

00:04:20.602 --> 00:04:23.152
I like to use strong colors such as cyan or magenta.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.920
I'm terrible with the backgtounds ...

00:04:30.826 --> 00:04:34.476
This took me several minutes to achieve
an appropriate color contrast.

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.759
Until finally add some effects
patterns and gradients.

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:33.617
And this is the end result.
