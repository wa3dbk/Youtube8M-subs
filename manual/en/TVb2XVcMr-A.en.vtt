00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.850
ROB: Hello, I'm ROBwithaB,
and today we're going back in time to the

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.110
Stone Age
so that I can become an expert

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.519
in the African Hand Drill.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.400
ROB: Luckily I have a time machine right here
at home!

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.889
Ta-Daa!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.110
ROBERTA: (Mutters) Maybe THAT can help you
get ready

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.320
before my mother arrives.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.620
ROB: So I'm just going to set the dial for 2,000BC,
then step inside, and I'll see you again shortly...

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.830
 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.400
ROBERTA: WAIT! You're not leaving me here
alone with a CAVEMAN!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.400
Anyway, who's going to work the camera
and explain all the sciencey stuff?

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.000
ROB: Hmm... Good point
Not just a pretty face, that one.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.870
ROBERTA: Pfft. "Time Machine"

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.870
ROB: Luckily, I happen to have a REPLICATOR
right here at home!

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.159
Ta-Daa!

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.429
ROB: I hope this works...

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:07.429
[Weird mechanical noises]

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.500
ROB: Well that didn't really seem to...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.500
[Loud knocking interrupts]

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600
ROB: HUP...

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.560
#2: Smells like shoes in there.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.360
#2: What's...? Do I know you? You look kinda
familiar.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.090
ROB: Hello. I'm ROBwithaB.
I make YouTube videos.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.320
I'm quite famous actually.
A bit of a celebrity.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.970
And youÃ­re my alter ego; a copy of me.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.780
#2: Oh I don't think anyone can copy THAT
ego.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.000
ROB: Anyway, I'm making a video and I need
someone

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.930
to send back in time to the Stone Age.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.100
#2: And I'm guessing you don't have any
FRIENDS to do that for you.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.280
ROB: Yes, well... No.
They don't really want to be in my videos...

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.630
anymore.
Not since the whole "Eyebrow Incident".

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.560
#2: So why don't YOU just go back in time
and I'll stay here and make the video?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.480
I mean, I'm YOU, right?
So I know everything you do.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.030
ROB: Jaaa... but see, the replication process
is never  100% accurate.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.210
Any time you copy something, errors creep
in.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.569
Little glitches. Mutations, if you like.
Like a photocopy.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.590
There's a loss of quality.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.480
#2: What are you trying to say?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.480
ROB: Well, don't take this the wrong way,
but the audience tunes in for my PERSONALITY.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.709
And you seem a bit... Stoic?
And there's other things.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.880
Lets just say...
you're a couple of feathers short of a hat.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.000
#2: But the mutations could also be an IMPROVEMENT.
Which wouldn't be too difficult

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.010
Tell you what: we'll fight for it.
Push-ups. 
Whoever does the most gets to stay here.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.569
Survival of the fittest,
I think you call it.

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:09.200
 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.220
ROB: Yeah, okay. You go first

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.670
#2: one- two-three

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.099
ROB: Take your time, glitch-boy.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
#2: 73- 74- 75 - 76 - 77

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.200
#2: 204 - 205- 206 - 207
ROB: I've created a MONSTER.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
#2: [Slightly out of breath]
Okay. That's 300. 
For the FIRST round.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Your turn.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
ROB: Cool. Umm... I should probably
put on a wrist-guard, though.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.700
I think there's one in the cupboard with
the tennis rackets.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.300
#2: Don't wait too long.
The past isn't going to wait for you.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.989
ROB: It's just... I think I tweaked my back
earlier.

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.360
I don't want to bend down before...

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.720
#2: Okay. Enough excuses. I'll get it.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
ROB: [shuts door and locks it]

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.800
#2: HEYY!!!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.040
[Hum of machine roaring to life]
