Phil: Hey guys itÕs Phil from smilinggardener.com.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.500
ItÕs actually getting warm at here, I think
this might be the last video where I am wearing

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.930
my faithful green sweater here.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.529
If you havenÕt picked up my free online organic
gardening course, you can do that right on

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.130
the home page of smilinggardener.com.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.869
Today I am talking about organic weed control.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.859
Now for many of us organic weed control means
we are down on our hands and knees for hours

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.960
at a time pulling weeds, you can tell right
now but I was down on my hands and knees and

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.440
we really start to after a while to think
that weeds are the enemies, especially weeds

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.520
like bindweed and some of those grassy weeds
which just keep putting up shoots all over

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.520
the place.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.500
I am going to give you some tips on how to
kill weeds naturally today but first I want

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.590
to talk about the benefits of weeds some of
us realized you know that canÕt be just that

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.839
simple that weeds are all bad, the truth is
weeds are soil healers.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.629
A number of weeds are nitrogen fixers like
this is vetch and this is something I actually

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.839
planted as a cover crop but it is helping
to get more nitrogen into the soil, same with

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.920
clover is a common weed, people would call
the weed in the line even though it wasnÕt

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.670
long ago that it used to be included in lawn
seed and itÕs coming back a little bit today

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.530
the people started to do a little bit of that
but that is a nitrogen fixing plant.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.600
ItÕs working with bacteria to help improve
the nitrogen in the soil, other than pulling

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.700
weeds by hand there are number of things you
can do.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.149
I am going to give you six of them today.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.040
If you get cheap seed itÕs going to have
a lot of weed seeds in and you donÕt want

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.730
to do that, likewise when you are bringing
in compost or when you are composting, you

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.650
want to make sure you are creating a hot compost
pile or buying really good compost for most

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.540
of those weed seeds will have been killed
because if you spread compost that has or

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.130
top soil that has horse tiller or something
like that you are bringing that into your

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.130
garden.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.950
ItÕs not a great thing, so thatÕs number
one as try to be clean.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.360
Second step is balancing your soil fertility
and actually thatÕs what I was going to bring

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.500
out my soil test for I remember now.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.770
So I am not going to get in much detail here
but when I look at this organic soil test

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.270
result I can look especially at my main macronutrients
here.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.970
I can see my calcium, magnesium, potassium,
sodium those are all a [indiscernible 02:02]

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.260
which is certainly common but if we can balance
those out based on the recommendations from

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.680
a good organic soil lab, we will start to
see our weed pressure go down, a trusty hope

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.040
Now itÕs not always going to kill the weeds
but if you just keep doing it a few times,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.270
itÕs going to weaken them and eventually
they wouldnÕt cause that much problem, but

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.120
dandelion, itÕs nice if you can pull up that
by the tap root it takes so long, now for

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.319
me personally I leave most of the dandelions
in my soil because I know they are doing a

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.319
lot of good work there but if I did want to
get rid of them and this is one handed I would

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.450
just take a whole and boom, I didnÕt get
rid of everything but I got rid of a lot,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.980
you know the worms like to hang up right in
the root zone of a weed.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.890
So, thatÕs another reason weeds are good.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.940
Next, how I am going to stop that dandelion
from coming up again, well dandelions happen

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.319
to be pretty strong, they keep come in back
otherwise you can weaken them over the time

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.459
but the next step to controlling weeds is
boom.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.459
Throw a nice thick mulch in there leaves or
straw or whatever you like to use for mulch,

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.209
I talked about that before but that is going
to stop most weeds from coming up.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.069
LetÕs go have a look at okay.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.330
LetÕs check out this new garden that I put
in last fall, not a whole lot of weeds going

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.819
on in here either and thatÕs because of mulch,
does so much to stop weeds.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.360
I had a leaf mulching here over the fall and
just actually in the last couple of days having

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.090
lend on a little straw because some of the
leaves blew over to that side of the garden,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.319
so now I am laying down straw, those are my
two favorite kinds of mulch and I do not have

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.409
any weed problems in this garden.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.590
The next step is to plan very densely, plant
poly cultures which are groups of different

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.780
kinds of plants that all work together to
help each other out and the shadow of the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.340
soil, now I donÕt have much going on this
year.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.770
Here is my little strawberry batch.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.010
It doesnÕt have much weed problems because
itÕs pretty dense on itÕs own when it gets

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.230
going and plant other things in there and
I smoldered it with leaves so thatÕs not

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.269
a great example this time year and there is
the last step right there if you are in a

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.640
pinch in it vinegar, just regular household
vinegar, itÕs 5% ascetic acid by volume.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.069
ItÕs going to get rid of some of those you
know dandelions and those really strong perennials

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.660
but they do a really good job on animals and
it will weaken perennials too just like aa

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.849
hoe does over the time.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.500
So, what you do here is you put this in a
spray bottle and just spray it especially

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.610
nice for sidewalks and patios, but even a
little bit in the garden is not too big of

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.050
a deal, now if you want something a little
stronger, you can buy horticultural vinegar,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.290
itÕs 10% to 30% ascetic acid now itÕs pretty
caustic stuff very ascetic.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.070
It can burn you, you got to be careful with
it but it can be used with you know to kill

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.040
more perennial weeds, so those are your six
steps.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.280
So how to kill weeds naturally, the big thing
here is to take a long review.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.610
So all of these other lessons I am teaching
you had a balance of your soil and get organic

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.130
matter in there, all of that stuff is going
to create a soil that doesnÕt support weeds

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.080
very well, they just wouldnÕt be able to
thrive there.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.140
So thatÕs the main one along with smoldering
them out with a nice thick organic mulch with

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.780
very dense plantings or plants with a very
dense healthy line, itÕs especially important

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.970
to balance your soil and have a good healthy
line to compete weeds there because in the

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.300
garden we can put a thick mulch on and that
can cover a lot.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.530
So that allow me really need to make healthy
and thatÕs what we gotta do that.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.230
So the question today is what are your main
problem weeds.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.890
If you can post that down below I will try
to give you some tips specifically on how

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.440
to deal with those weeds or I will try to
tell you if there are any fertility issues

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.350
that those weeds point to, other than that
you can read more detail in this article down

below, you can subscribe to my free online
course down below that, you can join me on
