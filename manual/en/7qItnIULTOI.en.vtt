00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.560
Sometimes you wonder
what a car looks like in real life.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.840
This is the Ferrari Four.
To be honest it somewhat disappoints me.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.280
It is very big, quite huge actually.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.840
The styling makes it look quite large.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.520
The design lacks dynamics and speed,
it's not that elegant.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.400
Because the Audi A3
is nearing the end of its life...

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.485
...they are making a successor.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.760
But they won't show it yet
because they still want us to buy the old A3.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.080
This is the A3 concept.
Surprisingly it's like a sedan...

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.960
...with coupe lines.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.920
The wheels deserve special attention.
I'll walk around the front.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.920
On this site Patrick can film them better.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.880
Look, there's carbon in the wheels.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.920
You don't want this if you have to park
alongside a curb every day, like me.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.400
If you hit the curb once,
it'll cost you 23 grand.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.120
This is one of the treats of the show.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.520
Alfa Romeo is finally introducing
a new car again.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.200
And quite a car too,
it's a small sports car; the 4C.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.680
They've used a lot of technology from the 8C.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.400
This one is a lot smaller and lighter, though.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520
They've used a lot of carbon fiber,
so it weights just 850 kg (1,873 lbs).

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.880
Under the hood you'll find
a 1.8 turbo with 200 hp.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.600
It's got a dual clutch gearbox.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.720
0-62 in 5 seconds
with a top speed of 155 mph.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.160
It is still a concept
but they will launch it next year.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.000
The only thing I'm worried about is the price.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.360
Carbon fiber doesn't come cheap
and it will undoubtedly be hand-built.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.960
But it is a cool flagship for Alfa Romeo.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.400
Mercedes is launching
a lot of new cars this year.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.800
This is one of them; the new SLK.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.280
Your hairdresser's car of choice.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.350
I think it's nicer, it looks less barbie-like.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.800
It looks more solid.
It fits in with the family better.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.120
And before we forget it; this one is matte.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.520
Very beautiful, nicely done by Mercedes.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.720
This is also a favorite of mine.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.600
I have always liked the C-Class.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.880
It has had a facelift, but we've already
seen that in Detroit and so did you.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.280
This is the coupe, that one was still missing.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.520
There used to be a Sportcoupe,
but that was a more compact car.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.200
This one is 41 mm lower
than the standard sedan.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.000
It's available with 3 petrol
and 2 diesel engines. I like it.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.240
In matte black it looks even better.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.800
I think it's a cool car, I can't say that enough.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.640
But there's much more matte porn here.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.360
This is a matte white CLC 63 AMG.
It has the new bi-turbo V8.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.660
But it gets even better.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.800
A matte white SLS with brown leather.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.240
How cool is that?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.240
The Chevrolet stand is filled
with world premiers again.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.720
The Aveo sedan with really cool headlights...

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.600
...that's all there is to it.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.280
Of course small sedans suck,
you can't drive those.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.080
The Cruze used to be a sedan, but now
there is a 5-door hatchback version.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.400
You can buy it right now.
The Aveo is available from this summer.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.240
Patrick, you have to stay here.
I know it's a strange brand.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.480
Chevrolet also has the Camaro, the Corvette.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.160
That's the weird thing;
they've got small eco-cars...

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.320
...and those loud V8s.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.880
We don't see enough of those in Holland.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.160
We actually also don't see
those eco-cars very often.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.320
I think they sold better
when it was still called Daewoo.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.320
But I'm no product-marketing specialist
so I don't really know.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.320
I do know that it helps
to put a lovely blonde girl...

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.280
...next to a measly Spark.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.400
This isn't a normal Rolls Royce...

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.480
...if you can call them normal.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.190
This is a Phantom Extended Wheelbase,
very long and big.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.400
It's electric. They use it to
test electric drive on a Rolls Royce.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.320
The funny thing about Rolls Royces...

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.650
...is that they're not being driven a lot.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.040
The most miles are clocked up
with Coupes and Dropheads...

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.520
...while Phantoms are mostly used
to arrive at a party in style.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.270
They do about 2,500 miles a year,
mostly short distances.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.240
That makes them a perfect candidate
for electric drive.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.920
There are lots of premieres in Geneva,
but also lots of conversions.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.680
How cool is this?
A ski box on a Koenigsegg.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.440
Talking about cars with a lot of carbon...

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.920
...This is the Agera R.
It uses lots of carbon fiber.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.120
It has over 1,100 hp.
Eat that, Bugatti.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.120
It only has rear-wheel drive,
so 0-62 takes a bit longer.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.240
But once you get going,
it's much quicker of course.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.140
I think it is less beautiful
than the Pagani, I have to admit.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.520
But you can always buy both of course.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.600
Lancia has updated their whole range of cars.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.160
I'm standing next to the Ypsilon,
it's the biggest news in a way...

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.300
...because the car is completely new. 
It's now only available as a 5-door.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.480
But that's not the only Lancia news,
everything is new.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.360
So let's go to the Voyager on my left.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.240
It's actually a Chrysler Grand Voyager...

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.480
...with Lancia badges
and a few other changes.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.680
They also say that they've made
the interior more Italian.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.120
Actually it's just a rebadge...

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.760
...but is is a nice successor to
the Lancia Phedra that has disappeared.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.040
While we're on the subject of rebadging,
Fiat also knows how to do that.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.880
This used to be the Dodge Journey
but it has become the Fiat Freemont.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.160
The engines do come from Fiat...

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.360
...but I can't see a Fiat in this.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.000
Maybe the buyers will think differently.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.880
This is a little joke from Fiat.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.040
This looks like a regular 500
until you see the rear.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.880
It has a nice coupe-line.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.040
It's been designed by Zagato.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.920
It looks very cool but it just has 
a 0.9 liter 2-cylinder engine.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.640
It does have 105 hp, downsizing rules.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.840
It's funny. I wonder if
they dare to start selling it.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.920
I'll see you later in part 3.
