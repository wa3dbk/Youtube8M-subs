HOW I OVERCAME 
HIP DISPLASIA

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:06.900
As a puppy I was rescued from the shelter

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.400
Unfortunately my first owner didn’t give me a bit of interest and care which I required

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.400
I met my current owners in 2009 
when I was 15 months old

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.400
When we met for the first time I didn’t know how to walk on a lead, play with a stick or even how to run!

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.400
Unfortunately apart from behavioral problems 
it turned out that I have serious disorder

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.900
I had a Canine Hip Dysplasia

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.400
In the normal anatomy of the hip joint, the root (the thigh bone) is connected to the pelvis at the hip joint.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.400
My root (the thigh bone) is outside of the hip joint. 
I was in pain. Continously. All the time...

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.900
To relieve the pain I reduced the movement 
of my aching hips.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.400
And it was making my rear legs weaker and weaker

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.400
Comparing big head and torso with skinny rear legs 
I looked like a caricature of a dog

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.900
My muscular atrophy was progressing. 
I was in danger of paralysis!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.400
The only chance for me 
to be able to walk 
and live was 
hip replacement 
but 
the surgery was way too 
expensive...

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.900
Fortunately, my owners found 
informations about stem cell therapy. 
It was my only chance to gain 
normal life - without pain 
and specter of paralysis

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.900
I received 4 injections - one for each hip and knee. 
And then...

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.400
We went for a walk...

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:49.600
Now I can dance! :)

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.900
And I can run!

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.800
And make new friends

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.000
And even fly!

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.800
I'd like to express my gratitude to 
veterinarian Jerzy Kemilew 
REGENVET Steam Cells Labratory
(http://regenvet.pl)
for his help, advices and for preparing the 
allogeneic cells for me.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.100
Also I want to thank veterinarian Zdzisław Rak
from veterinary clinic Vita I Animal 
(http://vitaanimal.pl)
who gave me anesthesia and injections.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.400
Thanks to them
I am 6-years-old puppy now
who can now run, play and live
without pain.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.900
Extending the life of your pet
is selfish
but making that life better
is a gift of love
