00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.390
Hello. I'm Mike Corliss with Tormach. 
Today I'm going to talk...

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.429
...about toolmaker vises and how
to use them in a mill.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.730
A toolmakers vise is a precision ground vise.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.499
it's

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.969
it's good for holding delicate parts
because you're clamping pressure is...

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.210
really easy to control. You just
use an allen wrench to tighten it.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.020
and for uh... parts that you really want
to make sure...

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.240
...are oriented the way you want them.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.150
Because you can orient them in the vise
and then just clamp the vise...

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.240
in your workholding in the machine.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.070
And if you've got a surface grinder, we use them all the time in a surface grinder.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.870
We have three different size toolmaker
vises with this style.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
The smaller one, the larger one
and then the in-betweener.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.060
They're all,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.280
basically the same just different sizes.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.610
And they're precision ground,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.990
all sides and and and so you can set
these flat,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.680
you can set them on their sides,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.080
set them on their ends.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.500
They've all got a threaded hole
on the sides,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.960
so you can put, um..

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.330
a little strap clamp with a bolt

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.150
and use them for stops if
you are doing more than one piece.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.690
you have a stop bolted to the side 
and just slide your piece against that stop.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.310
Or one off each side. Pinch it.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.100
If you had a pin,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.100
That you wanted to clamp on
the v groove here.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.460
And now with it like this

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.479
you can put it in the machine,

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.520
you can do your work on this side,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.610
take the whole vise out of your vise...

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.820
tip it up.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.659
and then do end work on it and then you
know it's oriented ninety degrees

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:05.370
from where you

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.569
did the first work.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.309
Same with this flat piece...

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:12.679
you can set the vise in...

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.540
..the vise. You can clamp
it this way.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.739
machine the end off, do whatever
end work you want to,

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.939
unclamp it from your vise,

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.079
rotate the toolmakers ninety degrees
and do your side work,

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.589
and you know everything is ninety
degrees andeverything going to be perfect

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:30.749
the locking mechanism for the vise

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:34.319
it just slides in here. And when 
you get to the correct size...

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.019
...for your piece

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:44.019
it locks up in and you tighten your bolt
against the groove.

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:50.459
You clamp it in the vise this way

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.689
and if you wanted to change parts

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.059
...the movable jaw in the tool makers
vise is smaller...

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.319
the mill vise is clamped up on the solid jaw.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.669
...so the moveable jaw...

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.739
...still moves.
you can loosen it up.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.689
There we go..

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.469
Just like that.

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:19.939
It's in.

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.279
It's still clamped in the vise

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:30.279
With the moveable jaw you can still loosen and tighten.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.629
Flip the vise over ninety degrees,

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.349
just like that and do the work on this face.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:56.349
Then you know it's perpendicular to
whatever work you just did.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.430
Good.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.049
and too

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:04.819
Toolmakers vises...

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.620
...are very versatile for small intricate work,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.749
delicate work.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:16.749
But you don't have a lot of clamping force, so don't think you can
put a block in here and do a lot of heavy milling. It'll slip out on you.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.450
If you use them on a surface grinder
with a magnetic chuck

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.529
the magnetism will draw up through these
vises so you can grind.

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:29.739
uh... it'd help hold your workpiece...

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:30.929
...down in the grinder.

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:32.870
Aluminum...

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.150
it's not going to help you a bit. There's nothing
to help with the magnetism of aluminum.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.819
it holds you vise down well but it's not
going to increase you holding power.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:42.940
So steel.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.520
Just steel. Just iron.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.270
and that's uh... a quick into for what
toolmaker vises are used for.
