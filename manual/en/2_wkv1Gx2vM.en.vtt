00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.270
Which should we be more afraid of: sharks
or horses?

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.590
Before we answer that, let’s consider two
more questions:

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.139
Which kills more people each year: car accidents,
homicide, and suicide combined… or cancer?

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.449
And… are there more English words that start
with the letter 'r', or that have 'r' as the

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.310
third letter?

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.020
When answering questions like these offhand,
we tend to think in terms of examples, and

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.180
assume that the more examples we can remember,
the more common a thing is.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.530
Unfortunately, we remember some things much
more easily than others, so this "availability

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.639
heuristic" can lead us to make really bad
assessments of risk.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:43.370
Things that are more commonly and vividly
shown in the media, like a violent murder,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.569
will be a lot easier to remember than things
that are far more common in real life but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:52.229
aren't as dramatic, like a cancer patient
dying peacefully at home.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.319
Likewise, thinking of things in familiar ways,
like alphabetical order, is a lot easier than

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.829
new ways, like third letter order.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.859
But if we actually count the words, this intuition
turns out to be wrong: more than twice as

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.390
many words have “R” as a third letter
than first letter!

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.890
We can see this same effect happening in public
policy: Americans spend 25 times more money

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.289
fighting terrorism than fighting cancer, even
though cancer kills almost two thousand times

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:20.780
as many people.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.100
Both policy makers and the public who elect
them remember dramatic episodes of terrorism

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.409
much more readily than boring statistics about
cancer… and that's how priorities are set.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.469
The only way to avoid this availability bias
is to decide based on statistics, not the

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:38.469
news.

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.009
We just can't trust our intuition to accurately
calculate risks.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.560
So, which causes more deaths: Jaws, or My
Little Pony?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.670
Sorry, sharks — horses are the real killers.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.430
