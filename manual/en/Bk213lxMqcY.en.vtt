We're talking 2003, the year in which Peugeot presented the 206 SW. A compact station car in the B-segment, I liked it a lot.

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:25.631
Then the 207 and the SW became this ... thing. But now, the world has changed and at the competition, small stationcars are replaced by this...

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:39.256
And this one, and this one, and this... So Peugeot follows the trend and brings us this. Er, this...

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:59.558
I have to say, I'm not a huge fan of small SUVs. Don't like the high stuff. But this one looks funky. Although it has very, very many details that try very hard to be unique.

00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:15.816
The head light, lots of chrome, lots of lines, and this bulge in the roof which doesnt continue in the middle. And this little edge... One thing's for sure: it has character.

00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:37.537
And character is what cars seem to need these days. Shapes matter more and more. Look at this interior, lots of 208 influences. 

00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:47.116
It looks nice but I keep wondering: what extra stuf does this car have to offer compared to a 208 SW, which won't come?

00:01:47.622 --> 00:02:01.692
Take the space in here. The trunk is pretty good, but sitting behind myself is undoable, but it's not bad when the driver is of a more average size. 

00:02:02.538 --> 00:02:14.899
But that also was the case in the 207 SW. That one didn't have the high seating position and the better view on the road like this 2008 though, and that is what costumers want these days...

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:35.123
It's a pretty high car, and you feel that when going through corners. It's a comfy drive, and it hangs more on its springs than a lower stationcar. It's simple as that. 

00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:45.690
But many buyers won't care I think. It steers nice, it rides relaxed, I think this car can make a lot of people happy. 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.256
Right, don't expect too much when blasting though a corner!

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:17.143
The 2008 will come with four choices of engines. This is a 1.6 VTi with 120 ps, the strongest petrol choice for a while. 

00:03:17.586 --> 00:03:31.439
And it's no powerhouse, to be honest. It makes the car feel heavy, especcially when going uphill. 

00:03:31.913 --> 00:03:40.317
That makes me wonder for tomorrow, when I'll be driving the new three cylindre 1.2 VTi.

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:26.246
Oh yes, it has three cylindres allright. The 1.2 VTi. with 82 ps. This truly is a base engine guys, as long as the road is flat there's no problem, but as soon as it has to start climbing...

00:04:26.714 --> 00:04:48.227
Like it shows here in the Elsas, there is very little torgue-reserve, it requires a lot of downshifting... It'll be ok for The Netherlands, but in the mountains this will have to work!

00:04:51.512 --> 00:05:00.949
It's obvious this 2008 tries very. very hard to show how special it is. Even though this really is a normal family car.

00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:18.476
All those funky details can't hide the fact this car fits right in between the rest of the market. A good amount of space inside, in terms of driving it's less harsh than a Nissan Juke but less comfy than a Opel Mokka...

00:05:18.768 --> 00:05:25.892
So there are not a lot of things I can nag about, let alone the drivetrains... 

00:05:26.383 --> 00:05:34.613
This car puts on a show, a Peu-show if you like, because on the inside, this is a pretty ordinary car...

00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:51.490
+ Original details, modern options  + Good interior space    - Limited choice in engines  - High centre-of-gravity.
