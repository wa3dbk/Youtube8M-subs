00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.740
Alright you guys so we are going to do the
Moon Walk forwards.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.600
Forward but still in place.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.910
So what's happening is, same idea as the moon
walk, but the only difference is you're not

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.349
going back.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.430
So you're going to do the same thing as we
did in the Moon Walk.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.340
Now, normally, in the Moon Walk, we would
start to go back but in this one your weight

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.730
is going to continuously stay.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.470
And now we're kicking the left to stay in
the place.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:52.070
See what's happening.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.620
So we're kicking a leg placing and then we
push through.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.950
So if I'm starting on my left, I want to kick
the left, prepare, go through the ball of

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.189
the feet and heel, as my right foot just skates
back.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.049
I going to kick my right, prep, the weight
is going be on the right foot.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.420
I'm going to go to the heel, and the left
foot just slides back.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.420
Once more.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.990
I'm going to kick the left, make sure you'll
push through the ball of the foot first and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.070
then go to the heel and that's right, kick
through press to the ball of the foot, and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.640
to the heel, and the left is sliding back.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.900
For my technical dancers you want to go through
your metatarsals.
