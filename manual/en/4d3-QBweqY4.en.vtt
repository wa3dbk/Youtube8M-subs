00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:10.630
We cannot pray effectively if we pray with
our minds and that is why Jesus sent us the

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:19.570
Holy Spirit so that we can EFFECTIVELY PRAY
and WORSHIP GOD.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.179
As Jesus said to the woman at the well.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:32.599
I read from John 4:23-24 "But an hour is coming,
and now is, when the TRUE WORSHIPERS shall

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:42.800
worship the Father in SPIRIT and in TRUTH;
for such people the Father seeks to be His

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.440
worshipers.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:53.580
God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must
worship in spirit and in truth."

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:03.250
We can pray with our mind but we need the
Holy Spirit of God in us, so that we can pray

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:11.189
in the Spirit according to the will of God
and that is why Jesus sent the Holy Spirit

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.520
to those who have accepted Him and who are
following Him in truth.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:33.680
Paul wrote in Romans 8:26-27 ” In the same
way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.829
we do not know how to pray as we should, but
the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:52.110
groanings too deep for words; and He (The
Spirit) who searches the hearts KNOWS what

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:00.840
the mind of the Spirit is, because He INTERCEDES
for the SAINTS ACCORDING to the WILL OF GOD.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.470
“ We don’t know the will of God and therefore
we cannot PRAY the will of God.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.970
We can just pray the things that are important
to us, we can pray according to our mind but

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:23.940
we NEED HELP and that is why Jesus sent us
the Holy Spirit to HELP us PRAY according

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.550
to the will of God.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:36.670
Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 14:15 He says
"what is the outcome then, I shall pray with

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.280
the Spirit and I shall pray with the mind
also;“ In order to be able to pray effectively,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.760
we need the Holy Spirit.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.970
We need to be able to pray in TONGUES.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.330
We don’t know what we are praying but we
are praying mysteries to God according to

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.980
the will of God by the Holy Spirit dwelling
in us and praying according to the will of

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.980
God.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:15.210
We read that in 1 Corinthians 14:2 He says,
"for the one who SPEAKS IN A TONGUE does not

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:26.840
speak to men but to God; for no one understands,
but in his Spirit he speaks mysteries.”

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.030
When you are praying in a tongue you are praying
mysteries to God.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.210
You are not praying with your mind, your mind
is unfruitful but the Spirit of God that dwells

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:45.680
in you together with your spirit prays mysteries
according to the will of God.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:55.230
That is why we cannot effectively pray according
to the will of God if we have NOT RECEIVED

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.760
the HOLY SPIRIT.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:07.650
We NEED the Holy Spirit of God to ASSIST us
in praying according to the will of God.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.900
And that is why we NEED the HOLY SPIRIT.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.940
We NEED to be BAPTIZED IN THE HOLY SPIRIT
and we NEED to RECEIVE THAT TONGUE which HE

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.729
GIVES US, which will enable us to speak to
God, mysteries that nobody understands.

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.069
The devil does not even understand it.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:33.889
I don’t understand it, you don’t understand
it, nobody understands it but the SPIRIT OF

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:43.069
GOD, PRAYS MYSTERIES unto GOD and that is
why the POWER OF GOD works through those who

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:48.129
WORSHIP HIM in SPIRIT and in TRUTH.

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.780
Have you received the HOLY SPIRIT?

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.539
Do you PRAY in the SPIRIT?

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.319
May Jesus bless you.
