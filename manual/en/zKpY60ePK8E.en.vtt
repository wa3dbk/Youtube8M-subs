00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.320
Hi, my name is Lynn Taylor and my company
is Taylor Made Plans and today I'd like to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.890
show
you

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.450
 A set of construction drawings for a
brand new house or stock plans which I sell

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.990
on my website. Primarily these are inner-city
historic neighborhood house designs.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.579
There are Craftsman, Victorians, and also
very

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.320
contemporary Craftsman
and Victorians. So they're considered

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.750
stock plans, is what you call them
It is like a pre-done plan. You just

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.700
go through and search your square footage
that you're interested in and all the

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.560
specs
and then you can buy a set of construction

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.230
drawings from like seven hundred fifty
dollars, files sent

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.230
Then you can build that house one time
and then if you'd like to build it more

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.530
You send a reuse fee in. So that is what
a stock plan is. It's a pre-done plan you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.840
can also
then take that plan if you want to do

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.920
modifications to it you could hire me then
to modify or change a few things

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.180
and that will add on to the price of
the stock plan fee

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.250
you could also just do a total custom
plan where we take

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.189
just start from scratch completely and
that would be more expensive course and

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.790
I would have to give you the
1:11 fees on that. Today we're going to look

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.810
at a set of
plans and this is my cover sheet. Now,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.960
on the cover sheet I've just got some basic
information.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.780
Climate Zones information. These are
designed in Nashville Tennessee

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.690
and the building code which is based
on 2006 International Residential Code.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.729
Some information here for the Estimator
and the lumberyard. These house plans

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.880
like I said fit into historic neighborhoods
and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.930
they have a historic feel to them.
They're designed to fit in and we're

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.080
not
using customize or replicating the exact

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.820
trim work
but the materials you would use off the

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.770
shelf at one of the lumberyards
or a big box store like Lowes or Home

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.810
Depot.
But they're not like what you'd build

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.350
out in the suburbs
so if a builder is just used to building

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.760
houses in the suburbs it might throw them
for a little loop.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.659
You just need to pay attention to the
details more because it's a little

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.670
different arrangement of materials to
get that historic feel.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.610
Let's go to the next section. Primarily
I want to show you what you're getting in

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.310
your
construction drawings. Sometimes you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.240
know construction plans are not created
equal .You can have a great design and

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.290
then maybe the designer doesn't
have enough technical experience really

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.360
put together a house
everybody has a different level of experience

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.650
so we put a lot of time
an effort and time into our details so

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.810
that when the builder gets out there there's
the least amount of problems, you get

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.590
a better estimate on your drawings
and less guessing and head-scratching,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.580
is what I call it in the field.
So most of the plans are set up the same

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.410
way.
Same type sheets. Different if you have

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.560
a two story or one story.
This here is a first floor plan. You

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.819
got your dimensions, your window sizes right
here

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.750
by the windows. Of course your plumbing,
any particular notes

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.660
that would be required here. Talking
about

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.380
especially like here beside a tub you
want to put a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.489
energy breaks there, which is you go
ahead and insulate that,

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.410
a half inch piece of foam or a quarter-inch
piece of foam behind the tub prior to setting

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.489
the tub.
That's an energy break and an energy-efficient

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.660
note that I have on the drawings.
Let's see what else. I also have dimension

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.440
and notes on the
porch columns and things like that trim

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.150
detail over here.
And here is some general information

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.770
here about Energy Star windows and what
you would want to do if you

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.390
want to get more energy efficient into
your home.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.319
So that is the first floor plan and then
this is the electrical layout. I do not

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.310
put electrical
and all the notes and dimensions on one

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.590
plan. I separate them out
So here you have your basic legend in

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.060
just where your switches and
lights and this is based on

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.060
standard recommendation kind of thing.
Very straight forward. We have a big

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.879
note here that says
to subcontractors if you make a hole,

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.959
seal it.
This is to stop the air infiltration

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.730
going from your crawlspace
into your house if you're subcontractors

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.239
are not careful and do not caulk
and seal up everything then youï¿½re

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.769
just going to have air moving back and forth.
We recommend actually doing a sealed

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.419
crawl space with some air conditioning in
it

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.910
and
this just helps with better air quality

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.290
control and also not breathing the dirt
from your crawl space. Again, these are

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.570
notes from the drawings but
unless the contractor or you enforces

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.910
it they still may not do it just because the
notes are on the drawings.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.090
The next sheet we usually have is
Interior Trim Details. I give different

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.380
options here.
We can go pure Craftsman or

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.340
traditional design making it more modern.
We can have a very

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.440
a simple inexpensive trim detail, so
really

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.340
you can pick and choose which ones of
these you want. These are all custom trim

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.780
so
they are made out of inexpensive wood

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.740
you could pull off the shelf
or you can just go ahead and buy what's

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.810
in stock. So these are just going to
give you a little variation

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.490
on your Interior Trim Details.
Sometimes I have interior elevations,

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.400
sometimes kitchen elevations come with
smaller houses because of community development

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.530
affordable housing
5:23 organizations need them for certain reasons.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.970
This particular house has a fireplace
with built-in bookshelves and so I have

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.310
more
detail there. Also houses with stairs

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.310
in two-stories
I'll have a stair section cut just to

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.960
show you the headroom
also trying to give the Framers some

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.979
dimensions so that you can move a piece of
furniture up those stairs when it's

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:43.460
built.
