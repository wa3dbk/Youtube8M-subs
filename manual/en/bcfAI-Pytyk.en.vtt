00:00:01.549 --> 00:00:03.549
In this video I'd like to explain how we know how many calories

00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:07.197
are in different types of food.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.002
In other words, how is the energy in food measured?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.680
First, let's review what a calorie is.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.599
Before I can define a Calorie, I have to clear up a potentially confusing detail.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:22.969
When we talk about how many calories a food has,

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.329
we are actually talking about kilocalories.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.130
A kilocalorie is a thousand calories.

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.769
When you see the word calorie with a capital C, this means kilocalories,

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:35.246
whereas a small c would just be one calorie.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.609
If we were to talk about foods in terms of one calorie at a time,

00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:46.851
the numbers would be huge.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.046
Most people do not bother with this distinction, so just be aware that we are actually

00:00:50.978 --> 00:00:52.978
working in thousand small calorie units when measuring calories.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.810
I'll clear that up more in a bit and the links in the description

00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:01.847
will provide a thorough overview.

00:01:05.528 --> 00:01:07.528
One calorie is defined as the quantity of heat necessary to raise one kilogram,

00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:12.451
or 1 liter, of water 1Â° Celsius.

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.329
That's 1000 grams.

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:18.497
So, this calorie is actually a kilogram calorie hence, kilocalorie, as I explained.

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.966
This is usually abbreviated k-c-a-l (kcal).

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:26.589
A single calorie, as I said, with a small c, is the amount of heat

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.149
it takes to raise ONE GRAM of water 1 degree Celsius.

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:34.148
That's the same as 1 milliliter.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.390
The small calorie is sometimes called a g-calorie, where g stands for gram.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.270
Current US Dietary Reference Intakes define 1 cal as 4.186 Joules

00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:46.600
and 1 kilocalorie as 4.186 kilojoules.

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:51.280
I'll provide an explanation of a joule in the description below.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.920
To measure the energy from foods, foods are burned inside a special device

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200
using a process called direct calorimetry.

00:02:07.763 --> 00:02:09.760
The device used is called a bomb calorimeter.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.920
This is a metal container inside which the food sample is burned

00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:17.080
in a sealed and pressurized pure oxygen environment.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.440
The food is burned inside the reaction chamber 
 which is ignited by an electrified fuse

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:24.040
running through the top of the chamber.

00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:28.520
This ignites the oxygen and food inside the chamber, which, as it burns,

00:02:29.037 --> 00:02:31.040
gives off heat which is absorbed into the surrounding tank.

00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:40.400
The reaction chamber that the food is burned inside 
 is surrounded by a water bath.

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.560
This water bath is well-insulated so that the outside environment

00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:48.250
cannot change its temperature.

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.900
So the heat from the food in the reaction chamber also

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:53.300
raises the temperature of the water to some extent,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920
which is recorded by a highly accurate thermometer.

00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:59.100
The change in temperature of the water, once the food is combusted,

00:03:00.318 --> 00:03:02.320
is the heat of combustion or the thermal energy of the food,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.420
which gives the caloric content.

00:03:10.187 --> 00:03:12.190
Using this method, the average caloric content

00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:16.240
of a wide variety of foods has been determined.

00:03:17.624 --> 00:03:19.620
These average caloric values are then used to derive an average caloric value

00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:23.860
for different types of macronutrients, and this is how we decided

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:26.430
average caloric value for proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:30.600
Now, if we were only to consider the thermal energy of the macronutrients,

00:03:32.121 --> 00:03:34.120
the numbers would be higher than the ones we are used to hearing.

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.580
For instance, proteins are generally 5.65 Calories per gram.

00:03:41.243 --> 00:03:43.240
This is higher than the 4 grams you've probably been taught.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.200
See, the thermal energy is the gross energy value of the food.

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:50.360
We also have to consider the net energy value for humans.

00:03:58.194 --> 00:04:00.190
As I described how calories were measured, you may have been thinking

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.340
that your body does not ignite food and burn it to ashes.

00:04:04.523 --> 00:04:06.520
You're right! The fact is that we are not capable 
 of deriving ALL of the energy from food.

00:04:10.278 --> 00:04:12.280
Digestion is not one hundred percent efficient so we cannot digest

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.890
one hundred percent of the foods we eat 
 in order to extract energy from them.

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:20.360
The efficiency of digestion for different foods is called the coefficient of digestibility.

00:04:25.562 --> 00:04:27.560
This is usually given as a percentage value.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
For example, meats and fish, on average, have 97% digestibility.

00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:34.560
Also, once the nutrients are absorbed, some of the energy is lost

00:04:36.303 --> 00:04:38.300
in the process of metabolism.

00:04:39.618 --> 00:04:41.620
the nitrogen must be combined with hydrogen to form urea,

00:04:39.618 --> 00:04:41.620
This is especially true of protein, since the 
 body cannot oxidize the nitrogen component,

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:45.830
the nitrogen must be combined with hydrogen to form urea,

00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:49.870
which is excreted in the urine.

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:52.310
This loss of hydrogen, to deal with the nitrogen, represents a loss of energy,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.040
which averages about 19% of a protein molecule's energy lost.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.040
which averages about 19% of a protein molecule's energy lost.

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.720
Because of all this energy loss, the gross energy value, as measured

00:05:03.048 --> 00:05:05.050
with direct calorimetry, and the net energy we humans can derive, will differ.

00:05:10.928 --> 00:05:12.930
So how many calories do lipids, or fats, have?

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.290
Well not all lipids have the same amount of energy.

00:05:18.891 --> 00:05:20.890
A gram of pork or beef fat, on average, yields about 9.5 kilocalories gross.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.280
And 9.5 is also the average for lipids from fish or eggs.

00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:29.330
Butter fat yields about 9.27 Calories and dairy fat gives about 9.25.

00:05:33.464 --> 00:05:35.460
The average for lipids from vegetables and fruits is about 9.3.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.750
All of this makes the average heat of combustion 
for all fats about 9.4 kilocalories per gram.

00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:44.760
The net energy for humans is the same.

00:05:45.907 --> 00:05:47.910
We usually round this down, so you can consider

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.400
the net Calories from fats to be 9 Calories per gram.

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:57.960
Carbohydrates give much less energy per gram than fats.

00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:03.320
Gross energy from glucose is 3.74 kcal per gram, and 4.2 for starch.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.690
The average for carbohydrate is given as 4.2 kcal per gram gross energy,

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.960
and the net energy in humans is the same.

00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:17.930
The actual amount of energy from any carbohydrate varies

00:06:19.206 --> 00:06:21.210
depending on the shape of the molecule.

00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:23.410
The calories from carbohydrate is usually rounded to 4 calories per gram.

00:06:30.805 --> 00:06:32.800
Energy from protein can depend on the amount of nitrogen the protein contains,

00:06:36.326 --> 00:06:38.330
as well as the digestibility of the food.

00:06:40.044 --> 00:06:42.040
The higher the nitrogen content, the lower the amount of energy

00:06:42.606 --> 00:06:44.610
that can be derived through human metabolism.

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.450
Proteins from meat, eggs, beans, and corn have about 16% nitrogen.

00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:51.720
Protein from nuts and seeds, and most grains (cereals)

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:56.410
have a higher nitrogen content of around 18.9%.

00:06:59.046 --> 00:07:01.050
Protein from milk has a lower nitrogen content of about 15.7%.

00:07:03.732 --> 00:07:05.730
The average heat of combustion for protein is 5.65 kcal per gram.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600
The average net energy for humans is given as 4.2 Calories per gram,

00:07:14.311 --> 00:07:16.310
the same as for carbohydrate.

00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:20.320
This, again, is usually rounded to 4 Calories per gram.

00:07:25.564 --> 00:07:27.560
Alcohol actually has higher Calories than most realize.

00:07:29.844 --> 00:07:31.840
Alcohol, or ethanol, yields around 7 kcal per gram through direct calorimetry.

00:07:36.078 --> 00:07:38.080
The net energy for humans is usually the same.

00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:41.240
If, however, a large amount of alcohol is consumed,

00:07:42.475 --> 00:07:44.480
it is possible for less energy to be available to the body,

00:07:45.213 --> 00:07:47.210
which may be due to damage to the mitochondria in the liver cells.
