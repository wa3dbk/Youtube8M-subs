00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.710
Before the wildly popular Halo series, Bungie
was in charge of developing some of the only

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.090
good titles to play if you were a gamer and
owned a Mac instead of a PC (no idea why this

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.010
would be the case, but they did exist).

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.270
The Marathon series was a Sci-fi FPS epic
which really planted the seeds as to where

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.920
this developer would eventually find itself.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.930
The 2nd installment in the Marathon series,
Durandal is now available on the iPhone...

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.930
for free!

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.730
Let's take a look and see if a first person
shooter from 1995 can hold up on a touch screen

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.570
based system over a decade and a half later.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.739
Durandal controls with an on-screen d-pad
for moving and strafing.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.030
The mouse used for looking around is replaced
with sliding your finger along the touch screen.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.790
Firing your weapon can be done by either a
the buttons in the bottom left corner (as

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.239
duel wielding weapons is an option), or by
tapping the screen (but this option needs

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.059
to be turned on in the menu).

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.190
Below the fire buttons are the buttons for
switching weapons and that's really all you

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.240
need to know.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.780
The rest of the game is typical FPS fare.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.810
Walk around a labyrinth searching for buttons
and switches that will open areas and guide

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.119
you to the next level, all while blasting
anything that gets in your way.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.979
Health is revived either via med-packs or
at dispensaries and there are computer terminals

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.880
in which you will communicate with the game's
characters, and receive back-story and plot

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.789
(The Marathon series was lauded for having
a complex story play out along-side the running

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:31.789
and gunning).

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.380
The pitfalls are all you might imagine them
to be.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.439
The controls work, but are not the most intuitive.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.570
Moving and firing at the same time is complicated,
and circle-strafing would require a level

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.729
of practice most would be unwilling to invest
time in.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.920
The level design itself is indicative of the
the time, with a lot of multilevel mazes and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.689
backtracking through large chunks of the landscape
after you acquire a key or hit a switch.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.610
The ambient sound can at times be both atmospheric
and annoying, but it does help immerse the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.970
player... and we can't discuss the graphics
without discussing the game's shop.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.050
Yes, the game itself may be free, and for
that you get Durandal, as it was in 1995 with

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.820
the controls changed to suit its new platform.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.640
If you wish to spend some money however, there
are a couple options available to you, with

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.470
the first being the HD upgrade pack.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.620
With this all the textures of the game have
been upgraded to present a crisper visual

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.920
experience.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.590
Now while Durandal's visuals have certainly
aged, they are not altogether terrible, and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.410
really the HD upgrade only makes things a
little sharper.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.230
Along with this pack, there are personalized
shooting reticules available, and the Master

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.330
Chief mode, which is sort of like popping
all the keyboard codes in Doom on at the same

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.330
time.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.180
You gain god mode, have access to all the
weapons with infinite ammo, and can travel

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.240
to any level you please.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.349
So can we recommend this game?

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.810
If you are a fan of the Marathon games, or
are curious about this slice of gaming history,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.810
go for it.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.160
For others though, the FPS genre has come
such a long way since this game and what it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.080
has to offer might frustrate more than delight
(especially with the new controls).

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.310
Still, giving Durandal a try isn't really
going to set you back financially, so it might

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.940
be worth it.
