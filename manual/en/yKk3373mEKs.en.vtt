00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.770
[AD]

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.880
In the entire history of medicine there were a lot of

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.780
that boggle our imagination.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.539
In this video I will show you ten such records.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.119
10. 52-year-old Willie Jones from Atlanta from the USA

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.500
had the highest recorded body temperature in 1980.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.600
After thermal shock, the man went to the hospital,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.940
where he had recorded body temperature at 115.7 F.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.899
Fiery Willie was discharged from the hospital 24 days after that.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.489
9. The lowest documented human body temperature

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.800
was registered on February, 23 in 1994.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.149
This record belongs to 2-year-old resident of Canada Carly Kozeliski.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.120
When her parents were away from home, the girl was scared

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.030
and she ran outside. The door randomly slammed

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.709
and Carly spent about 6 hours in the cold at a temperature of -7.6 F

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:13.850
When doctors started to warm her, the body temperature

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.939
of the girls was 57.5°F. This incident had no critical

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.569
consequences for her health..

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:24.509
8. 2533 foreign bodies, including 947 English pins were found

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.200
in stomach of 42-year-old woman, suffering from

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.229
obsessive ingestion of subjects. Despite this,

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.109
oddly enough, this glutton had no strong complaints.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.270
The woman only complained of slight pain in her abdomen.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.399
7. The heaviest object ever removed from the stomach,

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.539
was removed from the stomach of 18-year-old American girl

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.529
from Illinois. In her stomach the doctors

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:53.249
found a giant lump of hair weighing 9lbs. The girl suffered from a disease

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:57.049
called Trichophagia, compulsive eating of hair.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.959
The doctors scanned her belly after the patient complained

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.919
of abdominal pain, which lasted for 5 months,

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:06.729
and lose of 39lb of weight.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.979
6. The man from Zimbabwe took the largest number

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.510
of pills; he even entered the Guinness Book of world records.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.320
For 21 years of treatment from 1967 till 1988, he had taken

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.470
nearly 566 thousand pills, and it was more than 70 pills a day.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.850
I think he could even not to eat, taking this number of pills.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.200
I think he could even not to eat, taking this number of pills.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.890
5. British diabetic Samuel Davidson got the most number

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.950
of injections during all his life. From the time he was

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.160
11 years old and till the rest of his life he had got more

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.610
than 78 thousands of insulin injections.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.080
4. U.S. resident Charles Jensen underwent the most number of surgeries.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.800
For 40 years of his life from 1954 till 1994 he underwent

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.450
970 surgeries to remove benign tumors.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.710
3. The longest surgery in history lasted for 96 hours.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.620
From 4th to 8th of February,1951 the doctors of Chicago

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.420
hospital removed 58-year-old Gertrude Lewandowski a giant

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.630
ovarian cyst. Surgeons removed the cyst very carefully

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.500
and slowly to avoid a sudden drop in blood pressure of the patient.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.340
The weight of this cyst is just amazing.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.330
the operation Gertrude weighed 617 lbs,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.860
and after surgery her weight was 308 lbs!!

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.090
2. Norwegian fisherman Jan Resdal survived the longest

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.360
cardiac arrest. After he fell overboard in frosty December

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.569
and his body temp decreased from 96.8 F to 75.2 F,

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.370
the man's heart stopped for 4 hours.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.069
He recovered after connecting to a heart-lung machine.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.050
1. The biggest overload experienced the IndyCar racer

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.130
Kenny Bräck. In 2003, during the race, Kenny got into

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.200
a serious accident. His car after colliding with another car

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.430
crashed into a safety barrier. At the moment

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.850
of collision with the wall the pilot survived

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.510
214 g overload. Multiple fractures and a spinal injury

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.310
thrown the Swede out of action for 1.5 years, never the less

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.880
