00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:17.750
Year Walk is an odd beast that won’t appeal
to everyone.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.730
It’s a slow-paced, quiet and ambient title,
nailing its atmosphere better than anything

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.730
else.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.390
Which isn’t to say it doesn’t do other
things well, because it does.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.520
The story focuses on an ancient Swedish ritual
and vision quest known as “year walking.”

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.489
If successful, those who choose to undergo
a year walk would allegedly be able to see

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.219
into the future.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.960
And so begins your journey as a nameless,
silent year walker.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.579
The controls are simple at first, swiping
left or right, up or down, as if leafing through

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.920
the pages of a book.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.120
Which is an apt description, as I would consider
Year Walk somewhat of an interactive novella,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.350
riddled with mind-bending puzzles.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.769
As you traverse through the snowy Scandinavian
landscape, the wind whistles, the snow crunches

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.440
beneath your feet.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.160
Just as important are the completely silent
moments in the game, which work to heighten

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.450
that feeling of tension and dread.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.240
The forest serves as a fittingly eerie setting
and truly the best way to experience the environment

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.610
is with a pair of headphones.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.630
After your first true scare (and trust me,
the game has numerous) you’ll sometimes

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.970
catch yourself too terrified to take another
step.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.560
Soon after getting to learn your surroundings
the puzzles begin.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.190
Night falls, your year walk starts and you
notice strange markings on trees, a locked

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.689
box sitting in the snow, a creepy doll hanging
in a shed.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.970
Every puzzle is unique and often leaves you
stumped.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.950
I normally have no issues with puzzles that
leave me scratching my head; that’s often

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.860
the sign of a good mind-bender after all.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.030
Yet, I wish Year Walk was clearer on what
kind of touch inputs are required.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.510
It becomes too much of a guessing game and
I found myself in trial and error territory

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.191
most of the time as I swiped frustratingly
at the screen, trying to understand what the

00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:53.810
game wanted me to do.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.560
Keeping a pen and paper handy is essential,
as many of the puzzles will have you jotting

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.000
down information necessary for puzzles later
on.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.649
It’s a nice touch, making you feel more
engaged and a real, tangible part of the year

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.110
walking experience.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.509
When the puzzles work everything comes together
in one seamlessly unsettling package.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.160
The visuals are something out of a picture
book, very minimalist in design, much like

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.350
the game’s sound.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.000
It all works cohesively, luring you into a
false sense of security before making you

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.920
realize this isn’t one of those books you
read as a child.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.580
And again, the scares take you completely
off-guard, making you resent how endearing

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.700
the visuals are.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.090
It all works in a smart and slick way.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.170
It’s extremely important to explain that
Year Walk requires you to download a secondary

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.980
free app titled the “Year Walk Companion.”

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.940
In order to truly appreciate the entirety
of the game, the companion is essential.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.950
Again, my comparison to a novella rings true,
as the companion is all about reading back-story

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.940
and learning more about the Swedish folklore
of year walking.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.900
But if that doesn’t interest you, simply
wait until you’ve finished the actual game

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.780
– the companion will come into play in an
exciting new way that will truly surprise

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.780
you.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.840
Giving myself a few days after I completed
the game before writing this review, I’m

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.190
surprised to find how Year Walk has stayed
in my mind.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.000
Walking through those woods, I was there.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.090
I was a part of it all as the story began
to unravel.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.950
Maybe in the moment, the obscure puzzle design
will take you out of the experience.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.540
But once it’s all said and done, the visions
feel like they’re yours.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.530
As I said before, Year Walk isn’t for everyone,
but if you’ve stuck with me this far, then

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.960
it just might be.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.600
Treat yourself to something different.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.100
At the very worst, you’ve just experienced
something wholly unique on your mobile device.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.380
At the very best, all of those feelings Year
Walk made you feel will resonate with you

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.780
for years to come.
