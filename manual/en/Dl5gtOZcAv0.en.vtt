00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.949
&gt;&gt;If it drives like a Wagon-R, feels like
a Wagon-R then it must be a Wagon-R. Or perhaps

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.949
a Wagon-R with a heavy dose of make up.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:01:32.340
Presenting this cosmetically enhanced Maruti
Wagon-R StingRay.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:02:03.460

Other additions include these 14-inch alloys.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.070
In terms of safety kit you get a single driver's
airbag and ABS.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.400
The StingRay gets a key-embedded remote.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.360
Step into the StingRay and the whole thing
looks very familiar.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.080
The only difference is in the color -- the
StingRay gets all-black interiors.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.240
Let's look at the minor differences though
-- with the StingRay, you get steering audio

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.490
controls for the integrated music system that
has USB and Aux connections.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.900
You also get StingRay branded fabric upholstery
that feels quite good.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.829
Other standard Wagon-R features continue,
like these pop-out cupholders, power-windows

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.530
with the addition of a driver's side auto
down and electrically adjustable mirrors.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.160
The multi-information display shows you range,
average consumption, tripmeter and odometer.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.020
In terms of space, well, here's the thing
about boxes -- they pack in a lot.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.650
And the Wagon-R StingRay with its boxy dimensions
is pretty spacious for four adults -- and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.760
I say four, because the car is not that wide.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.160
Legroom and headroom are good, and you also
get adjustable headrests.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:21.889
The 180 litre boot is a tad small, but the
60:40 folding seats allow a degree of flexibility.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.410
Powering the StingRay is the familiar K10B,
3-cylinder, 1 litre petrol engine that puts

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.449
out 67 bhp of power and 90 newton metres of
torque.

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:37.410
The 5-speed manual transmission is a bit notchy,
but the clutch is super light, just like the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.890
electric power steering.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.680
The huge glass area means you get good all-round
visibility in this car.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.549
The StingRay's handling and ride quality are
very neutral.

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.549
Our drive was too short for a detailed fuel-efficiency
test, but the MID told us we were getting

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.919
about 13.8 kilometers to the litre.

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.400
Overall, the StingRay is a car that adds a
bit of style to the otherwise staid looking

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.790
Wagon-R, while retaining the car's virtues
of practicality and functionality.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.290
It's a car for those who want space and practicality,
with a little bit of style.
