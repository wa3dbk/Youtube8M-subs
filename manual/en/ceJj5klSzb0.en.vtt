00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:14.538
- [Narrator] This program
is brought to you by

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:18.121
B-A-S-F The Chemical Company.

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:21.399
- Hey, welcome to Stuff
to blow your kid's mind.

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:22.532
My name is Robert Lamb.

00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:23.707
- My name is Julie Douglas, and today

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:25.392
we are talking about solar power.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.149
- The sun is constantly bombarding

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.399
our planet with all this solar energy.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.279
It heats our world and plants use it

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.005
to feed themselves via photosynthesis.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:35.872
- So we're gonna take
a closer look at this

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:37.943
with this solar powered experiment.

00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:41.102
- For this you're gonna need
two identical cups or glasses.

00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:44.189
Wrap one in white cardboard,
the other in dark cardboard.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:46.046
Then put some water into each glass

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.713
and set them out in the
sun for a couple of hours.

00:00:48.713 --> 00:00:50.425
We just retrieved these from the sun.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.245
We put a thermometer into each one,

00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:54.395
and we can actually observe that the water

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:57.003
inside of the dark cup is a little hotter

00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:58.896
than the water inside the white cup.

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.711
- What's happening here is that the cup

00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:03.839
that's wrapped in black is
actually absorbing more heat.

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.232
More of that sunlight.

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:09.189
Whereas the water in the
cup that is wrapped in white

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.286
is reflecting off that sunlight.

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:13.054
- This is the same
principle that we use in

00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:17.155
solar collection technologies,
such as solar cells.

00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:19.209
In our experiment we
were able to witness how

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.689
dark objects absorb light more readily,

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.637
and emit more thermal
energy than lighter objects.

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:27.291
And it all comes down to color.

00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:30.316
And the same is true in a city.

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:31.273
Just look around you.

00:01:31.273 --> 00:01:33.761
You will find yourself
completely surrounded by,

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:37.272
generally dark buildings and
very dark surfaces underfoot.

00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:40.027
- Yes, so think of all
that cement and the asphalt

00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:42.942
and then add to the equation
that you have this kind of

00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:46.253
maze configuration of
buildings and that makes it

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:48.853
really difficult for the heat to escape.

00:01:48.853 --> 00:01:51.210
Which actually means that
you're now going to have

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.062
a two to five degree
increase in temperature

00:01:54.062 --> 00:01:56.431
which is pretty significant
especially if it's

00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.099
a hot summer day or if
there's a heat wave.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.465
- It may not sound like
a lot, but everybody that

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.648
gets a little warmer is
going to reach out for that

00:02:03.648 --> 00:02:06.689
air conditioning knob and
turn it up just a little bit.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.642
And then that's gonna consume more energy.

00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:10.723
So there's a real cost involved

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:13.743
with this increase in city heat.

00:02:13.743 --> 00:02:15.755
But it seems like we might
be able to solve that

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:17.702
maybe with just a bucket of white paint.

00:02:17.702 --> 00:02:20.913
- Yeah it really is that
easy all you would have to do

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:23.992
is paint the rooftops of a city white.

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:26.047
And you would be absorbing less light,

00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:28.550
you would be emitting less heat, and that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.024
would probably be about a one
degree drop in temperature,

00:02:32.024 --> 00:02:34.375
which, I mean that could
save millions of dollars.

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:35.924
- Right, it doesn't sound like a lot but

00:02:35.924 --> 00:02:37.297
when you start looking
at the energy it takes

00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:40.949
to cool a city, it
really has a huge impact.

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:42.373
Here on earth a little white paint

00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:44.105
could potentially cool down a city.

00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:47.238
But out here in space, it
might just save the planet.

00:02:47.238 --> 00:02:48.801
- Ah but before we talk about saving

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.351
the planet let's talk about the way that

00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:52.941
light behaves in the void of space.

00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.642
- Sunlight is made up of
photons, so when sunlight

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:59.286
hits a reflective surface,
it bounces those photons off.

00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:00.711
And actually exerts a force,

00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:03.085
not unlike the wind behind a sail.

00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:05.842
- That's right, and this is
called solar sail technology.

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:10.248
And the idea is that we could
use this to propel spacecraft.

00:03:10.248 --> 00:03:12.452
- And we could save the
planet, and here's how:

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:15.201
imagine the earth and
now imagine an astroid,

00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:18.402
a deadly astroid on a collision
course with our planet.

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:19.891
What we want to do is nudge it

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:22.585
slightly off course so
that it doesn't hit us.

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:25.215
And the way that we can do
this, one of several ways

00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:28.243
we could do this, would be
to coat it with white paint

00:03:28.243 --> 00:03:31.203
or some sort of reflective substance.

00:03:31.203 --> 00:03:33.685
So then the photons
would hit this substance

00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:36.243
and bounce off pushing the astroid

00:03:36.243 --> 00:03:39.604
just off course enough to
where it would miss us.

00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:42.123
- Now think back to that
simple experiment that we did

00:03:42.123 --> 00:03:44.059
with that glass of water and

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.750
the sunlight streaming though it.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.059
And now think about how we can
actually harness that light

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:53.055
to do amazing things, here
on earth and in space.

00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:55.082
