00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.290
&lt;&lt;Adult learners are some of the fastest growing
students at colleges and universities across

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.290
the nation.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.080
At Penn State, an adult learner can be defined
by several characteristics.&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080
Martha Jordan
PSU Adult Learner Services Director

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.960
&lt;&lt;“An adult learner is someone who is at
least 24 years of age or older or is a veteran

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:29.330
of the armed services or is an active military
or has had a gap in going back to school or

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.360
have had some type of adult learner role.”&gt;&gt;

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.270
Erin Calandra
PSU Outreach Reporter

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.440
&lt;&lt;There’re over 51 thousand adult learners
taking graduate and undergrad courses… credit

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.750
and non-credit at Penn State and that number
is growing…&gt;&gt;

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.750
Martha Jordan
PSU Adult Learner Services Director

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.629
&lt;&lt;“We see more and more people who are being
laid off from their jobs and unfortunately

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.899
that means that they have to be retrained,
rehired in possibly a new career.”&gt;&gt;

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:56.899
Erin Calandra
PSU Outreach Reporter

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.340
&lt;&lt;Penn State wants to provide the best services
available for adult learners.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.890
That’s why it hosts an annual conference,
to share best practices across all campuses

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.369
within the university system.&gt;&gt;

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.369
Ann Williams
Chancellor; PSU Lehigh Valley

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.630
&lt;&lt;“Both the 18-year-old and the adult population
in Pennsylvania are in need of the services

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.689
that Penn State offers and the quality of
services and that’s what these conferences

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.219
are all about, to make sure that the people
who are in the Penn State University system

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.450
are able to provide those services to both
populations.”&gt;&gt;

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.580
Erin Calandra
PSU Outreach Reporter

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.540
&lt;&lt;At the conference… chancellors, faculty,
administrators and most importantly adult

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.219
learners… share what’s working.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.770
Arthur Brunt, an adult learner majoring in
Business at Penn State Berks in Reading, PA,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.140
admits going back to school as an adult learner
can be a little nerve wracking…&gt;&gt;

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.140
Arthur Brunt
Adult Lerner; Penn State Berks

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.720
&lt;&lt;“Well a little fear, intimidation being
amongst younger peers and wondering if we

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.789
still have the capacity to learn quickly,
being accepted, forming a network, social

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.390
network to be able to communicate and interact
with other people.”&gt;&gt;

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.390
Erin Calandra
PSU Outreach Reporter

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.130
&lt;&lt;But the services offered by Penn State,
bonding with professors and reaching out to

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.210
others helped ease those nerves.&gt;&gt;

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.650
Arthur Brunt
Adult Lerner; Penn State Berks

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:16.970
&lt;&lt;“Most people who I interacted with at
Penn State were really just naturally nice

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:26.769
people who were able to communicate with me
and be able to interact with me and help in

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:27.769
any way that they could.”&gt;&gt;

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:28.769
Erin Calandra
PSU Outreach Reporter

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.190
&lt;&lt;Catering to adult learners is something
Penn State takes seriously…&gt;&gt;

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.190
Ann Williams
Chancellor; PSU Lehigh Valley

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.350
&lt;&lt;“I think that Penn State has always been
a leader in continuing education. Penn State

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.370
University is looking at how they can make
their process a little easier so they can

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.410
come into the Penn State campuses and also
what support services they need to complete

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.519
their educational programs.”&gt;&gt;

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.519
Erin Calandra
PSU Outreach Reporter

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.930
&lt;&lt;The combination of younger college graduates
leaving P-A for work… and with P-A’s aging

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.650
population… about 2 million residents over
the age of 65… makes educating adults a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.720
crucial endeavor for the Commonwealth.&gt;&gt;

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.720
Martha Jordan
PSU Adult Learner Services Director

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.950
“What we’ve got to do is make sure that
our work force is up to speed with new technology

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.379
and new types of jobs that are being created
so we have to retrain them get them better

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.129
educated to go out and fulfill that to better
our economy.”&gt;&gt;

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.129
Erin Calandra
PSU Outreach Reporter

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.250
&lt;&lt;Graduating is something on Brunt’s “bucket
list” and he encourages anyone else who

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.220
shares the same goal to jump in head first,
no matter what your age.&gt;&gt;

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.739
Arthur Brunt
Adult Lerner; Penn State Berks

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.220
“I don’t think they should think of age
as a factor. It is an opportunity and its

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.310
what that opportunity means to you in the
long run is what you should be thinking about.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:46.080
If they feel there is even the smallest chance,
they should go for it because with it they

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.780
have a far greater chance for success than
without it.”&gt;&gt;
