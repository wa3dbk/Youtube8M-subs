00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.760
-Hello.
-Hi, Bethanie, how are you doing?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.120
Good.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.160
-Where to ?
-To my flat.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.960
If a player should inspire your game,
who would it be and why?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.680
My favourite tennis player was Monica Seles.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.680
I liked her aggressive style of play.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.960
She was one of the first players
to take it on the rise and hit the ball hard.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.200
I met her when I was 10 years old.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.720
It was a huge moment
and I got to hit with her for a few minutes.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.240
She signed my racket bag, I still have it!

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.520
-So the word for Monica is "thanks"…
-Exactly! Thank you, Monica, you inspired me.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.400
Can you cast a magical spell
to bring back the sun, please?

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.800
-I will think good thoughts.
-I can make the noise.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.400
Perfect!
The sun will be back tomorrow, that's my prediction.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.800
Message for you coach for tomorrow.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.680
I have to say that my coach is always early,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.600
and I'm late for everything.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.600
-He's in the car there?
- Yes.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.760
-Hi, coach!
-Can they hear us? That's funny.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.800
Goog thing I said something good about him!

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.360
To become a great player
you need to make sacrifice.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.640
What do you miss the most?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.480
I am on a very strict diet right now

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.320
and I miss all the food that I used to eat,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.280
I miss that the most.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.120
After the tournament,
I'll have a cheat day,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.520
but now I can just watch everybody eat.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.160
-That's pretty hard.
-My team is mean.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.000
Choose a thing in the funny box…

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.800
Pretty weird.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.640
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks, that was fun.
