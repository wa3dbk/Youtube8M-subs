00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.560
Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen from vanveenbulbs.com
and next we're going to talk all about red

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.500
hot pokers,kniphofia uvaria, however you want
to pronounce it but either way, they're a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.870
really pretty plant. Now, red hot pokers are
originally from South Africa so they can handle

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.090
quite a bit of cold temperature, people tell
me that they can grow them in Minnesota, even,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.710
and all they do is mulch them a little bit,
so they can handle a lot of cold whether.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.500
A story I like to remember is, they were found
in South Africa in the sixteen hundreds, fifteen

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.940
hundreds even, they brought them to England
and they only grew them in the greenhouses

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.469
because they assumed everything had to grow
in greenhouses, that was from South Africa,

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.899
and then, until the seventeen hundreds, a
farmer accidentally left some outside and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.399
they survived the Winter so they realized
then, that a lot of South African plants can

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.039
grow in England and colder climates. So, it
took them two hundred years to figure it out

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.280
so I'm always amazed that they're such a tough
plant. Now, red hot pokers get these big candy

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.020
corn type of flowers on them, they're red
and yellow and hummingbirds love them, they're

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.900
probably my number one hummingbird plant,
next to crocosmia. They're just a root so

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.671
when I'm growing them, you don't have to do
a whole lot, you don't need to transplant

00:01:15.671 --> 00:01:21.610
them very often, they love to be crowded.
And, as I said, they're just a root stock

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.570
so you can even separate them out very easily.
They'll multiply quickly so over the years,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.060
you can separate them out and in five, ten
years from now, you'll get lots and lots of

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.990
starts. So, as long as you've got some root
and some stem, you can start a new plant.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.840
In saying that, I've even found little pieces
of root and planted them and they've made

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.250
it. So, just make sure that the roots are
covered up but the green's exposed. They're

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.384
pretty tough, these we just transplanted not
too long ago so I think it might take them

00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:56.170
a couple of years to really look good and
get growing. I just love them and they're

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.090
easy to divide. I used to think that they
were just a grandmas flower because I saw

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.420
them in a lot of older ladies yards but now
I realized that the hummingbirds love them

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.810
and I love them and that they're one of the
joys of my garden.
