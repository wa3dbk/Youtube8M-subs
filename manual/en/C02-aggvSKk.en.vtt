00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.930
Oh that's lovely.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.269
What an amazingly splendidly lovely car this is, and i'm lucky enough to know the owner

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.619
Jo, I've known you since what? we were seventeen? mm

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.599
there a bouts, that long, and now it's a long time.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:20.490
We're going to use this car to remake one of the first films we ever did.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.580
The film i'm talking about is on YouTube,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.850
go and search for 'how to photograph a fast car' and you should find a film where we make

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.220
this image.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.850
Now this was done some time ago and this was the very first film we ever did

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.840
and i know i left out some crucial information.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.389
If you're some one who's seen this on YouTube and you're frustrated by that,

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:41.030
this one's dedicated to you.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.260
The key to getting movement into something

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.649
is your shutter speed,

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.790
you need a slow shutter speed to create
movement to create the blurry effect.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.210
But obviously we don't want to blur Jo or her car, so

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.780
the camera and the car have got to move together nice and smoothly.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.350
If you're a proper car photographer
doing it for a living, you might have a

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.680
rig made out of steel which will clamp in just underneath the car and come out here

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.630
and you can mount the camera on it, and move it to where you want it,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.150
it'll be very sturdy and very solid.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.050
But if you don't want to go to the expense of doing that, you can use something as simple as

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.710
a little tripod.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.990
All i'm going to do is literally sit it on the wing of the car

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.080
you may notice i have little soft rubber feet here because the last thing we wanna do is damage the paint work.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.830
This is original plaint work too, this car has never been restored, is that right?

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.950
yeah, never been restored.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.680
I've got some little bits of tape on here, because i want to make sure

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.529
that none of the little

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.130
cornery bits of plastic actually touch the paint work

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.420
either.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.340
So, i'm going to sit the tripod on those bits of tape like that, and I've already

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.800
kind of got it ready, there we go.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.750
And you'll also notice that I've got a cable release going on here too because

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.670
the last thing i want to do is to vibrate the camera during the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.350
exposure.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.500
Movement is all about shutter speed,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.230
you need a slow shutter speed in order to create movement or a fast shutter speed

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.510
in order to freeze it, to stop it, to get rid of it.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.929
Now the alter shutter speed for this shot, i reckon is about half a

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:11.900
second.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.370
so that's the first thing i'm gonna do is shoot in manual mode for this

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.260
really.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.049
so you've got full control.

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.659
i'm going in to the camera

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.939
and i'm just gonna set

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.919
a half a second, actually i'm not i'm going to go for a one second exposure okay.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.060
One second the shutter will open,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.200
stuff will move and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.569
then the shutter will close.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.829
Now i can't tell you what aperture you're gonna need because i don't know

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.430
what light you're shooting in,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.150
and this is crucial you've obviously got to get the exposure correct.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.159
We're shooting in the evening

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.930
and it's a bit of an over cast sort of an evening and we're under trees,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.409
and this tunnel here

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.760
is brilliant because it blocks some of
the sky reflections

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.660
it makes it a little bit darker so we
can use the slow shutter speed and it

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.960
gives us plenty of things to blur in the picture. If you try this out on an open

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.720
prairie somewhere or something like that
without stuff either side of the road,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.180
there's nothing to blur is there?

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.959
you won't get much of an effect.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.849
Try and do it somewhere a bit quite so you don't get in everyone's way,

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.369
there's a few cars coming through here

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.379
but the crucial thing is stuff either side of the road.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.049
so we've set our one second exposure

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.599
now i need to set

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.549
the aperture in that will work with that exposure.

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.159
so if i go

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.060
into

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.349
my

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.269
info button up, so i can see the light meter

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.319
as you an see I've set a one second exposure

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.569
at F ten and it's saying it's over exposed.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.189
So i need to change, that's the wrong one, here we go, my aperture

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.869
until the light meter is about in the middle.

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:47.359
This is a very dark green car, cameras think that everything is mid grey

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.249
so actually i want it to be a little bit tiny bit darker than the cameras light meter

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:52.760
thinks i do.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.090
If you don't know what i'm talking about
you need to go and take a look at the exposure films.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.249
so i'm just gonna change my, I've done it again wrong one, there we go, i'm

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:03.370
going to F twenty which is just under exposed very very very

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.529
slightly,

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.639
because i want to get the exposure right.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.069
Now in these lighting conditions, i'm using an iso

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.789
of two hundred, which is pretty low, so I've got nice fine quality and good

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:14.959
colours.

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.300
As i say if you have more light going on here,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.440
you might not be able to get a one
second exposure at F twenty with

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.570
two hundred iso.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.879
You might need to go to one hundred iso to make the camera less sensitive.

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.809
Even then, that might not be enough and you might need to use

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:33.729
something like a neutral density filter,

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.190
I've got one here.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.259
This is like a pair of sunglasses, it's you kinda put it over the lens

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.850
and it just cuts light out that's all it does, there's no colour in it.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.600
This is a cokin you can get lee which are absolutely brilliant at it i have to say,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.830
and it has a little bracket which slots on the front, you slide it in and it will cut out the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.659
light.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.310
It will allow you to set

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.229
slow exposures.

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.239
If you don't need to stop out a huge
amounts of light you can sometimes do

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:02.449
this with a polarizing filter because that will cut out two slots of light on it's own,

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.270
as it is in these conditions i don't need to.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.330
so we've got

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.689
a one second exposure at F twenty,

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.919
i'm using a ten millimeter lens because there's lot's of width going on here

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.710
and i want these beautiful louvers on the bonnet

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.449
which is running back here to Jo who is going to be in the driving seat.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.889
Now your driver has got to keep really still.

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.239
Right, so Jo is going to sit there, and she's not gonna move a muscle, she's going to

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:31.509
going to be in a driving kind of position

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.180
you're kind of be thinking well if you've seen the other film

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.139
why is she going to be in a driving sort of position?

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.449
wait, the moment is coming.

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.750
We're pretty much ready, the last thing i want to do is to make sure that

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.529
my camera is set in mirror lock-up, to minimize vibrations.

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.629
Mirror lock up means i can press the shutter once, it lifts the mirror out

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.869
the way and locks it in position, that's for moving vibrations from the camera

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:57.660
and when i press it again

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.460
it will open the shutter to let the light in

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.410
and that's when all the magic happens.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.990
So Jo, i'm going to ask you, can you put your fleece jacket on please

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.259
to look the part, it's a bit of a muggy kind of a warm,

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.889
evening  and Jo's got a

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.970
genuine fleecy jacket.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.750
Very hairy and really itchy.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.550
but it is kinda of you know makes it all work, makes it look the part.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.070
So our camera's ready, we've got that all set up,

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.800
we know all of the exposures right,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.860
Jo we've got no traffic on the road so that's brilliant. If you

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.229
just try and keep your eyes on probably Jane.

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.119
Don't look at the camera, and keep really really still.

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:41.729
Now all we have to do is let the brake off, and i'm gonna

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.359
yeah let's get it rolling it is not
push the car, there we go let's get it rolling, it doesn't have to go that fast that should be enough.

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:46.819
and press the shutter,

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:48.419
shutter opens

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:50.509
it stays open for a second and then, it

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:51.330
closes.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.419
Thanks Jo.

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.059
Do you see what i mean about your camera falling off it's incredibly unlikely at that

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:58.800
sort of speed.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.130
and even if id did, you're here

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.949
just catch it just grab hold of it.

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:05.329
So let's have a look and see what our

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:06.690
shot

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.560
looks like.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.899
Wake my camera up.

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:12.089
here we go,

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:16.689
yeah that's pretty cool i don't know if you can see it in the back there but

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:20.280
it looks really nice, doesn't it. That is such a simple and easy way to get some

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.840
fast motion blur into a car shot.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.060
Can i go in your car Jo? haha
