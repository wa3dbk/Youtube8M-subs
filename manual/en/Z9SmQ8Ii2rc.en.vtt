TRANSCRIPT:

00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:06.059
Voicover (MJ from Coxy's Big Break):
Apart from its award-winning wines, the Tahbilk

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:12.170
Winery and Vineyard is also home to Australia’s
largest concentration of catfish. Yes, catfish.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.980
That’s where Wayne Koster from the Department
of Sustainability and Environment comes in.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.900
Wayne Koster (DSE):
So this is a freshwater catfish.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.699
MJ (presenter):
Wow, he’s a funny looking thing isn’t

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:22.699
he?

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:23.760
Wayne:
Yeah, they’re quite an unusual looking fish.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.240
They’re got these whiskers at the front
of their snout which they

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.359
use to sense out food.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.630
Voicover (MJ from Coxy's Big Break):
Researchers and fish ecologists like Wayne

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.210
are using electronic tracking to learn more
about the threatened freshwater catfish.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.170
MJ:
Alright Wayne, I’m all kitted out, how does

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.170
it work?

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.250
Wayne:
Well, this is a radio tracker, each of our

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.469
radio transmitters puts out a unique signal
and using the antenna we’re able to track

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.469
the movements of the fish.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.820
MJ:
So Wayne how long would you do this for?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.650
Wayne:
We actually did some tracking over a couple

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.180
of days, getting out every hour over that
period so pretty, pretty long sessions.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.180
MJ:
What about your arms, do they get a bit sore?

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.590
Wayne:
Yeah they certainly do yeah. Need a good rest

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.270
at the end of it.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.270
MJ:
But it’s worth it huh.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.570
Wayne:
Yeah definitely, knowing which areas or which

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.930
habitats freshwater catfish use is really
important it means that those areas can be

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.520
protected. It also means that those sorts
of habitats can be reinstated in areas where

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.929
catfish may have disappeared from.

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:19.410
Voicover (MJ from Coxy's Big Break):
Now, if you love being on the water, you can’t

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.490
go past Nagambie. Fed by the Golburn River,
its lakes, lagoons and wetlands enjoy a constant

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.560
water supply. The water is ideal for sailing,
rowing, canoeing, or waterskiing. But today,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.050
I’ve chosen fishing. Wally Cubbin is part
of the Nagambie Angling Club. Today, he’s

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.429
showing me the ropes.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.460
MJ:
Wally what sort of fish do you catch here?

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.690
Wally Cubbin:
Red fin, Murray cod and also catfish – a

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.319
fish that wasn’t around but since the waterways
are being managed

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.710
properly now the catfish are coming back which
is excellent. Because we’ve got a good range

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.710
of native fish then.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.360
MJ:
And what’s your biggest tip for fishing

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.360
for me?

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.360
Wally:
Biggest tip?

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.360
MJ:
Yeah.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.229
Wally:
Have patience. As far as bank fishing goes

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.280
you’ve got to have patience. You can sit
down, relax, read a book,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.080
listen to the wireless.
You got a bite, quick!

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.450
MJ:
Oh! So what do I do just reel it in like that?

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.450
Wally:
You wind ‘im in yeah.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.450
MJ:
I got one!

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.890
Wally:
And he’s kicking too that’s good.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.960
MJ:
So what have I got?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.340
Wally:
Red fin. He’d be round about three quarters

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.270
of a pound might be a pound.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.180
MJ:
Oh look at that you’re a good teacher huh.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.180
Wally:
Yeah, no doubt about it.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.810
