00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.080
Your identity?

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.430
Unnamed humanoid.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.700
Your objective?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.700
Collect the rings.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.700
The reason?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.640
I don’t know, because it’s fun?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.680
If you’re looking for the humanoid’s motivation,
well...this probably isn’t a game for you.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.340
But if you’re down for a retro punch square
to the face, this ode to the old-school leaves

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.570
one hell of a bruise.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.320
It’s a right-hook of retro!

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.090
It’s Crosstown for the Xbox 360.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:52.600
Since it was released in 2009, you might call
this an “old game” by downloadable standards.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.080
And since it looks like it’s running on
an Apple IIe, it feels even older.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.530
This is another one of those games I like
to refer to as “modern retro,” new releases

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.440
that take inspiration—in some cases, entire
concepts—from bygone eras of game design.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.870
But what makes this one unique is how genuine
it feels.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.700
If you told me Crosstown is actually an obscure
late seventies arcade game, I’d have no

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.290
reason to doubt you.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.420
Unless your fingers were crossed.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.590
In which case, you’re a jerk.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.479
So Crosstown is this weird city with 40 different
levels.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.130
Evidently, in the future, cities have levels.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.159
And it’s your job to collect four rings
scattered across each of them, which is easier

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.420
said than done when you’re being chased
by Neeners and Aggrogators and Dogdozers and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.950
Bouncebacks...

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.950
What’s next?

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.900
Snozzwangers and Vermicious Knids?

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.720
See, just about every level introduces a new
enemy with new abilities, some of which really

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.130
force you to change your approach.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.689
In fact, things start off kind of slow, with
your enemies confined to the maze the same

00:01:58.689 --> 00:01:59.689
way you are.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.979
But it’s not long before new foes are walking
through walls, creating new ones and blowing

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:04.979
others up.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.580
And that’s when things get really frantic,
and Crosstown shows its true colors.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.950
In fact, in some of the later levels, you
have to deal with enemies that create walls,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.450
destroy walls, expel lasers and spawn walking
explosives, all the while dodging the occasional

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:28.160
laser of your own, which comes back at you
if it goes off the screen.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.650
So will you rage quit?

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.650
Probably.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.650
Will you swear at your television?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.840
Oh, for sure, but in a good way.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.580
And yeah, Crosstown is infuriating...but that’s
in a good way, too.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.580
Factor in its endless mode and multiplayer,
and this is actually a nice little package

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.019
for such a retro game.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.359
It even has a special ending for those of
you finish the game without dying.

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.040
Good luck with that.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.049
It’s Pac-Man meets Robotron meets torture.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.720
In a good way.
