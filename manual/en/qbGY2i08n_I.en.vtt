Hi, I am Candi Cane-Canncel with Expert Village.
So in this clip we are going to add some eyes

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.309
and a little mouth to our little doll. First
thing we are going to do is take another color

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.690
of our felt and just cut out a rectangle.
From that, we are going to cut out circles.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:40.920
You can do these as circular shapes or if
you want them more oval, it's up to you. So

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:50.579
we are going to take one of our felt circles,
and take a sequence, take a sequence and stick

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.750
it on to our felt circle. We are going to
take some embroidery thread, in this case

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.750
I am using like a deep navy, and you are just
going to insert it through the back in to

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.930
the little hole. Sometimes these are a little
tough to pull out because they make the hole

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.610
kind of small. Once you get it out, just come
all the way in and you are going to make like

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:33.430
a star pattern. So just come back down, then
come across from the back, come back in, pull

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:54.049
this through again. Go on to the next, insert
it through the hole again.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:03.909
Come on this side, insert it through the hole
again. And you are just making like a little

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.629
star pattern. You could do as many of these
as you like. You could have just one line

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:17.900
going across. You could have two lines. Whatever
you like and you just want to make sure the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:28.139
knot is secure and go ahead and trim it. You
are going to do the same thing for the other

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.540
eye and after you have done that, we will
go ahead an attach them.
