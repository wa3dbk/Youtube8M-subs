Hi everyone!

00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.080
Lately I've noticed a lot of women hating
on other women for... silly reasons.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.420
Like the way she dresses, or the way she talks,
or just the way she expresses herself in general.

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.789
Which leads us to today's video: a girl-hate
face mask tutorial.

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.700
So first step, you're gonna wanna tie your
hair back.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.500
I like to leave one strand out because I'm
not like other girls.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.250
Because, you know, it's an insult to see similarities
in yourself

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.769
and people who identify as the same gender
as you.

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.089
But do pull the rest of your hair back to
create as much distance as you can.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.220
Like you're distancing yourself from fifty
percent of the population

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.150
to somehow please the other fifty percent
of the population, in like a weird... way.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.280
Math! [CHUCKLES]

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.440
The next step is to wash your face. Now you
can use your hands, or a face cloth,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.570
but I use, uh, a Clarisonic, which my best
friend got for me. Which is really nice of her.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.640
Oh, battery's flat. Which is funny, because
I'm pretty sure a BEST friend

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.240
would get me something that would never run
out of batteries, Olivia.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.260
God I hate her so much.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.760
So you've washed your face. Gently pat it
dry with a towel.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.080
This may be kind of gross, I've actually had
this towel since I was a kid.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.570
Which is how long the media's been conditioning
me to compete with other women

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.299
over jobs, men and everything else.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.869
Suck up all the extra water on your face,
like you're sucking up all the good will you

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.009
have for other women.

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.759
Next step is apply your mask.

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.359
I'm using, uh, Traditional Expectations of
Femininity.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.200
Ugh, it smells a little old, like archaic
even. Um, but it's okay.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.250
So this is, this is your mask. And you're
gonna wanna take it and gently... 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.750
place it on your face... and smooth.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.900
And don't leave any room for other definitions
of what it means to be a woman,

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.989
because God forbid you do an intersectional
mask.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.920
That would just be a nightmare of a quality.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.620
And the next step obviously is to just wait
for half an hour. You might get lonely, but

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.890
you shouldn't be surprised.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.800
♫ MUZAK ♫

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.920
It's hard to move or feel anything with these
constricting Expectations of Femininity on my face.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.299
Okay so, the final step obviously is to peel
the mask off.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.469
It may hurt a little bit at first, but your
skin will actually be better without it.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.749
It's so important to acknowledge and support
other women.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.060
That doesn't mean you can't be critical and
ask questions when you see something problematic.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.039
But tearing someone down for no reason hurts
us all.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.879
And it perpetuates a cycle that quite frankly
sucks.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.280
