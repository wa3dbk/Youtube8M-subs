JOHN VANDEBROOKE: This is John Vandebrooke
on behalf of Expert Village. Today, we're

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.120
going to talk about advanced encaustic painting.
Looking at that picture, you can see that

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.280
there's all kinds of different embellishments
in that painting. And I thought I'd just show

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:23.240
you a couple ideas that I have in there. For
one, it's got a lot of gels, transparent gels

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.990
that I have painted on top of the wax and
they come in art stores different--there's

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.960
transparent, then there's marbled effects
on the different gels and I've used that,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.249
painted it on top of the wax and on some cases
there, I've actually dusted that when it was

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:44.699
wet with some metallic powders just to get
some different looks. So, this is one thing

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:52.760
that's in there. Another thing that is kind
of interesting is that I took a DVD like this.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.500
I took an embossing gun and I heated the DVD
and once you heat that DVD, you can then take

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:09.220
a pair of scissors and actually cut that DVD
up like that. So, once you have a piece of

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:21.280
that DVD cut out, you could then take a rubber
stamp. And you could stamp an image on that

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:33.170
DVD like this. Now, there's an image of this
half face on that DVD. I could cut that out

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.610
more so as a square like it's shown on that
painting up there. And then on top of that,

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.500
I could take some heavy embossing powder and
I could melt it in a melting pot like this

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:56.130
here. And once it was all melted, I could
take the melted fluid and pour it on top of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.750
the DVD to create a totally different effect
on top and then I set that into the painting.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.590
So, that's just one of the many effects on
this painting that I thought I would talk

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.060
to you about.
