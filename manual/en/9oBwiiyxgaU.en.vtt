Hello and welcome to mDhil.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.420
This season, I'm sure all of you want to have absolutely glowing skin

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.980
for every social get-together you are at.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.520
What are the secrets? Let's find out, with Swati Gupta: Hair and beauty expert.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.000
-Thank you for joining us on mDhil.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.520
-Thank you for having me here.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.280
-How are we going to ensure that we will have glowing skin throughout the season?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.820
-Always a toughie.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.540
I tell all of my brides, my clients,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.000
I tell all of them just to carry 1 liter bottles with them all of the time.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.020
Make sure you're finishing that bottle at least four times over

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.480
3 and a half to 4 times over

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.100
you may not realize it, but if it's a part of your lifestyle,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.800
then water is definitely the biggest healer.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.880
I think diet is another very very important aspect to it.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.100
Try and make sure you're having at least four fruits in a day

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.240
with a mix of different fruits

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.800
a fruit like guava is very very good roughage. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.660
It's in its own way doing a lot of detoxification.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.140
bananas have so much citric in them, and banana has so much carbs in it, 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.560
so everything is helping you in its own way.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.640
dried fruits really help contribute to the oil factor

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.740
to the nourishment in a natural way.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.180
I think, in terms of food, try and keep it light, do more pulses,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.600
If you're a non-vegetarian, do more fish rather than red meat, and stuff like that

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.660
fruits, juices, these kinds of things really work well.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.200
Obviously, during the day, you should be using sunscreen

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.080
In the evenings you should be using some base of moisturizer

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.920
under your makeup and stuff

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.300
but once in a while using a little bit of a face bag.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.020
at least twice a week, doing a little bit of natural exfoliation.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.640
there are very good exfoliants available in the market

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.520
you have excellent scrubs available from any brand.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.720
you can read up about home tips, see which skin type you identify and then use that,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.520
orange peel works very well, orange peel powder works very well

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.080
a lot of people grind pulses, and make a pack out of that

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.020
-I've even heard about coffee being ground and used as a good scrub

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.680
-Yeah! Coffee, chocolate is a very popular ingredient being used these days

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.640
Some form of effort is definitely required is what I feel.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.640
-Is sweating good?

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.160
Is being able to sweat it out good for the skin?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.380
-I think yes, that really works well

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.940
follow your excercise routine.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.140
So whether its aerobics, whether it's swimming, whether it's yoga, 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.340
whether it's running, walking, whatever works for you.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.180
do it.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.320
-Marvelous, thank you.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.960
So there you go. Excercise, finding products

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.020
that suit your skin and pampering it,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.540
good diet, lots of water, things you can do to ensure you have glowing skin throughout this festive holiday season.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.240

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.980
