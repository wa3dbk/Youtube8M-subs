00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.680
Today I am going to show you how easy it is
to change these locks.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:26.580
These have kind of a quick nice and easy feature
in how they slip together.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.300
So let me show you here.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.020
You can see the slots in the back of this
here.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.040
What you do is line up your post hole.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.430
You can turn it so that it slides in and than
this slips into place.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.190
Than you are able to tighten the screws through
here.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.510
So it is just a quick deal to get it going.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.100
So here it is on the door itself.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.239
Taking off the old lock.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:07.020
All we have to do is loosen up the screws
on both sides.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.049
Than rotate it and pull the old one out.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.650
On the new one we will just pass it through
our holes.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:28.150
Like so and rotate in the new deal.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:44.730
Tighten the screws down on both sides.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.380
And we are all set there.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.470
Ready to go.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.283
Now one of the most common causes of sticking
locks is if your screws are too tight.

00:01:56.283 --> 00:02:00.840
So if you see your post is sticking that would
be one of the first things to check.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.850
Either these two screws or these two screws
may be too tight so.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:17.150
Make sure our deal closes properly and we
are all set there.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:47.349
Good to go.
