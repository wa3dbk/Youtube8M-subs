President Obama:
Now, the reason why Natoma is
not here today is that she's

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:19.994
lying in a hospital bed.

00:00:19.994 --> 00:00:23.695
She is racked with worry not
only about her illness but about

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:26.961
the costs of the tests and the
treatment that she's surely

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.895
going to need to beat it.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.027
So you want to know
why I'm here, Ohio?

00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:33.628
I'm here because of Natoma.

00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:34.594
(applause)

00:00:34.594 --> 00:00:36.628
I'm here because of the
countless others who have been

00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:40.795
forced to face the most
terrifying challenges in their

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:44.861
lives with the added burden of
medical bills they can't pay.

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:45.861
I don't think that's right.

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:46.761
(applause)

00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:47.661
Neither do you.

00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:50.994
That's why we need health
insurance right now.

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:52.661
Health insurance
reform, right now.

00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:55.494
(applause)

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:58.294
I'm here because of
my own mother's story.

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:01.728
She died of cancer, and in the
last six months of her life,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:06.161
she was on the phone in her
hospital room arguing with

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:07.861
insurance companies instead of
focusing on getting well and

00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:10.127
spending time with her family.

00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:12.928
I'm here because of the millions
who are denied coverage because

00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:17.795
of preexisting conditions
or dropped from coverage

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:18.961
when they get sick.

00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:19.795
(applause)

00:01:19.795 --> 00:01:22.361
I'm here because of the small
businesses who are forced to

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:24.294
choose between health
care and hiring.

00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:25.695
(applause)

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:28.861
I'm here because of the
seniors unable to afford the

00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:30.328
prescriptions that they need.

00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:31.161
(applause)

00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.695
I'm here because of the folks
seeing their premiums go up 20

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:37.261
and 30 and 40 and 50 and
60 percent in a year.

00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:39.194
(applause)

00:01:39.194 --> 00:01:42.027
That is not the America I
believe in and that's not the

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:43.928
America that you believe in.

00:01:43.928 --> 00:01:47.261
When you hear people more
worried about the politics of it

00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:49.895
than what's right
and what's wrong,

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:53.461
I want you to think about Natoma
and the millions of people all

00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:56.494
across this country who
are looking for some help,

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:58.161
and looking for some relief.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:01.494
That's why we need health
insurance reform right now.

00:02:01.494 --> 00:02:04.594
(applause)
