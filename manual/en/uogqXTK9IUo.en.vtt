00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.830
What's up guy and girl players of World of
Warcraft. This is Ryutarou aka Tarou and in

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.380
this video I'm going show you a basic overview
of the Heroic Gunship Battle. For the free

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.640
complete guide, and many others, go to tarouwowguides.com

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.460
If you thought the Heroic modes for Lord Marrowgar
and Lady Deathwhisper were hard then prepare

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.189
to have your ass handed to you by one of the
most difficult encounters ever. Yes, ever!

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.050
Heroic Lich King without the 30% buff is a
joke compared to the shear insane difficulty

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.020
brought by the Wrath of the Gunship Battle.
Which is what they should have called the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.730
expansion in my opinion.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.180
Your raid needs to be perfectly composed of
the best players your server, no the World..

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.260
of Warcraft has to offer. Your elite raid
should include 1-3 healers, 2 tanks, and the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.780
rest DPS.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.640
The roles' of each raid member is extremely
crucial to your success of defeating this

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.100
encounter. Healers, your job is pretty intense
and complex; heal the raid and don't let tanks

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.930
die. Range DPS you need to be on the ball
and nuke anything that moves within your range.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.030
Melee DPS and your best tank need to immediately
kill the Mage who pops out and freezes your

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.320
cannons. Since this is Heroic, the Mage boasts
an insane amount of extra HP. We're talking

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.030
like.. a whole lot of a tad of just a little
or something. After the Mage is dead, quickly

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.010
get back to your ship and help out your defending
raiders with killing adds as they're likely

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.560
being ruthlessly slaughtered by the enemy
boarding party.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.580
The whole raid will also want to be extra
super careful not to get hit by rockets as

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.090
they a have a huge, crazy 7 yard knockback
which can knock you back... a whole 7 yards.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.760
If you get hit back by these rockets 7 times,
you might get knocked back to the middle of

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.090
your ship. This can be devastating so avoid
it all costs even if you have to jump off

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.340
the boat and die. Well, maybe you shouldn't
go that far but it's THAT serious!

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.840
Finally, the enemy Gunship got pimped out
by some Gnomes and now has, get this, more

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.450
HP. Yes more HP so now the fight may take
slighty longer. All raiders should be prepared

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.950
for the extra 10 or 20 seconds the fight will
take by packing their bags full of Noggenfogger

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.500
Elixirs, Pygmy Oil, or whatever your favorite
random drink is.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.840
Alright so just to make sure your raid has
success, here's a Heroic specific recap.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.860
Defending Party:
Avoid rockets like the plague

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.450
Healers, heal
DPS, DPS

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.390
Tanks, tank

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.150
Boarding Party:
Tank, tank

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.340
DPS, DPS
Healers, heal

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.150
Gunners:
Shoot stuff, yeehaw!

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.920
and most importantly, be super serious!

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.569
You keep this up until the the enemy's ship
is destroyed and you win! If you're lucky

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.569
that is.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.540
So there you have it. A super crazily complex
walk-through of the most difficult, badass

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.830
Heroic fight ever to release in the World
of Warcraft. Let me know in the comment section

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.080
what the funniest or stupiest thing your raid
has experienced in Icecrown Citadel. For me,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.379
it's the time a dc'd player came back outside
of Rotface's gate which bugged Rotface to

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.150
despawn in our Heroic run.
