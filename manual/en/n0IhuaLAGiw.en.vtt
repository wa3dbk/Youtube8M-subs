00:00:09.648 --> 00:00:15.488
Next point is how to gain extra power 5%-10%

00:00:15.488 --> 00:00:20.601
in same way, you have to completely stop

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:26.369
and then restart. ok, if you do your smash nothing changes

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.438
but change the stop and then hit 5%-10% harder, watch this

00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:35.099
ok, this is right way

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:37.401
what I mean, little bit high please

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:42.636
when I set, I completely stopped, until I saw shuttle

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:46.745
set, bang

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.725
set, bang

00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:51.856
set, bang

00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:22.287
so I stopped, but some players they move little bit

00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:24.092
this is not the right way

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:14.501
so, my racket is continously moving

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:18.833
no, you have to stop quickly, stop

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:21.518
you are holding, but you are also holding

00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:23.212
your opponent if you do it

00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:26.856
stop, bang

00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:29.607
stop bang

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:32.245
and you can create lots of power

00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:38.012
lets say, watch this, shuttle is there, I stop

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:39.233
stop

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.228
higher, stop

00:02:56.228 --> 00:03:00.059
higher, stop

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.597
stop

00:03:02.597 --> 00:03:04.933
I can't do it if I move it

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:34.402
compare, stop first immediately

00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:38.062
if you stop earlier, if you stop longer 

00:03:38.062 --> 00:03:41.213
more deceptive, more powerful

00:03:47.213 --> 00:03:51.839
same, smash stop

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.862
stop

00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:58.343
stop

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.660
stop

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.976
stop
