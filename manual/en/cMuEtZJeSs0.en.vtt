Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen, and in this segment,
we're going to learn all about how to prepare

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:10.540
our perennials, for the winter. Now, we all
have gorgeous blooms all summer long, and

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.730
by the end of the fall, it starts to freeze
a little bit, if you live in a colder climate,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.881
and everything just looks trashed, so how
do you prepare your perennials for the winter,

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:25.441
and what should you do with them? First of
all, my theory with all my plants, is if it's

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:29.460
green and lush leave it be, if it's brown
or ratty, cut it out, so the first thing I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.859
do, is, to prepare them for winter, is cut
out all the brown material, and if it's in

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.609
the garden, a lot of times I'll just leave
it there as compost, but in my containers,

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.469
I like to actually cut out anything that's
brown, and not looking good, because it doesn't

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.920
look good, and by the winter time it will
turn mushy, and then I remember, this is my

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.059
strelitzia, or my bird of paradise, and it
does not like cold, cold winters, and it won't

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.920
even survive in my greenhouse, because if
it gets even a little bit of frost, the ends

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.809
of the leaves will actually curl up, and I'm
even getting concerned now. It's probably

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.110
forty degrees, and I know it's hating it right
now, and I should put it in the house, so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.680
I treat it as a house plant, for the wintertime.
I don't even try to put my exotic plants outside

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.530
in the greenhouse, or even cover them up.
If they're very, very temperamental, then

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.880
I will bring them inside, and even if I leave
them a little bit on the dry side, give them

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.390
some water, but leave them in the laundry
room. They seem to do really well. I have

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.500
a little window there, and they sometimes
get a little bit beat up, but at least I can

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.340
save them, so if you've got plants that are
annuals, like this petunia, it's really probably

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.490
not going to come back no matter what I do,
but I have left them in my greenhouse, and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.910
a few times they have survived, so the same
deal. If it looks brown or green, or looks

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.900
ratty in any way, then I just start chopping
it out, and it's easy to do, and a lot of

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.660
times too, if it's still blooming, I just
have the hardest time, chopping anything that's

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.530
dying, so I've thrown this in my greenhouse.
It's actually getting pretty cold in the greenhouse,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.840
and this plant is not liking that, but there's
still some flowers on it, so I think I'm just

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.479
going to trim off all the dead flowers, for
dead growth, and then I'll come back in a

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.080
few weeks, probably, and the rest of it will
die down, and then I'll go ahead, and I will

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.689
cut off the rest of the flowers, anything
that's brown, all the way to the ground even.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.189
Sometimes my annuals will even come back,
so it's always worth the effort, to either

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.820
throw it in the garage,or throw it in the
basement, or even in the greenhouse, if you

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.489
have one, and just let it survive the winter.
In my outside beds, I cover all of my perennial

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.719
beds with leaf clippings, so when I'm raking
up my leaves, I just cover up all the flower

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:44.290
beds, and that way, all the weeds die down,
and then the leaves break down the compost,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.310
for the next year, and then my perennials,
my day lilies, my semisefugas, my crocosmias,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.769
all come up through that, and they do really,
really well, and it's an easy way to prepare

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.840
your garden for the winter. I also like to
dig up my geraniums, or begonias, or any other

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.740
plants that will not make it over the winter,
in my climate, and I will either save them

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.779
as the bulb, in a paper bag, or I'll just
throw them in the greenhouse, and leave them

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:10.450
dry for the winter, and then put them out
again the next year, so there's lots of ways

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.290
that you can help your perennials through
the winter. Never fertilize them with nitrogen

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.420
in the fall, because that will get new growth,
and that's the worst thing you can do for

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.549
your plants, so to prepare them for the winter,
don't fertilize them at all, after mid summer,

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.810
and even into early fall, and if you're going
to fertilize them, give them phosphate, something

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.010
that is a blooming fertilizer, because actually
the phosphates will help the plant survive

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.269
the winter, better.
