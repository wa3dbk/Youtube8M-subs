00:00:05.476 --> 00:00:10.515
Yes, a lot of people have died for a lie, 
but they always thought it was the truth.

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:18.172
If the resurrection of Jesus Christ was a lie, they had 
to know it was a lie. Therefore, you would have to say

00:00:19.013 --> 00:00:29.239
that he not only died for a lie and went through that horrible 
torture and death for what was a lie, but they knew it was a lie.

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:40.030
You’ve maybe heard of Andre Cole. His real name is Bob 
Gurtler. He’s rated one of the world’s greatest illusionists.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:48.892
He is a man who can boast. He’s the only man alive 
who has never ever been fooled by another illusionist.

00:00:49.723 --> 00:01:00.311
One of his expertises is to create illusion. In his lifetime he has 
created and sold almost 2,000 illusionary or magical effects.

00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:09.596
Many of the great magicians you watch, those magic 
acts and illusions were created by Andre Cole.

00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:18.048
He’s the one that created the disappearing of the Statue of Liberty. 
I can’t believe it! Three times I’ve stood just within a few feet

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:24.728
of a miniature Statue of Liberty, and it would disappear before 
my eyes. I remember once I said, “Andre, how did you do that?”

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:30.974
He said, “Very well.” And I have to admit 
he did. But he was a skeptic, a nonbeliever,

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:42.716
and he just thought the Bible was myth and everything else. And my friend challenged him to take his ability as the world’s greatest creator of illusion,

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:49.480
the only man alive that can boast he’s never 
been fooled by another illusionist, and apply it

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:58.173
his skills and techniques to the miracles of 
Jesus Christ to prove that they were magic acts.

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:02.022
After a little persuasion, he accepted that thinking it would be very easy.

00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:06.691
I lived in Canada, and I remember when Andre 
came up there and spent three days with me.

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:11.842
What a great three, most people don’t have three 
minutes, let alone three days, with a master.

00:02:12.338 --> 00:02:15.492
And he shared with me the struggle he went 
through. He said, “I thought it would be real easy,

00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:22.378
that all I’d have to do is approach them with modern day 
technology, and magic, and illusion, and could explain it all away.”

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:30.599
He said, “Several of them I could, but the majority of the miracles of 
Christ I could not explain away.” But he said there was one miracle,

00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:41.003
one miracle, that Christ did that there’s absolutely 
no way through all modern magic, illusions, or anything

00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:50.500
to ever explain it away as illusion. In the next segment 
I’m going to tell you what that one miracle was.
