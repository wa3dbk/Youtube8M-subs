00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.270
&gt;&gt; Today is so meaningful because we're welcoming
the new students here.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.769
It's been a long process for Penn State to
restart their PA and we welcome the alumni

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:15.769
back.

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.140
We have real patients, part of our application
process, that they interview the students.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.739
So, if a student is not good with the patient
or is uncaring with the patient, this is not

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:27.739
going to be their program.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.419
So, I think Penn State's going to be very
innovative, we're in the right setting, we've

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.679
got the great support and we're going to lead
in a professional education here.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:42.489
&gt;&gt; Growing up somewhat close to this area,
I knew the reputation of the Milton S. Hershey

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.809
Medical Center.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.589
I knew the reputation of the College of Medicine.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.949
I was thrilled when I discovered that they
were going to be starting a Physicians Assistant

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:51.949
program.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.749
This to me signifies the first step in that
next journey to where I ultimately want to

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.659
be in my career.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.920
&gt;&gt; I can't believe I'm like, wearing a white
coat.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.480
I'm very excited.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.700
It's been a long journey, a long path to even
get to this point and we're not there yet.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.659
We have the white coat, but we haven't graduated
yet.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.270
It's only the beginning and we know it's a
long road ahead of us, but we know this is

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.819
the start of something special and I'm actually
just excited to get started.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:20.920
&gt;&gt; I chose Penn State Hershey because I've
been to this area before.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.729
That was kind of the first straw is the area.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.580
It's, you have a lot to do, but yet it's not
a big city feel.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.039
Once I got to the campus and interviewed here,
it was unbelievable.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.570
It was different than any other interview
experience I've ever had.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.520
It was more of a sit down at the dinner table
talking with your relatives, kind of place.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.810
It wasn't intimidating at all and after hearing
the curriculum and things like that.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.889
It just seemed like a great place to be.

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:49.040
&gt;&gt; I know that the white coat symbolizes going
into the medical field and what I will be

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.719
practicing, but to me I think it symbolizes
also what my family and friends and the support

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.429
network that I have, what they have done for
me.

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.659
And without them I couldn't be here today.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.850
So, every time that I put on my white coat,
I think I'll be reminded of them and all the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.759
work that they've done to help me get to this
point.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.320
&gt;&gt; I was inspired by a really good physician
assistant who treated my mom for her GI problems

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.040
and every since then I've just been so inspired.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040
Penn State has an excellent reputation.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.670
I have a lot of friends who go to the med
school here and they love it.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.569
They love the community, they love the professors.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.340
They call the professors by their name.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.530
As soon as I heard I got in, I cancelled all
my other interviews, so, which was really

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.550
good.
