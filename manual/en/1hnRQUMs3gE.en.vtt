00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.066
- Flashlight!
- Lots of juice...

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.200
- ...and maps!
- Chocolate bars.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.000
Doug, we need more
than drinks and food.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.966
We have to prepare
for a snack attack.

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.066
Whatever you say.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:36.066
- Aren't you going home?
- What’s this?

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.733
- It's none of your business.
- Really?

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.966
Maybe the teacher
will think differently.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.666
- Don’t, Jenny!
- Why?

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:47.733
Because we’re going out
to look for fireflies tonight.

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.333
You know where
to find fireflies?

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.600
- Yes!
- I heard there’re

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
lots of fireflies
in Owl Forest.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.300
So we’re planning
a firefly adventure tonight!

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.266
Great!
I’m going with you.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.033
Hey… this could be
dangerous!

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:02.433
I know.
That’s why I’m coming.

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:05.733
You need someone
who isn’t a coward.

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.000
Cool. I’ll bring
even more stuff to eat.

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:25.066
Kevin, where are you going?

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.033
What’s this?

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:31.966
- Hey guys!
- Hey Kevin.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.433
- You’re late, Kevin.
- Sorry.

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:37.233
- Well let’s see the map.
- Right.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:39.433
- Doug, get the flashlight out.
- Right.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.000
Here it...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.666
Dougie... that's a sausage.

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:48.933
That’s funny. 
I think I forgot to bring it.

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.766
You should’ve
double-checked.

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:54.800
- Kevin, where’s the map?
- Uh... not here.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.466
What? How could you
forget the map?!

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:00.533
I… I’m sure
I packed it in my bag.

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.633
- This didn’t work.
- I'm going home.

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:06.066
Hey wait, Jenny. Don’t go.
We don’t need the map!

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.433
- Are you sure?
- I’m sure. Just follow me!

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:13.833
Wow…
the adventure’s starting!

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.200
Kevin just... disappeared?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.133
Well SUJI says she heard him
leaving a little while ago.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.633
Uh huh. And I found
this paper laying on the floor.

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:24.833
Oh?

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:26.800
What kind of picture is this?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.133
- It’s a map.
- Fireflies.

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:40.333
Why’s Owl Forest
always so scary?

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.700
Oh no… a headlight!

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.566
I’d better
get out of this place fast

00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:47.500
before the other headlight
goes out on me!

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.500
Kevin, this seems wrong.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.366
I think we went too far.

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:58.333
No way...
they should be around here.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:01.666
Well maybe we can at least
see the forest monsters.

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:04.333
I don’t LIKE monsters!

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.133
- Guys... look there!
- Is that?

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:12.700
- fireflies!
- I knew I’d find them!

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.866
Let's go see!

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.566
Guys, wait.
That looks like one big light.

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:26.733
Yeah... you’re right.

00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:29.933
It’s ...a monster!

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:35.366
There they are!

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:38.166
Oh no. That’s Spooky!

00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:41.233
SPOOKY!

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:46.500
Oh n-o-o-o!

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:00.800
Poli!

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:05.366
Well Spooky.
I’m surprised at you.

00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:07.900
You know you should
slow down when it's dark.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.466
I know Poli, but I was
really scared. I'm sorry.

00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:14.300
It's okay, Spooky.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.400
It’s important
to be extra careful

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.200
whenever you’re in the dark.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.000
When it’s dark
people and drivers

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.233
can’t see
each other very well.

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:24.566
When you’re in a dark place,

00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:26.933
it’s best to wear
brightly colored clothes

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:31.300
or something reflective
that drivers can easily see.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.666
If a car is coming,
don’t panic.

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:35.700
Just stop, move aside

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.433
and let the car pass
before you continue on.

00:04:38.433 --> 00:04:41.500
That’s the safe way
for both you and the driver.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.166
And there’s
one more thing...

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.700
never ever go out at night

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.066
unless your parents say
it’s okay.

00:04:47.066 --> 00:04:49.033
A street you may know
very well

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:51.133
might seem
much different at night

00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:54.166
and it’s easy
to get scared and lost.

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:55.900
I think we’d
better head back.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.800
Your parents are
worried about you.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.866
- OK!
- Yeah.

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:03.966
Wow!

00:05:03.966 --> 00:05:06.233
See guys, aren’t they cool?

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:10.566
- They’re beautiful.
- Hurray!

00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:13.066
I did it again!
