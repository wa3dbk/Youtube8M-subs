00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.010
One of the best part of working in this field
for a long time has been trying to figure

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.590
out for patients which exercises are good
and which exercises are bad for their condition.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.760
There's millions of exercises, there's just
so many to count, and unfortunately it really

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.429
does depend on the condition that the patient
is coming in for, if they are having a spine

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.759
problem or disorder.

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.140
But by and large, if you're having a mechanical
problem in the back, and you're stressing

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.860
your back out with too much bending and sitting
and lifting, it's playing a role on your pain

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.019
and on your suffering, there is a very good
chance that there is going to be certain exercises

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.210
that are going to be bad for your back, and
the reason is you're going to move your spine

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.330
in the same sort of direction, creating the
same kinds of pressures on the tissue as your

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.869
day-to-day functional tasks, you know, require,
so I can't take away those activities, I can't

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.050
tell you not to go to work or, you know, put
your shoes and socks on, but if you're going

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.670
to then choose some exercises, you better
know which ones to be doing for it.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.420
And so for instance, if you're doing exercises
bringing your knees into your chest, where

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.619
you're doing exercises lifting your legs up
into the air, lying on your back trying to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.320
stretch out your buttock muscles or your hamstring
muscles, as good as it might feel during the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.999
stretch, potentially you're harming the tissue
and moving your spine in the direction that's

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.929
very similar to what caused the problem in
the first place.

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:38.100
It's a challenge for patients to understand
that, and it usually requires a clinical assessment,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.869
you know, with me or others to know which
ones are bad, and it definitely depends on

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.530
what is wrong with the patient.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.299
But there are bad ones, and it's usually the
flexion exercises, flexion being defined as

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.200
bringing your knees into your chest, or your
chest down into your knees, or anything that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.100
looks similar to that.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.869
By contrast, moving your spine into extension
is often indicated in these conditions, and

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.520
it's something that usually isn't thought
of right away when a patient is trying to

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.520
deal with their problem.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.530
They're often researching and finding some
flexion options, thinking that it's a muscle

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.370
problem, for instance, and trying to alleviate
the stress in the muscle.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.840
There are a number of bad ones, but flexion-based
exercises in the presence of a mechanical

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.190
back problem is often the bad ones.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.510
Flexion is defined as when the spine or the
body is moving forward, hips are moving closer

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.330
to the shoulders, or shoulders are moving
closer to the hips.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.360
Extension is defined as the body moving back
or shoulders further away from the hips and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.470
the knees.
