How to Lose Fat in The Buttocks | Bigger Butt
Secrets

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.770
The muscles of the buttocks are known as the
gluteals.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.770
Strength and aerobic training blended with
diet modification will shred fat from your

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.770
buttocks.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.770
Strength Training

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.770
Strength training increases lean muscle tissue,
and muscle development heightens your metabolism.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.770
Full-capacity strengthening dissipates fat
tissue in the buttocks.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.770
Every major muscle should be strengthened
three times per week.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.260
A full-body routine is necessary because spot
reduction is a myth.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:28.840
A resistance circuit gets you to move quickly
between sets and exercises.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:37.460
This creates a greater heart rate response
and allows you to burn more energy.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.460
Aerobic Training
How to Lose Fat in The Buttocks, Bigger Butt

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.460
Secrets
Your aerobic program should be on the three

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.460
opposite days to your strengthening to lose
weight in the buttocks areas.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.460
The duration of your three aerobic sessions
is 40 minutes.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.460
The stair stepper and elliptical trainer are
ideal for glute conditioning.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.460
The joint action of both pieces powerfully
targets the gluteals.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.460
Diet Modification

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.460
Do not overlook the role of nutrition in shaping
your buttocks.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.190
Exercise becomes a non-factor without diet
modification.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:02.360
Eliminating 500 calories per day will allow
a pound of weight loss per week.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.519
Slow, but steady, weight loss is much more
likely to be sustained.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.519
Considerations

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.909
Maintain a whole-body training approach.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:55.779
It is tempting to focus all your energy on
your glutes, but remember, isolated fat deduction

00:01:55.779 --> 00:02:01.129
is impossible.
