Hi everyone, it's your project Rakamakafo

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.346
How good do you watch your stuff?

00:00:04.347 --> 00:00:09.411
Today we will check people's awareness realizing one idea in Russian realities

00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:12.646
And our friend from the channel vJOBivay will help us with that

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:16.247
Today we and our friends want to check a very interesting prank

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:19.868
In this video a man goes up to someone and asks for a phone to make a call

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.631
because his phone died. And after he gets the phone he starts slowly or fast getting away

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:29.036
Either way the reactions he had were very awesome

00:00:29.037 --> 00:00:34.289
Let's check if Russian people gonna be staying numb or fight for their phones?!

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.366
Let's get it!

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:44.378
Guys, can I use your phone real quick? My phone died, I need to call

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.625
My phone died, I need to call this number real quick

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:47.989
Not long-distance I hope?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.723
No, not long-distance, our local number, thanks a lot

00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:52.118
It's very nice of you, thanks a lot

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.038
A basic ask for help in broad of daylight...

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.698
Guys, can you tell me where is a crossroad of Nevsky and Sadovaya street?

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.527
There's the theatre of puppets next to it

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:07.648
There's a theatre over there, it's probably the one you need

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:08.526
There, at the corner?

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:10.662
Yeah, look at the corner over there!

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:11.807
Thank you!

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:24.776
Excuse me, can I use your phone? I need to call. My phone died

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:28.290
Just saying, I run fast!

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.468
Hello, where are you?

00:01:37.712 --> 00:01:40.147
Okay, alright, I'm coming toward you!

00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:45.974
Yeah, I got you!

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.281
What's wrong?

00:01:51.282 --> 00:01:53.926
Give me the phone, I'm telling you in a good tone now!

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:55.096
What do you mean in a good tone?

00:01:55.097 --> 00:01:57.991
Where were you running to?
-Nowhere, why are you bending me?

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.135
Easy, easy, easy!

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:01.999
What happened?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.310
Give the phone back!

00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:06.943
What do you mean?

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:08.645
You took my phone and ran away!

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:10.541
Oh! Lady, I'm so sorry

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:16.258
Everything is okay, anyways. One, run!

00:02:20.537 --> 00:02:24.035
Guys, stop, stop! It's a prank!

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:25.462
Give the fucking phone back!

00:02:25.463 --> 00:02:28.148
It's a prank, fools, there's a camera right there!

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.424
What camera? Give me the phone, you faggot!
-It's a prank, you see the camera?

00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:36.037
Are you okay? Would I take a phone from three guys that were surely gonna run after me.

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:40.404
I'm not that crazy! It would be okay if I had a car waiting on me here. Good job guys!

00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:41.933
Saved the phone!

00:02:46.297 --> 00:02:49.800
It looked like this: Valya started running, the guys took off 

00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.722
And all I saw was a dude was chasing after Valya with his fist being up like this

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:56.383
We found out that this method works with a bunch of people

00:02:56.384 --> 00:03:00.546
Now we're gonna go up to one person and won't be running right away

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.473
We will be getting away from him slowly

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.649
Excuse me, my phone died, can I use my phone to make a call?

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.123
I have a meeting here

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:10.638
It's a surpirse there are some people out here who can help. 103...

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.647
Hello, so where are you at?

00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:18.897
There's the Russian National Library

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.549
So, are you far from here?

00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:40.594
I'm seeing tours in front of me, tours on the left, some metro station on the right

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:56.653
So you're near Sadovaya? Hold on

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:09.496
I think he will run out of money now

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:19.508
Man, I have to go in 10 minutes

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:29.087
I can't anymore, I'm sorry it's a prank. It's a camera right there! And right there!

00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:35.152
Thanks!

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:41.447
Circling around like a shark. And pigeons are flying

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:47.426
Trust people but be alert!

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:51.221
The results of our experiment turned out quite inconsistent

00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:55.927
Just as we thought, the basic problem that we faced was total distrust of most of the people

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:58.618
to the person that asks them to use their phone to make a call

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:02.051
More that 50% of the people would reject that ask

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:04.251
Can I use your phone to make a call? My phone died

00:05:04.252 --> 00:05:07.205
Can I use your phone, please? I will call just in front of you!
-I'm sorry, but no!

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:11.245
Can I use your phone to make a call? I just need to meet someone but my phone died
-No, I can't

00:05:11.246 --> 00:05:15.838
Man, my phone died, I need to make a call really quick, can I use your phone? 

00:05:16.457 --> 00:05:18.518
Alright, thank you very much!

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.745
But the ones who would give their phone either wasn't watching it at all

00:05:21.746 --> 00:05:24.813
Or watched very carefully, sometimes acting very sharp

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:28.317
At the end of the day we can say that the reactions were very bright and different

00:05:28.318 --> 00:05:30.754
Subscribe to your friends' channel vJOBivay

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:40.508
