00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.209
So, I'm going to go ahead and show you how
to swaddle your baby, leaving his arms free

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.700
for extra movement so he has freedom of movement.
We're going to swaddle his lower half using

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.349
the snug and tug blanket. And the snug and
tug blanket is a blanket that has been specifically

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.289
designed for swaddling. So, I will show you
how to use it. You'll see, right here on the

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.340
blanket, there's a great big pocket that baby
fits inside. So, fold the flap down so you

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.089
can help to guide baby into the pocket. And
bring baby down safely to the floor where

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:37.570
you are swaddling, laying baby so his arms,
his underarms are right at the top edge of

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.000
the swaddling blanket. So, you fold back the
pocket, take his legs, tuck them right in.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.530
You might need to help guide them in a little
bit. You might kind of move the blanket up

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.190
a little bit. Bringing it up so it's right
up underneath the arms. Once you have him

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.640
securely in the pocket, we're leaving the
arms free. Bring this flap over. You'll notice

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.620
it has velcro. Bring it over and it's going
to go through a hole that's right here on

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.859
this side. So, bringing it through the hole,
holding onto the flap, finding the velcro

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.810
with your other hand, feeling on his back
where that velcro attaches to another piece

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.190
of velcro. And then, taking this side, we're
folding it around. We're going to go underneath

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.570
baby. So I'm keeping his arms, I keep moving
them to keep them out of this fold. Make sure

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.439
it's nice and snug and straight. Fold that
flap all the way around. There's velcro here

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.119
as well and velcro here. Go ahead and attach
it. Go ahead and attach it. And let's pick

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:43.179
up baby and you'll notice that his arms have
lots of freedom of movement and yet he's still

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.321
comforted. He's still swaddled up in this
blanket nice and snug. You can leave it lose

00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:52.920
like this or if you're holding him and you
want to have his legs feel a little bit more

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.909
snug and secure, you can take the bottom of
the blanket and you can fold it right up and

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.659
you can hold it with your own hand while you?re
sitting together. So, it can help him to feel

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.749
even a little bit more secure and snug in
his blanket. Or you can leave it lose, whatever

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.800
feels comfortable for the two of you. But
many babies enjoy being swaddled with their

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.950
hands and arms nice and free. So go ahead
and feel free to give that a try.
