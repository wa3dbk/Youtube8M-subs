Hey, whats up? Drew Seeley here

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:06.295
And I'm very excited to show you guys my new music video for 'Her Voice'

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:09.341
It's a new take on the song that I get to sing on stage every night

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.019
in Disney's The Little Mermaid on Broadway.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.644
So I hope you enjoy it

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.296
and come check me out as Prince Eric

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:17.310
now through Aug 30th at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:37.132
Somewhere there’s a girl who’s like the shimmer of the wind on the water;

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:42.799
Somewhere there’s a girl who’s like the glimmer of the sunlight on the sea;

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.901
Somewhere there’s a girl who’s like a swell of endless music;

00:00:48.902 --> 00:00:54.291
Somewhere she is singing and her song is meant for me.

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:59.808
And her voice, it’s sweet as angels' sighing.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.440
And her voice, it’s warm as summer sky.

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:10.768
And that sound, it haunts my dreams and spins me round,

00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:14.698
until it seems I’m flying...

00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:19.613
Her voice.

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:28.883
Well, I can sense her laughter in the ripple of the waves against the shoreline.

00:01:28.884 --> 00:01:34.855
And, I can see her smiling in the moonlight as it settles on the sand.

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:40.574
Oh, I can feel her waiting just beyond the pale horizon.

00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:46.300
Singing out a melody too lovely to withstand.

00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:51.882
And her voice, it’s there as dusk is falling.

00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:57.697
And her voice, it’s there as dawn steals by.

00:01:57.698 --> 00:02:02.738
Pure and bright, it’s always near, all day, all night,

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:10.953
And still I hear it calling...singing Da da da da da da da da

00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:14.186
Strange as a dream...

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:17.300
Real as the sea...

00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.426
If you can hear me now,

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:23.893
Come set me free...

00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:30.580
Oh, come set me free!

00:02:37.072 --> 00:02:42.406
And her voice, it’s sweet as angels' sighing.

00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:47.908
And her voice, it’s warm as summer sky.

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.681
And that sound, it haunts my dreams and spins me round,

00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:57.009
until it seems I’m flying...

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.139
I'm flying!

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.631
Strange as a dream...

00:03:03.632 --> 00:03:06.625
Real as the sea...

00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:13.528
Her voice is calling to me.
