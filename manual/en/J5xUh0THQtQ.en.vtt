Hi, I'm Aiman, and in this video I am going to show you my dad's fish pond.  It looks like there is no fish in the fish pond, but trust me, there is fish

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.759
it looks like this is water but

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:26.759
really it is actually ice

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.000
maybe in one of my future videos, I am going to show you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.390
the fish in the fish pond

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630
but for now I am going to show you 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.500
pictures from the past

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.880
[picture of the fish pond]

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.240
[a side view of the fish pond]

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.110
[picture showing deck on top of the pond]

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.269
[picture showing a few small yet]

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.660
[very colorful koi fishes]

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.660
[you can see some regular fin and butterfly koi fish in the pond]

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.310
[aquatic plants]

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.400
[the kois were very small in this picture - maybe 2-3 inches long]

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.400
[the kois are very big now, some are 12 inches long]

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.840
it took my dad 3 years just to build this fish pond, originally it was 3 feet deep in the ground.  It was winter, and all the fish died.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.659
my dad added 2 and half feet of concrete wall to the fish pond and it became higher

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.659
the total depth of the fish pond is 6 feet deep

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.120
it is about 18 feet at the longest point and it is about 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.849
10 feet at the widest point

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.179
the fish pond holds about 3,000 gallons of water, in all

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:31.179
the concrete wall is about 12 inches thick or 1 feet thick

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.149
as you can see that is actually a waterfall

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:37.619
but it's not hooked up so

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.239
and there is no water in it

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.239
and you can see there a filtration system.  There is a river near the fish pond, so my dad 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.949
hook up the pipe and

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.889
and connect it to that

00:02:53.889 --> 00:03:00.889
and make the water go up into that, then suck it up, and that is what the 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:08.029
filtration system is...You can see the green thing under the ice...uh..the green things are 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.400
actually plants that grow in the water and though the concrete...that is not

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.029
some people might think that may look

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.560
like a monster

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.989
but it actually just plants

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.400
the plants provide

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.709
natural foods for the fish

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:37.639
the water goes through this 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.329
pipe and

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.909
goes beneath the rocks

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:43.980
the the water goes up 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.349
and then leaves the dirt on the bottom

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.679
and the water [rock] filters the dirt

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:54.679
the water goes through the reservoir

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:03.209
and then it goes right in here, comes out through this hole in the pipe, and then when there is enough water, the water will come shooting out, and it will make the waterfall

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.919
there is a valve in the back of the waterfall to get the sludge out that was in the waterfall

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.369
as you can see 

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:28.849
there is valve and there is

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:35.510
the pipe and that would take the sludge out of the trash bin

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.409
and down there

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.930
