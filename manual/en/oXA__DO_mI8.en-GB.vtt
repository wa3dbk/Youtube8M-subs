00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.680
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.720
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.440
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.100
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.740
'We were born sick, you heard them say it

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.120
My Church offers no absolutes
She tells me, 'Worship in the bedroom.'

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.360
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.580
I was born sick,
But I love it

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.460
Command me to be well

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:04.920
Amen amen amen.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.200
Take me to church, I worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.680
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.880
Offer me that deathless death

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.340
Good God let me give you my life.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.140
Take me to church

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.980
I worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.820
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.540
Offer me that deathless death

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.480
Good God let me give you my life. 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.600
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.040
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.560
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.520
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.800
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.800
That looks tasty
That looks plenty

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.720
This is hungry work

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.400
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.960
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.080
Offer me that deathless death

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.960
Good God, let me give you my life

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.120
Take me to church, I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.480
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.440
Offer me that deathless death

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.120
Good God let me give you my life.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.520
No Masters or Kings
When the ritual begins

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.920
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle
sin

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.320
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly
scene

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.760
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:33.080
Amen amen amen.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.800
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.560
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.480
Offer me that deathless death

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.800
Good God, let me give you my life.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.560
Take me to church, I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.480
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.160
Offer me that deathless death.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.400
Good God let me give you my life.
