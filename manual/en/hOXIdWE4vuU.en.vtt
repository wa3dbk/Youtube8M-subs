00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499
 

00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.150
You can add some
aggressive styling

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.270
and improve the air flow
to your 2013 or 2014

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.737
Mustang GT or V6 with a Roush
performance upper grill.

00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:10.320
This grill is a great
option if you've

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.950
chosen another
fog light mounting

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.652
position, such as the Roush
performance fog light kit.

00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:17.110
The hardest part
of this install is

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.570
going to be removing
the front bumper cover.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.200
Follow along and we'll show you
just how easy that part of it

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.030
is.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.310
Installation begins
by opening the hood

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.450
and removing the eight
pin retainers along

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.175
with the upper radiator cover.

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:35.190
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.690
Remove the four pin retainers
and the four 8 millimeter bolts

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.650
from the top of the
front bumper cover.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.310
 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.140
Remove the three 7 millimeter
outer lower bumper cover

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.220
bolts on both the right-hand
and the left-hand side.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.030
Remove the front six
8 millimeter bolts

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.301
and the rear five 7 millimeter
bolts from the lower air

00:00:59.301 --> 00:00:59.800
deflector.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.160
 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.300
Pull down and back to remove
the lower air deflector

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.130
from the car.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.560
Disconnect the two side
marker light connectors--

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.570
one on the right
and one on the left.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.740
Remove the ambient
air temperature sensor

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.720
by prying it out of place.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.950
Pull outward to unsnap the
right-hand and left-hand sides

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.720
of the bumper cover.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.080
If equipped, disconnect
the fog lamp connectors.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.670
Pull the bumper cover away
from and off of your Mustang.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.110
Remove the three 7 millimeter
bolts from each fog light

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.790
and remove the fog lights
from the factory grill.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.510
Release the 14 retaining
tabs around the perimeter

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.510
of the factory grill
and remove the grill

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.860
from the bumper cover.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.500
Take this opportunity
to clean the opening.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.590
Slide the new Roush
grill into position

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.060
and install the 14
supplied U-clips.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.880
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.240
Reinstall your bumper cover,
reversing the removal steps.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.870
The Roush upper grill is an
easy snap-in installation

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.870
that requires no
modifications and no painting,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.050
plus it fits both GT and V6.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.680
If you have original
grill-mounted fog lights,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.390
you can either zip-tie your
old pigtail harnesses out

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.370
of the way or, if you're
installing something

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.410
like the Roush fog
light kit, they

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.870
need to be routed down and
plugged in to the new fog

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.240
light adapter harnesses.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.860
