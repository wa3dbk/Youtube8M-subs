00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.220
  Have you always wanted to become a cop?

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 Yeah, from when I was a kid, playing

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.300
Cops and Robbers with my brothers,
I'd always choose Cops.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.090
 I was dying to become a pastry chef.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.090
...I also liked to fish.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.090
...I used to dance from time to time

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.090
...I also loved glass-blowing... a lot.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.030
 Look there. See that?

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.000
 Hi sweetie, how are you?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If we'd stayed we’d have made real progress with the investigation.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.500
TWO MEN

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.530
What've you brought?
-A comic book.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
AN INVESTIGATION

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
I don't want my daughter to be
traumatized because her dad

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.030
didn't go see her
 at her baseball game.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.030
Maybe I'd better sleep on the couch.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 Nobody's gonna come out of there.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.030
It's gonna be tomorrow, man.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.030
 And when you ruin the manual,
I get phonecalls.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.530
Silence your phone.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.530
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.530
Before you know it,
it'll be "oh me, oh my"…

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.030
The last thing I want
are "oh mes, oh mys"...

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.530
Take one.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530
Let's see.
-Oh, Pretty woman.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.030
THAT CHANGED THEIR LIVES&lt;i&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-This is my job

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.030
and this is my life.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 Look, there they are.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.030
What is it?
-It's him.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
Shit! It's him.
He looks real smug.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.030
Surprise!

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 You fucking pig.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Who are you?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.500
I’m a cop.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.710
 I've had it up to here with you!

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.210
Don't move or I'll shoot.
Seems I've got to explain everything.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.710
 Are you trying to get on my nerves?

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.000
&lt;i&gt;POLICE INVESTIGATION

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
&lt;i&gt;SOON

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.210
 I used to make pies, pastries…

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.210
...tartlets, biscuits, cakes,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.210
I was passionate about all that.
