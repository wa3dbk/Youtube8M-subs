00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.180
- Welcome back.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.690
I'm with Jan Brydon, and
we're continuing our talk

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.110
on Let's Get Growing.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.090
And we're in Jan's fruit
orchard that, if you remember

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.910
from last month,
it didn't really

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.470
have that much growth on it.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.170
And we weren't-- you know, there
were some blooms and things

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.753
kind of looked a little sparse,
and there's quite a difference

00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:23.350
here, Jan.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.891
- Yeah, John.

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:26.086
Since last month, we've
fertilized the trees

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:27.460
and done quite a
bit of watering.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.380
We also sprayed the
weeds around the base.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.190
And you can see there's a lot
of new growth, and on this tree,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.320
we're getting quite
a few little peaches.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.130
- Yeah.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.810
Now one of the
problems, and, I guess,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.460
one of the big things
with homeowners

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.520
is that they are very
reluctant to thin a tree.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.510
So here's a tree
that's not real big

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.340
and yet has a pretty
heavy crop on it.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.020
And as these peaches
get bigger, they're

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.270
going to cause
these limbs to droop

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.120
and possibly break, so what we
want to do is come in and thin

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.405
the fruit off the tree.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.780
So what we're going to do is
just twist some of the fruit

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.680
off.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.450
And what I'd like to
do is keep a fruit

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.770
somewhere about every
four to six inches,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.170
so we're going to come
in and thin pretty heavy.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.360
So we're just
going to drop them.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.290
So we have one here, one here,
kind of got those cleared out.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.730
We're down to a group here that
we'll take those off and leave

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.630
one there.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.930
We want to take the
weight off of the branches

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.380
so that they don't have so much
weight on them, so we have them

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.700
kind of spaced out.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.492
We can probably even
take that one off.

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:38.950
So we want to leave the weight
a little bit on the stronger

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.620
branches and not put a lot
of them out on the end 'cause

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.450
that will cause
it to weight down.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.300
So we're going to go through
here and kind of thin

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.010
those off, make sure that
they are going to fruit.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.920
Here's another group that
has quite a few on it.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.900
We'll go ahead and take two of
these off and leave these two

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.640
and just, kind of,
see how they progress.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.890
'Cause we can thin
them even one more time

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.650
if they look like they're
putting too much weight on.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.500
So you can see quite a bit
of fruit on the ground.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.780
But, actually, what's
going to happen

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.471
is this fruit is going to
be much larger in size.

00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:14.970
You know, if we had left that
fruit on the tree, all of them

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.885
would have been kind
of medium-sized.

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:19.260
So hopefully, we're going to
have some large-sized fruits

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.490
here, and they'll--

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.700
what you've taken off is going
to be made up in larger fruit

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.090
and yet you've helped regulate
the load on the trees.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.210
So--

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.060
Also, with some of the growth
that we've had on the tree,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.330
we can come in and thin
some of the growth out.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.430
So if we want to open
the tree up a little bit

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.620
and take some of the
growth off, so we're

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.680
getting more sunlight
in to kind of help--

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.220
help get sunlight in to
ripen some of the fruit,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.630
we can take some of those
shoots off at the time.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.470
And if they're getting
a little too lengthy,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.490
like out on some of the ends, we
can come in and clip, you know,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.010
just clip the tip out.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.590
And that will stop
the growth on it

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.120
and force more growth down here,
so you kind of thicken it up.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.220
Again, the foil
down at the bottom

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.060
was put on for a
couple of reasons.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.110
One is, and the main reason
was, Jan was spraying

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.210
weeds around the base here.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.780
And so that helps
to keep the spray

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.950
off the trunk of the tree.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.610
Also, if you have any rabbits or
critters feeding on the trunks,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.329
that helps protect
that and that also

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.870
gives a little bit
of sun protection.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.870
So--

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.382
And then, Jan, last
thing-- we were

00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:29.090
going to put some
mulch around it to help

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.750
keep the weeds down and also
keep moisture in these circles.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.280
So we've got some flakes of
hay here that we'll break up.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.880
And again, this mulch-- we'd
like to have a couple of inches

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.960
deep at least and not really
stacked up against the tree,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.520
but spread out so that
we're blocking sunlight out

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.010
to the weed growth.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.150
And we can get the moisture
in there when you irrigate,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.890
and that way we'll have a nice,
moist soil that will stay.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.470
And kind of for water
conservation purposes,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.760
this is--

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.180
mulches are good to use.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.810
So we'll kind of keep that
away from the trunk of the tree

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.800
but keep it out here.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.800
Just break it up,
and that way it's--

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.630
hopefully, these trees
will respond to all

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.930
that extra moisture and care.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.140
- This looks good, John.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.410
And then before we
leave here, I want

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.785
to show you all the new growth
that's on that little tree

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:30.636
that we cut back
last time, and then I

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:31.760
want to show you the roses.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.190
- OK

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.264
- John, last time this
tree was about this tall

00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:39.180
and didn't have any
growth, and I think we all

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.900
gasped when you cut it in half.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.690
But I think the
results have paid off.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.996
- Yeah, it looks like we got
good new growth coming out

00:04:44.996 --> 00:04:45.496
on it.

00:04:45.496 --> 00:04:47.340
And hopefully,
that will continue.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.110
Might even get a few
more breaks on it.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.400
So it's looking good.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.560
Keep it watered and
fertilized, and I

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.000
think it'll come back good.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.500
- Great.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.874
- Let's take a
look at the roses.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.040
- John, you remember last
month, we fertilized the roses,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.561
and we've had a lot of
new growth, and some--

00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:06.060
- Yeah, very-- a
lot of good growth.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.800
- --and some beautiful blooms.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.400
Now I'm noticing that
we do have some insects,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400
and there's possibly some
growth that we don't want.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.365
What do you think?

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.460
- Yeah, I think you've
got a few shoots that

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.210
are starting to come out from
probably below the graft union.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.630
You can kind of see how there's
a difference in leaf shape

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.450
and foliage, and these
are kind of putting a lot

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.230
of real rampant growth on.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.400
So these are probably
rootstock material,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.890
so those need to be cut
off at the point of origin.

00:05:40.137 --> 00:05:42.760
I'm going to clip all
those off because they're

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.789
taking a lot of the energy
away from the main part

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:46.330
of the plant.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.570
So we want to keep
those cut down and not

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.400
let them get too
much growth on them.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.030
- OK.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.550
- We also have a rose
here that's kind of a what

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.530
we'd call a spent
rose, where it's

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.180
kind of beyond its maturity, and
so it needs to be clipped off.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.750
Rosarians kind of like to do
it about with the first five

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.970
leaflet leaf.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.750
So we'll cut that off.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.750
And one of the things
that you can kind of check

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.670
for when you're doing
it is to see whether you

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.140
have thrips in here.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.990
And thrips are little
teeny-tiny insects.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.950
You can kind of see just these
little tiny slivers moving

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.860
around on the rose petal.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.570
There's one right
in the center there.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.730
- And what do I need
to do to control those?

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.440
- Those are very,
very hard to control.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.230
Usually what we do is take
the spent roses off and not

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.340
throw them back down on the
ground like a lot of people do.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.800
So soon as the rose is becoming
a little bit over-mature,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.410
get it clipped off and
get it put in the trash

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.220
and disposed of, because you
can re-infest some of the roses

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.590
by throwing these back
down on the ground.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.300
There are insecticides
that you can

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.240
use when the rose is
in more of a tight bud,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.970
because that's when the
thrip will get into them.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.230
And insecticide sprays
can be used there.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.040
Again, in the tight formed ones
that's opened up like this,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.560
then the thrip has probably
already done its damage.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.090
- So with the
insecticide sprays--

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.298
would that be like Malathion?

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:08.800
Or--

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.299
- Right.

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:11.790
Malathion, diazinon,
one of those that you

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.580
can use as a cover spray.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.040
- And what about Rotenone?

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.530
- Rotenone will
help a little bit,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.570
but It has a short
residual, and you really

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.900
have to do a thorough job
of covering the entire bud,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.840
whereas the spray material you
can do it a little bit easier.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.800
- OK.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.840
- Jan, thank you
very much for helping

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.222
to host this segment
of Let's Get Going.

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:31.930
- You're welcome.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.642
- Rose for you.

00:07:32.642 --> 00:07:33.000
- Enjoyed it.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.500
Thank you.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.036
- Thank you.

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:34.910
- See you next month.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:35.510
- OK.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.046
