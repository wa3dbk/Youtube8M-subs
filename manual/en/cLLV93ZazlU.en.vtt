Hi, I'm Mark on behalf of Expert Village.
In this segment we're going to show you how

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.160
to prepare your dry yeast for inoculation
into your wort. First you're going to pour

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:19.850
one cup of water into a nice Pyrex container.
Next, you're going to put this into your microwave

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.359
and turn it on until you get a nice rolling
boil. Once its come to a boil, you're going

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:46.570
to want to take it out and then you're going
to want to cover it with saran wrap. When

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:59.940
you've got it covered, you're going to want
to put it into your refrigerator and let it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.530
cool. You are aiming for it to get around
one hundred degrees which will be just about

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.719
warm on your fingers, but not hot at all.
Our water for our yeast rehydration is now

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.960
getting just about blood temperature which
is where we want it. You can check this with

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.460
a sterilized thermometer to make sure it's
around one hundred degrees. If it's a little

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.590
lower, you're still okay. Now that it's the
right temperature, we are going to add in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.659
the yeast. So we're going to take off the
nice saran wrap covering which has been keeping

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:40.670
it nice and sterile and then we are going
to cover it back up. Now I'm going to take

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.329
a sterilized fork which I used in my sanitization
fluid and help break up the yeast a little

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.869
and get it into the solution. You don't need
to do too much of this, just enough to get

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.609
it under the top of the water and it will
be good. Now, take this back out, get it good

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:02.610
and covered up again, and we're going to put
this aside in our room temperature environment

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.170
for about fifteen to thirty minutes as our
wort cools.
