BEHIND THE SCENES
#125: ELF CITY PART 2 Q&amp;A

00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:16.217
This week mod James shoots your question at the team behind batch two of the Elven City.

00:00:17.244 --> 00:00:22.455
Hi guys. I'm mod James and today I'm lucky enough to sit down with some of the mods behind batch 2 of the Elf City.

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:26.187
So, question number one coming in from Elf Carantir.

00:00:26.188 --> 00:00:29.616
What changes have been made to part one of the city after feedback?

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.846
Lots of little things. Like, you can replay the entrance cutscene,

00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:35.574
there's a well been added to the Crewys area,

00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:39.885
the Imcando pickaxe will now incinerate corrupted ore.

00:00:40.097 --> 00:00:41.081
Lots of little stuff.

00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:44.580
Miu asks what farming patches will be in part 2 of the city?

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.300
So, there's an existing farming patch type, which is the fruit tree patch.

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:53.861
There are also four new farming patches, which do something a little bit different to your traditional farming.

00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:59.363
So they're called Harmony pillars. They're massive stone obelisks that are in the ground.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.759
You collect moss seeds and you plant the moss at the base of the pillar.

00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:08.347
And then the moss grows as you gain experience in other skills.

00:01:08.348 --> 00:01:12.972
So, you rake the patch and it may be a smithing patch, for example. So you plant your seed there

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:19.318
and as you get smithing xp, the moss grows up the pillar and then when it reaches the cap you harvest it

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.870
and you get some moss out of it, which is used to make potions.

00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:28.183
Ryun Stark asks what has been the biggest challenge when adapting the Elf City concept into reality?

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:35.124
I think the biggest challenge, apart from the fact that the city is so big, it is one of the largest areas we've done,

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:39.102
but the biggest problem was the sense of scale, the really tall towers.

00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:44.879
Trying to get those in game and having the player walk up to them and making sure player can see enough,

00:01:45.123 --> 00:01:47.761
I think that was the hardest part of it, of the project for us.

00:01:48.152 --> 00:01:53.020
Ferenc2017 asks is there any specific reason why some of the crystals used around the city

00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:55.907
were not used on the top of the buildings like some of the concept art?

00:01:56.136 --> 00:02:00.928
Yeah, we did want to put some gameplay associated with the crystal at the top of the towers

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.989
but one of the things we did when we did early playtests was you just couldn't see them

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.391
because they were so high you really had to move your camera and really know where to look in order to find them

00:02:10.392 --> 00:02:14.521
and so we thought because they are so far away we decided to not include them.

00:02:15.277 --> 00:02:19.960
TheRealQuaid asks what can we expect to see from the two dungeoneering resource dungeons?

00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:22.621
There are absolutely loads of content in these two new dungeons.

00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:25.095
I'll pick some of my favourite parts out for you.

00:02:25.324 --> 00:02:28.676
The level 95 dungeon includes the Gorajo hoardstalker.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:36.520
He will once a day give you a card that you can take into a dungeoneering dungeon which will give you an effect of some kind.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.082
And there's quite a few of them. There's also group cards in there which will effect your entire party.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.030
In the 115 dungeons we've got the Edimmu.

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:51.476
The Edimmu room is only accessible if you're on a slayer task to kill Edimmu and they are pretty tough to kill

00:02:51.477 --> 00:02:54.495
but they have an excellent drop table and some really awesome stuff on there.

00:02:55.443 --> 00:03:00.418
R4tt3pl4n asks what kind of rewards will be available from the motherlode maw and where can it be found?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.811
The motherlode maw is within the 115 resource dungeon.

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.614
You need to have 115 dungeoneering to get in there.

00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.999
The sort of rewards it gives are based around them helping players to complete their completionist cape requirements.

00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:18.954
It drops these really awesome things called enhancers and there are various different ones.

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:26.047
You keep them in your inventory and they help you to do things like get the gold tickets in Castle Wars.

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:28.491
So if you are in a game that you would get a gold ticket,

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:31.254
if you have this enhancer with you you can get double tickets,

00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:32.834
and they have charges.

00:03:33.737 --> 00:03:39.641
Jamie0208 asks will the blue crystals that hold the city together change colour once the city is finished growing?

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:45.748
So, as of the new launch on Monday, the city will be finalised in its current state.

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.523
We're going to keep the city a mixture of blue and white.

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:53.314
So, the more finalised architecture of the houses will be white

00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:56.829
but the more solid bases are going to stay blue.

00:03:56.864 --> 00:04:01.874
That represents more of the organically grown crystal just like the existing blue crystal tree.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.998
Morgan asks with the Ithell clan opening will the player owned house portal be moving?

00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:09.756
The player owned house portal will move to the Ithell area.

00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:12.309
There'll be a bank chest about the same distance away from it.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.312
There's also a sawmill operator who sells Keldagrim stonemason construction materials,

00:04:18.313 --> 00:04:20.871
so it's a very convenient place to do your construction.

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.593
IBody asks how will the new combat divination-training work?

00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:27.893
So, within the Amlodd section of the city there is a big crater.

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:31.261
Around that crater there are shadow creatures of 3 different tiers.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.231
Obviously the combat level is different on each one.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:40.527
They drop cores from themselves which you then purify in the crater for divination experience

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:44.634
and you have a chance to get a light core in return which is used to make a new familiar.

00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:48.868
So, how will this compare with the current AFK divination training methods?

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:55.577
So it's less AFK because you've got the combat element involved in it but you get the nice balance of combat xp and divination xp.

00:04:55.803 --> 00:04:59.080
It mixes things up from your traditional divination.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.114
You've also have the chance to get the shadow creatures on a slayer task,

00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:05.955
so you can introduce that slayer xp element in there as well.

00:05:07.525 --> 00:05:08.731
So that's it for the questions.

00:05:08.732 --> 00:05:11.242
Thank you guys for taking the time out of your day to answer them.

00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:11.898
You're very welcome.

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:12.806
Happy to do it.

00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:13.485
Thanks.

00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:17.915
And you guys can look forward to seeing Elf City batch two in game next week.

00:05:19.273 --> 00:05:22.743
We'll be back next week with more of this months biggest updates.
