00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.211
Hey, guys.

00:00:00.211 --> 00:00:00.501
What's up?

00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:00.931
It's Mike.

00:00:00.931 --> 00:00:02.351
So the other day me
and my girlfriend

00:00:02.351 --> 00:00:03.716
are coming home from
the farmer's market,

00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:04.601
and she turns to me.

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.501
And she's like, "You know
what's cool about the farmer's

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:07.031
market?"

00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:08.708
And I'm like, "No."

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:11.041
And she's like, "The best
thing about the farmers market

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.861
is all the farm fresh eggs.

00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:15.681
Could you imagine waking up next
to each other, being in love,

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.011
and having farm fresh
eggs every morning?"

00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:20.366
And I'm like, "Well, I'm
not going to farmer's market

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:20.991
every morning."

00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:22.101
And she's like, "No, no.

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:23.355
Sh, sh."

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.021
She put her finger
on my mouth like that

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:26.191
which she knows I hate.

00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:27.316
Don't know why she does it.

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:29.481
And she was like, "Maybe
if we had our own chicken,

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:32.411
we could have our own farm
fresh eggs in the apartment."

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:34.011
So finally, I'm at
my breaking point.

00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:35.111
And I'm like, "We
can't have a chicken."

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:36.061
She's like, "Why?

00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:37.788
Because chickens
are wild animals?"

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:38.621
And I'm like, "Yeah.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:54.665
Because chickens
are wild animals."

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.581
So one of her arguments
for getting this thing

00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:58.971
was, you know we eat a
lot of chicken and eggs.

00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:00.535
So this is not
only a pet that we

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:01.951
could have for
companionship, this

00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:03.231
is also a very productive pet.

00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:04.411
And I'm like, OK.

00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:06.911
So what you're talking about
is either eating the stuff that

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:09.521
drops out of our pet
or eating our pet.

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:12.161
So you want me to develop a
relationship with this thing

00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:13.531
and then end up seasoning it.

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:14.941
And hoping it's delicious.

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.858
Let's flip the script.

00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:18.107
Do you remember when you
used to have that guinea pig?

00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:19.061
Would you eat Stuffy?

00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:20.671
As I understand
it, chickens only

00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:22.691
lay eggs until they're
about four or so.

00:01:22.691 --> 00:01:24.301
And then, they live
for about 8 years.

00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:25.871
So that's half of their
life where they're just

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:28.661
kind of freeloading, walking
around, making noise, waking me

00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:30.041
up, pooping on things I love.

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.311
And she's like, "I just read
an article the other day

00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:34.671
on how popular urban chicken
farming is becoming."

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:36.713
And I'm like, "How hipster
do you want us to get?

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:38.087
We already have
a record player."

00:01:38.087 --> 00:01:40.051
Do you know chickens and
roosters are actually

00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:42.171
banned in most areas
because of the crowing.

00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:44.051
Most people think
roosters and chickens

00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:45.541
only crow early in the mornings.

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:46.221
And I get it.

00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:47.351
I used to watch cartoons.

00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:48.101
But they don't.

00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:49.631
They crow all day.

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:50.131
Constantly.

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:52.214
You know what I have to
wake me up early every day

00:01:52.214 --> 00:01:52.981
when I have work?

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:54.031
My trusty cell phone.

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.468
You know what I
have to wake me up

00:01:55.468 --> 00:01:57.051
on days where they
don't have to work?

00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:57.551
Nothing.

00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:59.878
You could actually set
the time on a cellphone.

00:01:59.878 --> 00:02:01.211
Can't set the time on a chicken.

00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:02.311
We're going to get this thing.

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:03.911
And it's going to be
crowing constantly.

00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:04.976
Could you imagine if it were me?

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:06.433
And I was just
yelling constantly?

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:07.641
And this is how we conversed?

00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:08.166
Can't stop.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:08.851
Won't stop.

00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:09.741
It is annoying, yet?

00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:12.111
So the beaks are sharp
enough to break skin.

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:13.661
And that's great
because that's how

00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:15.281
they explore their surroundings.

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:16.351
Here's you. "Oh, look.

00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:18.786
He's trying to introduce
himself to us."

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:20.911
Here's me. "Well, that's
going to be a huge problem

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:22.121
because I hate bleeding."

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:24.361
So most chickens lay
like one egg a day

00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:26.486
which, if my calculations
serves me correctly,

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:28.681
that's 365 eggs a year.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.183
365 divided by-- yeah.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.141
That makes total sense.

00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:33.141
God forbid, I want a
three-egg omelette one day.

00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:35.371
That means two
days without eggs.

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:35.931
Yes.

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.071
That's exactly what it means.

00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:38.471
Have you ever heard
of the avian flu?

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:39.441
You know where that comes from?

00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:40.001
Our new pet.

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.001
Look how adorable it is.

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.031
Put it in a Christmas card.

00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:42.591
Merry Christmas.

00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:43.861
Do you know what we got you?

00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:44.961
Throwing up forever.

00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:46.851
Plus, they need a lot
of room to run around.

00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:48.331
And I don't know if
you've been here,

00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:49.501
but we live in an apartment.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.161
So if I see this
thing running at me,

00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:51.981
I'm going to drop kick
the mother [BLEEP].

00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:53.341
And you know how
you've been saying

00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:54.521
we need more personal time?

00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:56.581
They don't call it [BLEEP]
blocking for nothing.

00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:58.271
And that's why we
can't get a chicken.

00:03:03.741 --> 00:03:08.385
Chickens are meant to
be eaten and not loved.
