00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:04.192
“Improbable Deaths”.
Andy, Elidio and Edu will play.

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:07.852
I'll need you to give me
three objects.

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:12.058
'Nail polish’!
Another non-lethal object.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.817
'Duster’! Great!

00:00:15.878 --> 00:00:18.715
- Answering machine!
- ‘Answering machine’!

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:22.638
They will improvise a scene,
in any way they want,

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:28.387
but Edu will die by nail polish.

00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:31.085
Andy will die by duster.

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:35.767
And for Elidio I carefully chose
a death by an answering machine.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:42.642
It will be over when they are
dead by those objects you gave us.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:45.831
It's the “Death Game”, go!

00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:51.049
Bernardete, could you
come into my office?

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.310
Yes?

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.153
Here's the thing: I called a repairman
and he didn't fix the answering machine.

00:01:00.153 --> 00:01:05.584
- But... - Bernardete, I leave you for
five minutes with the repairman,

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:07.966
he doesn't fix the machine
and you let him go?

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:12.019
I thought he fixed it, boss!
He tricked me!

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:13.699
I can take it to the
repair shop if you want...

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:18.026
Never mind, I'll fix this
machine by myself now...

00:01:18.026 --> 00:01:22.693
- May I move the machine
for a second... - Sure.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.780
- I'll leave it... - I insist
to take it to the repair shop.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.535
- Just for dusting... - Turns out
I'm the boss! Isn't it crazy?

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:38.355
It's crazy, I'll fix the
answering machine by myself!

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:42.728
But you are... Well, I don't wanna
meddle, I meddle too much already...

00:01:46.503 --> 00:01:51.462
- Easy, boss! - I got shocked!
What do you say!

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:55.554
Listen! Stop dusting the boss'
room, he has rhinitis!

00:01:55.554 --> 00:01:59.605
I'll take this duster and
put it away from this room!

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:02.958
Fine! I'll take another one!

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.230
I'm glad we got the wrong shipment,
I asked for one and they gave us eleven!

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.570
We got eleven dusters!

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:17.344
- I'll go back to my lacework!
- No. We're doing this together.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.975
- I disconnected the power plug so
you don't get shocked! - Of course!

00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:27.722
- You don't have to worry!
- Thanks a lot!

00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:31.581
By the way, do you have
a plastic bag I can borrow?

00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:34.800
- I have a plastic bag.
- The one from the duster, can I have it?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.115
- Here! I still have the duster.
- Thanks!

00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:45.535
What is going on in my office?

00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:49.734
I'm just sniffing nail polish
to bear the stress, boss!

00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:52.929
You have the nerve to sniff
nail polish in my office?

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:56.414
Here, you can use mine,
it's very good too.

00:02:56.771 --> 00:03:00.219
Wow, a ‘gabriella’,
amazing!

00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:03.698
- Listen, I want both of you...
- Weren't you going to fix the machine?

00:03:03.698 --> 00:03:07.972
- I was going to fix the machine...
- Then fix the fucking machine.

00:03:08.874 --> 00:03:11.635
Listen, who do you
think you're talking to?

00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:13.682
With my grandson!

00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:19.003
You don't get to treat me like that just
because you gave me the job, hot shot.

00:03:20.642 --> 00:03:24.304
I don't have authority
in my own company!

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:26.206
Boss, I think I'm feeling sick!

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:30.674
Of course, you were breathing
nail polish in my office!

00:03:30.674 --> 00:03:34.389
- Give me that nail polish.
- No... Let me have it!

00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:39.034
Here.
There's another one.

00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:44.556
I ordered a nail polish. They
sent eleven! Can you believe it?

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:47.383
Those delivery girls...

00:03:47.383 --> 00:03:51.318
I cant take this anymore!
I can't take it!

00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:55.259
- I'll do something crazy!
- Boss!

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:01.344
- I decided to do something crazy!
- No, no...

00:04:01.344 --> 00:04:04.899
- I did! I'll put the answering
machine here... - Oh, no...

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:11.009
Easy! What are you
thinking? Stay there!

00:04:11.296 --> 00:04:16.483
Beacuse I'll jump from the
19th floor! That's what I'll do.

00:04:16.483 --> 00:04:19.178
My God, the boss
is gonna kill himself!

00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:21.098
I'm waiting!

00:04:21.098 --> 00:04:24.091
- Don't forget that the machine is here!
- Of course!

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:26.105
Bye!

00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:28.136
- Bye, grandson!
- I don't have the courage.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:32.361
The answering machine
hit my head!

00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:38.161
Boss!
How could you let it happen?

00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:46.322
Boss! Look at this red puddle,
it looks like a ‘let me kiss’ polish!

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:54.950
They will accuse us!
And you're not doing anything!

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.242
Throw this duster away!
Do something!

00:04:58.242 --> 00:05:01.708
That's the second one,
I got nine more!

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:07.150
I'm nervous! I'll have a beer
from his fridge to calm down!

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.287
This beer is not good!

00:05:12.486 --> 00:05:17.674
Oh, my God! It's really strange!
I'm feeling...

00:05:17.674 --> 00:05:22.173
It's from Poland...
a Polish ale!

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:38.567
To see my favorite employee fall.

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:40.842
To see my grandson die.

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:46.022
The pain is so strong.
So strong...

00:05:46.022 --> 00:05:53.040
This kind of pain makes
my heart turn to dust.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.436
And this duster
takes my life away!

00:06:09.163 --> 00:06:14.117
He had nine dusters to stick wherever
he wanted, and he died from a pun!

00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:20.767
This duster
takes my life away!

00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:24.042
You have to be a poet
to talk like that!

00:06:24.643 --> 00:06:27.543
CIA. BARBIXAS DE HUMOR
presented

00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:34.544
IMPROV¡VEL
Probably a good show.

00:06:39.843 --> 00:06:43.043
It's running on the Pinheiros road
and there's a woman in there!
