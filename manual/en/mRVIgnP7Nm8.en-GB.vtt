00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.820
I chose Birmingham because of the broad range
of programmes available and the location of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.560
the city. Birmingham often rains, but when
it rains the green get greener, the bricks

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.020
get redder. It’s absolutely stunning.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.610
It’s a very relaxing and calm environment
which makes it easy to study.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.600
The university has a chemical engineering
department and I found the University of Birmingham’s

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.000
Chemical Engineering is very good.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.040
The best things of this university is it’s
cultural diversity. I can study with many

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.340
international students and be friends with
them.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.620
What I like the most in Birmingham is my accommodation.
Actually on-campus accommodation called The

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.220
Vale and this accommodation is very comfortable
to live, surrounded by beautiful nature and

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.220
a beautiful lake.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.260
There are comparatively less Japanese people
here so it’s the perfect environment for

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.160
me to practice my English.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.771
Birmingham is really convenient. We have a
huge shopping mall in the city centre. In

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.260
there you can buy anything you want.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.080
The biggest difference between Birmingham
and Japan is that Birmingham is more diversified

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.030
in terms of the culture. It’s a place where
all the colleagues bring the different expertise,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.000
study, compete and we learn from each other.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.900
Meeting students with different backgrounds
has been a very nice opportunity to me.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.920
What I recommend to you before coming to Birmingham
is to get used to the British accent as much

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.340
as possible because personally I thought that
yeah, actually I was so struggling to understand

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.370
what people said when I came here.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.950
The university has free English classes and
an English club which provides you a free

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.380
opportunity to practice your daily conversational
English.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.270
So I would advise them to practice their speaking
and writing their opinions in English.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.790
The best piece of advice is to learn how to
cook because the food is really different,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.069
so you might want to cook by yourself.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.120
Don’t worry about your studies because the
system of study support is excellent and many

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.930
international friends will help you. Don’t
worry about food because there is a nice Asian

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:38.569
food supermarket near the campus so you will
never miss Japan. Please come and study together.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:54.650
Come to Birmingham!
