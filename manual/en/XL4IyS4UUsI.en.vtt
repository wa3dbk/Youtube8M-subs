00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.180
My dishwasher is draining into my sink.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.450
What can I do?

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.160
Some dishwashers were designed to drain through
a side adapter next to the garbage disposal.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.990
That's especially true in older plumbing.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.480
This is not an old dishwasher.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.840
This is a matter of how the sink was plumbed,
and the connections may stay the same if you

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.820
installed a new dishwasher tomorrow.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.019
What if that isn't the cause?

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.300
If it was the cause, you could get a separate
trap for the dishwasher that isn't connected

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.630
to the garbage disposal.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.520
Or the lack of drainage could be a stopped
up garbage disposal.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.660
I'd hate to think that I need to get a plunger
for the sink so I can do my dishes either

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.830
way.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.610
If this is the case, then you need a new trap
and drain for the dishwasher.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.790
What's another possible cause?

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.970
The dishwasher drain line might be backed
up.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.730
You might have to disassemble it to remove
any blockage.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.010
That's what we pay plumbers for.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.010
You might want to run the garbage disposal
at the start of the dishwasher cycle, so that

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.390
you may clear out the line before the water
starts to flood the sink.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.290
It sounds like I need Draino for my dishwasher
hoses.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.100
You should use garbage disposal cleaners,
not Draino, through those hoses.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.050
And garbage disposal deodorizers aren't good
enough.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.480
I heard that dishwashers have their own garbage
disposals.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.560
They may have small blades to grind up some
food that goes down the drain, but it won't

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.070
get everything.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.820
Others have a small basket to get the big
stuff.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.370
That's like a lint catcher on a dryer.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.830
And it may need to be cleaned because it can
get clogged.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.000
It sounds like food is clogging the drain
path, no matter where the thing drains.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.200
That's the most common cause of the problem
you're having.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.990
Little plastic parts from baby bottles or
toys are a less common cause of blockage.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.430
Not in our house.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.850
My kids got to watch as Daddy disassembled
the toilet to find the Legos they were flushing

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.640
down the drain.
