00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:15.355

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.620
- It's only 30 seconds.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.659

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:29.820
- Shut up.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.332
- Alright, Inna, what is the
name of this sexy ass drink?

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:34.794
- [Inna] It's called The Breeze.

00:00:34.794 --> 00:00:36.815
- [Skyy] Why you call it
The Breeze, I don't know.

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:37.621
- [Inna] I don't know either.

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.540
- But that's pretty bad ass.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.367
Let's make this drink.

00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:42.088
Here hold that for me.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.870
Hold tight (mumbles).

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:50.939
- [Inna] It's a slusher, right?

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.605
- (chuckles) It's a slusher?

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.565
Coconut rum, pour!

00:00:55.256 --> 00:00:56.050

00:00:57.822 --> 00:00:59.378
Stop!

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:03.059
- Looks like somebody peed on the snow.

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:05.907
- You ever pee nn the snow lil' Inna?

00:01:05.907 --> 00:01:07.186
Triplesec pour!

00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:09.005
- If I had a wiener I would do that.

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:10.958
- Stop, next one.

00:01:11.712 --> 00:01:12.462
Stop.

00:01:12.462 --> 00:01:13.920
What do you mean if you
had a wiener you'd do that?

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.334
- See, when you have
that dangling particle,

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:19.588
you can write on the snow.

00:01:19.588 --> 00:01:20.746
- You can write too.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:21.980
Can you twirl?
- [Inna] Not really.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.093
- Girls can write.

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:24.232
- You have to just squat.

00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:26.693
- I know a girl who can write
cursive in her pee homeboy.

00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:29.637
That's talent, okay.

00:01:29.637 --> 00:01:31.202
Calligraphy and shit.

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:35.171
Okay pour 99 bananas, pour. (laughter)

00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:37.582
Stop, next one.

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:38.747
Stop, next one.

00:01:38.747 --> 00:01:40.928
You only need a little bit of
this 'cause it's potent, okay?

00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:44.863
Okay hit it with a splash.

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:46.528
- Just a splash?

00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:48.327
More of a splash?

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:51.759
- Pineapple juice, pour.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.528
- That's a weird way to
shake it after you open it.

00:01:54.528 --> 00:01:55.593
- Top it off, top it off,
top it off, top it off.

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:56.846
- That'll work.

00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:59.013
- Top it off, okay.

00:01:59.013 --> 00:02:04.013
Garnish with those red, no,

Mmhmm, next one.

00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:10.076
Mmmhmm okay.

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:12.784
- Okay.

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:13.707
- What are you doing what are you doing?

00:02:13.707 --> 00:02:14.630
You shoot out, what is that?

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.553
That's a shoot out?
- [Inna] I don't know,

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:16.468
I'm trying.

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:18.307
- And there you have it, The Breeze.

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:23.208
Created by my boy Bartending

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:23.984
You ready?

00:02:23.984 --> 00:02:25.898
- Way to go bachelors.

00:02:25.898 --> 00:02:27.280
- Are you into bachelors?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.401
I'm a bachelor.

00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:30.985
Put your lips on that, oops.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.899
- Mmmmm, wow.

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.951
Really bananas, this drink is bananas.

00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.957
It's like tasting like a banana.

00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:43.064
- Just for authenticity's sake okay.

00:02:43.064 --> 00:02:45.323
We've been sipping on these
while we're making this.

00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:48.212
♫ I made it for you, baby ♫

00:02:48.212 --> 00:02:51.165
- Not you, Bachelor. (laughs)

00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:52.425
Bartender Bachelor.

00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:57.073
♫ I made it for you, baby ♫ (chuckles)

00:02:57.073 --> 00:02:58.920
- Give me some high-pitch notes.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.634
♫ Baby ha ♫

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:03.916
Let me just go a little bit higher.

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:06.701
♫ ha ♫

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.373
Okay, huh, huh?

00:03:08.373 --> 00:03:10.787
- It sounds like somebody's killing a--

00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:13.215
- You know where I learned
that trick, Michael Jackson.

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:15.254
♫ C'mon, get with it ♫

00:03:15.254 --> 00:03:16.430
You know that's what I'm
saying, that's what I'm saying.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.377
That's some Michael Jackson's, 'cause this

00:03:17.377 --> 00:03:19.086
Michael Jackson real
natural voice right here.

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:21.364
- Yeah, no, but well, like
he gives like that little--

00:03:21.364 --> 00:03:22.505
- That's what I am saying.

00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:24.978
♫ Billie Jean's not my lover ♫

00:03:24.978 --> 00:03:29.978
And then he just gives
himself a little (screams).

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:33.041
You see?

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.199
- Is it necessary to?

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.945
- You just got to use these fingers.

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:38.742
Just grab an edge and squeeze and you

00:03:38.742 --> 00:03:40.539
get that pitch okay gentlemen, okay?

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:42.953
- Let's give them daily advice.

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.507
- Condoms. Wear 'em.

00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:46.989
- But they break guys.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.194
One percent out of 90--
- [Skyy] Wear two!

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:51.445
If you're going in dark
territory, put on two.

00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:52.953
Tuck them nuts in there too.

00:03:52.953 --> 00:03:53.911
- Does it work, two?

00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:54.869
Isn't it a little bit you know--

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:55.827
- They say two is--

00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:56.954
- Rubber on rubber?

00:03:56.954 --> 00:03:59.032
- No, no no, okay because
people joke about that

00:03:59.032 --> 00:04:02.514
and nurses have said that
using two is dangerous

00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:05.812
because it causes it to slip
off and all this sort of stuff.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.717
You know what I'm saying, okay?

00:04:07.717 --> 00:04:08.464
- No but--

00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:09.236
- But what does a nurse know?

00:04:09.236 --> 00:04:10.785
How many nurses out there
getting (mumbles) on?

00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:12.985
- The only question I
have, like okay you put

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:14.832
one on, you have one layer.

00:04:14.832 --> 00:04:16.476
But then it's rubber on rubber.

00:04:16.476 --> 00:04:17.873
Is that even possible?

00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:19.766
- Yeah because there's
lubrication on some of them.

00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:21.548
So you can put rubber on rubber and then

00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:24.428
get the bottom part and
they'll strap your nuts in.

00:04:24.428 --> 00:04:25.815
Okay? (laughter)

00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:27.202
Get them nuts in there.

00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:28.375
- What's going on down there that's--

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:29.658
- No, 'cause you got plastic on this.

00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:30.725
You've got this rubber on the shaft

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:32.162
- Have you ever tried that?

00:04:32.162 --> 00:04:33.894
- Yeah, but your balls hanging
out there all alone going,

00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:37.724
"Hey, hey homeboy. What
about us, what about us?"

00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:39.088
- He's a ball right now.

00:04:39.088 --> 00:04:40.388
- We gonna rub up against this shit.

00:04:40.388 --> 00:04:41.226
What are you gonna do, okay?

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:42.317
So you just tuck 'em in.

00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:43.962
I got you boy, tuck 'em in.

00:04:43.962 --> 00:04:45.330
- Too much information.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.422
- Tipsy Bartender.

00:04:46.422 --> 00:04:47.806
Sex Ed homeboy.

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:51.838
- I'm traumatized. (laughter)

00:04:51.838 --> 00:04:53.405
- Sarah, what's this called?

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:54.273
- Sundae Funday.

00:04:54.273 --> 00:04:56.829
- Exactly, we are making a Sundae funday.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.609
- One, two, one.

00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:02.309
- One, two, one, one two, one.

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.677
- Jesus Christ. Okay.
