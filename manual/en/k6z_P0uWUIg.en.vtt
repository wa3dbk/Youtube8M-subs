00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.770
[Steve Myers] What does the Bible teach about
homosexuality?

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.350
It's big in the news right now.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.750
It seems like our modern society has been
developing, growing, and suddenly we're faced

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.519
with all these new issues.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.020
Well, where do you go for the truth?

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.369
The problem is, is homosexuality really a
new issue?

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.900
You know, according to the Bible, it's not.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.259
The first century Church faced the issue of
homosexuality.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.220
It faced the problems that came with that.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.130
There's an interesting passage over in Romans
chapter 1, right at the very beginning of

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.910
Romans, verse 28.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:47.350
It says, "Even as they did not like to retain
God in their knowledge, God gave them over

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.370
to a debased mind to do the things which are
not fitting."

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.370
You might say, boy that's pretty tough.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.470
That's pretty hard.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.340
We have a harsh, mean God.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.270
Well, is that true?

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.610
Let's think about that and see what the Bible
actually says.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.550
In verse 29 it says, "They were filled with
all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.610
covetous, full of envy..."

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.860
And it goes on to list all of these different
types of things that they gave over - they

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.280
were given over to this debased way of thinking.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.090
In verse 26 it says, "Even their women did
change the natural use of that which is against

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.090
nature."

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.990
Verse 27 says, "Likewise also the men, leaving
the natural use of the woman, burned in their

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.550
lust toward one another" (Romans 1:24-32).

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.710
You see God points out that's unacceptable.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.170
That is unacceptable behavior before God.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.670
If we claim to be Christians, it's unacceptable.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.479
It's also interesting as the Apostle Paul
addressed the church at Corinth, God's people,

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.950
here's what he told them over in 1 Corinthians
chapter 6.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.950
I'll write that one down.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.340
1 Corinthians chapter 6 and it's throughout
the chapter, but beginning in verse 9.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.869
He says something interesting.áHe says, "Don't
you know that the unrighteous will not inherit

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.110
the Kingdom of God" (1 Corinthians 6:9).

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.130
Then he says do not be deceived.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.330
It's interesting how many times throughout
the Bible when you read this phrase "do not

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.190
be deceived" really you should step back and
remember this is something that I could be

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.590
fooled about, this is something that I might
misunderstand unless God reveals it in His

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.690
word.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.160
And so Paul specifically says watch out, be
careful, beware, do not be deceived.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.060
Well, what is it that we could be deceived
about?

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:51.140
Well, he says, "Neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor Sodomitesů"

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.319
And then he expands that list to "Thieves,
those that are covetous, nor drunkards, nor

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.050
revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the
Kingdom of God" (1 Corinthians 6:9-10).

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.340
So none in those categories will have eternal
life.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.370
They will not be a part of the Kingdom of
God.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.680
They will not be in God's family.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.490
That is the straight scoop on all of those
behaviors.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.380
They are unacceptable before God and we cannot
be in the family of God if we practice those

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.690
things.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.680
But you know, he doesn't leave it there.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.260
Because this was an old issue, because this
is not something new, Paul showed very clearly

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.670
that there is a solution.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.940
You know what he said to those in Corinth?

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.460
In verse 11 - this is very important - in
verse 11 after making that list and sounding

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.030
very harsh, very hard, he says something interesting.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.739
He says, "And such were some of you."

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.360
You see, some of God's very own people had
been practicing those things.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.230
They were thieves, they were revilers, they
were extortioners.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.239
Yes, they were fornicators.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.830
Yes, they were homosexuals.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.910
They were Sodomites.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.519
Some of them were those things.

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.050
They practiced those things.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.360
And yet, Paul calls them Christians.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.900
Some of them in the Church of God, they were
guilty of those things that he listed.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.259
But, he says this, "But you were washed.

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.069
You were sanctified.

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:31.139
You were justified in the name of the Lord
Jesus and by the spirit of God" (1 Corinthians

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.139
6:11).

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.610
So in other words, God says that they came
out of those lifestyles.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.349
They were no longer fornicators.

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.199
They were no longer thieves.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.050
They were no longer homosexuals.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.389
They were no longer Sodomites - that they
came out of that.

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.300
They repented, they changed, and they put
that behavior behind them.áThey were converted

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.580
in other words.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.360
And so they lived a life with the mind of
Jesus Christ.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.199
So could we say that God loves those people?

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.849
Absolutely, God loves those that were thieves.

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.740
God loves the revilers.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.999
He loves the extortioners.

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:14.660
Right, Jesus Christ died so that these people
could be a part of the family of God - for

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.020
you and I to be a part of the family of God.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.449
God so loved the world that He gave His only
begotten Son.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.509
That is fact.

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:29.620
Now the thing is, He loves the sinner, but
He hates the sin.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.479
And so we are called to come out of that kind
of behavior.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.219
We are called to be washed clean by the blood
of the Lamb.

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:39.350
That's what's most important.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.969
So do not be deceived.

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.509
God does not accept those behaviors.

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:50.909
That has to be something that we come out
of so that ultimately we can say what those

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.030
in Corinth were told.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:00.279
Such were some of us, but now we are clean
through Jesus Christ.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:01.279
That's BT Daily.

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:02.349
We'll see you next time.
