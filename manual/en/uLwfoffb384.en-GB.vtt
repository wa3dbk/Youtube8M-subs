00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.189
HDCP compliance errors are a common problem
when mixing modern HDMI devices with older

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.200
technology AV products.
But what is HDCP and how can we overcome these

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:20.400
errors? Join us here at HowToAV.tv as we find
out...

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.820
Welcome to HowToAV.tv.
Today I'm joined by our very own AV signal

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.800
distribution expert Martin Featherstone to
talk HDCP and HDCP errors.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.090
So Martin, perhaps you could start us off
by deciphering yet another of those AV acronyms.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.700
What does HDCP actually stand for and what
is it designed to do?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.579
Well, as you say Chris, it is another AV acronym
- High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection - so you

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.579
can see why they shortened it to HDCP.
Basically, it was developed by Intel to prevent

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.019
piracy and the ability to copy HD images and
video - and audio as well - across peer-to-peer

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.400
networks and on the internet as well.
So what's HDCP doing within the AV system

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.500
and how does it work?
As I mentioned, it's designed to prevent the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.300
digital audio and video content being copied
by third party devices as it travels between

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.860
connections. So, as the transmitting device
delivers the content and then the display

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.380
receives it, both of which have to be HDCP
compliant in order to pass that HD video across.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.760
So I guess, therefore, that this can cause
the HDCP compliance errors and affect the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.950
success of the signal?
That's correct, the HDCP has to be present

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.610
on both the source and display. If it's present
on the source, but isn't present on the display,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.490
then no image will be passed, no video will
be passed.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.850
If both source and display are compliant then
you will get video and audio being passed

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.760
between the devices. And that's why Chris,
you might not get a picture.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.000
You also mentioned devices which aren't compliant;
what sort of devices might they be?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.810
Things like PCs can be non HDCP-compliant. Because
on a PC the content is your own, although

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.590
it's digital, once you send it up to the screen
it's actually your own content, therefore

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.640
you own it, so there's no issues with sharing
that across the network or across the internet

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.530
as well.
Some other instances are where maybe a broadcaster

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.910
have got their own content - so companies
like Sky and the BBC own their own content.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.670
Therefore, they can do what they want to it.
Therefore, it doesn't have any HDCP compliancy

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.940
in-house.
Once it's then broadcast, at that point it

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.130
then becomes HDCP compliant.
And finally, Martin, tell us - is there a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.980
nice workaround or an easy fix to HDCP compliance
errors?..

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.610
In a word... No - not really! There's not
much you can do. As I mentioned, if it's your

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.600
own content then you are able to distribute
and do things with it. An example is Sky or

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.550
broadcasting companies where they own the
content. But other than that, really, no - you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.490
are stuck with it.
If it's a non-HDCP device and a non-HDCP display,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.490
I'm afraid you're not going to get an image.
So that's HDCP; and it would seem that if

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.040
you're experiencing HDCP error messages, the
likelihood is that one or more of your devices

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.120
on the system simply isn't HDCP compliant.
