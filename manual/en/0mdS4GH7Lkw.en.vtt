00:00:00.763 --> 00:00:02.731
- [Voiceover] I want to talk
about some complications

00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:06.276
of Cystic Fibrosis that
don't seem as intuitive.

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:07.499
Everybody thinks of CF

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:10.844
as mostly thick mucus in the lungs,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:11.897
and you have GI problems,

00:00:11.897 --> 00:00:13.623
not having the pancreas enzymes,

00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:15.721
and those are the very important

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:19.093
and poster-child complications of CF,

00:00:19.093 --> 00:00:20.083
but there's some other things

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:21.941
that don't seem as intuitive,

00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:25.543
just in thinking of the
chloride channel not working.

00:00:25.543 --> 00:00:26.999
I want to talk about three of these,

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.464
and let's start with the
issue of infertility.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.562
This actually affects a lot,

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:35.458
I would say, most CF patients.

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:38.145
Up to 98 percent of the
men can be infertile,

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:39.924
and men and women have different reasons,

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:42.302
but let's look at men first.

00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:45.783
For men, the reason that
they tend to be infertile

00:00:45.783 --> 00:00:48.539
is because of an absence of these tubes

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.539
called vas deferens, so, vas deferens.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.111
It's a funny word to describe
a specific set of tubes

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:00.220
in the male reproductive system.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.737
If I were to draw it, let's
put the testes down here,

00:01:03.737 --> 00:01:06.806
and sperm begins their
life down here, but,

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.995
after maturing and they
have to be transferred up

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:12.761
these tubes that are
connected to the testes

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.426
that transfer the sperm
and allow them to mature,

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:17.910
these are the vas deferens.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.658
In CF, up to 98 percent
of men don't have this,

00:01:22.658 --> 00:01:26.235
and this condition's called
vas deferens agenesis.

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:29.103
Genesis means to generate,

00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:31.753
and agenesis just means
it doesn't develop.

00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:33.260
When these babies are in the womb,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.743
the thick mucus here clogs off these tubes

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:37.944
and they don't actually ever develop,

00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:39.691
so we have vas deferens agenesis.

00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:42.181
That's the reason for male infertility

00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:43.942
because the sperm can't go

00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:45.397
to where they need to go,

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.765
and they can't mature
without the vas deferens, so,

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:50.598
basically, we don't have
sperm production here.

00:01:50.598 --> 00:01:51.829
For females, of course,

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.413
the reason is completely different.

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:59.002
If I could just draw the
female system really quickly,

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:00.795
I'm going to draw it like this,

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:05.060
so here is the cervix,
and up here is the uterus,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.955
and over here are the ovaries.

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:11.612
For sperm to get up here,
to impregnate this woman,

00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:12.951
it has to go through the cervix,

00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:15.258
but we have thick mucus here

00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:17.399
due to the Cystic Fibrosis,

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.445
so a lot of sperm doesn't get through.

00:02:20.445 --> 00:02:22.631
For females to produce
eggs and be fertile,

00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:24.241
nutrition is important,

00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:27.224
so the actual underlying
nutrition problem in CF

00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:29.988
can lead to female infertility as well.

00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:31.231
Here they're still producing eggs,

00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.569
they're able to get pregnant

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.977
but, technically, it is difficult.

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.090
Keep in mind that even though CF patients

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.727
can be infertile, meaning
it's hard to get pregnant,

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:41.738
or they can't get pregnant on their own,

00:02:41.738 --> 00:02:45.047
they're not sterile.

00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:47.613
Being sterile would mean
that they can't have children,

00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:50.562
even with infertility treatments,

00:02:50.562 --> 00:02:52.237
but, in this case, they can.

00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:54.795
We can artificially put the embryo

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:57.473
into this woman's uterus
and it can grow there,

00:02:57.473 --> 00:03:00.789
or for the men we can
artificially extract his sperm.

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.003
People with CF, they can reproduce,

00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:04.120
but, usually, not without

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.325
some kind of reproductive therapy.

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:08.458
If a woman with CF â€¦
Actually, it's difficult

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:09.606
to carry a baby sometimes

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.289
because, again, nutrition,

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:13.183
and a lot of those
other combinations of CF

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:14.795
come into play.

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:16.491
That's infertility and,
I don't know about you,

00:03:16.491 --> 00:03:18.396
but I wouldn't have expected this to be

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:20.848
part of this spectrum of
disease but, obviously,

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:23.260
it's a huge part of their life.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.104
Now, the next thing I want
to talk about, I guess,

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:28.126
belongs to the family of
GI or gut complications.

00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:30.428
It's called intussusception,

00:03:30.428 --> 00:03:33.438
and it's even harder to
spell than it is to say,

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:35.555
so I'm going to just spell this correctly.

00:03:35.555 --> 00:03:40.555
Intussusception, and this
is in people, without CF,

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:46.353
this still occurs, but mostly in babies,

00:03:46.353 --> 00:03:48.817
and people with Cystic
Fibrosis can have this

00:03:48.817 --> 00:03:50.845
into adulthood, or they can have it,

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:53.174
more commonly, as a child.

00:03:53.174 --> 00:03:54.815
It's a mechanical thing in the gut

00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:58.495
that, I think the best
way to describe it is,

00:03:58.495 --> 00:04:00.799
if you can imagine a telescope,

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.527
one of those telescope
that come in segments

00:04:02.527 --> 00:04:05.110
and you can open it, one
segment after another,

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.928
so this is a looking lens,

00:04:06.928 --> 00:04:11.928
then each segment gets a
little smaller, like that,

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.159
and this is with the telescope fully open,

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.887
so when you need to close the telescope

00:04:15.887 --> 00:04:17.430
and take it home, what do you do

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.474
is that you push the end here,

00:04:19.474 --> 00:04:23.621
this way, and it folds in on itself,

00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:24.636
and that's exactly how

00:04:24.636 --> 00:04:26.919
intussusception happens in the gut,

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.501
so you have, just going along in the gut,

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.740
say we're going from
the small intestine here

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.258
to the large intestine,

00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:36.690
and the gut here can suddenly

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.865
just collapse this way, folding
into the large intestine.

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:42.205
This cuts off the blood supply.

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:43.489
It's extremely painful.

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:45.358
Babies will cry and fuss.

00:04:45.358 --> 00:04:46.920
Sometimes it reverses itself,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.328
sometimes you're using air.

00:04:48.328 --> 00:04:51.240
You shoot air into here to
push it out, but, again,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.843
it's extremely rare to see
this in people after 12,

00:04:53.843 --> 00:04:56.273
but, in Cystic Fibrosis, it happens,

00:04:56.273 --> 00:04:57.327
so just something to watch out for

00:04:57.327 --> 00:04:59.243
if you're treating somebody with CF

00:04:59.243 --> 00:05:02.431
and they suddenly have abdominal pain,

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:05.061
this should be on the list
of things to think about.

00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:06.813
The third complication
I wanted to talk about

00:05:06.813 --> 00:05:09.462
has to do with bone density.

00:05:09.462 --> 00:05:10.452
Now, you might think,

00:05:10.452 --> 00:05:11.986
what does bone have to do with

00:05:11.986 --> 00:05:14.224
chloride channels and mucus?

00:05:14.224 --> 00:05:15.914
This is, kind of, a weird one,

00:05:15.914 --> 00:05:17.911
but most people who have Cystic Fibrosis

00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:21.155
have osteopenia, osteo--

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:23.067
so osteo means bone,

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:26.003
penia means not enough of, or lack of,

00:05:26.003 --> 00:05:28.738
so osteopenia means low bone density.

00:05:28.738 --> 00:05:31.523
Now, if this gets really bad,

00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:34.321
it reaches a criteria of
osteoporosis, and this,

00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.136
you've probably heard of
as an old people disease.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.904
As you get older, your
bone density erodes away

00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:41.514
and you get osteoporosis,

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:43.244
but young Cystic Fibrosis patients

00:05:43.244 --> 00:05:44.924
can have this as well

00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:46.890
because what's a very important thing

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.698
for bone to develop is Vitamin D.

00:05:49.698 --> 00:05:50.738
I think we all know this.

00:05:50.738 --> 00:05:52.651
If you take calcium for your bones,

00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:55.211
most of the time it comes with Vitamin D.

00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:58.505
Now, there are four
vitamins, out of all of them,

00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:01.644
that are fat soluble, so fat soluble means

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:04.627
that the vitamin has to
be absorbed into the body

00:06:04.627 --> 00:06:08.412
with fat instead of with
water, like the other vitamins,

00:06:08.412 --> 00:06:10.711
and there are four of them.

00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:15.711
It's Vitamins A, D, E, and K.

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:20.052
Notice how Vitamin D is one of them,

00:06:20.052 --> 00:06:23.541
so the impaired fat
absorption in people with CF

00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.717
makes it hard to get these four vitamins.

00:06:26.717 --> 00:06:30.508
To absorb fat in our bodies,
we need bile from the liver,

00:06:30.508 --> 00:06:32.228
so I'm drawing a liver right here,

00:06:32.228 --> 00:06:33.929
and, with the clogged chloride channels

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:36.205
and thick mucus, bile or, actually,

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:38.543
the bile ducts in the
liver gets clogged off.

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:40.594
People with CF actually lack bile

00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:43.535
and they don't produce the
right amount of bile salts,

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:46.296
so it's hard to absorb these vitamins.

00:06:46.296 --> 00:06:48.070
They can eat them, but it's hard to get

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.620
into the bloodstream this way,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.353
so the lack of Vitamin D
here leads to osteopenia.

00:06:54.353 --> 00:06:57.864
Since we can't change the
fact that this happens,

00:06:57.864 --> 00:06:59.854
there are other ways to try to maximize

00:06:59.854 --> 00:07:01.804
the amount of bones that we can have,

00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:04.477
and one important way is to exercise,

00:07:04.477 --> 00:07:06.710
especially weight-bearing exercises

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.268
like resistance training, and, of course,

00:07:09.268 --> 00:07:12.676
whatever supplements we can give them.

00:07:12.676 --> 00:07:14.660
So, these are three complications

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.597
that might not be intuitively
associated with CF,

00:07:17.597 --> 00:07:20.996
but I just want to show
you how Cystic Fibrosis

00:07:20.996 --> 00:07:23.351
is so wide-reaching as a disease.

00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:26.531
It really affects everywhere in the body.

00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:27.908
While it should always make you think

00:07:27.908 --> 00:07:32.660
of lung infections and
nutritional deficiencies,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.465
don't forget that there
are other complications

00:07:34.465 --> 00:07:36.109
associated with CF as well.
