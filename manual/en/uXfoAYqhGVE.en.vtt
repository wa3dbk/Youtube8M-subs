Although we can't feel it,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.240
our solar system is constantly being changed by a galactic wind.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.310
The wind is composed of gases like hydrogen, helium, oxygen and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.340
neon, which form a very wispy "atmosphere" between stars.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.410
This gas is called the interstellar medium. Like a bicycle 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.430
traveling in a crosswind, the wind that the solar system feels is actually a 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.470
combination of a solar system's movement relative to the galaxy and the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.480
movement of the interstellar medium itself. The solar wind 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.550
pushes out against this galactic wind, forming a bubble called the heliosphere.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.580
The outer boundary is called the heliopause, and is blown

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.660
into a teardrop-shape by the galactic wind. IBEX, or the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.750
Interstellar Boundary Explorer is designed to study this region from Earth

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.770
orbit and has now made the first direct measurements of hydrogen,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.770
oxygen and neon from outside the solar system.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.820
Many instruments have seen the characteristic spectra of elements outside the solar

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.870
system, but IBEX is actually detecting atoms from interstellar

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.910
space that punch through the heliopause and strike the spacecraft.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.940
Only some of the atoms that make up the galactic wind can do this.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.990
Much of the galactic wind is made up of

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.050
ions, which are atoms with charge due to missing electrons.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.070
the remaining atoms are neutral; they have the same number of electrons and protons.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.110
The ions are deflected by the magnetic field of the sun, 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.160
just like the magnetic field of the Earth deflects the solar wind, but the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.190
neutral atoms are unaffected and go straight through.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.220
The measurement of these atoms by IBEX has enabled scientists to get a better

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.260
grasp on the environment around our solar system.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.280
The speed of the galactic wind registered around 52,000 miles per hour, 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.320
which is about 12% slower than previously thought. At that speed, 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.370
it still takes about 30 years for each atom to reach 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.380
IBEX from the edge of the solar system. The IBEX measurements

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.410
of heavy interstellar atoms, oxygen and neon, show a 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.460
difference from the solar system and galaxy as a whole. This puzzle 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.480
may mean that the sun has moved out of the region where it formed, or that some

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.520
of the oxygen has been captured by dust in interstellar space.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.580
These direct, physical measurements of the universe right on the sun's

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.600
doorstep help us understand the history and future of our solar system

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.630
and the galaxy. What scientists learn can help protect

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.680
human spaceflight and teach us more about our home in the Milky Way.
