What you'll need for your bead encrusted hair
clip is a hair clip that you can get in a

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:14.530
craft store. I have some precut foam shapes.
And you can also get the foam sheets and cut

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.140
your own shapes. Or even initials to personalize
your hair clip. You'll want an assortment

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.269
of beads. I have the seed beads and bugle
beads in different colors. It's nice to use

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.869
different sizes and different textures to
give it a pretty look. You'll need some scissors,

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:40.550
a plate and some good thick clear drying craft
glue. Ok first you'll want to cut a strip

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:50.240
of this foamy sheet to fit over your barrette
piece. And just. It doesn't have to be precise.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.010
And then just trim that to the right size.
Ok, now we'll use this to arrange our foamy

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:06.549
pieces on. And just put them in some arrangement
that you like. And if you have overlapping

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.880
sections I'll show you what to do. Because
we don't. We want to mark any place that we

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.369
have overlapping. We're going to mark. So
here I have this blue heart over the orange

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:29.069
and pink. I'm going to take a pencil and just
lightly trace around to show anywhere where

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:37.090
its overlapping. Ok and then there's a little
overlapping here. And we'll just trace like

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.749
that. Ok, now we're ready to glue and bead
our hearts. This is a great project to do

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:49.880
with kids. Because it's easy, it's fun and
it looks great. Ok, so we'll start with our

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.539
pink, that's our biggest heart. And you just
put glue everywhere except for the area you

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.840
marked as an overlapped area. And you put
the glue on fairly thick, because you want

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:13.370
the beads to stick nicely. Plenty of glue.
And pretty evenly. And we'll get that last

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.590
spot that I was holding it with. And this
is the fun part. You just take your beads

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:30.420
and spill them all over the heart. And just
shake it around. Now with the bugle beads

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.310
you might want to press them down a little
flatter until it's coated nicely.
