00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.520
Craftsman Restoration Rollout.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.610
Welcome back to the Craftsman
Restoration Rollout.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.404
I'm Sandy Ganz, the Garage Professor.

00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:24.570
Today we're going to catch
up on some odds and ends,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.980
install the Summit
high-performance fuel pump,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.450
fuel tank, and then get to
mounting and balancing the tires.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.227
Let's get to it.

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:34.060
We're using the
high-performance Summit fuel

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.164
pump that is rated for
moderately modified engines.

00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:39.080
When we have determined
our mounting position,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.630
we're going to be using
the Nextec 12-volt cordless

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.200
drill to drill the pilot holes.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.370
We will now use the
Craftsman C3 cordless

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.430
drill to finish the mounting holes.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.800
When the holes are complete, make
sure to vacuum up all metal shavings.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.600
When choosing a mounting spot
for your electric fuel pump,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.210
make sure the location is clear of any
suspension travel or clearance issues.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.750
Now we're going to install the gas
tank and the fuel sending unit.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.890
Let's start with the installing
of the seal for the sending unit,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.680
then the sending unit, and next, secure
the lock ring to the sending unit.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.020
Now take the gas tank and
place it in the trunk.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.664
Now we're going to bolt it into the car.

00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:26.080
We're going to use the Craftsman
thin profile quarter inch

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.460
ratchet to secure the bolts.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.270
Our next step is to install the
filler hose onto the gas tank,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.830
then place the filler pipe
through the body of the car

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.239
and connect it to the filler hose.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.280
We're going to use a hex
key to secure the filler

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.032
pipe to the body of our project car.

00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:45.990
And the last step is to
tighten the hose clamps

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.020
on the filler tube using the Craftsman
3/16 4-inch slotted screwdriver.

00:01:54.032 --> 00:01:56.990
Let's get the tires mounted to the
rims and then get them all balanced.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.820
And then they'll be ready to install.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.770
The tires we're using on our project
car are the Toyo Proxes T1 Sport

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.630
tire, the perfect mix
of high speed stability

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.810
and quick braking on
wet or dry pavement.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.570
First, we're going to secure
the rim to the tire changer.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.790
Before we install the
Toyo Proxes T1 Sport tire,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.910
we inspect the bead of the
tire for dirt or damage.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.660
Then we'll lube up the bead
of the tire for mounting.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.270
Now we rotate the turntable
while using the helper

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.690
hold down bar and the mounting head to
expand the tire bead around the rim.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.956
Once the tire is on the rim, we
fill it with air to seat the bead.

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:40.710
With the tire filled with the
proper amount of air pressure,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.530
it's ready to be balanced.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.050
The tire balancer rotates
the tire and formulates

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.290
a weight offset to balance the tire.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.680
We then place weights on the rim
based upon the balancer's direction.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.720
And finally, we check the
balance one more time.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.160
