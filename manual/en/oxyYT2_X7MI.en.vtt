00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.000
Today we&amp;#39;re going to take a look at the
Highland Ramp Champ telescoping truck and

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.549
trailer loading ramps, in a quantity of 2,
part number 11200.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.990
Let&amp;#39;s go ahead and begin here by taking
a look at a few features that we need to go

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.589
over on our telescoping loading ramps.

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.029
It comes with this nonslip material that is
adhesive on the back.

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.690
See here, it&amp;#39;s kind of cut so you get
2 pieces per ramp, so you get 2 sheets of

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.690
these.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.920
There this actually goes is right here, and
this gives you a nonskid, it&amp;#39;s also a

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:50.320
nonmarking area for the tailgate of your truck
or the back edge of 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:02:17.139
your trailer, as we&amp;#39;ll be 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.569
using today.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:04:14.139
So you would attach a 
piece there, and the 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:05:50.069
other piece right here.
