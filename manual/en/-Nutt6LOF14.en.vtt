00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.415
"Why Might Vegetarians 
Have Less HPV?"

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:12.153
Cervical cancer is now considered a 
sexually transmitted disease,

00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:15.160
originally suspected as such 
as it was supposedly

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.527
found less in nuns and 
more in prostitutes,

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:21.620
but now we have DNA fingerprinting 
proof that virtually all cervical cancer

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.295
is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, 
human papilloma virus,

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:30.358
which also causes cancers of the penis, 
vagina, vulva, and throat.

00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:36.324
HPV is considered a necessary, 
but not sufficient cause of cancer.

00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:41.557
Most young women contract HPV,
 but most don't get cervical cancer,

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:45.724
because their immune systems 
are able to clear out the virus.

00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:50.790
70% of women clear the infection within 
1 year and more than 90% within 2 years

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.400
before the virus can 
cause cancer,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.720
unless you're immuno-
compromised or something.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.760
Well, if that's the case, may 
maybe those with particularly

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.080
strong immune systems 
might clear the virus even faster.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.340
That's what may be behind this new 
study that found that vegetarian women

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.938
appear to have significantly 
lower infection rates with HPV.

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:14.440
It's one of many studies reporting 
that vegetarians have lower risk

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.637
of HPV infection thought to be because

00:01:16.637 --> 00:01:19.040
of the presence of more fruits 
and vegetables in their diet,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.014
which are rich sources of
 all sorts of good phytonutrients.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:26.360
So for example, if you take a bunch 
of women with cancer-causing

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.070
strains of HPV infecting 
their cervix

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.340
and follow them out, 
and retest at 3 months,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.705
and then 9 months, while analyzing
 their diets, what do you find?

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:38.960
Higher levels of vegetable 
consumption may cut

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.170
the risk of HPV
 persistence in half,

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:47.338
double one's likelihood of clearing this 
potentially cancer-causing infection.

00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:52.840
And "higher" levels just meant 
like 2 or more servings a day!

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.070
What do antioxidants in plants 
have to do with viral diseases?

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:03.530
Different antioxidants affect 
different viruses in different ways,

00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:10.400
but against HPV…don't you know that electrophoretic 
mobility super shift assays showed

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.880
"irrespective of enhanced c-fos 
expression, c-jun was phosphorylated

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.160
and became primarily 
heterodimerized with fra-1",

00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:20.130
"which was also induced 
after PDTC incubation"...I mean duh!

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.170
I had to read this 
paper like 5 times!

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.340
Long story short: antioxidants 
appear to suppress the activation

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.870
of critical segments
 of the virus' DNA.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.680
Maybe that's why smearing green tea 
on genital warts – also caused by HPV –

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.070
has been found so effective 
in clearing them.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.530
In terms of preventing cervical cancer:
through their role as antioxidants,

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:45.960
pytonutrients like lutein, found 
in dark green leafy vegetables;

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.300
and lycopene, the red pigment in
 tomatoes, may decrease viral load,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.070
thereby decreasing persistence 
and progression to disease.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.540
Whereas the protective associations
 may be due to their antioxidant properties.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.500
They have all sorts of other wonderful 
effects, so who knows... who cares!

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.480
Bottom line: "higher 
consumption of vegetables

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.100
may decrease risk 
of HPV persistence,"

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.180
which may help explain 
why this 2013 study

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.060
found vegan women 
have significantly lower rates

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:21.900
of all female cancers combined,
 including cancer of the cervix.
