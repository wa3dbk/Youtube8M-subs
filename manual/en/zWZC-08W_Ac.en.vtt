00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.440
This video shows how to use the media loading
accessory on the HP Latex 260 printer, formerly

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.900
the Designjet L26500.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.690
HP recommends using the media loading accessory
with soft or flimsy substrates, such as banners,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.960
textiles, and meshes.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.900
Lift the loading table to ease the spindle
into the printer.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.250
Enter the Substrate menu from the front panel.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.129
Select "Substrate load" from the menu
and then press OK.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.120
Next, select the "Load with accessory"
option, and press OK.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.800
Lift the blue substrate-adjustment lever as
far up as it will go.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.800
The printer will ask "Do you want to use
edge holders?"

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
Make sure Yes is checked and then press OK
to continue.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.900
The front panel will display a short animation
illustrating how to attach the media loading

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.200
accessory.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.000
First, lay the media loading accessory on
the loading table.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.540
Next, open the flaps.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.300
Now, pull some of the substrate from the roll
and place the leading edge on the media loading

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.000
accessory.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Close the flaps over the leading edge of the
substrate to secure it to the media loading

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.690
accessory.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.080
Lift the media loading accessory and manually
load the substrate into printer.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.319
Lower the blue substrate-adjustment lever
as far down as it will go.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.560
Select the substrate type and roll length
settings on the front panel.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.069
The printer automatically moves the media
loading accessory out of the curing module.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.500
Remove the media loading accessory and replace
it in the storage area.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.200
Lift the blue substrate-adjustment lever.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.470
Check the substrate to ensure correct tension.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.470
Lower the blue substrate-adjustment lever.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.120
If using the edge holders, open the window
to place them.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.800
Do not touch the printer's drying enclosure
after you have opened the window because the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.000
internal surfaces could be hot.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.500
Place the edge holder on the platen so that
the three alignment pins sit in the receiving

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.910
holes and the edge holder overlaps the substrate
slightly.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.120
Slide the edge holder until the white lines
are aligned with the edge of the substrate.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.200
Repeat the placement and adjustment process
on the opposite side of the platen to complete

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.200
the installation of the edge holders.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.280
After installing the edge holders, close the
window and latch it securely.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.500
On the front panel, press OK to continue.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.000
Note, After printing on a porous substrate,
you should clean the platen immediately. Refer

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.700
to the maintenance guide for details.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.500
Press OK to continue.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.800
The printer will check the substrate in various
ways and might ask you to correct problems

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.900
with skew or tension.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.400
To assure print quality, keep flexible substrate
tensed using a take-up reel.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.700
Press OK to select "Load take-up reel now"

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.000
A short animation shows an overview of how
to use the take-up reel. Refer to the User

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.710
Guide for details on how to set up the take-up
reel.
