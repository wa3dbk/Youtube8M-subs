00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:15.569
Orica was one of the first companies to
manufacture sodium cyanide and today,

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:20.039
we're a global leader in the production
and distribution of cyanide

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.550
We produce two different types.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.829
Solid cyanide and liquid cyanide.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.399
Solid cyanide comes in the form of a
white crystalline briquette or "cyanoid".

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.389
They're highly soluble and delivered in Orica's Sparge delivery system

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:37.550
or in FIBCs

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.400
liquid cyanide is offered to sites near
our purpose-built manufacturing facility

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.130
in Yarwun, Queensland, Australia.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.320
Our unique delivery systems reduce the
risk associated with

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.560
transportation safety and security

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.620
and the environment.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.090
With our regional knowledge and industry
understanding, our delivery systems can

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.140
be customized to meet your requirements.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.750
We offer bulk sparging for
large-scale operations,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.120
MiniSparge for small operations and
liquid sparging for certain locations.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.440
Our manufacturing base and integrated
supply chain allows for contingency

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.610
planning - providing customers with
continuity of supply.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.190
In addition to our base in Yarwun, Queensland, we also have Sparge transfer

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.210
stations in South America and Africa

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.350
We understand that optimizing your
chemical use is important to your

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.980
operation.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.850
Orica has the in-house technical
expertise to help you increase recovery

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.420
and reduce total costs:

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.480
from metallurgists, who can optimize
cyanide consumption

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.320
to in-house engineering, design, blending and testing support.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.920
Through our tailored PRO service programs,
we offer customized reviews, safe use and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.560
handling, dosing optimization

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.950
and analyser servicing.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.220
At Orica, where committed to the safe,
efficient and secure use of cyanide in

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.909
your operations.

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:11.880
So, talk to us

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.310
and we'll help keep you operating
safely,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.559
efficiently and securely.

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:18.649
That's the Power of Partnership.
