00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.209
How to Plant a Tree.

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.130
Trees ask for little, mostly because they
cannot talk.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.900
So just assume that they like company and
plant them a new friend.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.680
You will need A site for your tree A trowel
A soil sample A list of tree species native

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.590
to your area A local nursery that sells native
trees A large shovel Fertilizer Mulch And

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.500
a hose or other water supply Supports and
protection for the tree and compost.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.150
Step 1.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.660
Choose a spot to plant your new sapling.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.790
Step 2.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.520
Dig a small sample of the soil and take a
look.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.100
If it is heavy with clay or very sandy, plan
to add one part compost to every three parts

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.710
soil that you shovel out.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.770
Step 3.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.800
Check for wires and pipes above and below
your site.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.230
If there are wires above, you may still be
able to plant a low-growing tree.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.230
Step 4.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.390
Visit a local nursery and pick out a sapling,
ideally one five to six feet tall.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.289
Match the tree's preferred soil type and sun
exposure to the site you have chosen.

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.579
Trees that are native to your area are more
likely to do well in your ecosystem and provide

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.179
food and habitat to wildlife.

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.679
Step 5.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.030
Dig a hole no higher than the root ball but
at least twice as wide.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.010
Leave rough surfaces in the hole so roots
can penetrate as they grow.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.469
Roughen the sides and bottom of the hole with
a stick or shovel.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.030
Step 6.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.990
Quickly remove the root ball from its container
and gently straighten the roots as needed.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.520
If the roots are wrapped in burlap, let it
fall to the bottom of the hole.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.920
Step 7.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.280
Place the tree in the hole, then stand back
to see if it is straight.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.720
Adjust as needed.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.720
Step 8.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.659
Replace soil around the roots.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.530
The flare, where the roots spread at the tree's
base, should be just above the soil line.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.530
Step 9.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.219
Pack the soil around the tree firmly but gently
with hands and feet to fill in any air pockets,

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.259
but not so hard that water can't get in.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.259
Step 10.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.670
Spread mulch two inches deep in a ring about
two feet in diameter around the tree, but

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.110
not within a few inches of the trunk.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.330
Mulch can be wood chips, pine needles, grass
clippings, or fallen leaves.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.040
The ideal time to plant a deciduous tree is
while it is dormant: in fall after leaves

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.280
drop, or in early spring before leaves come
out.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.350
Step 11.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.980
Water your tree when it doesn't rain.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.320
A young tree will need to be watered about
every week for the first year.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320
Step 12.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.490
Protect your tree from strong winds by tying
two stakes to the trunk.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.750
If you have deer in the area, wrap the trunk
loosely with wire mesh hardware cloth, especially

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.000
in winter.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.150
Did you know In the summer, an acre of Iowa
forest can cool the surrounding area by as

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.110
much as 15 degrees.
