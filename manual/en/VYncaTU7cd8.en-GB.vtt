00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.050
The ITL Bluetooth speaker is the most convenient
product I've ever owned. While opening the

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.820
package contents after ordering, it has a
sleek look as it's covered in white and chrome

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.510
design that has a modern touch. My favorite
part of this product is how diverse it is.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.320
You can either hook up Bluetooth to keep it
wireless or directly connect this to your

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.810
source of audio.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.220
In the package I had bought, included in the
box was:

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.189
• The Bluetooth speaker
• A micro USB cable (for recharging the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.769
speaker)
• 3.5 mm male-to-male input cable for hardwiring

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.769
• Owner's manual

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:31.769
The portable Bluetooth speakers surprisingly
pumps out a lot of sound for its size. This

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.769
is awesome at night when I like to listen
to music as I sleep because of the light show

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:33.769
it puts on. Depending on what you listen to,
the lightshow may be crazier. Something with

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:34.769
more bass that's heavy will make the lightshow
go crazier and something that's a bit softer

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:35.769
will gift you a light and calming lightshow.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.210
This product is also very easy to work with
my iPhone 4s. I simply just hooked it up and

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.280
used the factory set password "0000" to connect
it. If you use a radio service on your phone

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.560
such as Pandora or Spotify, controlling the
songs volume, playing type, shuffle, etc.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:01:07.310
is just as easy to do from your smartphone
and works flawlessly.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.320
The Bluetooth also works at the max, 30 feet
away depending on how many walls you're trying

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.329
to work the audio source through. The Bluetooth
option allows you to wirelessly use these

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.840
items without ever connecting the two, which
is super simple.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.060
I would definitely recommend the portable
Bluetooth speaker to all of my friends who

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.249
enjoy being able to have freedom and like
a clean, simple product. Instead of having

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:33.369
an array of cords everywhere for different
products and purposes, this Bluetooth speaker

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.570
allows cord-free interaction and a clean workspace
with great audio. I have tried many kinds

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.189
of speakers before that eventually broke or
were not up to my standards audio wise, but

00:01:43.189 --> 00:02:09.939
this has changed my mind completely with nothing
but good feedback.
