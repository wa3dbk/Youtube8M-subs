Hello!

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.380
So... It's around 11 o'clock now, on January 31st.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.500
And it's my very last chance to make my very first "Wardrobe Post".

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.800
*Annoyed by bad English pronounciation, tries to create Swedish translation*

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.260
Um... yes!

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.720
I've photographed all day, no I've been filming all day,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
and when I was done filming everything i discovered,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.740
that I had set the sharpness on manual and made it blurry and the exposure on auto.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.740
So the video quality is a bit... uh. A bit so so.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.340
But, well, let's go!
