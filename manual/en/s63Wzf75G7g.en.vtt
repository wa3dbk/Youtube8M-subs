00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:33.460
Do you guys remember the game Battalion Wars
on the GameCube?

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.590
It was initially going to be the console version
of the game Advance Wars, developed by Nintendo’s

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.640
Intelligent Systems, but got the name change
as it turned into a game that mixed third-person

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.460
shooting with strategy and controlling different
squad members.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.480
Well, the game I have today is a lot like
that, except it’s a lot darker, it’s set

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.980
in World War 2, and it has a guy who reminds
me of Duke Nukem.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:03.079
It’s The Outfit for the Xbox 360.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.580
The Outfit follows a group of a few different
soldiers in the American army who learn of

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.280
a general in the Wehrmacht who is terrorizing
villages, even killing women and children.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.440
The game uses a sort of old school “capture
this area and use it as a respawn point”

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.330
system, and although this hasn’t been used
recently, it actually works really well.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.540
The game gives you a number of different options
for reinforcing, adding more vehicles, calling

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.280
in airstrikes, and several other things to
help you along the way.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.820
You’ll also be controlling your own soldier
at the same time, and this part of the game

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:50.980
is all third-person shooting with rifles,
grease guns, bazookas, and even flamethrowers.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.740
Control in The Outfit is really its weakest
point.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.370
While aiming works fairly well, movement in
both on foot and in vehicles feels very sluggish

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.370
and imprecise.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.490
It is definitely not a game breaker, as you
will get used to it, but it will bug you when

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.690
you have trouble turning around in tanks.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.729
The problem seems to stem from the fact that
you are both the gunner and the driver in

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.680
these sections, so while the right stick is
for aiming guns, all you have for the vehicle

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.870
is the left stick.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.830
This means you turn and accelerate with the
same analog stick, and this is much more frustrating

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.249
than it sounds.

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.280
Hit detection is also pretty bad.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:35.280
Shooting at an enemy 30 times before he actually
takes a hit is a pain.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.019
But The Outfit really isn’t about the third-person
shooting by itself; it’s about the combination

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.170
of this and using strategy and your squadmates
to complete each objective, and the game does

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.329
this very well.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.200
The experience is pretty seamless.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.989
You’ll have the ability to actually capture
specific types of buildings to gain access

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.180
to airstrikes or other special abilities,
and you can then use these later to help yourself

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.030
out of a tough area.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.470
Your squad can also be used to man different
weapons and attack the enemies you order them

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.859
to, and you can use points to call in reinforcements
if something goes wrong.

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.819
The Outfit really does a good job of using
old shooter concepts and not making them feel

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.060
dated.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.370
What does feel dated, though, are the visuals.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.569
It’s expected, as this game is more than
5 years old, and the game uses a slightly

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.469
cartoony style, but textures, characters,
and environments all look pretty bad, even

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.489
for an early 360 game.

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.500
Voice acting is actually pretty good, as is
the music.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.450
It fits the dark, yet approachable tone of
the game nicely.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.760
Actually, I don’t really think this got
an M rating for violence.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.299
It’s nothing worse than what you’d see
in most teen rated games, but the subject

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:51.690
matter is a little bit more mature.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.939
While I wouldn’t call The Outfit a tremendous
game, it’s interesting in how it manages

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.209
to make some dated concepts still feel fresh.

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.819
If you can find this cheap, I’d definitely
recommend it.
