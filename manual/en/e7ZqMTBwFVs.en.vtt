00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.420
Our planet is surrounded by a wispy-thin layer
of gas that keeps us warm and allows weather

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.210
to happen and basically makes all of life
on Earth possible.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.690
Except... that precious atmosphere of ours
is actually leaking, every second, into outer

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.690
space.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.710
Luckily, it's a really slow leak, since for
any object--be it a molecule of gas, a rocket,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.289
or a cat -- to break the tether of Earth's
gravity and escape, it has to hightail it

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.789
out of here at 34 times the speed of sound.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.109
It takes the energy of a metric tonne of TNT
to boost a person to that speed, and less

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.420
energy for lighter objects: 1/10th of that
for a cat, for example.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.701
Barring a large asteroid impact that can eject
large swaths of atmosphere into space, the

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:40.370
only gases that regularly escape Earth's atmosphere
today are Hydrogen and Helium - the lightest

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.110
elements in the universe.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.430
There are a few ways hydrogen and helium molecules
can wind up on a one-way mission to space.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.440
Some, near the top of the atmosphere simply
get enough energy from the sun's heat to escape.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.460
Others are high-energy charged particles that
would usually be stopped from escaping by

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.560
the Earth's magnetic field.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.370
Occasionally, though, these speedy electron-lacking
particles crash into a neutral molecule with

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.460
enough force to knock loose--and steal--one
of its electrons.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.110
Now neutral itself, the speeding particle
is free of the earth's magnetic field, and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.080
if the collision happens to set it on a course
for the stars, that's where it goes.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.650
Finally, some of Earth's magnetic field lines
are weakened and pushed away from the earth

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.030
by the solar wind, a violent stream of plasma
emanating from our sun.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.900
Charged particles guided by these magnetic
fields can simply fly off the weak ends like

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.730
sparks off a live wire.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.520
But if our planet didn't have a magnetic field
at all, things could be a lot worse.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.240
Mars, for example, has no protective magnetic
field, and so what little atmosphere it has

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.130
is constantly buffeted and ripped away by
the solar wind.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.780
Even with its protective bubble, Earth is
losing enough hydrogen to fill a meter-wide

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.220
balloon every second.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.720
No need to worry - it'll take a few billion
years before we lose all of our hydrogen this

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.640
way, but maybe sometime in the distant future,
someone will look at Earth and ask, just as

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.119
we do of Mars now: Was there ever life on
this chunk of rock?
