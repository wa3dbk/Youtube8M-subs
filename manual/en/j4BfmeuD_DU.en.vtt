00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:02.692
The President: You haven't
seen me enough today.

00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:08.224
One of Jay's favorite
lines is, "I have

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:12.091
no personnel announcements
at this time."

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:13.625
But I do.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:15.525
And it's bittersweet.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:20.558
It involves one of my closest
friends here in Washington.

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:24.725
In April, Jay came to me in the
Oval Office and said he was

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.958
thinking about moving on
and I was not thrilled,

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.925
to say the least.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.191
But Jay has had to wrestle
with this decision

00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:33.391
for quite some time.

00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:38.391
He has been on my team since
day one -- for two years with

00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:41.091
the Vice President, and for the
past three and a half years

00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:43.258
as my Press Secretary.

00:00:43.258 --> 00:00:48.224
And it has obviously placed a
strain on Claire, his wife,

00:00:48.224 --> 00:00:51.892
and his two wonderful
kids, Hugo and Della.

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:55.658
Della's little league
team, by the way,

00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:58.638
I had a chance to see the other
day, and she's a fine pitcher.

00:00:59.224 --> 00:01:02.925
But he wasn't seeing
enough of the games.

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:05.458
Jay was a reporter for 21
years before coming 

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:10.191
to the White House, including a
stint as Moscow Bureau Chief

00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:14.858
for Time Magazine during the
collapse of the Soviet Empire.

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:21.124
So he comes to this place
with a reporter's perspective.

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:23.425
That's why, believe it or not,
I actually think he will miss

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:26.091
hanging out with all of
you, including the guys

00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:27.658
in the front row.

00:01:27.658 --> 00:01:29.358
(laughter)

00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:30.191
Audience Member: Third row.

00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:31.325
Third row.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:33.425
(laughter)

00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:40.692
The President: But Jay has
become one of my closest

00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:46.558
friends, and is a great Press
Secretary and a great advisor.

00:01:46.558 --> 00:01:47.591
He's got good judgment.

00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:49.391
He has a good temperament.

00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:52.325
And he's got a good heart.

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:56.024
And I'm going to miss him a lot.

00:01:56.024 --> 00:02:00.024
I will continue to rely on him
as a friend and advisor after

00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:02.892
he leaves to spend as much
of the summer as he can with

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:05.825
his kids before he decides
what's next for him.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:10.991
Whatever it is, I know he's
going to be outstanding at it.

00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:13.191
Of course, that meant I
had to make a decision,

00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:16.258
which is who succeeds Jay.

00:02:16.258 --> 00:02:19.858
And we've got enormous
talent around here,

00:02:19.858 --> 00:02:23.825
but I've decided that we're
going to put in this slot

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:27.258
somebody who is also
a friend and advisor.

00:02:27.258 --> 00:02:31.692
So today, the flak jacket is
officially passed to a new

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:34.825
generation -- Mr. Josh Earnest.

00:02:34.825 --> 00:02:37.558
(applause)

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:44.358
Josh is a coach's son
from Kansas City.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:49.825
He still roots for
the Royals, I guess.

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:52.158
(laughter)

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:58.658
As you know, his name
describes his demeanor --

00:02:58.658 --> 00:03:06.591
Josh is an earnest guy, and you can't
find just a nicer individual

00:03:06.591 --> 00:03:09.391
even outside of Washington.

00:03:09.391 --> 00:03:12.658
The country, of course, knows
him for his golden voice 

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:18.325
 and dulcet tones on West Wing Week,
the biggest viral Internet hit

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:20.425
since "Between Two Ferns."

00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:21.291
(laughter)

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:25.091
But Josh and I have an
incredible history going

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:27.391
all the way back to
the Iowa caucuses.

00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:31.291
Josh was my Iowa
communications director.

00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:33.792
And even when he
was in that role,

00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:36.525
you'd find him spending an
extra hour or two helping

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:39.591
young staffers make phone
calls or knock on doors.

00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:42.458
There was no task
that was too small,

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:48.224
no detail too unimportant
for Josh to attend to.

00:03:48.224 --> 00:03:50.658
At the White House, he's been
a mentor to many of the young

00:03:50.658 --> 00:03:54.591
people here who I know are
thrilled for him today.

00:03:56.024 --> 00:04:02.124
He is of sound judgment
and great temperament.

00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:04.925
He is honest and
full of integrity.

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:08.024
And I'm sure you will at
some point get frustrated

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:09.258
with him as well -- 

00:04:09.258 --> 00:04:10.224
(laughter)

00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:11.391
-- but it's going to be hard,

00:04:11.391 --> 00:04:15.525
because he's a straight
shooter and a great guy.

00:04:15.525 --> 00:04:22.224
So my request is that, be nice
to Jay on his farewell tour,

00:04:22.224 --> 00:04:25.258
and be nice to Josh
during his initiation,

00:04:25.258 --> 00:04:30.058
which I'm sure will last maybe
two days -- or perhaps

00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:30.858
two questions.

00:04:30.858 --> 00:04:31.825
(laughter)

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:34.525
So we're going to let him
hang around a little bit

00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:36.024
to milk it for all it's worth.

00:04:36.024 --> 00:04:36.925
(laughter)

00:04:36.925 --> 00:04:37.491
 All right?

00:04:37.491 --> 00:04:38.358
Thank you, guys.
