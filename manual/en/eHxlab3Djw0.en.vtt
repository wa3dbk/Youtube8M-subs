MARY:
In the 1950s,
Andy Warhol created

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.367
silkscreen portraits
of celebrities

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:10.067
using mass-produced images

00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:12.100
and non-traditional
blocks of colour,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.133
which became Pop Art icons.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.533
I'm going to show you a fun
and easy technique

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.967
to transfer and duplicate
images onto clay tiles.

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:22.433
Then, by adding interesting
colour combinations,

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.067
students can create
their own

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:26.100
Pop Art self portraits.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.733
Hi, I'm Mary Skydema

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:31.333
and I'd like to introduce you
to Pop Art Clay Portraits.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.167
First, have students find
a photograph of themselves

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.933
and make a black
and white copy of it.

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.433
A close up works best,

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:41.533
and it should be
as simple as possible.

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.133
You'll want your work tables
to be covered in canvas

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.367
to keep the clay
from sticking.

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:49.300
A white clay body works best
for vibrant colour

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.633
and you can cut the slabs
right from the block.

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:56.533
I've rolled a slab of clay
about a quarter inch thick.

00:00:56.533 --> 00:01:00.833
A thickness strip on
each side of the slab

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:02.533
helps to keep the slab even,

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:06.033
and you want to roll both ways
across the slab

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.333
to align the clay particles

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:11.067
and reduce your chances
of warping later.

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:13.900
The slab is just slightly
larger than

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.767
the image I'm going to use.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.633
So have your students
decide which features

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:22.533
of the photograph

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.900
will need to be transferred
to make the most effective,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.300
simplified line drawing.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.433
I'm going to use a gel pen to
go over the lines of the photo

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.100
that I'm going to
transfer to the clay.

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:19.233
I like to mark
the four corners

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:22.133
for ease of cutting later.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:25.367
I just like to put small
little marks in the corners

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:26.667
with my gel pen

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:28.933
that I'm going to
use as a guide.

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:36.100
So we're going to place
the image face down

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.300
onto the clay and rub it
with your fingers.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.400
We're just going to let it
sit for a few seconds.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.367
We're going to peel up
the paper

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:51.667
to check the transfer.

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:55.367
If it's not quite dark enough,
wait a few more seconds

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:56.667
and remove the paper.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:00.567
If your clay is
slightly drier,

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:04.933
a little mist on the back of
the paper will do the trick.

00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:17.100
Your portrait has transferred,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.700
and as you can see
it's now a mirror image.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.500
At this point I'm going to use
a ruler to cut the slab

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.567
into a tile.

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm using these little marks

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.833
I left as a guide
on the corners.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:40.767
Okay, and you can just smooth
the edges of the tile slightly

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:44.467
with a little water
on your fingertips,

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:47.100
and then we're
going to start carving.

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:54.600
Now we're going to use
a small ribbon tool

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.567
to carve into our image.

00:03:56.567 --> 00:04:02.333
This soft slab can
very easily be carved.

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:05.233
Some might prefer to let
the clay stiffen slightly,

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:08.767
and you'll figure out
which you prefer.

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:20.467
In addition to using
these ribbon tools to carve,

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:24.967
you can also just use
a single layer of a baggie,

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:27.000
place it over the tile,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.733
and use a pen
to just go over your lines.

00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:36.800
This is going to result in
a nice smooth edge

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.533
without burrs.

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:40.900
You can see
how that turns out.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.967
Try not to move the tile
other than to flip it over

00:04:44.967 --> 00:04:47.433
once or twice
for even drying.

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:50.000
When the tile
is completely dry,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.700
or fired,
it's time to apply colour.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.533
I like to fill all my
carved lines in

00:04:57.533 --> 00:04:59.800
with black paint to
mimic the black outline

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.067
many of the Pop artists used.

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:04.533
If your tile is fired,

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:07.533
you can paint black
acrylic paint into the lines.

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:14.967
I'm just moistening it
a little bit with clear water.

00:05:14.967 --> 00:05:18.233
I'm just going to take some
plain old black acrylic

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:22.700
and brush it over about
a 1/4 of the tile a time.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.667
Got to move a little bit quickly
so that you don't have

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:26.800
a whole lot remove,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.833
then you just go back
with your sponge,

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:33.133
and wipe off
the surface of the tile.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:40.967
It's going to leave the black
acrylic in the carved areas.

00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:43.533
If your tile is made
of air dry clay,

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:47.467
the black paint must be
painted into the carved areas.

00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:50.933
Now with a small brush
we can apply colour.

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.967
For this project
Blick Studio Acrylics

00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:53.933
gives good coverage

00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:57.700
on either the fire tile
or the air dry one.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.367
Pastels are another option,
but should be sprayed

00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:02.533
with a fixative as a last step.

00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:05.967
Oil colours also work well,
and give a very deep

00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:08.300
colour saturated
finished product,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.633
and ceramic underglazes

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:12.967
look great as is or with
a clear glaze on top.

00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:15.167
