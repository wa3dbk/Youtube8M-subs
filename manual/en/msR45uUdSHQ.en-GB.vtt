Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Elmo
Cupcake Tutorial where I'll be showing you

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.559
how to make this lovely Elmo cupcake. After
our Cookie Monster Cupcake Tutorial, we've

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.769
had so many requests for Elmo and the gang
so we thought we'd follow him up with the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.199
lovely Elmo cupcake.
Tools and equipment that we will be using

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.220
today:
I have some of our perfectly pipeable buttercream

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.609
frosting which I've tinted red. If you don't
have a great recipe or method for buttercream

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.970
frosting, do check out our channel. It's a
lovely sure fire way to get a great cupcake

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.830
swirl.
I have some red sanding sugar. So red sanding

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.570
sugar looks a little bit glittery. You can
see it there. But essentially, it's just like

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.250
a sparkly red sand. If you don't have access
to red sanding sugar, you can tint some coconut

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.860
red by sticking it into a snap lock bag with
a little bit of red food coloring and just

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.330
shaking it around until you've got the right
color.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.940
I've got some licorice straps. Now licorice
straps -- we buy them here in Australia -- it's

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.000
essentially 2 meters of licorice. If you don't
have access to licorice straps, you can use

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.600
black fondant. Otherwise you can get some
nice soft (Inaudible 01:12) and actually roll

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.400
it out. If it's soft enough, it will roll.
I've got a couple of chocolate chips just

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.650
small chocolate chips that you put into cookies
or muffins.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.180
I've got a few white chocolate candy melts
or white chocolate melts. There's probably

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.031
about 4 or 5 in there. You don't need very
many. And I've got 2 of those over here. That's

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:40.030
just going to be used to make Elmo's eyes.
I've got a butter knife and I've got a serrated

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.010
edge knife, so nothing too fancy on the serrated
edge knife, just something with a few little

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.659
teeth to give us a nice sharp cut.
I've got a skewer but you can also use a cocktail

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.659
stick or the back of a paintbrush. We're just
going to do a little bit of detail work on

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.850
the eyes.
I've got a circle cookie cutter just a straight

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.549
circle. Now I've chosen the size of that by
basically just putting it over the top of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.390
my cupcake and getting something that's roughly
the same size as my cupcake. You don't want

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.090
to go too much bigger or too much smaller
because that's going to be used to make his

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.140
mouth. And we really want his mouth to go
from side to side.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.560
I've got a little bit of fondant which I've
pre-colored with just some orange food coloring.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.840
If you don't have fondant, you could also
use orange toffee or something of the like.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.810
I've got a disposable piping bag which I'm
going to be using in conjunction with the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.430
Loyal number 20 piping nozzle which basically
just has a nice, big, wide, open tip on it.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.920
Let's get started.
Firstly, I'm going to fill my piping bag with

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:53.180
some of that lovely red buttercream. I'm just
going to push that frosting all the way down

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.410
to the end, making sure that there's no air
bubbles and I'm going to squeeze it until

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:07.260
it comes out the tip.
Now to create Elmo's lovely dome head, I'm

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.150
just going to squeeze and just come up a little
bit, really I'm just squeezing. So what we're

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.860
ending up with is a nice peaked mountain.
This is where the back of our knife comes

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.989
in.
If you don't have a piping bag, you can just

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.069
spoon it on. But I always find the piping
bag just gives you a little bit more control

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.670
and a little bit of a neater finish. You can
see here, I'm just working the icing down

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.930
into the outside of the patty pan. Try not
to get too much of it around those outside

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.660
edges. We want to keep it as neat as possible.
And now I'm just fashioning it into that lovely

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:50.050
dome shape. You might take a little bit off.
And don't worry if it's not perfectly smooth.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.720
To give him his lovely furry type look, you
can either use the coconut as I suggested.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.209
However I find a lot of people don't like
coconut. That's why I go with the sanding

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.430
sugar. So I'm just going to dip it in the
sanding sugar. Turn it around a few times

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.350
just to get a nice good coating. Come out
looking like this. Take the palm of your hand

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.660
and just pat it down, evening out any of those
little ridges that have come from the frosting

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:23.740
underneath. So here you have a lovely, shiny,
sparkly dome surface.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.240
Now we're going to make Elmo's eyes just to
give it a couple of minutes to set. To make

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.060
his eyes I've got 2 of those white chocolate
melts or white candy wafers. And I'm going

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.120
to take the back of my skewer or your cocktail
stick or the back of your paintbrush, and

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:46.240
I'm just going to put just a tiny little blob
of white chocolate onto those eyes. I've put

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.400
them right at the edge of the eye, not in
the center. Now I'm going to take these chocolate

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:59.300
chips working nice and quickly and stick them
on. Now that will just take a couple of minutes

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.770
to dry and you'll have 2 lovely eyes. You
can pre-make those eyes. I do find them quite

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.400
time consuming. But if you know you're going
to be making a dozen or two, you can pre-made

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.910
the eyes well in advance. They will last quite
a while.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.721
For Elmo's mouth, as I mentioned I've got
the licorice strap. If you don't have the

00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:20.280
licorice strap, you'll take your fondant or
whatever else you're using for his black mouth.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.830
And I'm just going to take my cookie cutter
and just cut a half circle. If you're using

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:34.100
a licorice strap, you do need to push down
quite firmly. Here we have Elmo's mouth.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.780
It's time to take the serrated edge knife.
I always use a serrated edge because I find

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.320
that it cuts through the cake a bit easier.
And I'm just going to cut. You can see I'm

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.320
about a centimeter away from the patty pan
there. I don't want to cut too close to the

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.340
patty pan and I don't want to cut too far
in. So you can see how far in my knife's gone

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.830
there. If you cut too far in, you do risk
taking his head off and we do not want to

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.080
do that. So now I'm just going to... I'm squeezing
the sides of that. You can see when I don't

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.970
squeeze and when I do squeeze. His mouth just
opens up a little bit. So I'm going to slide

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.389
in his little mouth and live it poking out
just a little bit there.

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.930
Now next up is the nose so this is where the
fondant comes in. if you're going to be making

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.360
several of these, I would make all of the
noses in advance because you want the noses

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:35.430
to be roughly the same size. So take a ball
of fondant. I guess it's a little bit bigger

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.930
than a peanut M&amp;M perhaps. And I'm just going
to roll it into a teardrop. You can see I'm

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.139
just rolling it in the palm of my hand, and
then I'm just going to just taper off into

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:50.190
a nice teardrop shape. That's going to go
on as his nose. Don't wait too long to stick

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.500
that on because you do want to be able to
push it into the frosting while it's quite

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.131
[damp].
And then finally, we've got the eyes. Now

00:06:57.131 --> 00:07:02.380
Cookie Monster if you'll recall had the crazy
for cookie eyes. But Elmo's a little bit more

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.139
subdued. So we're just going to give him nice
overlapping, side facing eyes, looking at

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:13.750
the other Elmo.
So there you have your 2 Elmo cupcakes ready

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.020
to go for your little one's party or for the
avid Sesame Street lover in your family. We
