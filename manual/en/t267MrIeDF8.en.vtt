hello everyone and welcome to a new video

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.840
in today's video i'm gonna show you how to make             a paper gun that can shoot so let's start

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.720
first of all you need to make 7 paper rolls like those

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.600
all you have to do is just putting a pencil                        on  a sheet of paper and rolling it like that

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.720
after you finish fix the roll with some tape

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.880
then use a small stick to push the pencil out

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.840
next take 4 paper rolls and put them together like that then fix them together with some tape

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.380
make sure that you leave the area at the  end  untaped

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.620
because that's where you're gonna put the trigger and the grip so you need to leave this area un taped

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.760
after that use a cutter to make an angled cut at the end of it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.560
next take another two rolls and cut them equally in half like this

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.680
take three of them and keep this one for now

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.080
using a plier press so hard on the tip of each roll to flatten them out

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.060
then bring the 4 taped rolls and put some glue at the untaped area that we talked about before

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.080
after you finish insert the 3 rolls                                             next to each others with an angle

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.320
and to complete making the grip get a sheet of paper and fold it in half both ways like this

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.100
 then keep folding it until it becomes like this

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.460
after you finish put the paper on the three rolls                          and fold the top of it until it fits in

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.420
and don't forget to cut the remaining bits

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.580
make another one and glue each                                 one on both sides of the grip

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.640
take the piece pf roll that we kept before                        and progressively press on it like that

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.800
then put it with the grip like that and fix them together with some white electrical tape

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.380
you  can use hot glue but i prefere white electrical tape because it gives it a much better look

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.580
for the shooting part you need to make those two barrel pieces , the trigger and the trigger guard

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.440
so take the remaining paper roll                                    and cut it into three pieces like this

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.220
glue the bottom of the barrel  and                                      stick the biggest piece of roll on it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.220
then take the smallest piece of roll and fold it reversely like this then glue it at  the front of barrel

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:57.600
take the remaining piece and also fold it reversely like this and make an angled cut at the top of it

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.040
after that get a rubber band and put around the trigger

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.720
then stick the trigger between the  rolls until it gets from the other side

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:22.280
make another piece of roll and fold it like that then put some hot glue to hold it in place

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.220
push the trigger back a little bit  and fix some electrical tape infront of it to prevent it from slipping

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.680
use a scissors to make a small cut to the lower piece of roll in order to hold the rubber band on it

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.900
this way whenever you pull the trigger                            the rubber band will pull it back

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:00.000
finaly .. get another rubber band and double it like this then stretch it between the front sight and the trigger

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.480
once you bull the trigger                                                the rubber band will be released

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.480
