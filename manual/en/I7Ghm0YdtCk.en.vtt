00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.210
Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 and Galaxy Mega 5.8.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.020
Expected May 2013.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.340
Two new entrants in the growing "phablet"
market, the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 and Mega

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:33.320
5.8 are even larger than the popular Galaxy
Note II, sporting 6.3" and 5.8" displays respectively.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.190
More conventionally like an overgrown smartphone
than the stylus-based Galaxy Note Range, these

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.690
Galaxy Mega devices look they might be a little
bit cheaper too.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:50.200
Bur despite the similar names, the Mega 6.3
and 5.8 have quite a few differences.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.950
The pick of the pair is the Samsung Galaxy
Mega 6.3, featuring a 720 x 1280 pixel panel

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.250
on the front, and 8 megapixel primary and
1.9 megapixel secondary camera and a 1.7GHz

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:13.850
dual processor with 1.5GB of RAM and 8 or
16GB of onboard flash plus a microSD slot.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:23.009
It's a big device at 168 x 88 x 8.0mm and
199 grams and it packs a hefty 3200 mAh battery.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.030
This is a 3G device with optional 4G LTE support..
and yes, you can make phone calls on it.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.670
The Mega 6.3 is also NFC capable, and as this
is an Android 4.2 smartphone then it comes

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.130
with all the usual Android features too.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.439
The smaller and cheaper of the pair is the
Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.8, with a 540 x 960

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.979
pixel display, a 1.4 GHz dual-core processor,
no 4G or NFC support and just 8GB of internal

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.770
memory plus a 2600 mAh battery.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.819
All the other features are pretty much the
same as the Mega 6.3.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.679
The Mega 5.8 in particular looks like it might
be good value with the relatively modest pixel

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.390
count on the screen.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.030
Consider though that the Galaxy S4 has over
two million pixels on its display panel, but

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.590
the Mega 5.8 has one quarter of that and the
Mega 6.3 just half, and you can easily see

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.070
how much sharper the display on the S4 is.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.580
Samsung say that the Galaxy Mega range should
start to ship in Europe and Russia from May

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.580
onwards.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.640
No guidance was given on price, but is perhaps
worth saying that the rival ASUS Fonepad is

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.000
slated to cost just â‚¬210 or so when it goes
on sale later this month.
