00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.189
disturbing story out love I

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.549
East memorial high school I East
memorial has

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.719
I had a long playoff drought and

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.490
they brought in coach Scott Phillips and
they actually started playing way better

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.539
and scott phillips all the sudden finds
himself

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.590
out in the cold because when he was
hired was in part

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.449
love the written contract that he signed
to be hired but he was told

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.869
you've gotta start coming to our church
not that other church that you go to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.829
and he said that the is so the athletic
director must be a member

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.860
RVs Memorial Baptist Church and

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.520
Phillips actually said I was 30 seconds
from turning the job down because if the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.930
church

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.489
issue they wanted me to transition from
the Church of the Highlands to East

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.090
memorial

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.160
I never really liked it so I told them I
was willing to give it a try

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.129
but I don't know how it will work out
for one year Phillips an entire family

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.770
went to both churches they would go on
Sunday at 9 a.m. to East memorial

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.449
and then at 11 a.m. to his previous
Church Church of the Highlands

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.650
and again the policy was not documented
anywhere but it was one of these things

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.439
were it was made very very clear to
scott phillips

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.740
and when %uh the school was asked why is
in it just

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.990
part of the contract the response was

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.780
terms of a contract hiring or job
expectations are confidential

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.979
information that cannot be discussed
Phillips wrote back and said you know

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.079
this really isn't working for me it's
just not working

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.659
he didn't hear back from school
officials about that

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.790
and he then ended up resigning

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.119
after he says they would not cave on
their policy of just letting him go to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:45.520
his

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.369
original church I understand we can have
a debate about well

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.630
he was kind of told up front but it
wasn't really anything that he signed so

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.299
was it really binding in any kind of
traditional sense

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.920
I don't really want to have that
conversation the conversation I wanna

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.500
have is

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.450
is a christ-like to have a policy

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.180
or to he was really fired but to force a
guy out

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.520
because he's not a member love your
specific church

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.020
and remember it's nothing is not part of
your religion we know about firing

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.640
people because they're the wrong
religion altogether

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.500
this is a follower of Jesus right he
just followed at a different church

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.720
is that Christ like is this really
representative

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.160
love I don't know what would we even
call it good faith Christianity and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.860
I'm not really sure what the term would
be if this is what they do to Christians

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.620
that go to other churches

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.360
what do they do did muslims jews
atheists do they even have a shot at

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.319
being hired

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.769
at East memorial very very very
disturbing here

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.170
and I think that it was probably a
problem

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.250
a problem for scott phillips that he was
told this it wasn't in writing he kinda

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.900
agreed

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.349
he we can criticize him for that but is
this crisis like is a christ-like to say

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.760
you've gotta follow Jesus not only at
your church but you've got to do it at

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.840
our church is very very concerning stuff

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.370
