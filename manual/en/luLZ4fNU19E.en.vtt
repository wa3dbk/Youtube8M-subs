00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.460
You know, diesel engines aren't just for big
rigs anymore -- we're seeing them in all kinds

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.540
of vehicles these days.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.990
And although this isn't the first time Jeep
has offered one in its Grand Cherokee, this

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.880
one is mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission
making it even more fuel efficient and it's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.180
cleaner than ever before, making it 50-state
compliant.The last time I drove a Grand Cherokee

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.590
diesel it too was a 3.0-liter V6 but instead
of being sourced from an Italian company owned

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.010
by Fiat it was built by Mercedes-Benz.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.440
It was too dirty to be sold in the 8 green
states, was mated to a 5-speed auto producing

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.750
376 pound feet of torque and delivered 22mpg
highway.This time around, if you choose a

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.870
Grand Cherokee trim at least as high as Limited,
you can choose the diesel as a $4,500 option

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.050
instead of the gas V6 and V8 engines.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.701
In reality, the price is even higher considering,
for example, on this Overland trim if you

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:15.780
go diesel you have no choice but to also select
the $1,800 Advanced Technology Group, bundling

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.480
adaptive cruise control, forward collision
warning, advanced brake assist and blind spot

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.000
with rear cross path detection.Power, efficiency
and emissions have all improved since then

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.990
allowing those in any state to opt for the
ECODiesel.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.200
It uses urea injection to clean up the exhaust
and when pitted against the HEMI V8, it can

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.590
save you over $1,000 per year according to
the EPA.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.430
There's no clear towing advantage over the
HEMI but this engine's mighty torque output

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.400
combined with its 28mpg highway rating make
it a winner when heading to the cabin.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:07.880
When you call for more power in the lower
gears, you'll get it.This 2014 Grand Cherokee

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.440
receives a thorough freshening this year,
most of which I've already had the chance

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.150
to appreciate when I test-drove the SRT model.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.790
The new bi-xenon headlamps with their signature
LED treatment highlight the refined exterior

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.520
design which looks fantastic.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.710
Plus the addition of the 8-speed automatic
with sport mode allows the Grand Cherokee

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.550
to luxuriously glide about its business.This
3.0-liter engine produces 240 horsepower,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.319
420 pound feet of torque can tow over 7,000
pounds and can travel over 700 miles between

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.319
fill-ups.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.110
And though it doesn't really bother me, if
you're looking for a diesel engine that's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.680
really quiet, this one isn't it.This one lets
you know what's under the hood with a bit

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.319
more clatter than I've heard from competing
engines so if you're sensitive to such things

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.100
you'll want to check that out.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.690
Otherwise, this Overland 4X4 will please even
the most discriminating luxury SUV driver

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.330
with its rock solid foundation, sophisticatedly
sumptuous ride and a cabin so perfectly crafted

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.800
that it should be the benchmark for quality,
comfort and tech integration.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.670
The Overland is jammed with all of the goodies
AND is easy to use...a rare combo.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.170
Plus this UConnect system is not only the
best looking but also the best period, chock

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.640
full of useful features that actually work
as intended.This Jeep isn't trail-rated but

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.700
with Selec-Terrain and an adjustable air suspension,
I'd feel extremely confident in most situations.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.590
Of course, you can add an off-road group to
get it to that status.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.661
As is this one stickers for $53,485 and though
diesel fuel is no bargain at the pump, for

00:03:53.661 --> 00:04:00.090
some the peripheral advantages of having this
engine will be worth it.
