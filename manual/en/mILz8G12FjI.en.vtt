Hi, I'm Amelia, and on behalf of Expert Village,
I'm here to talk about troubles you have with

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.860
your hair. Depending on the type of cut you
have, like let's say it's too short. If it's

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.469
just too short, unfortunately, patience is
the only thing that's going to work. However,

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.710
if you've got something going on like this,
where you've got like a step, that's easy.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.359
Go to someone you trust and have them go in
and just sort of blend that a little bit more.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.560
So once they blend that, that line will go
away, and it will be a lot softer. If the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.629
sides are too short, like here, you see she's
got so this step here, you can go in you can

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.019
have this sort of texturized a little more
so it looks like it's supposed to be that

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.440
way. And that's the thing, is you want to
make a cut look like you meant to do it. If

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.219
it's, you know if it's bad, you don't want
to just wear it like this all the time just

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.059
because it's bad. Try and have fun with it.
Wear it up, wear little clips in it, you know,

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.809
do different things, and eventually, you know
it will get to where you can do more with

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.930
it. But just go to someone you trust and have
them go through it and sort of help you come

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.049
up with ideas where you can fix it and you
know, do some different things with it. Now,

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.840
Lauren here, she doesn't like the layer she
has in her hair. She feels like it's a little

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.369
bit too bi-level. Turn your head for me. So,
the way that we would fix that, and it might

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.250
be unfortunate for her, but we could take
some of this length off, and that would bring

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.079
everything up and make these layers appear
a lot longer, and that's an easy fix. Now

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.670
let's say her bangs were cut too short, or
let's say she had bangs cut and she didn't

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.079
want them. Easily we just sort of kind of
let them grow, and when they get to a certain

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:55.560
point, we just start brushing them over. Now,
like I said, if your hair's just too short,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.580
you have to let it grow in. If it's overly
texturized, get some good products, scrunch

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.719
it, have fun with it. Just remember to try
and make it look like you mean to do it. And

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.970
go to someone you trust and help them take
you through the process.
