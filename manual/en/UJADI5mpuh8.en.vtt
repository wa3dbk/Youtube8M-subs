00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Hi, I am Eugenie. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:16.250
Today I am going to show you a different way to prepare a breakfast in this simple video. 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.160
First, cut the baguette. 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.670
And make a hole but don’t remove all the white bread inside. 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.510
Just like this. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.000
And set aside.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.210
And add the olive oil in the frying pan and heat the oil over medium heat. 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.710
Meanwhile cut the bacon. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.000
I am using slab bacon today. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.040
Then cook until brown and crisp. 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.250
Now transfer to a kitchen towel lined plate to drain the excess fat.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.060
Then wipe out the bacon fat on the pan and lightly spray oil. 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.770
Reduce the heat to medium-low and place the baguette on the pan.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.500
And crack an egg in a cup and slowly pour it into the hole. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.800
If you press the baguette firmly with fingers, 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.500
the egg white will not get leaked out on the bottom of the bread. 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Season with salt and pepper and cover the pan. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.700
And cook for 2 minutes. And flip it over. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:49.250
Then cook another 1 minute or until the egg is cooked to your liking.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.370
Voila. Sprinkle with bacon on top and immediately serve. 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.970
This is the best when warm. 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.880
I do love the crispy baguette with runny egg inside. 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.170
Bon appetit.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.870
And here goes another one. 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.910
It’s cooked more.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.410
Thank you for watching. 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.410
And yes I love this job. Really. 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.410
Bye for now!
