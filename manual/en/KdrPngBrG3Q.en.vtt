00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.659
I'm here on the Raystown branch of the Juniata
River

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.220
and this happens to be an excellent choice

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.929
if you're targeting panfish.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.860
There's lots of rock bass and bluegill out here.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.010
There is other fish too.  Occasionally

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.040
you'll get into some

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.270
catfish or some smallmouth

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.270
but when it comes to panfish, it's pretty hard
to beat this section of river.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.970
A lot of anglers like

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.740
the feel of a heavy fish on the line

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.619
and that's true with me as well

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.670
but it's nice from time to time to go out and
just catch a bunch of small stuff

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.060
to take home to eat.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.190
Rock bass and blue gill are some of the best
eating you can get

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.509
and occasionally I like to go out and see if I
can get a whole stringer-full.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.159
When I'm fishing ro rock bass and bluegill what
I look for is water that's about three

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.890
or four feet deep

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.780
and I like plenty of structure on the bottom,
so boulders and rocks and logs and things

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.050
like that

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.240
that the fish can hide under.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.570
Sometimes you can actually see the
bottom and you don't see any fish there but

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.060
you'll be surprised how many fish you
can pull out

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.060
from underneath a rock.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.049
What I like to do is use a wire stringer like
this and just hang it off my

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.089
belt loop.

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.959
You have to get used to the fish kinda 
swimming around your legs a bit but

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.069
it makes it handy because if you have to walk
back to shore every time you

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.439
have to hook one up

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:24.439
it will make things take a lot longer.

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.429
I use a real standard set-up when I'm fishing
for panfish

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.909
On my main line a put a snap swivel and just
above it

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.489
I put a slit shot sinker

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.400
and then I tie on a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.759
presnelled

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:55.949
hook and leader.

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.829
I use a size six or a size eight usually

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.389
as far as hooks go

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.429
and then usually I also put a bobber on
top.

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:08.019
Now you don't always have to use a bobber
when you're fishing for panfish.

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.210
I like doing it

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.309
to begin with because I can see where
the fish are located.  I can let the bobber

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.719
drift downstream and once I get it
pinpointed where the fish are then I can

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.769
take the bobber off and fish

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.930
closer to the bottom.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.810
The problem with that, of course, is you get a 
few more snags but it can

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.810
payoff and you can take home more fish.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.020
Well, I have 15 fish so far.   That's about all my
stringer can handle, so I'm going to

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.650
go ahead and take these

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.569
to shore and put them in the bucket, and then
I'll see if I can fill it up again.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.609
I'm looking to catch fifty fish today.

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.859
That's the limit here in Pennsylvania.

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.920
Some of what I'm catching are pretty small

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.959
and so those I'll use for cut bait when I go
for catfish on the Allegheny or

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.449
Susquehanna rivers.

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:05.449
But the rest of them I'll fry up to eat.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.199
Here I got one of those rare small mouth bass
that you pull in here

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.099
but it's only about eight inches long
and

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.599
in Pennsylvania it needs to be at least
twelve inches to take home so

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:32.080
I'll throw him back in for another day.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.340
I use European night crawlers and the ones I
have here today are actually pretty small 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.339
but even then I only use half a worm - I just
pinch it in half

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:43.349
and throw one half of it out.
