What I am doing is called an end chain. And
it's a way of practicing particularly helpful

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.090
with the italic. So what you do is, well I
would draw lines if I were you. And not go

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.779
as fast as I just did ok, because you are
just a beginner. You draw an A and then you

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.030
draw an N, and then you draw a B, and then
you draw an N, and then you draw a C, and

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.190
then you draw an N. And this is helpful in
all kinds of ways basically it helps you with

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:51.480
rhythm it helps you with form, staying even
and harmonious ok. Another practice method

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.520
is to play with lettering out whole words
or one whole sentence, and a fun whole sentence

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:07.290
is called a pangram or a whole, whole alphabetic
sentence, meaning that you've got a sentence

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.690
that has the entire alphabet in it. And the
classic pangram sentence is the quick brown

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.720
fox jumps over the lazy dog. But you, all
we have to do is go to the internet and type

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.521
in pangrams and a whole bunch of these will
come up. Alright and another thing that you

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:36.689
can do is you can draw, practice drawing the
whole alphabet on one piece of paper. And

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:48.340
see if you can stay balanced with it. And
if you want some inspiration for honing your

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.560
skills and being, and getting into the craftsmanship
of it, see the movie Surf's Up. It's a wonderful

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.750
little movie, it's basically a cartoon ok.
But it's got a nice little segment in there

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.570
about how to practice and how to work your
craft. Or you can watch martial arts movies

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.840
because they are very helpful. Now remember
you don't put it down until you can see it.
