Translator : popgasa

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:19.683
"Everything is fate"

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:25.362
When you said that, it painfully made me cry

00:00:27.353 --> 00:00:33.546
Are you really okay? Just looking at you is painful

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:39.261
I hope your pain is just a dream

00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:45.577
The world is not before your eyes

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:52.546
You are trapped in a dark time

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.049
Even if it's exhausting and hard

00:00:57.806 --> 00:01:01.598
Even if one step, two steps take a long time

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:07.478
I hope each of your scars heal

00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:11.206
Yes, smile like that

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.172
Just like that right now

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.421
I will always be by your side

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:28.172
I've gotten to know love for the first time

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:34.455
I will protect you, I won't let you go

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:37.538
I love you

00:01:50.092 --> 00:01:54.428
You say that even your tears have dried

00:01:56.612 --> 00:02:01.011
So it doesn't hurt any more

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.899
Your bright smile, I want to return to you

00:02:10.332 --> 00:02:15.984
I hope all your sadness disappears

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.035
Yes, smile like that

00:02:20.414 --> 00:02:23.434
Just like that right now

00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:29.611
I will always be by your side

00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:36.939
I've gotten to know love for the first time

00:02:37.588 --> 00:02:43.600
I will protect you, I won't let you go

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:47.386
I long for you so much that I can't take it

00:02:47.982 --> 00:02:50.677
I miss you again and again

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:56.416
My love, my painful love

00:02:57.732 --> 00:03:03.591
While I live, I will protect you

00:03:05.028 --> 00:03:11.563
I won't let go of your small hand

00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:18.154
Some day, we will smile again like it's a miracle

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.639
Yes, that day will definitely come

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:31.749
I will wait until then

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:38.537
I will erase your tears

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.369

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.794
