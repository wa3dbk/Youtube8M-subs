[farts, laughs]

00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:10.243
-[groans] Figures.
We finally get to go sailing,

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:12.585
and there's no wind.
-What are you talking about?

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:14.414
I'm breaking wind
like crazy over here.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.349
[grunts, farts, laughs]

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.722
-Awesome. Two fart jokes
in the first 30 seconds.

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.165
Not a good sign.

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:22.509
-Well, not to toot
my own horn, but...

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:23.887
[farts]
-[groans]

00:00:23.887 --> 00:00:26.139
-"Toot" is another
word for "fart."

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:27.799
-Thanks a lot, Captain Obvious.

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:31.134
Orange, why on earth did we
put him in charge of the boat?

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:33.214
-A-doy. He's a captain.

00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:36.442
-I'm a captain!
-[farts, laughs]

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:38.779
-And that was a...
-SHARK!

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:41.639
-Uh-oh. Good thing I'm
on the poop deck. [laughs]

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:44.400
-No, I said... SHARK!

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.950
-(Captain Obvious)
He did say "shark."

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.082
But it's actually a whale.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.906
[fruit scream]

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:00.809
-(Orange) Hey!
Who turned out the lights?

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.639
-Nobody turned out the lights.
We were eaten by a whale.

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:04.881
Remember?
-Really?

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.427
I thought we jumped the shark.

00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:09.637
-That happened during
"Orange Nya-Nya Style."

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:12.601
-Ouch.
-Oh, just shut it, Captain.

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.549
You're the one who
got us into this mess.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.631
Ugh, and I do mean mess.

00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:18.444
Bleh.
[Orange munching]

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:21.306
Orange! What are you doing?
-Oh, quit your bellyaching.

00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:23.907
It's not so bad. Besides,
I've got to keep my strength up.

00:01:23.907 --> 00:01:25.149
We ARE lost at sea.

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.380
-Oh, he's right.
We are lost at sea.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.387
-[munching]
-Dude, gross!

00:01:30.387 --> 00:01:33.248
Stop! It's chum!
-Oh, hi chum!

00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:35.241
You can call me "buddy."
[laughs]

00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:36.721
[munches]
-I am not calling you--

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.997
just stop eating!

00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:40.586
-Pear is angry!
-[grunts]

00:01:40.586 --> 00:01:42.476
Thank you, Captain Obvious!

00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:45.003
-[laughs] Stupid whale.
I'm totally stealing your lunch.

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:48.853
-(voice) That's it, pal. You've
got to keep your spirits high.

00:01:48.853 --> 00:01:52.812
-Uhh... who said that?
-Whoever it was,

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.725
I prefer you call me bro-chard
from another orchard.

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:57.062
-Shut up!
-That's not nice!

00:01:57.062 --> 00:02:00.312
We've all got to get along!
We're in this together.

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:04.026
-[reacts in disgust]
-O-M-G.

00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:06.825
-That means "oh my gosh."
-Forget it! [growls]

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:10.976
Man, all I really wanted
was a nice sailing trip.

00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:13.666
-All I wanted was
to be a real boy.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.370
AND ALL I GOT WAS
EATEN BY A WHALE!

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.956
-Wow, you must feel
like a real "dummy." [laughs]

00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:21.007
[laugh tapers]
I don't feel so good.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.589
-[sarcastically]:
Gee, I wonder why.

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.510
-It's because of the chum.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.791
-[laughs briefly, groans]

00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:30.636
-This is a happy day. I'm so
excited to have new friends.

00:02:30.636 --> 00:02:33.776
For so long, it was just me
and my pal, Mr. Cricket.

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:35.972
-You guys,
you got to get me out of here.

00:02:35.972 --> 00:02:38.225
This doll is crazy.
-[guffaws]

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:41.960
Oh, Mr. Cricket, we both
know that's not true.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.117
[nose stretches,
chuckling nervously]

00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:47.458
-[groans uneasily]
Pear?

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.540
I think something
bad is gonna happen.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.539
-No-no-no-no-no-no,
Orange, don't puke!

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.088
Don't puke! Don't puke! Ah...

00:02:54.088 --> 00:02:56.372
-[farts and sighs]

00:02:56.372 --> 00:02:58.542
-[sighs in relief]
Well, he didn't puke.

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:01.624
-Nope, he farted.
-[growls]

00:03:01.624 --> 00:03:03.118
-[farting and laughing]

00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:06.762
-Whoo-whoo!
Bad time to have a big nose.

00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:09.939
-Okay, I'm done. Had about
as much as I could take.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.048
-Now, now, Mr. Cricket,
nobody likes a hothead.

00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:15.177
-Bite me, ya whack-job puppet!

00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:18.382
[straining]

00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:20.134
-And that's why you
never-ever-ever play with...

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.550
-MATCHES!!!

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.316

-EXPLODE!
[laughs]

00:03:30.134 --> 00:03:32.288
-I hate you all!

00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:33.880
-I'm wearing a hat!

I'm a real buoyant!

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.298
[laughs]
Get it? Get it, guys?

00:03:46.298 --> 00:03:48.882
-That's a play on words!

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:50.688
-This was the
grossest adventure ever.

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:53.154
Is it over yet?
-Almost.

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:55.880
