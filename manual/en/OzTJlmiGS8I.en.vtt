00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.767
Dr. Hibberd&gt;&gt; So
now, let's move

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:05.767
into the omics
revolution.

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:09.567
This is truly where we're
getting a heck of a lot of data.

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:14.967
So from the bug's perspective,
we obviously have genes,

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:18.400
which leads to the
genome and genomics,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.067
the study of that, which
basically is the potential of

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:24.933
the bug to do certain things.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.400
Just the potential.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.533
Doesn't mean it's
going to do it.

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:33.567
Then the transcript ome from the
mRNA at least gets you to the

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:41.667
point that the genes are making
copies such that there could be

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.667
action from those genes.

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:46.533
But even that isn't good enough.

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.867
We need to get to the
manufacturer of proteins,

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:53.933
and the study of
that is now proteomics,

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:59.033
and we also need to understand
how these proteins affect the

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:06.300
metabolites in the microbes
and in the gut or wherever,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.567
and this is metabalomics.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:11.267
So the conceptual
framework here,

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:14.333
when we're talking
about omics,

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.833
we're talking not only
about the gene potential

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:21.167
but all the way through to the
metabolites that are there.

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:23.600
And this is just the bugs!

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.433
Then there's us.

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:29.267
And those may interact.

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:32.133
And then it gets
worse than that.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.567
All over the body, we
have different organisms,

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:39.400
so the function may vary in
different parts of the body.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.967
And then people
start eating things.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.933
And this is people
eating properly

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.900
according to the
USDA pyramid.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.467
But I hear there are a couple
people out there who just aren't

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.133
eating well in
the United States,

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:58.333
and in some other
countries as well.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.033
Hmmm.

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:08.133
And then here are the probiotics
that we're hoping can have some

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:16.300
effect beneficially for the host
and truly now what was such a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.300
simple concept before
2008, take a probiotic,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.800
get a beneficial
effect, feel better,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.333
now has become an
incredibly complex proposition.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:37.033
Clearly, administration of
probiotics is highly relevant to

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:42.000
the structure and
function of the host microbiome.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.200
It's an ecological concept.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.467
This is a little different than
what we originally learned

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.200
in medical school.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.133
But it is a way for us to
focus hypothesis-driven research

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:56.800
related to omics,
and that is exciting.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.933
Clearly, the host
gene, host microbe,

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:05.067
host and microbe response
to a probiotic needs

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:11.367
to be dealt with in a
translational context.

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:15.200
We need studies in man,
we need studies in vitro,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.133
we need animal models, and
we also need simulation.

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:23.833
And we probably need to do
some iterative work to really

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:31.233
understand how to use omics
to understand probiotics.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.267
But there are many challenges.

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:38.333
First of all, I've already
mentioned what's the relevance

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:46.267
of the available samples to the
site of action of the probiotic.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:50.000
If we're getting poop,
is that good enough?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.800
Variability in sample
collection and processing.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.633
Shhhh, don't say
this too loudly,

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:03.800
it's probably unknown how
much variability there is there.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.300
Variability and
validation of the assays

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.867
has been quite
a challenge.

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:13.367
And then, when we
find something,

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:19.533
is that really relevant, and
we've got to be awfully careful

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:24.800
about jumping to omic markers
and point of care diagnostics

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.967
relating to this very,
very fast moving field,

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:33.000
unless we start taking
care of all of these issues.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.100
So these things are challenges.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.400
I'd like to thank Dr. Duffy,
who's my program officer

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.367
and who provided this
slide explaining

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:46.933
how the Microbiome
Project relates

00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:49.833
to the particular
work that we are doing.

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:51.467
We're here.

00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:56.300
I work with the probiotic
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.267
which is one of the multipurpose
staged U01 translational

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:08.100
studies, and we are focusing
on use of omics to understand

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.033
safety and mechanism of
action of the Lactobacillus GG,

00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:17.633
which is a very
widely used probiotic,

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:20.366
yet these details are
not well understood.
