Today the European champion Zhan Beleniuk is going to visit him.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.240
On the 17th of June an announcement to start the contest appeared in social media.

This contest caught a buzz and provoked interest.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.680
Cause nothing similar to this happened before.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:43.940
A common person has a chance to compete with a world-famous Greco Romanian wrestler.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.820
In result Petro Barchuk from Kiev has won in this contest.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.320
When he acknowledged that he happened to won he couldn’t believe.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.760
At last after solving some organizational matters the man was waiting to see a sportsman.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.940
First I expected from this meeting is just to talk with a champion.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:16.000
Secondly as I like wrestling and train it  I wanted to get some tips or instructions.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560
Petro is traumologyst.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.425

In free time he goes in for wrestling.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.540
He says that its one of the sports where everything is fair and real.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.240
Days before meeting Petro went to train.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.540
During one of the wrestle he injured his right leg.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.200
Broken limb destroyed all his expectations.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.820
In fact his dream to wrestle with the champion became impossible.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.700
But Zhan had another thought on this case.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.600
- Hi! This is Zhan

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920
- We are standing near your house.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.960
- How can we meet? Where should we go?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.440
Fan meets the champion on scratches but without a pain.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.680

But now it’s in the past.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.847
Emotions run high.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.040
Few minutes passes and it seems that they know each other for a long time.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.060
- I couldn't imagine that it would be so cool. It's a pitty I can't get any instructions.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.400
- We can meet in a gym after your recovery and I show you some tips. That's not a problem.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.220
- Maybe I'll get some technique from you. Cause we train different wrestling. I'm not good in shoot. You will teach me.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.680
