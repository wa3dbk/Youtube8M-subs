00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:05.038
In this animation, we'll look at how a hydro generator works.

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:07.918
This is a typical New Zealand hydro station.

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:15.557
You can see that the station has a dam, which creates a drop from one water level down to another.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:19.965
From outside the station, we can't see the generators.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:27.680
If we approach, though, we can see the power lines, or conductors, that carry the electricity from the station to the national grid.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.680
Each power conductor connects to a turbine-powered generator inside the dam itself.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.104
Let's go inside the dam now and look at one hydro generator to see how power is produced.

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:43.336
The water from above the dam flows down through pipes called penstocks.

00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:50.323
Each penstock has its own headgate at the top to stop waterflow for maintenance or during an emergency.

00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:53.409
At the end of the penstock is the scroll case.

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.970
This curls around the turbine like a snail shell.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.564
It's designed to create a consistent pressure of water entering the turbine from all sides.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:08.632
Inside the scroll case is a set of vanes called the wicket gates.

00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:12.543
These control how water flows into the turbine.

00:01:12.543 --> 00:01:16.776
The wicket gates are controlled by an external 'governor' system.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:20.842
This opens and closes them in response to conditions on the national grid.

00:01:20.842 --> 00:01:23.942
A high load on the system slows the turbine.

00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:28.653
The governor system reacts by opening the gates further to speed it back up.

00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:35.183
Conversely, it will narrow the wicket gates in response to low load on the system.

00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:39.490
Beyond the wicket gates we can see the turbine blades.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.527
The blades are shaped to extract the most possible spin from the moving water.

00:01:44.527 --> 00:01:49.814
The turbine blades and the shaft connecting them to the generator are called the 'runner'.

00:01:49.814 --> 00:02:00.084
We will expand this into its parts so we can see them clearly.

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:13.173
At the top is the 'exciter', which gets a small DC power supply from a cable attached to an external controller called the automatic voltage regulator or the AVR.

00:02:13.173 --> 00:02:16.312
Below the exciter is the generator.

00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:20.812
The inside is a rotor, turned by the runner.

00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:29.605
The outside stationary part is the stator. This is made up of a set of three coils of copper wire, called 'windings'.

00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:36.371
On the rotor are a number of electromagnets, powered by the DC current from the exciter.

00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:41.695
If these are switched off, the turbine will be able to spin without generating any electricity.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:49.490
The magnets' poles on the outside of the rotor create a separate rotating magnetic field for each magnet.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:59.484
The magnets are lined up so that adjacent poles always have opposite fields to each other - north, south, north, south.

00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:07.539
As the rotor spins within the stator, each pole's magnetic field acts on the stator's windings.

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:19.602
Each time a pole makes one full revolution, one pulse of AC power is generated in the windings and transmitted towards the grid by conductors attached to the stator.

00:03:19.602 --> 00:03:27.326
Because the stator is connected to the grid, it's important that the pulses are in time with the grid frequency.

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:34.329
When the pulses are in time with the grid frequency, we say that the generator is synchronised.

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:41.622
System conditions can 'push' the stator's magnetic fields out of synch with the rotor.

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:48.414
The difference between the movement of the stator's magnetic field and the rotor's is the torque angle.

00:03:48.414 --> 00:03:54.822
The rotor has many electromagnets on it, producing a consistent flow of power.

00:03:54.822 --> 00:04:06.144
The generator produces three-phase power by using different conductors to carry the power generated along different parts of the stator, as shown here.

00:04:06.144 --> 00:04:18.429
This creates a three-phase alternating current, which is represented by the sine wave.
