00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.260 position:98%
Deep in the Tonquin Valley of Jasper National Park, Parks Canada biologists are on a mission.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.240 position:98%
They are out to investigate a potential caribou kill site as part of an ongoing program to monitor wolf kill rates in the park.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.010
But its not an easy task

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.050 position:97%
not only is it a 50km hike through difficult back-country terrain,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.190 position:98%
searching for the licked-clean cast-offs of last winter’s hungry wolf pack feels like finding a needle in a haystack.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.290 position:61%
But the biologists have come prepared….

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.060 position:70%
using GPS data from collars on the wolf pack,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.120 position:97%
the biologists use their own GPS unit to guide them to within meters of where the wolves might have made their kill.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.050
Should be right around here

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.600 position:94%
The biologists search the site, but no carcass can be found;

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.250 position:98%
meaning that the wolves most likely used the area last winter as a bedding site, and not for a feast.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.250 position:97%
Its good that we're liberal with definition of what a kill site is

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.210 position:97%
because we’ve had situations where we’ve been to a site and there have only been 2 or 3 hours that the animal was at the site,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:41.280 position:97%
and we’ll get there and there will be a kill, and what has happened is that the GPS can’t quite reach the satellite due to either cover or a big cliff or rocks somewhere around

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.120 position:98%
so it helps us find where the cutoff is between a bed and a kill.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.020 position:80%
But finding no kill is certainly not disappointing…

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.140 position:98%
because woodland caribou herds in the Rocky Mountains don’t have many more members to lose.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.020 position:97%
Our last census was 87 and there could be as many as 96, so just under a hundred here in Jasper,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.080 position:97%
we figure back in ’88 there was about 175 so we’ve had a decline since then.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.240 position:97%
Banff National Park of course, there was only about 5 and all of them were killed in an avalanche,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.280 position:95%
so odds are they have been extirpated in Banff National Park.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.050 position:98%
So within Canada there’s a lot of different types of caribou and the one on the quarter is the one that people probably grow up learning about and seeing

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.020 position:98%
but most of the time when people think about caribou they think about barren-ground caribou

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.100 position:97%
- large herds, migratory animals, moving to the coast to calve, and then back,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:51.200 position:97%
but woodland caribou generally live below treeline in Canada, don’t have large migrations, don’t move to the coast and don’t live in large groups.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.170 position:98%
A lot of people are surprised to learn that we have woodland caribou as far south as jasper and into southern B.C and even down into the United States.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:11.290 position:97%
For the woodland caribou that spend time within the mountain national parks, Parks Canada is actively doing research to learn the best way to maintain stable populations.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.230 position:80%
They have come up with five key threats to caribou.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.290 position:97%
The first of the threats, and the one that is being managed most, is altered predator prey dynamics.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.250 position:98%
This threat starts with having a stable, over-inflated population of elk in the park.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:39.100 position:97%
And having increased numbers of elk sustains more wolves – more wolves that can kill more caribou.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.010 position:73%
The second threat is increased predator access.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:55.180 position:97%
So caribou live up in these high reaches of the mountains, especially in winter time they use this space to separate themselves from wolves.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:04.160 position:97%
When we create tracks that go into caribou habitat, we create a perfect trail, a wolf can access caribou habitat easily and this increases risk to caribou

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.040 position:59%
The third threat is human disturbance,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.020 position:97%
In Jasper National Park we’ve lost about 13 caribou since 1988 on the Icefields parkway;

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:26.260 position:98%
This is a fairly preventable loss and ends up being a fairly large factor to the population decline, so we’ve worked on speed zones in those areas.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:38.070 position:97%
When we're hiking and accessing areas that are caribou habitat, sometimes caribou react and run great distances from us.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.060
The fourth threat is habitat loss.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.100 position:97%
We don’t see a lot of that within the national parks, but one example is potentially fire - which changes habitat for caribou.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.040 position:98%
Outside of the national park were talking about things like cut blocks, pipelines, and seismic lines,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.120 position:97%
The fifth threat is small population size, and as proven by the loss of the entire Banff herd in just one avalanche,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.070 position:98%
normal impacts on small populations are magnified, making each animal precious.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.100 position:97%
Caribou are a really cool species that are highly adapted to a unique environment.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.080 position:97%
They have really unique features and they live in places where really only they can survive.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.230 position:98%
They are connected to us in so many ways, culturally connected, economically connected,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.270 position:97%
they're probably one of the first deer species that we grow up learning about just because of the fact that they are on our money.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.110 position:97%
They are good indicators for an ecosystem and for when an ecosystem is in trouble.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.220 position:98%
And for all these reasons I think we should all be involved in learning about caribou, and participating in caribou recovery,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.250 position:98%
giving our opinions about caribou when we are asked, and just staying informed about caribou and caribou ecology.
