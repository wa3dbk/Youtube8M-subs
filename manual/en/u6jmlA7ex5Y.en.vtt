00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.400
-How are you?
-Fine and you?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.560
Sunshine… Advanced technology… 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.640
Why did you not choose football
like every Brazilian?

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.160
My best idol, even though he passed away,
is my father.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.320
He was very certain
that I would be a tennis player.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.280
Larri got to be my coach
for all my life.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.280
My father made a barbecue for him

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.520
and said: "You have to coach Guga."

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.760
Larri said: "You're crazy, he's 8 years!"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.520
But he promised
that one day he would coach me.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.360
-It's all around him!
-It's because of him!

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.560
Next one…

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.840
Who would you like to play with in the actual players?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.800
Nadal!
The match I didn't have in my career.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.960
But you did play Federer:
you were the last one who beat him in quarterfinal.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.760
-Before quarter.
-The last one!

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.800
What's the secret
between the French public and you?

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.480
In 1997, it was this big surprise.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.440
We can consider it normal,
but it kept growing.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.320
And in 2001,
when I drew this heart on the court,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.360
it was the most emotional feelings I had…

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.240
-You give me the goose!
-Me too!

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.880
-What is your prognosis for Roland Garros?
-Nadal.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
You have to consider yourself a little bit crazy
if you don't say he's the favourite.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.760
We need a miracle
to get somebody else than Nadal…

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.560
But it can happen!

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.880
Guga, many thanks for your time.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.760
-Thank you.
-Bye.
