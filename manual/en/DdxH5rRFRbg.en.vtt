-5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Xbox One. -Wii U, PlayStation

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:26.231 position:86%
4, Xbox One - we're officially in the eighth generation

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:28.379 position:75%
of video game consoles. We made it. If you're as

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:31.377 position:73%
old as me, you feel old, maybe a little creepy.

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:33.021 position:69%
Maybe your back hurts when you get up in the

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.363 position:83%
morning. Maybe the other parts of your body just hurt

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.975 position:84%
for no reason. That's how long video game consoles has

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.831 position:81%
been around. -My very first video game console was a

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.315 position:97%
NES FamiCon. -The Gameboy. -Sega Genesis. -Probably the ColecoVision. -Was

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.840 position:92%
the Nintendo 64. -The original NES, man. -It's important to

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:50.792 position:78%
look back and ask ourselves, "How did we get here?

00:00:49.755 --> 00:01:01.900 position:78%
How did the industry evolve to where it is today?"

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.572 position:73%
In the '60s, a man named Ralph Baer was working

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:07.173 position:89%
at a defense company in Nashua, New Hampshire. He thought

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.444 position:78%
to himself, "Why can't I hook something up to this

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.201 position:67%
TV to make it more fun?" So he got together

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:12.896 position:88%
with two of his engineers, and they cobbled together the

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.756 position:92%
first of seven Brown Boxes. These were video game consoles,

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.896 position:98%
early video game consoles that played simple games. They eventually

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.496 position:88%
sold the final Brown Box to Magnavox, which rebranded it

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:25.840 position:88%
as the Magnavox Odyssey. -From most of the 20th century,

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.306 position:80%
the idea of actually being able to play video games

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.926 position:78%
in your house was the fantasy. You couldn't do it.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.965 position:98%
Not until the Magnavox Odyssey, where people were actually able

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:36.292 position:86%
to play video games in their homes. -The Odyssey itself

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:39.195 position:70%
had a really rough start. I mean, it came out

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.475 position:98%
and it was marketed incredibly poorly-- -Odyssey, the electronic game

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.874 position:70%
of the future that lets you do your own thing

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:48.606 position:97%
on television. -It was brand new technology that people didn't

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.070 position:75%
get. -The Odyssey was odd. It's the best word to

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.846 position:86%
describe-- But it was really the Atari 2600 that kicked

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:09.138 position:81%
everything off for me as a home console player. When

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.804 position:73%
you look back now at the Atari 2600 games, they

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.138 position:75%
all look very basic, but at that time, they were

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.393 position:88%
nothing short of amazing. They-- -The Atari 2600 was the

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.305 position:86%
game console that everybody had. Well, I didn't have it

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.817 position:73%
and I was really jealous of my neighbor who had

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.776 position:77%
one. But this one was iconic. This was the system

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.107 position:88%
that got people crazy about playing video games at home.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.064 position:73%
-It was as ubiquitous as a refrigerator or a TV

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.667 position:89%
in most households. -In the successful years of the Atari

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.507 position:72%
2600 we got to over $2 Billion business in the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.217 position:78%
United States, only on video games. It's kind of a

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.412 position:98%
number that is important to understand because we will understand

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.740 position:94%
what happened when video games go into what this universally

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.761 position:80%
recognized as the big crash of video games in 1983.

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.825 position:72%
-Game over. -There was a video game crash as a

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.274 position:78%
result of just this flood of terrible games on the

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.204 position:83%
2600. And for awhile, it seemed like maybe home video

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.313 position:78%
games and video game consoles had just been a fad.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.431 position:95%
-And video games really went out of fashion altogether. -Then

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.377 position:97%
something happened. What happened was Nintendo happened. Nintendo, a company

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:15.075 position:84%
that has been around making trading cards for nearly a

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.412 position:97%
century. They decided, "We're gonna make a video game system."

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:18.836 position:69%
The key thing is they didn't call it a video

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.504 position:84%
game system. In the United States, they marketed it as

00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:22.843 position:72%
a toy. They have Rob, the robot. They have the

00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:26.773 position:75%
Zapper, which was a little gun you plugged in to

00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:28.903 position:83%
the console. They didn't want people to think that it

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:30.899 position:77%
was a video game machine because that had a stink

00:03:30.094 --> 00:03:35.085 position:72%
to it because of the Atari 2600 and the crash.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.103 position:89%
-With the third generation of home video game systems, it

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.800 position:97%
was not a fair fight. The Nintendo Entertainment System mopped

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.363 position:97%
the floor with the Sega Master System. -The Nintendo Entertainment

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.464 position:91%
System is the console that changed everything. This is the

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.300 position:98%
system, the little gray box that shipped and suddenly connected

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.570 position:88%
with everyone. Whether it'd be Mario-- This is-- this is

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.348 position:94%
Mario Brothers. This is the start of everything for Nintendo

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.284 position:73%
and for the industry as well, all right? All of

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.516 position:77%
a sudden, the new games had what they didn't have

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.841 position:84%
before - a mascot, someone you could connect with. -It

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.424 position:72%
was not just something that was big as a video

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.544 position:91%
game system, but it helped launch Nintendo into being just

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:09.126 position:98%
a cultural force. So everything from Nintendo cereal-- -Nintendo Cereal

00:04:09.174 --> 00:04:15.159 position:94%
System is a super power system of nutritious breakfast-- -Or

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.934 position:97%
Fred Savage's famous, or infamous movie The Wizard. Power Glove,

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.785 position:88%
this ridiculous glove that you would wear, in theory, to

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.185 position:81%
control games better. It was more than just a gaming

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:32.566 position:88%
system. It was a cultural phenomenon. -There can be only

00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:36.532 position:88%
one. -Sega challenges you with the ultimate video game -

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.402 position:81%
the Sega Master System. -When I started my career in

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:44.138 position:83%
this industry, I was testing games on the Sega Master

00:04:43.609 --> 00:04:45.652 position:80%
System, and quite frankly I didn't even know it had

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.226 position:75%
existed. The only thing that was in my world was

00:04:48.564 --> 00:04:52.555 position:97%
the Nintendo Entertainment System at that time. -The Sega Master

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.835 position:83%
System is notable in that it's what brought Sega into

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.034 position:66%
home video games. -I saw-- I saw it, I put

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:58.158 position:78%
my little pudgy finger on the glass, I said, "Mom,

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.114 position:78%
that's what I want for my birthday. What is that?"

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.093 position:86%
That was the second question. And they made that happen

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.921 position:70%
and I got the Sega Master System. And man did

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:06.968 position:72%
I pick a losing horse in this race, becoming a

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.440 position:69%
Sega kid over a Nintendo kid, but it was one

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:11.527 position:81%
of those things where that was your source of pride.

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.891 position:81%
That was your identity as video games were getting a

00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:16.142 position:98%
foothold [unk], right? -There's certainly a rivalry, you know, somebody

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:18.817 position:67%
else had a Sega Master System and you had a

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:21.134 position:81%
Nintendo [unk]. You know, you picked sides in a war.

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:23.402 position:80%
You kinda-- you had one, you didn't have the other.

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:26.419 position:84%
And it was the beginning of a rivalry between Nintendo

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:28.095 position:91%
and Sega that would go on for generation after generation.

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.796 position:81%
It would take awhile before there was a clear victor

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.032 position:72%
in it. -So you're talking about the NES or the

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.705 position:92%
Sega Master System, or just video games of that generation,

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:38.155 position:88%
you're talking about, literally for what I think, is the

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.606 position:95%
foundation for what video games will be. Right, because there

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.675 position:80%
was suddenly all these kids like me, who started to

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:46.597 position:97%
grow up with these, and started to understand these characters

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.036 position:80%
and these things and what video games would be. And

00:05:49.374 --> 00:05:51.260 position:64%
so, as we make that jump to the Super NES

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.176 position:73%
to, you know, the Sega Genesis, what you see is

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.912 position:98%
the video game companies realizing that their audience is maturing,

00:05:57.164 --> 00:06:01.189 position:66%
and so they need to as well. -And then the

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.167 position:92%
fourth generation - the empire strikes back. Sega comes out

00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:07.400 position:98%
with the Sega Genesis, saying "Genesis does what Nintendon't." -Genesis

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.441 position:98%
does-- -What Nintendon't. -I mean, Sega Genesis was Sega's coming

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.022 position:84%
out party, you know. Sega Master System was the system

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:16.547 position:75%
that I owned, and nobody knew what that was. But

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.255 position:91%
Sega Genesis, everybody knew because it was when Sega came

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.193 position:78%
out and adopted an identity and said, "We are this

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:25.763 position:98%
blue hedgehog--" -Sonic 2 handles stubborn stains. Embarrassing bald spots?

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:28.006 position:78%
No problem. But wait, you can play it, too. -Sonic

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:30.595 position:86%
was just-- he had attitude. You know, history has shown

00:06:30.354 --> 00:06:32.650 position:88%
that Mario's a great character, but he's kinda just this

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.123 position:88%
schlubby plumber guy who jumped on turtles and-- -It was

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:37.424 position:89%
one of those things that Sega said, "We're the underdog."

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:40.036 position:64%
And in a way, it summed up fans, like me,

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.003 position:98%
right? Like we needed a rallying crowd-- -Genesis. -Does. -Genesis.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:45.022 position:66%
-Does. -There has to be a line on the sand

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:47.775 position:61%
for what you are what you are a kid and

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:50.182 position:92%
your parents won't buy you both systems. -Sega people could

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:53.701 position:75%
look to the Genesis and say, "This is the thing.

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:55.771 position:86%
This is what gets us over Nintendo." -Super power. -The

00:06:56.454 --> 00:06:59.445 position:95%
Super Nintendo was Nintendo putting its foot down and saying,

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:02.112 position:98%
"We basically started this home console business, and we aren't

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:04.996 position:95%
going anywhere. -It's been very unusual in gaming history for

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.556 position:81%
any one console maker to have two great platforms in

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:11.396 position:98%
a row. But Nintendo pulled that off. The Nintendo Entertainment

00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:13.504 position:91%
System was phenomenal. The Super Nintendo, I would say, it

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:16.994 position:81%
was even better. -It was when Nintendo said, "We are

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:18.724 position:75%
going to make these things that you loved in the

00:07:19.049 --> 00:07:21.924 position:92%
last-- on the last system franchised. These are things that

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:22.965 position:77%
are gonna be here to stay because you loved them.

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:26.845 position:97%
Here's another Metroid. Here's the Final Fantasy. Here are all

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.865 position:97%
these different experiences that we're gonna give you and make

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:33.294 position:98%
this definitive video gaming platform for the time. -Super Nintendo

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:37.354 position:72%
kind of quietly proved itself out to be one of

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:38.737 position:84%
the best machines ever made. -You realize there was no

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.244 position:86%
ceiling to what was happening, and 16-bit was our first

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:44.553 position:84%
taste of that. -The fifth generation was a [unk] show.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:49.422 position:84%
Can I say "[unk] show"? There's too many players here.

00:07:49.624 --> 00:07:58.621 position:98%
There's too many players in the fifth generation. Something's gotta

00:07:57.665 --> 00:08:02.665
give.
