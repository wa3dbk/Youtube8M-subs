00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.680
Hi, and welcome to my Brixton Kitchen series
for Videojug.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.680
I am Rosie.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.510
I am a food writer, and today I am going to
be cooking some recipes that were inspired

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.840
by the fresh produce I found in the market
in Brixton, where I live.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.840
[Music]

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.840
Ok.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.560
So, in this episode, I am going to be making
my version of Ajo Blanco.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.919
And, so, this is my take on a really delicious
chilled Spanish soup.

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:29.729
I am going to start off by just putting 200
grams of flaked almonds into the blender.

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:34.429
I am popping these almonds in here with a
clove of garlic.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:39.059
And, I am just going to pulse it up.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.480
You want to get it as fine as you can before
you start adding liquid, so that you get a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.739
smooth soup.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.519
Because you are using raw garlic in this,
the soup is going to have a very strong, garlicky

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.910
flavor and it will be quite punchy.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.300
I am a massive fan of garlic, so that is lovely,
but you might want to adjust it to your own

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.789
personal taste and for the people you are
cooking for.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:09.110
So, now, I am just going to add a pinch of
salt and some olive oil and I am going to

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.370
blend it again, until it is a, kind of, paste.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:21.790
Now, the reason I love this recipe is because
it is just such an unusual soup.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.890
When I first had it I thought there might
be cream, or something, in it because of the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.450
almonds.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.760
When blended with the garlic and with the
breadcrumbs that we are going to introduce

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.920
in a minute, it just has a really, really
creamy texture and flavor.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.700
And, because it is a chilled soup, it is really
great for the summer.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.310
Especially as a little starter.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:54.570
So then, I am just going to add now, about
a tablespoon of cider vinegar, which just

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.420
adds a little bit of acidity, which is really
nice, to cut through that creaminess.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.990
And, then, I am going to add in the sourdough
breadcrumbs, which is just the inside of some

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.470
sourdough that has gone a bit stale.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:19.500
Obviously, if you are making this on a bigger
scale, you might want to use a bigger blender.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.410
And, that is basically it, for the base ingredients.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.380
Now, the only thing we need to add is water.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:36.580
So, if you just get your water, and add in
enough to moisten it, and then, give it a

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.610
blend.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.580
There is a lot of blending in this recipe.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.640
Right.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640
I think that it is ready.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.990
So, it is time to get some bowls and to chill
it down in the fridge.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.990
Okay.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.140
So, while the soups are chilling, we are going
to get on with the next stage of the recipe.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.400
To add a bit of texture and crunch, I am going
to fry some morcilla, which is Spanish blood

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400
sausage.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.090
Okay, so, I am just going to slice this up
quite fine.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.300
I think that is probably enough.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.470
I am just going to peel the skin off the outside
as well.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.820
Traditionally it is served with grapes, which
works really well, or you can do it with sliced

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.230
up apple.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.980
But I really love morcilla so I am just going
to use it as a kind of crouton, and it is

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.950
also nice because if you serve it immediately
once you have fried the morcilla, you get

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.430
that hot and cold contrast, which is quite
nice.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.170
I am just going to add some oil to the pan.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.140
Okay, I think that is about ready.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.230
So just a sort of medium heat.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.130
And then, pop your morcilla in.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.501
And you can hear it sizzling there.

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:44.420
That is what we want.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.070
And, it is quite fatty itself, so some of
the fat in the sausage is going to drain out

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.070
at this stage, as well.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.630
You do not have to give it very long at all.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.490
I just do it, literally, for a couple of minutes
on each side.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.620
So I am going to take it off the heat and
I am going to just drain it on some kitchen

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.010
roll to get rid of the excess fat.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.010
Okay.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.170
So, we have got our soups out of the fridge.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.350
They are nice and cool now.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.530
And, we are just going to crumble over the
morcilla, as little croutons.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.080
I just break it up quite roughly, so that
it is not too small, because you still want

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.150
to get a sense of what it is.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.690
Just to finish off, I am just going to drizzle
a little bit of extra virgin olive oil over

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.849
the top of the soup.

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.469
And, that is it.

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.919
Lovely to enjoy with some friends on a hot
summer's day.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.349
Hope you enjoyed it.

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.840
And I will see you next time for some more
tasty recipes.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.240
I am going to try the soup now.
