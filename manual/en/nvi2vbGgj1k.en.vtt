Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.300
[pause]

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.840
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.469
Women often ask me what vitamins or minerals
can they take to make their

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.789
hair and nails grow faster or even to make
their hails harder or thicker

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.310
and, unfortunately, the answer is, none. The
reality is that, unless you’re

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.460
severely malnourished or unless you have a
severe vitamin deficiency,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.960
taking extra vitamins and minerals just has
no effect on your hair or

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.820
nails. Lots of websites and advertisers recommend
vitamin and mineral

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.239
supplements, especially vitamin B6 and biotin,
folic acid and beta-

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.140
carotene, and the minerals, magnesium and
zinc. But there’s no medical

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.980
evidence to suggest that taking supplements
of these minerals or vitamins

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.850
has any effect on the growth of your hair
or nails if you have a normal

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.769
diet and you are normally nourished. Let me
explain why.

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.070
The vitamins and minerals that you use for
your hair and nails work in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.329
very, very small, tiny, minute amounts. And
the small amounts that are

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.649
present in everybody’s diet is sufficient
to make your hair and nails grow

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.890
normally. Those vitamins and minerals act
like on/off switches. Let me give

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.900
you an example. This lamp has a regular on/off
switch with no dimmer. If I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.289
push the switch on, you get this much light.
If I push harder as I am

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.940
pushing now, the light doesn’t get any brighter.
It works the same way with

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.829
the vitamins and minerals in your body for
hair and nails. The normal

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.130
amounts you have will allow normal growth,
and taking extra amounts have no

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.950
effect on their growth. So, despite deceptive
advertising, your hair and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.069
nails can’t be fooled.
