00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.199
Welcome back.

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.080
This is the final part of a five part series
on MyFord Touch.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.930
In this video we will cover settings and Navigation.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.559
Lets get right into this, there is a lot to
cover.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.940
MyFord Touch is equipped with the capability
of turning your car into a wireless network

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.480
and if you are outside a wi-fi hotspot or
you have a USB mobile broad band connection,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.150
you can give everyone in your vehicle internet
access.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:37.730
To access this press menu – settings – wireless
internet – wifi settings.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.440
First go to wi-fi network mode and make sure
it is set to “on” Then you choose a wireless

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.860
network, either by searching for one, or by
choosing one that was previously setup.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.190
You also need to make sure you check the gateway
access point and make sure it is turned on,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.250
so everyone in the vehicle has access.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.250
And if you want to see who has connected to
your network, just go to the gateway access

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.250
point device list in the wi-fi settings menu.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.250
You can also use your USB mobile broadband
connection by simply plugging it into the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.250
USB port and following the instructions on
the Wi-fi settings screen.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.250
(check this out)
Now we haven’t covered where to make some

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.399
of the changes to the vehicles basic settings
so we will go over that now.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:12.840
Press menu&gt;settings&gt;system to adjust language,
temperature units, touchscreen beeps, distance

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.909
units, system prompt volume and keyboard layout.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.399
For display settings press menu&gt;display.

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.740
Here you can adjust brightness, auto dim on/off,
edit wallpaper and change the mode-auto, day

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.110
or night.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.329
Press menu&gt;vehicle to adjust ambient lighting,
run a vehicle health report, adjust the rear

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.960
view camera, enable valet mode and edit the
door keypad code.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.340
MyFord Touch Navigation is pretty much like
every other navigation program out there.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.600
If your vehicle is equipped, press the upper
right corner of the touchscreen.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.380
To set a destination, then choose to set the
destination using one of the choices you are

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.380
shown.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.829
Then follow the instructions.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.060
You can choose to get there the fastest way
possible, the shortest distance or the most

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.450
fuel efficient route.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.049
Then choose start route.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.530
Its that easy!

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.219
You can choose to set the destination by typing
on the touchscreen or by using the voice commands.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.920
Remember, you can press “voice” and say
“list commands” anytime you need them!

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.790
That’s it for now.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.069
Even though the video series is complete,
you can call anytime to set up an appointment

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.989
with one of our SYNC/MyFord Touch specialists
for a one on one session.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.120
