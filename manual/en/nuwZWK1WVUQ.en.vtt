00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:27.490
Alright, I'll get it this time.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.070
Almost there, AGH DAMMIT.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.410
Oh hey viewers, looks like another case of
me sucking again.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.370
Nothing makes my blood boil more in a game
than totally unnecessary difficulty, which

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.920
is usually a result of the developers forgetting
a certain piece of the puzzle, and sometimes

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.079
its because they were working really, really
hard on another element of the game.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.100
Still, live by the sword, die by the sword.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.910
Many have tackled that difficult Labyrinth
game on a wooden board with a metal marble,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.320
and more recently, marble madness, a game
that replaces the traditional first player

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.860
character with a simple sphere that rolls
around on a physically sound board.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.470
This is where the tough part comes in.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.150
How do you make this type of game handle like
a pro?

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.710
It's not easy.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.560
This is made painfully obvious in Mojo! for
the Playstation 2, developed by FarSight Studios

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:36.100
and published by Crave Entertainment.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.850
You control a marble in a variety of worlds
and must destroy all the blocks.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.550
Problem is, your sphere needs to be the same
color as the block to knock it over, which

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.840
can be changed by running it through an infuser.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.190
If you complete it in a seemingly impossible
time frame, you receive an infuser to take

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.979
with you as opposed to having to backtrack
and collect that color again.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.759
It's a simple formula that can work well as
a puzzle game scenario, but examining the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.610
jerky camera controls as public enemy number
one, therein lies the problem.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.050
Difficulty as a challenge notwithstanding,
I feel that if you are given a control to

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.540
use in a game to use in a particular situation,
it should make things easier on you.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.990
As opposed to, you know, harder.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.140
The most useful ability granted to you is
a speed boost, which can help you control

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.800
your direction at high speeds, allowing you
to clear those tough corners.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.960
Still, this ability is limited by your mojo
meter.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.440
I am also not a fan of the arbitrary rules
to some of the aspects of this game.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.650
For example, in this stage you are instructed
to pick up a key to destroy the lock block,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.580
but you are only allowed to have said key
when your sphere is yellow.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.520
After falling off the course multiple times
you'll become quite fond of this rule, let

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.440
me tell you.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:13.460
In theory, Mojo! should be a quality puzzler
that offers players a high fun factor and

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.650
replayability with its top three scores, but
is lacking in practicality with primitive

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.300
controls that are difficult to handle even
in the least precarious situations.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.870
Yes, I might be a whiny baby, but hey, it's
what I'm paid for, after all.
