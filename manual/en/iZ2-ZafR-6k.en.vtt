Sweets Tales

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:14.000
Today’s story is of Kanoko,
the shining star of bean sweets.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.866
Ginza, Tokyo.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.800
One of the attractions of this multifaceted town is Kabuki theater.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.789
“Kyoganoko Musume Dojoji”
This representative piece from the Edo era
is performed in gorgeous costume and portrays a woman in love.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.899
It is said that the Kabuki actors of Edo
are responsible for popularizing wagashi such as Kanoko.

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:57.400
Here is one store infatuated with these sweets.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.666
Kanoko in a rainbow of colors are on display at the storefront.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:13.766
These six varieties of beans and chestnuts are handpicked and together known as “Flower Kanoko.”

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:23.933
“Kanoko were originally cheap sweets.
So I thought I wanted to give them something
that would give them that Ginza class.”

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:37.533
It was the previous owner, Atsuhiro’s father,
who bestowed rich garment on Kanoko,
which, until then, was only made with one variety of azuki bean.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The quality of Kanoko depends on how you prepare the beans.
Atsuhiro has worked in the factory since he was young,
and preserves the traditional flavor of the bean.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:02:01.267
“You can feel the skin when you first eat it,
but as you chew, the skin melts away in your mouth.
Cooking the beans until they reach that state is crucial.”

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:10.500
Kanoko is made by first kneading gyuhi mochi from shiratamako
and wrapping it whole in red bean paste.

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:19.133
Then, roll it up in plump boiled beans, mold it to shape,
and finish by glazing with agar-agar.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.933
Much like the Shirabyoshi dancers of Kabuki theater,
these attired Kanoko are stars of the wagashi world.

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:41.666
Be sure to taste the difference
of these Ginza-born beans!
