00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.299
Stamps honoring the country’s farmers markets,
saving energy and helping the environment

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.520
at U-S-D-A, and tracking a creeping menace.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.160
Those stories and more in
U-S-D-A Week In Review.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.310
A new stamp series from the postal service
celebrates America’s farmers and farmers

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.310
markets.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.850
Secretary Vilsack helped unveil the four new
stamps at a farmers market near the White

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.850
House.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.489
And a lot of folks have talked about the benefits
of farmers markets and that’s certainly

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:38.489
true.

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.329
This postage stamp will give us the opportunity
to focus on those benefits.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.829
It’s been mentioned that it’s obviously
access to great food and I’d encourage everybody

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.110
to spend a few bucks while you’re here.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.910
The new stamps will help remind people how
farmers markets help connect consumers with

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.840
the people who grow our food.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.600
We have been celebrating nationwide the fifteenth
annual National Farmers Market week.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.100
We kicked off the week’s celebration at
the Madison, Dane County Farmers Market.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.130
Secretary Tom Vilsack proclaimed this the
week that farmers and customers and the public

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.540
should really celebrate farmers markets throughout
the nation.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.410
To find a farmers market near you go to the
online Farmers Market Directory at a-m-s dot

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.360
u-s-d-a dot gov.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.740
In Washington and across the country, U-S-D-A
is working to make its buildings more environmentally

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.740
friendly.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.659
Number one, to reduce our carbon footprint
so that it helps with climate change.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.090
The second reason is to preserve our natural
resources, of course.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.899
And then also to make our facilities more
efficient.

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.130
And cooling more efficiently is what an upgraded
chilled water plant does at U-S-D-A headquarters.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.560
Energy savings on a daily, monthly basis,
not needing to mechanically cool the water

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.340
using the outside air, that really does save
an awful lot.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.361
Probably thirty percent of the baseline energy
costs have been saved just not running the

00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:05.939
machines on a daily basis.

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.789
The new chiller plant uses outside air and
computer software to cool headquarters during

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.580
fall and winter warm spells when the main
A-C is off.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.000
The vine that ate the South is eating a lot
more these days.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.080
Damaging kudzu vines have crept through the
mid-Atlantic and northern U-S and into Canada.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.800
We think that with warming winters that kudzu
is going to be a potential newcomer to many

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.500
parts of the United States that have not seen
kudzu before and may not be familiar with

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500
it.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.030
It basically eliminates all the other species,
so you’re reducing the degree of biodiversity

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.140
that you’re going to have.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.170
The kudzu is also host for soybean rust, which
is a pathogen, which once it gets into a soybean

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.960
field is difficult to control.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.730
Kudzu is sort of a super weed, if you will.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.480
One that we really need to keep an eye on
and one that we need to come up with new ways

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.101
to try and detect and, of course, to try and
manage.

00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:03.500
And that’s really, truly difficult.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.780
Right now, kudzu is mostly useless aside from
preventing erosion.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.780
However, the Agricultural Research Service
has shown that kudzu can be turned into a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.840
biofuel.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.340
And in this week’s Photo of the Week, thanks
to the Natural Resources Conservation Service,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.879
oysters are now thriving at the Nisqually
Shellfish Farm, near Belfair, Washington.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.959
The once polluted waters were improved through
successful efforts to prevent sediment and

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.110
nutrient runoff.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.030
The oysters are eaten locally and as far away
as New York City.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.120

photographs.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.110
That’s all for U-S-D-A Week In Review.
