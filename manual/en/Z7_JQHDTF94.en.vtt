00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.290
Welcome back to my Food For All series.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.149
My name is Pippa Kendrick, author of The Intolerant
Gourmet, and in this episode, I'm going to

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:19.050
show you how to make gluten-free and dairy-free
smoky tomato and lentil soup.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.039
So we begin this recipe like all good recipes,
with a chopped onion and some crushed cloves

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.609
of garlic.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.140
We've got tablespoons of olive oil, heated
in a pan, and we are just going to add the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:42.430
onion and garlic, plus quite a generous pinch
of sea salt, and that stops the onion catching.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.079
And then very simply, we are going to fry
those, over a medium-low heat, until completely

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.710
soft and slightly carmelized.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.800
So now that our onions are nice and soft and
lightly carmelized, we are going to add our

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.380
spice, which comes in the form of smoked paprika.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.140
So we add in that, two teaspoons.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.030
For a full list of the ingredients, just check
the description box.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.900
Just make sure that all the onion is coated.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.890
And we're just going to fry it for a minute
like that, and all that does is help bring

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.000
out the flavor of the spice.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.520
Now we add our red lentils to the pan.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.920
These help give the soup both body, but also
really nice creamy texture, once they have

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.100
cooked down with the stock.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.360
And it's the paprika that adds the lovely
smoky element.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.040
And then on top of that, we are going to pour
in a tin, which is about four hundred grams

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.040
of chopped tomato.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.460
And then on top of that, we've got some hot
vegetable stock, and we are going to pour

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.659
that over, stirring as we go.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.060
And then we are going to bring the whole lot
to a simmer, and then we are going to leave

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.219
it to simmer, for about twenty-five minutes.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:07.189
So our smoky tomato and lentil soup has been
simmering gently for 25 minutes, and the lentils

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.180
are really soft, and you'll see that it's
a nice thick and creamy rich soup.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.849
So we've got half a lemon, and we are going
to squeeze the juice into this, and this cuts

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.030
through any heat you might have.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.810
And then, your soup is ready to go.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.200
So we are going to ladle some into a bowl,
about two ladle-fulls per person, works out

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.980
great, and this serves about six to eight.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.610
And then, on top of the nice body of soup,
we're going to put our kind of salsa toppings.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.760
So here we've got some crispy fried chorizo,
we've got chopped tomatoes, we've got coriander,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.440
and we've got fresh avocado.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.410
And all we are going to do, is just pile it
up a little bit on top.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.910
You can do it for each bowl, and you can be
as decorative or as messy as you like.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.150
And then, add some chorizo as well, and you
get this really fresh kind of vibrant salsa,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.620
on top of this nice thick and creamy soup.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.900
It's a really nice combination.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.370

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.079
And I hope to see you again for another recipe
