00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.760
Hi.

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.370
I'm Caitlin Lewis, community outreach
manager for the Humane Society of

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.380
Greater Dayton.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.670
Today, we're going to learn how to
train, or retrain, your cat to use the

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.580
litter box.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.810
Contrary to popular belief, mother cats
do not teach their kittens to use

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.450
the litter box.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.850
Kittens begin to dig in and use dirt and
dry loose material at just a few

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.310
weeks old without ever having observed
their mothers doing so.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.960
This natural instinct is used
in training kittens to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.010
use the litter box.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.770
Until your cat is reliably house
trained, she should not have free run

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.659
of your home.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.720
When you leave the house for any length
of time, your cat should be

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.330
confined to a single room, preferably
one with non-porous floors, such as

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.110
the kitchen, bathroom, utility
room, basement, or garage.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.190
Provide your cat with a bowl of water
and a warm place to sleep at one end

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.490
of the room and a freshly clean
litter box at the other end.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.140
Until the house soiling has been cured,
your cat should have a regular

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.350
feeding schedule so she will develop a
corresponding litter box schedule.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.160
In order to reward your cat for using
her litter box, you must be there at

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.530
the time she uses it.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.930
Most cats, especially kittens, will need
to go shortly after waking, after

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.370
eating, and after exercise.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.340
To help predict when your cat will
go, feed her at regular times.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.710
If the input is on a regular schedule,
the output will follow likewise.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.400
Call her to the litter box from a
variety of places around your house,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.510
especially areas where she has soiled.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.460
When your cat gets to the box, scratch
the litter to get her interested.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.000
Similarly, throughout the day, whenever
your cat has been asleep for

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
over two hours, wake her up and
call her to the litter box.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.950
Encourage your cat to hop into
the litter box and praise her

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.060
when she does so.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.240
Even if she does not go, she's learning
that the litter box is a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.480
great, clean place to be.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.970
If your cat does use it, then praise
her in a gentle voice.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.970
Once she is finished, gently stroke
her, give her a treat, and let her

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.650
know how pleased you are
with her behavior.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.570
If mistakes occur, pick up the cat
and set her down in the box.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.890
Do not discipline just before
placing the cat in the box.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.980
The cat will associate any reprimand
with being placed in the litter box

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.030
and will assume the litter box
is the wrong place to go.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.690
Punishing a cat after the fact teaches
her to be afraid of you.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.680
Never rub your cat's nose in a mess or
bring her over to it for a reprimand.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.630
She will have no idea why she's being
reprimand, but she may be inclined to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.000
eliminate in hidden spots, such
as behind the sofa, to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.580
avoid another reprimand.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.170
Basically, punishment doesn't
work with cats.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.690
Prevention and praise for getting it
right are the keys to training.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.110
Clean any accidents immediately with
half and half solution of white

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.410
vinegar and water.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.790
This will help to eliminate the odor
and hopefully prevent kitty from

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.560
returning to that spot.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.300
Consider covering the area
with a plastic sheet.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.620
This will make it unpleasant for your
kitty and discourage her from going

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.670
there again.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.180
When your cat is still learning to use
the box, leave a tiny bit of urine or

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.940
feces behind in the box.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.530
The scent will remind her
what the box is for.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.230
As soon as she is using the box
reliably, and this could be as quickly

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.420
as a day or two, remove all liquid
and solid waste regularly.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.180
Scoop out solid material once or twice
a day and stir the litter to keep the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.580
surface dry.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.610
If your cat is having trouble using or
finding the litter box, move it to an

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.280
area where she can start
seeing it all the time.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.710
When she stops playing and starts
sniffing or scratching at the floor,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.820
gently place her in the litter box.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.340
If your cat or kitten suddenly stops
using the litter box for no obvious

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.270
reasons, then take your cat to the
veterinarian as soon as possible.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.490
Once your cat gets into the hang of
finding the litter box and using it,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.620
they should have this skill for life.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.270
Now let's recap.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.050
Provide your cat with a clean litter
box that's easy to access.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.280
Get her interested in the litter
box by scratching the litter.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.880
Reward your cat for using her litter
box immediately after she uses it.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.300
And remember, prevention and praise
are the keys to training.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.520
Punishment does not work with cats.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.570
