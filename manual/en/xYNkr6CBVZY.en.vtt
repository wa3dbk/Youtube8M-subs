00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:13.270
The term 'luxury pickup-truck' may seem like
an oxymoron, but when you consider that high-end

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.400
rigs like this are often serving in a multitude
of ways, well the idea makes more sense.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.820
And Chevy is stepping up the Silverado's game
in that regard for 2014.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.770
Consider yourself in the High Country.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.370
SilveradoTo the foreman, names like King Ranch,
Platinum, Laramie, Denali and more recently

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.430
1794 Edition are symbols of superiority.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.480
But until now, Chevy hasn't catered a Silverado
to the boss man.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.540
With a starting price of $49,975, the new
High Country 4-wheel drive comes exclusively

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.270
in the most spacious crew cab bodystyle, here
with the smaller 5'8" box.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.449
2-wheel drive and a 6'6" box are also available.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.279
So what takes the Silverado from LTZ to High
Country?

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:12.219
From the outside, there's a unique chrome
grille, body-color front and rear bumpers

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:18.509
and special 20" chrome wheels with Goodyear
Wrangler SR-A all-season tires.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.170
The interior features exclusive saddle brown
leather seats with High Country logos on the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.090
front headrests.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.549
Luxury features such as halogen projector
headlamps, chrome body trim, a power-sliding

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.659
rear window, heated and cooled front seats,
Chevy MyLink connectivity, Bose premium audio

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.680
and front and rear park assist are standard.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.669
My tester takes that a step further with the
optional High Country Premium Package, adding

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:55.020
the high tech safety features forward collision
alert, lane departure warning and GM's unique

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.750
safety alert seat that vibrates in the specific
direction of danger...just no side blind zone

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.750
alert.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.290
A lukewarm heated steering wheel , multi-zone
heated seats with varying intenisity, power

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.780
adjustable pedals and a trailer brake controller
round out the package offerings.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.659
Dress it up in this gorgeous White Diamond
tricoat paint, add 6" chrome assist steps

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.379
and LED lighting to the cargo box and you've
got my tester.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.209
But the biggest option you can't see is under
here.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.349
Replacing the standard 5.3-liter V8 is the
Silverado's biggest gasoline engine -- the

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:42.079
updated EcoTec3 6.2-liter V8 producing a whopping
420 horsepower and 460 foot-pounds of torque.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:48.909
It's mated to a 6-speed automatic, good for
towing 9,500 pounds with a maximum payload

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.440
of 1,957 pounds.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.420
You'd think it would be all muscle and sound
from behind the wheel, but in fact this Silverado

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.671
drives without any of that sport-truck fanfare,
instead feeling just like the posh truck that

00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:10.900
it is -- very well behaved, easily manageable
and with great cruising ability.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.400
When you lay into the gas pedal the engine
roars and acceleration is brisk, particularly

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.069
for such a big truck but most of the time
the Silverado goes about business with similar

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.870
decorum to a luxury sedan.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.139
As I noted in my GMC Sierra drive last summer,
the Silverado does lean to a slightly truckier

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:37.150
feel both in its ride and drive than say a
Ram 1500 or Toyota Tundra.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.310
And that's OK...it's a truck after all, but
its aforementioned competitors take big truck

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.099
smoothness to an even higher level.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.990
It feels as solid, durable and capable as
any half-ton truck owner would want and by

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.480
using active fuel management, which allows
the V8 to step down to V4 mode, and other

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.269
engine advancements gas mileage is a truck-respectable
14mpg city/20mpg highway though the fuel filler

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.359
cap reminds you that premium gas would be
better.

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.239
The huge rear seats will take on 3 equally
large adults and they split and flip up to

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.130
create more carrying space if needed.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.199
The new tech is really good with OnStar, MyLink
and seemingly a thousand ways to connect your

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.199
gear.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.500
But you may be surprised to see there's no
embedded navigation -- it's an option - just

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.599
OnStar turn-by-turn.

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.850
And though I like the remote start, I expected
smart key operation as well.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:48.150
This 2014 High Country, priced at $55,070,
gives Silverado shoppers another level of

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.479
aspiration.
