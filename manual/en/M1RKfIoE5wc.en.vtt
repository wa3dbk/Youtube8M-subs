00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.210
I'm Fernando we are here with Expert Village
and we are going over setting the control

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.770
for your timer. Now with your timer each timer
is individual and it comes with actual instructions

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.340
if you are not familiar with how to operate
this timer we ask that you seek a electrician

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.529
because there is electrical power and you
would need to know what you are actually doing.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.760
Here you could see the control knobs and each
valve would indicate would have there own

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.699
indicator so what you want to do is you want
to set the timer for the whole lawn at once

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:46.190
and it will facilitate if you set it up for
certain valve to turn on, on certain times

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.610
and for the duration for the actual water
flow. So again it is very important that each

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.220
valve timer is different that you go ahead
and you take the time to read your instructions

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.331
and if you have any questions please call
and hire a professional. Hi I'm Fernando we

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:11.581
are here with Expert Village we are going
over installing a water system and there are

00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:16.780
many items and details that are necessary
for installing a system and before you get

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.220
started the first thing I know you want to
jump in to your dirt put it is very important

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.730
that you actually take the time to plan. Plan
by first of all by calling your department

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.340
water,power, your gas, to have them mark any
areas that your particularly going to cut

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.440
into. The last thing your want to do is cut
a pipe, break a gas line, anything which could

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.250
be potentially dangerous, harmful and even,
costly so by taking a little bit of extra

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.479
time and contacting your city and letting
them know hey I'm thinking about digging a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.229
little bit in my yard and they would send
somebody out to take care of that. I am Fernando

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.780
and you've have been listen and watching Expert
Village.
