Hello and welcome back to Part 2 of Cupcake
Addiction's Giant Cookie Monster Cupcake Tutorial

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.300
where we are learning how to make this very
cute and very popular cupcake in larger than

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.190
life size.
For those of you that were with us in part

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.520
1, we have here our pre-prepared giant cookie,
two-thirds of, and we have our pre-prepared

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:38.900
giant Cookie Monster eyes.
We also have our pre-colored blue coconut

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.900
Cookie Monster fur.
We have a batch of our buttercream frosting

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.461
colored in blue, use approximately 3 cap fulls
of blue food coloring to color that. If you

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:58.640
are having trouble with your buttercream frosting,
we have a tutorial on how to make the perfect

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.370
buttercream frosting so feel free to check
that out.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.890
I also have here my giant cupcake. If you're
not familiar with baking giant cupcakes, you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.859
can check out our Giant Cupcake Basics Series
which will show you how to make this lovely

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.920
chocolate patty pan, as well as how to bake
your cupcake, how to layer it with frosting

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.820
and how to get it to this stage with a lovely
crumb coat ready for frosting.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.890
Alright, let's get started.
Firstly, because Cookie Monster is not quite

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.130
as high in the middle as a lot of our other
cupcakes, I'm going to shave off this section

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.950
of the top of the dome, just so it's not a
pointy top.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:51.740
I've just used a serrated edge knife for that.
Serrated edges are always better when you're

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.650
trying to cut through a pre-made cake.
I'm going to take my spatula and I'm going

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.319
to take my lovely blue buttercream frosting.
I'm going to use a spatula to apply this because

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.840
the spatula is a tool that most of you will
have at home.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.230
I also have here my handy pallet knife, which
is another good option for applying frosting.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.650
If you don't have a pallet knife -- a pallet
knife is a great starter tool for any cake

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.349
decorator and it will help you to get a bit
of a smoother finish. But like I've said,

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.780
I'm trying to work with what everybody should
have in their kitchen drawer so we're going

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.570
to use a spatula.
I'm going to scoop off some good quantities

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.200
of that buttercream frosting. And you'll see
that consistency; it is quite firm, very spoon-able,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.219
and very scoop-able.
Now I've got my cupcake on a Lazy Susan, otherwise

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.489
you can use a cake decorating turn table.
You do want something that's going to allow

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.340
you to spin.
I'm going to put my spatula on its side as

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.720
you can see. And I'm just going to spin the
table as I smear lovely big globs of this

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:30.670
frosting on.
You will notice, as I'm spreading, I'm using

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.560
a back and forth motion just to make sure
that I work that icing into any of the little

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.549
cracks that we might have in between that
top layer of cupcake and the patty pan. Make

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:54.379
sure we got a nice even coat.
Now we don't have to be too neat with that

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.349
frosting. You want to get it reasonably smooth.
But see how it is still quite rough around

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.319
the edges, that's not a problem because we're
going to cover that in coconut.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.969
I will take the back edge of that serrated
knife that I used earlier. And I'm just going

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.079
to run it along the edges to remove any excess
buttercream from around the top of that patty

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:27.200
pan.
Now as quickly as you can, you want to get

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.840
your coconut fur on there because as soon
the air hits the buttercream, it will start

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.870
to dry. I'm just going to sprinkle the coconut
on top. This can be quite messy as you can

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.951
see.
And we've made quite a bit of the coconut.

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:47.890
Coconut is not expensive but you definitely
don't want to have too little, you'd rather

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.100
have too much.
So when you get to the sides, pop some in

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.840
your hand and just lay it up against the side
of the cupcake. That frosting will allow it

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:25.220
to stick.
Now I'm just patting that around the top and

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.250
just using the palm of your hand. And you
just want to mold that into a nice rounded

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:37.090
surface. That's just going to force that coconut
to stick a little bit better.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:48.410
(Now for a quick tidy up)
As you can see, we've now got our lovely even

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:56.220
coat of coconut fur on our lovely blue buttercream
frosting awaiting the finishing touches.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.430
I'm taking our cookie and our eyes as I showed
you earlier. And I'm also going to take a

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.850
bread knife with a serrated edge. I'm going
to make an incision about the width of the

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.550
cookie, about 10 centimeters into the head
down in an angle. I'm going to support the

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.750
back of the patty pan with my other hand,
just to make sure that the cupcake doesn't

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:30.770
move.
Now, while that knife is still in there, I'm

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:36.750
just going to use it to lift that head just
a fraction. I'm going to take my cookie and

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.840
I'm just going to pop it in there, just a
little bit of the way and remove my knife.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:49.530
Put that to the side, now, still supporting
the back of the giant patty pan, I'm just

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:56.290
going to slowly work that cookie into the
head. This is quite a delicate part of the

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:02.220
process as you don't want to push that cookie
too far and take any part of his head off.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.050
There you have your cookie in Cookie Monster's
mouth.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:16.880
Finally, we'll pop his eyes in. Now Cookie
Monster's eyes are never looking in the same

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.720
direction. They're always going off into space
looking for cookies. Now you'll see that I'm

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.530
actually applying quite a bit of pressure
to make sure that I get them all the way into

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:34.120
the frosting there. Lovely! One pointed down
and this other one pointed right up. I'm actually

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.750
pushing them probably about a centimeter into
the cupcake.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:52.810
And there you have your Cookie Monster cupcake.
Here we have a little bit of a size comparison,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:59.410
the giant Cookie Monster cupcake in comparison
to your regular-sized Cookie Monster cupcake.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.860
I think you'll agree they look absolutely
gorgeous together.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.810
Thank you for watching Cupcake Addiction's
Giant Cookie Monster Cupcake Tutorial.
