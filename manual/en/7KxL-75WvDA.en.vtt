00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.440
Hi!

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.800
in this Episode we want to show you
how to fire your fireworks electronically.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.500
Here is what we need,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.060
how it works,
and what we have to think of.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.319
But why do we want
to fire electronically?

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.419
First of all
because of safety reasons!

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.609
At the time we ignite
our fireworks

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.049
we are out of the danger zone
and don’t have to get close

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:27.589
with a lighter or match.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.149
There is a second reason,
it is more convenient.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.120
We can set up the fireworks during daytime,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.960
and fire them conveniently
at nighttime.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.420
Another advantage is,
that we can set up set up more effects

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.480
next to each other
- e.g. several meters -

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.680
and ignite them at once.
That wouldn’t be possible

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.460
with a lighter or match.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.370
For the advanced pyrotechnicians
there is another advantage.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.690
We ca combine our fireworks
with music.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.160
What do we need to 
ignite electronically?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.560
Three items: a firing system
consisting of transmitter and receiver

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.660
and some e-matches.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.890
Let me show you a low priced
firing system for starters:

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.130
The AlphaFire system.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.900
A remote control
for 12 cues.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.960
and the receivers:

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.980
one type for 1 cue

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.720
and another for 12 cues.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.550
We’ll explain the advantages
of each model in another video

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.470
Here is a model for 
more experienced pyrotechnicians:

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.720
the Cobra firing system.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.640
The ignition timing for 
complete shows can be stored

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.980
we can use several receivers

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.700
and control the music with
the „Cobra Audiobox“.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.080
We also need e-matches

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.400
In contrast to the firing system,
e-matches are throw-away products.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.990
This is an e-match.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.910
It is a pyrotechnic item
and ignites from current pulse.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.580
This is an ignitor clip.
That’s not a pyrotechnic item.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.960
A glow wire is heated by current,
which ignites the fuse.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.010
The ignitor is clipped
on the fuse.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.440
Let me show you
in action:

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.249
We clip the ignitor on the fuse
of this volcano.

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.959
We put the other end of the wire
in our receiver.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.449
When I press the button on the remote
an impulse is sent to the receiver,

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:21.000
the glow wire heats up
and ignites the fuse,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which ignites the volcano.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.739
That was an overview
how we fire electronically.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.990
In the next episode we show you

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.639
the starter firing system
„AlphaFire“ and how it works.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.329
On the left you’ll find a menu
where you can select an episode.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.869
Subscribe our channel
and keep up to date.

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:49.389
We’d like to hear from you 
in the comment section

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.729
how we can improve our videos.

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:55.799
Please also note the
video description.

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.000
There you’ll find useful links.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.760
Thanks
and stay save!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.120
We hope the subtitles work out, please give us feedback on that as well.
