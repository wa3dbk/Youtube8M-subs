After listening to Kang Min commentator's practice speech for the closing, Faker claps to the speech as if it's on air.

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.779
The best~

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:19.655

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:40.549
During a short break time, Faker and Hyunwoo strengthened their friendship by adding each other's ID.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.765
You ARE the general!

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:50.765
Kang Min : Look at him~ He always wears like this. He wears layers even in the summer. Maybe it's relief that he isn't wearing a parka.

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:54.915
Faker : Generals always wear armors.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:59.842
For "General" Dade, armor is a must item!

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:04.617

Staff : You guys aren't close!

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.033

Faker : Huh? What's this?

00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:27.044
Kang Min : Why are you asking Dade for a carry!
Hyunwoo : Maybe I can carry him.

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:30.490
Kang Min : How can "you" carry Dade?

Stand By~

00:02:55.585 --> 00:03:01.442
