00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.066
I&amp;apos;ll do that Draven...

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.000
Challenge accepted!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Featuring: AP Teemo as MaDDz and Shen as GohanCZ
Recorded by LeeSin (thanks!) played by SpooTo 

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:24.033
Some poking and pushing on mid while Teemo farms top...
Eventually they decide to towerdive to get a few kills, but...

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:33.033
A wild botlane appears!

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:50.000
The enemy team gets 4 kills by being 4v5 in that teamfight - 
Teemo was very busy farming top in the meantime...

00:00:51.066 --> 00:01:00.000
But wait! There he comes for a cleanup... Lets see what he can 
do 1v5

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.033
And for the end: how teemo started getting fed

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:43.000
And for the end: how teemo started getting fed
and what not to do with 30 magic resist vs a AP teemo.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.033
Securing a kill and then leaving the next kill to the AD carry...
like a real support!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.066
Securing a kill and then leaving the next kill to the AD carry...
like a real support!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.066
Revenge for what you did to Teemo before Cait... or not?
