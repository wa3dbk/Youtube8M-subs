Hi, my name is Lanie Evans, and on behalf
of Expert Village, I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.049
to make an Origami paper cup for Valentine's
Day so you can fill it with your favorite

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:16.600
treats. Let's get started. Here I've taken
some holiday wrapping paper. I like this,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.540
you can spend money on a more expensive origami
paper, but I think wrapping paper's a lot

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.930
of fun, magazine paper also works really well.
You're going to start out by making a square,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.470
here I have a rectangle. To make a square,
fold the triangle and then you're just simply

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:43.300
going to cut this piece off to begin, you're
looking for that right angle. Now once I have

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.940
this, actually we're half way done, take this
point here and then you're going to fold it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.781
over to where this point meets the middle
of this line. So put your fingers down here

00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:03.309
as you do that to stop the paper if you need
to, actually I guess it's going to come up

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:11.820
a little bit. You want this line level, or
just like that. Now this point is going to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:24.690
come and meet this point here, just like that.
Press down here and then get your creases.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:33.600
And now I am going to peel down and this will
hold the paper in place. Turn it over and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.840
pull it down until it stops, and crease it.
To open your cup put in your finger here and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.700
press and then you can fill it with your favorite
treats. You can use sweethearts, small candies,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.210
foam hearts, stickers, these make great little
gifts.
