00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.800
So, did you just recently get your wisdom
teeth pulled? Well, my name's Michelle, and

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.680
I'm a Dental Assistant with Solutionz, and
I'm going to explain to you on how you can

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.639
survive getting your wisdom teeth pulled.
There are several different ways. Mainly,

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.400
you want to make sure that you take the medication
that your dentist prescribed to you after

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.640
your extractions, if he prescribes you medication.
You want to take that on a regular basis as

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.279
directed on the prescription. You also want
to make sure that you are keeping the area

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.829
good and clean from debris; that you're not
packing any food down in the area. You want

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.020
to make sure that you are rinsing your mouth
out constantly with Listerine or any type

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.150
of mouth rinse and antiseptic rinse. Also
too, another great method is that you can

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.809
rinse your mouth out with warm salt water.
That will help with discomfort that you're

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.809
having from your wisdom teeth extractions.
It will also help reduce the swelling of the,

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.780
of your gum tissue, and the area of your extractions.
Applying ice after the extractions is great.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.920
It's a great form and way on reducing the
swelling. You mainly, a great way to apply

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.700
ice is you're going to want to apply it once
every thirty minutes. You apply it; place

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.439
it on the area for thirty minutes, and then
take it off for about five to ten minutes,

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.670
and then do it again. And you want to continuously
do that for at least like the first two to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.979
three hours after you have your wisdom teeth
extracted, in conjunction with taking the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.200
pain medication and any antibiotics that maybe
your doctor prescribed to you. If he did not

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.149
prescribe any medication to you, you can go
and purchase over-the-counter pain meds, as

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:54.180
far as Advil, Tylenol, Ibuprofen. Ibuprofen
and Advil are a great way because they have,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.980
it's an inflammation, it's anti-inflammatory,
so it'll help with any inflammation that you

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.060
may have from the extractions, but mainly,
those are the great ways on how to survive

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.229
a wisdom tooth extraction. And once again,
my name's Michelle, and I'm a Dental Assistant

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.560
with Solutionz, and I just explained to you
on how you can survive a wisdom tooth extraction,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.390
so good luck.
