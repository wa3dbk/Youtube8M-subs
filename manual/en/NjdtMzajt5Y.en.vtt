Hi, my name is Eric, and thank you for joining
us here at Watch Your Style.

00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:19.934
Today I want to go over some simple steps
on how to wind your Rolex and set the date

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:21.414
and time.

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:24.904
Alright, let's start off with the Submariner
and the Datejust II.

00:00:24.904 --> 00:00:29.594
Both of these watches are going to take the
same technique to wind up and to set the date

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:30.324
and time.

00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:35.334
To set the time on the Rolex Submariner, it's
very simple. A couple of easy steps will make

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.194
it happen.

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:43.014
Now...the same procedure is going to be used
for a Datejust, both 41mm and 36mm and the

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:44.244
Yacht-Master I.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:47.154
The first thing you want to do is unscrew
the crown.

00:00:47.154 --> 00:00:53.834
Now, turning the crown backwards or counterclockwise...like
this, a couple of turns...and it's gonna pop

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:54.973
out open.

00:00:54.973 --> 00:00:58.154
This is now in the winding position.

00:00:58.154 --> 00:01:02.724
If the watch has been sitting for a while
and has no winding, you gonna have to wind

00:01:02.724 --> 00:01:05.594
the mechanism up to tension the spring.

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:09.834
Two fingers is always the best way to do it,
so you don't put unnecessary stress with one

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:10.444
finger.

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:12.834
Two fingers, you're going to do 15.

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:19.154
One, two...you see, one time up is what I
call one, so 15 of these will be more than

00:01:19.154 --> 00:01:20.904
enough to wind it up correctly.

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:23.813
From that point the automatic function will
take over.

00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:28.283
A lot of questions are...can I wind my watch
if it goes backwards.

00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:33.934
When you turn this backwards or counterclockwise,
it does not do anything.

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:39.324
Only when you turn it forward or clockwise
is when it winds. You'll feel the tension

00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:42.913
on the crown and you'll hear it as well.

00:01:42.913 --> 00:01:46.264
Once that's already done, the next step is
let's go ahead and set the date.

00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:51.993
Move the crown out one more...one more click
out and you get the date function.

00:01:51.993 --> 00:01:57.463
Again, if you turn the crown backwards or
counterclockwise, it doesn't do anything.

00:01:57.463 --> 00:01:59.834
You gotta go forward or clockwise.

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:06.214
We'll go ahead and sets this to say the 30th.
Right there.

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:08.694
Now it's time to set the time.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:13.214
Now, one click out...now we're gonna set the
time.

00:02:13.214 --> 00:02:20.214
We're gonna ahead and turn it, put whatever
time you need...let's just say 8:30, like

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.964
so.

00:02:22.964 --> 00:02:28.473
Push the crown all the way in. Now you're
gonna have to put a little bit of pressure

00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:33.473
in just to get started. Once it catches on
the threads, we're gonna go ahead and screw

00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:35.524
it all the way down.

00:02:35.524 --> 00:02:38.564
Remember not to over-tighten it. Just leave
it snug.

00:02:38.564 --> 00:02:42.973
And that's some quick simple steps on how
to set the time and the date.

00:02:42.973 --> 00:02:45.833
The next model to discuss is the Rolex Daytona.

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:49.404
Very similar to the previous ones, except
that it's a lot simpler because it doesn't

00:02:49.404 --> 00:02:50.514
have a date function.

00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:55.234
So it's very straightforward, just wind up
the mechanism and set the time.

00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:59.863
Now, to stay the Daytona, it's very simple
and straightforward.

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:03.764
All it requires is..we're gonna unscrew the
crown.

00:03:03.764 --> 00:03:08.234
To unscrew the crown we're gonna turn it backwards
or counterclockwise.

00:03:08.234 --> 00:03:12.994
A few turns and it's gonna free up and pop
out.

00:03:12.994 --> 00:03:15.423
Once it pops out, we're in the winding position.

00:03:15.423 --> 00:03:19.384
And remember although it's automatic, it still
needs to be would up after it has been sitting

00:03:19.384 --> 00:03:23.003
in the safe for a little a while.

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:26.673
We're gonna go ahead and we're going to turn
this forward or clockwise.

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:31.693
Two fingers on the crown at all times is gonna
help save any stress on the mechanism through

00:03:31.693 --> 00:03:37.214
the stem. Fifteen turns is more then plenty
to get it going. From that point, the automatic

00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:39.193
function will take over.

00:03:39.193 --> 00:03:43.503
Once we have it wound up, we're gonna go ahead
and pop the crown out...one click, like so.

00:03:43.503 --> 00:03:47.934
Remember not to force it. Take your time,
move it out.

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:54.934
When you turn the crown forward or clockwise,
the obvious hands move clockwise.

00:03:55.164 --> 00:04:00.794
When you turn it backwards or counterclockwise,
we get the same effect on the dial.

00:04:00.794 --> 00:04:07.794
We're gonna go ahead and we're gonna set this,
just to an example...2:30, like so.

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:12.774
Now, once we're done, we're getting ready
to seal the crown...push it in right there

00:04:12.774 --> 00:04:17.974
first click, now to seal, again, just like
the Submariner, you push it and turn a little

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:24.514
bit, then just go ahead and turn it forward
or clockwise on the crown until it feels snug.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.894
No need to over tighten it.

00:04:26.894 --> 00:04:30.224
And that's it for the Daytona.

00:04:30.224 --> 00:04:34.424
And last but not least, we have the GMT.

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:38.414
Very similar overall, except that it has one
more extra timezone we have to adjust.

00:04:38.414 --> 00:04:42.924
I'm going to over it through step by step
on how to adjust the GMT.

00:04:42.924 --> 00:04:45.924
The GMT Master II is very similar to the previous
watches.

00:04:45.924 --> 00:04:49.954
It just has a little bit of an extra function
because of the dual time feature.

00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:55.044
Dual time is gonna be indicated by that blue
arrow right there.

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:59.834
So let's start with the same steps as before.
We're gonna unscrew the crown backwards or

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:03.774
counterclockwise to open up the crown...right
there.

00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:08.234
Again, if it has been sitting in the same
for a couple of weeks, months, what not. We're

00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:12.074
gonna go ahead and we're gonna wind it forward
or clockwise.

00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:15.524
Two fingers again. Fifteen turns is more than
enough.

00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:22.524
Now, I like to set the GMT by opening the
crown all the way to the last position. The

00:05:24.364 --> 00:05:28.964
last one, remember not to force it. To the
last position where I can move the minute

00:05:28.964 --> 00:05:30.144
hands.

00:05:30.144 --> 00:05:35.484
As you can see as I move the minute hands,
we're gonna only really focus on the blue

00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:36.184
arrow.

00:05:36.184 --> 00:05:42.644
Now, since this is a dual timezone, let's
go ahead and keep turning this thing and let's

00:05:42.644 --> 00:05:49.644
put that blue arrow for an example only at
10:00, for the 10-hour in a different time

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.844
zone. Let's put it exactly at 10:00 like so.

00:05:56.844 --> 00:06:03.844
Now, now I like to do the regular hour we
have here.

00:06:03.914 --> 00:06:09.584
We're gonna go ahead and set this one to 11:00,
like so.

00:06:09.584 --> 00:06:13.334
But to set the date, you wanna keep going
on this one.

00:06:13.334 --> 00:06:19.324
You see, on the GMT, you don't have a quick
set for the date function.

00:06:19.324 --> 00:06:22.224
You gotta use the hour hand, so we're gonna
keep turning it.

00:06:22.224 --> 00:06:27.954
Now remember, when you do this GMT and you
turn this hour, try not to go too fast, because

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:32.674
it will cause some premature damage to the
mechanism. Believe me, I had it happen to

00:06:32.674 --> 00:06:33.734
myself.

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:40.604
So we're gonna go just nice and smooth around,
so we're around 15, an example for a date.

00:06:40.604 --> 00:06:47.604
And like I was telling you earlier, we're
gonna put it at 11 o'clock. And you find an

00:06:47.614 --> 00:06:54.314
adjustment that needs to be done, we can go
ahead and pop right back out, like so, and

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:55.534
we're set.

00:06:55.534 --> 00:07:02.494
Same procedure, push the crown a little bit
in. Turn it forward or clockwise to seal,

00:07:02.494 --> 00:07:07.504
and never over-tighten the crown. Just make
sure it's snug. And that's how you set up

00:07:07.504 --> 00:07:07.844
the GMT.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:14.844
So right now we have two timezones set up.
We have 11 o'clock and 10 o'clock. And that's

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:19.584
how you set up the GMT.

00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:25.394
