How to Clean Leeks. In the event that you
know what a leek is, and actually happen to

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:17.950
have one, here’s how to clean it. You will
need Leeks Sharp knife Cutting board Sink

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:27.119
And paper towels and medium bowl. Step 1.
Pull off the tough outer leaves of the leek.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.610
Step 2. Grasp the knife in your dominant hand,
holding the handle close to the blade with

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.489
three fingers (middle, ring, and pinkie).
Curl your forefinger around one side of the

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.360
blade while holding your thumb on the opposite
side. Step 3. With your non-knife-wielding

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.450
hand, hold the leek firmly on the cutting
board close to the area you will cut. Step

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.789
4. Cut off the top dark green part of the
leek and discard. You only use the white and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.929
very light green part of the leek. For recipes
that require whole leeks, cut off ¼” from

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:07.980
the root end and slice the leek in half lengthwise.
Step 5. Leeks can be very sandy. Hold the

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.990
leek halves under running water to remove
the dirt. Gently pull apart the layers to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.500
remove hidden dirt and sand. If you prefer
to leave the leeks whole, slice through the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.110
leek lengthwise but do not cut all the way
through or they will fall apart. Gently open

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.009
the leek under running water to thoroughly
remove all the dirt. Step 6. For recipes that

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.450
require rounds of leek, slice ½” from the
bottom and discard. Chop the leek in rounds

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.259
and submerge the pieces in a sink or bowl
water. Gently pry the layers to let water

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.340
get between them, but don’t pull them apart
completely. Step 7. Dry the whole, half, or

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.020
sliced leek round on a paper towel. Start
cooking. Did you know The leek has been the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.689
national symbol of Wales since the 6th century,
when Welsh warriors wore them on their helmets

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.460
to identify each other from their enemies.
