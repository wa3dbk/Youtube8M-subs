00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.920
Hi I'm Luke from Audient

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.960
and today I'm going to show you the ASP 880 8 channel mic pre and A-D converter.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.120
So if you're looking to improve the quality of your front end

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.980
by adding high-quality mic pres and converters,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.460
the ASP880 is the perfect product for you.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.460
ASP880 has 8 of our class A mic pres, 8 
line inputs and a couple of JFET inputs

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.410
for plugging in electric guitars and basses

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.880
The mic pres compare with products that are three or four times the price

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.720
and are used by many professionals around the world, recording all sorts of styles of music.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.060
They have just enough colour to 
add some character to the sound,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.260
whilst retaining the accuracy required to reproduce the original audio source.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.940
On the output side of things the ASP880

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.940
has 8 line outputs, it has 8 AES 
outputs and it has 8 ADAT outputs

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.820
It's these ADAT outputs that most 
people will use to connect their interface,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.240
In fact that's exactly what we're showing here.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.020
We have an ASP880 connected 
via ADAT to our interface, the iD22.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.860
This particular setup would give you 
ten inputs into your computer.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.240
We use the latest high-performance converter chips,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.420
so the ASP880 competes with the 
very best converters out there.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.140
Each channel has a balanced insert so you can insert your favorite compressor or EQ.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.480
and by pressing the AD button on the front panel

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.120
ASP880 effectively becomes an 8-channel mic pre with a standalone AD converter.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.119
There is a variable impedance switch 
on each channel which allows you

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.099
to match the impedance to 
your favorite ribbon microphone,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.840
or change the tone of any microphone.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.590
There's also a variable high-pass filter which allows you to tune out unwanted low frequencies or Rumble.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.800
If you're looking for high-quality 
front end to your interface,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.300
Then the ASP880 is set to impress.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.120
It has Audient's class A mic pres, it has the best converters around and it has inserts on each channel.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.680
and variable impedance. All at a great price.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.300
