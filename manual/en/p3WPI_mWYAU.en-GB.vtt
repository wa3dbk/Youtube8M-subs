00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
At the Y we want to get kids more active

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in safe and simple ways so that they can have a happier, healthier future.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.800
And what better time to get active than during National Children’s Week!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We put our heads together and came up with a plan. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We grabbed some chalk, found some willing kids at Dinjerra Primary School 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.533
and sure enough Chalk it up! was born.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So let's go... let’s go chalk it up.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It’s all part of YMCA Active Kids and promoting easy, safe and fun games that everyone can play! 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.900
Some of the chalk games can really work up a sweat! 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It’s a great way for kids to use their imagination, and create games together. The opportunities are endless.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.900
"I like to play outside because I get to play with all my friends."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.900
"I like playing outside because I can't really play ballgames inside."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You don’t need much outdoor space and the possibilities are endless. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
With Chalk it Up! school aged children can be healthier, happier and more active. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Do it anywhere, in the school playground, on footpaths, in your backyard at home - anywhere!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
"My favourite chalk game today has been Y ball because it really helped me out with my netball skills."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
"Today, I played downball with the chalk and Bullseye."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
"I think it's a good idea to play the chalk games cos you can be creative... you can be imaginative."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
With the Y, kids can turn small inspirations into big possibilities.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Thanks so much to Dinjerra Primary School students and staff for chalking it up with the YMCA Active Kids.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So go on, get out there - draw your play.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.000
Chalk it up!
