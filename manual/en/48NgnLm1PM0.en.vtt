00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.320
Flat Substrate Application

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.960
At some point in time you are going to run
into a situation where you are going to have

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.020
to lay out a large graphic by hand onto a
flat substrate.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.869
When using the proper tools, and the advent
of air egress vinyl, it is going to make your

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.990
life so much easier.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.050
The substrate used in this demonstration is
a big aluminum panel â€“ one of the most aggressive

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.730
surfaces on which to lay a graphic.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.070
Before beginning the application, make sure
your graphic is the proper size for your substrate,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.530
including a little extra on all edges for
trimming.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.199
To begin, wipe down the substrate with a clean
rag and a little isopropyl alcohol.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.989
It is important to make sure that your substrate,
graphic and work area remain clean.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.660
Place a few small pieces of double sided tape
on the back side of the panel to keep it from

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.690
moving while laying out the graphic.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.210
The key to a smooth application is exposing
the minimum amount of adhesive necessary,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.820
so that you are in control of the application
at all times.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.869
Use a backslitting tool, such as the bodyguard
knife, to make two slits along the center

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.780
of the liner, about one inch apart.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.330
This tool slits only the liner, leaving the
graphic intact.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.710
Secure the graphic on one end, then loosely
fold it in the center, and expose the one

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.560
inch wide strip of adhesive.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.920
For best results with air egress vinyl, we
recommend using a squeegee with a felt edge.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.500
Holding the vinyl up from the substrate, carefully
apply the one inch center strip.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.630
Fold back one half of the graphic, and release
a portion of the liner.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.420
Make a sharp crease in the liner to create
a handle.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.680
That allows you to control the exposure of
adhesive.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.260
Work your squeegee from the middle of the
graphic to the end you are holding.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.830
Continue to release more liner as your application
progresses.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.600
Apply the other part of the graphic, using
the same technique.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.260
Air egress vinyl makes it easy to work out
any remaining wrinkles and air pockets.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.940
Once this is done, trim the edges and the
application is complete.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.870
Now with air egress vinyl and the back-slitter,
your days of struggling with vinyl are over.
