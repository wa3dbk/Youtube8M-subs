- We're gonna play a game.

00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.400
First let's bring down
two people from the audience.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.066
Where are Vicki Cho
and Hannah Wimberley?

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.466
All right,
we're gonna play a game,

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.133
and it's called
Stuff Your Cups.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.133

- Now push it

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.600
[hip-hop music]

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.566
Push it good

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.866
Push it

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.333
Push it real good

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.966
Push it

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.966
Push it good

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.033
Push it

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.500
Pu-push it real good

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.633
- So here's what's
gonna happen.

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:27.200
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.300
Halle and I are gonna put on
her dream bra,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.000
and we're gonna step
into the cash machine.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.333
We have 30 seconds to grab
as much cash as we can,

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.800
stuff it into our bras,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.133
and whoever
gets the most money--

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.333
Whatever we get,
we're gonna--

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.833
we're gonna share.

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:41.766
So...

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.766
Thank you very much.

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.766
[cheers and applause]

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.433
- Okay.
- All right.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.000
- Ellen, I just hope
I don't hurt you in there.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.466
- You're not gonna hurt me.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.933
I hope I don't hurt you.
All right.

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.166
The money's
gonna fly around.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.400
If you want
to put these on...

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.966
Let's get in there,
and so...

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.366
- Okay.
- Oh, wait.

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:08.233
Who are we playing for,
Vicki or Hannah?

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:09.333
- I'll play for Vicki.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.000
- All right,
I'll play for Hannah.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
All right.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
[cheers and applause]

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:17.700
All right.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.200
- [laughs]

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.833
- Turn it on!

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:22.266
[air rushing]

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.266
[cheers and applause]

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:33.366
[frantic music]

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.766
My bra's
not big enough!

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.300
Won't hold all my money.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:51.366
[frantic music]

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:57.166
[cheers and applause]

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.466
- Hey!

00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:00.366
You're not supposed
to stuff it in your pants!

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:03.333
[laughs]

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.100
- All right.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.300
- You cheated.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.933
[laughing]

00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.033
- All right.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.400
[cheers and applause]

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.033
- That's not fair.
- Well...

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:16.933
- You look great.
- Thank you.

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:19.200
We don't--
there was $5,000 in there,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.633
and we don't have time
to count it up,

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:22.166
so we're just gonna
split it evenly.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:23.933
Each of you get $2,500.

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:26.933
[cheers and applause]

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.666
