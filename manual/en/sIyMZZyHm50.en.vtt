00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
- We're going to call this
what, Dumpling Ding Dong?

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.626
- [Steven] We're not calling
this Dumpling Ding Dong.

00:00:03.626 --> 00:00:05.180
- We're not gonna call
this Dumpling Ding Dong?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.010
- [Steven] No.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.220
- Ahhh

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.720
- [Voiceover] Three, two, one.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.090
- Live and direct from Hollywood,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.304
we're back at it again.

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:15.730
- We're gonna try to
find the best dumplings,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.200
the best soup dumplings
in all of Los Angeles

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.320
- We're gonna play dumpling telephone.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.310
- Where we go to different
dumpling houses...

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.370
- [Steven] And then ask them.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.771
- [Freddie] Where they
like to eat dumplings?

00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:26.370
- And that will lead us
to another restaurant.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.471
- Until we, ourselves,
are giant soup dumplings.

00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:31.230
- I'm expecting to be really full

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.540
'cause I'm a monster.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.650
- I, have never really
had a dumpling before,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.410
I don't really know what to
expect but I'm starving and I'm

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.020
stoked and Steven's gonna be
our connoisseur for the day.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.310
- Rubric, what are we doing for rubric?

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.550
- Broth, dough, how nice the pleats look.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.621
- Meat tenderness!

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:45.690
- There's one obvious
choice that we should go to.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.640
- Start with the Mecca and end at the...

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.720
VOWherever they take us.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.762
- We're going to a place
called Din Tai Fung.

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:52.352
So this is the first stop on the

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.272
dumpling ding dong adventure.

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:56.682
- [Steven] Dumpling telephone!

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:58.062
You guys want any beverages?

00:00:58.062 --> 00:00:59.112
Freddie have you ever had Boba?

00:00:59.112 --> 00:00:59.803
- [Freddie] I have not.

00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:02.664
- No! Boba's one of my favorite things.

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:04.322
They're like individual, little

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:05.772
like testicles in your mouth.

00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:08.872
- This is ridiculous,
Boba is not testicles!

00:01:08.872 --> 00:01:09.822
(laughter)
- I'm scared.

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:11.622
- Just go with it, let
it flow, let it happen.

00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:13.602
- I'm all like, what's the
purpose of these things?

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:14.742
(scoffs)
I like the tea.

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:16.002
- Okay, alright, it's a start.

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:17.572
- So here we have our sauces.

00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:19.976
This is gonna be a house-made
vinegar and a soy sauce.

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:21.702
Normally we recommend,
for an optimal taste,

00:01:21.702 --> 00:01:24.292
it's going to be three parts
vinegar and one part soy sauce.

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.592
- [Steven] We should definitely
compare, the pork between

00:01:26.592 --> 00:01:28.342
different establishments,
that's like the classic one.

00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:29.642
- Is that the standard soup dumpling?

00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:30.702
- Standard soup dumpling.

00:01:31.392 --> 00:01:34.812
- Mmm, whoa!
(laughter)

00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:36.642
It's like, a little, baby,

00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:39.812
mini soup, in one bite, whoa!

00:01:39.812 --> 00:01:41.192
- When you eat the soup dumplings,

00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:42.692
many people will do different things.

00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:44.122
- I kinda just take a little nibble,

00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:46.592
out of the side, pour out the soup,

00:01:46.592 --> 00:01:48.732
drink it, and eat the dumpling after.

00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:50.664
Feel free to do it however you'd like.

00:01:51.214 --> 00:01:52.402
- [Colin] Let's see, I'm gonna use

00:01:52.402 --> 00:01:54.342
Steve's bite a hole in it method

00:01:54.342 --> 00:01:55.992
which I'm very suspect of.

00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:58.192
De-juicing, the soup dumpling,

00:01:58.192 --> 00:02:03.012
dipping in the vin, holy (loud bleep)!

00:02:03.712 --> 00:02:05.502
- It's such a fun activity food.

00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:08.862
The soup is just so
good, it's just so good.

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.352
- The skin thinness allows me to

00:02:10.352 --> 00:02:11.682
really enjoy the meat and the soup.

00:02:11.682 --> 00:02:12.972
For the truffle dumplings, I do recommend

00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:15.692
that you cleanse your pallet
first, and then don't use any

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:17.865
dipping sauce for it, to
get the full taste, okay?

00:02:17.872 --> 00:02:19.272
- [Colin] Mmmm, okay.
- [Andrew] There it is.

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:21.510
- I'm so happy!

00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:22.897
- [Colin] Ohhhh!

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:24.502
- There's the truffle, okay, bye!

00:02:24.502 --> 00:02:27.342
It's crazy, that, this is a real food.

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:29.557
- That was like, an
out of body experience.

00:02:29.557 --> 00:02:31.342
- Very umami, I felt like

00:02:31.342 --> 00:02:33.031
a hobbit, putting that in my mouth.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:34.177
- [Andrew] Yeah, definitely.

00:02:34.707 --> 00:02:35.945
- [Andrew] What are those Steve?

00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:37.697
- Yeah, what's happening?

00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:41.765
- [Andrew] Where do we go from here guys?

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:43.665
- Din Tai Fung is like
the obvious choice, but,

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:45.485
if you were not to eat
soup dumplings here,

00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:46.695
where would you eat?

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:48.265
- It's probably gonna
have to be Mama Lu's.

00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:50.485
- [Andrew] What kind of
occasion sends you to Mama Lu's?

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:51.625
Like, when do you go there?

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:53.505
- When the line is too
long here. (laughter)

00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:55.250
- So, the next spot we're headed to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.581
is called Mama Lu's.

00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:58.058
- [Colin] Mama Lu's, get a dumpling,

00:02:58.058 --> 00:02:59.708
eat it, do whatever you want.

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:01.678
- Din Tai Fung is like come here,

00:03:01.678 --> 00:03:03.538
eat the dumpling, get out,

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:05.171
more people need dumplings.

00:03:07.148 --> 00:03:08.328
- So here they call them

00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:11.268
juicy pork dumplings, which
I think is a better name.

00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:13.822
Call me American, but I would

00:03:13.822 --> 00:03:15.762
like a larger meat quantity.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.672
- We ordered my fried coconut buns

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:20.305
so I am satisfied.

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:22.982
- [Colin] Oh look at you, you
got it all over your face.

00:03:22.982 --> 00:03:24.342
- [Steven] This is what you wanted Colin.

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:25.252
- [Colin] Is that the beef roll?

00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:26.802
- [Steven] I didn't order
it, they just gave it to us.

00:03:26.802 --> 00:03:27.842
- [Colin] So much meat.

00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:29.072
- [Steven] Chinese people have mastered,

00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:30.392
the art of buns.

00:03:30.392 --> 00:03:32.142
- I know a couple things
about the art of buns,

00:03:32.142 --> 00:03:34.092
depends on what type of
buns we're talking about.

00:03:34.092 --> 00:03:35.772
- Again, we did not order this,

00:03:35.772 --> 00:03:38.322
but they just, put it on
the house, spicy wonton.

00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:42.285
- [Colin] This spicy wonton is unreal.

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:44.035
- They just started
like, bringing out food.

00:03:44.035 --> 00:03:45.142
- [Colin] Whoa!!

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.252
- [Steven] Oh my gosh!

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:47.692
- I think the Mama Lu's people

00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:49.122
know what our game is and they don't

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:51.322
want us to go to another place.

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:53.202
They're trying to just shut us down

00:03:53.202 --> 00:03:55.852
by giving us way too much food.

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:57.882
Already, these fell a little heavier.

00:03:57.882 --> 00:03:59.072
- [Freddie] More meat perhaps?

00:03:59.072 --> 00:03:59.572
- Cheers.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.512
- [Voiceover] Feast mode, hunger squad.

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:02.292
- [Freddie] Mama Lu's has the lead

00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:03.992
just with the environment and the fact

00:04:03.992 --> 00:04:05.062
that they really want to take care of us.

00:04:05.062 --> 00:04:06.492
- Meatier.
- More wholesome

00:04:06.492 --> 00:04:09.162
- [Colin] That's the Din Tai
Fung and this is Mama Lu's.

00:04:09.162 --> 00:04:10.702
- The pleats are very pretty also.

00:04:10.702 --> 00:04:12.207
- [Steven] We ordered three things,

00:04:12.207 --> 00:04:13.692
and look what they gave us.

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:15.042
- [Andrew] I am comin'
around on these dumplings.

00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:16.852
I think I prefer them to Din Tai Fung.

00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:19.432
- I like the broth, but I
prefer Din Tai Fung broth.

00:04:19.432 --> 00:04:21.152
- It comes down to your broth preference.

00:04:21.152 --> 00:04:23.442
- I like, absolutely
love Din Tai Fung but,

00:04:23.442 --> 00:04:25.092
I think this is my new go to spot.

00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:27.982
- I thought both places we ate
at today had great dumplings.

00:04:27.982 --> 00:04:29.882
And that was the problem, is that

00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:32.182
I ate too many dumplings at both spots.

00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:33.112
- [Steven] Freddie, you ok?

00:04:33.112 --> 00:04:35.562
- No, but yes.

00:04:35.562 --> 00:04:37.952
- [Andrew] We can't go
on, we ate too much.

00:04:37.952 --> 00:04:39.645
- [Steven] God bless you soup dumplings.

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:41.896
- Feast mode, hunger squad.

00:04:41.896 --> 00:04:43.552
Strikes again, I know how much

00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:45.522
good, quality Chinese food and dumplings

00:04:45.522 --> 00:04:48.242
mean to Steven so, to go
on this journey with him

00:04:48.242 --> 00:04:49.792
and the rest of my friends...

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:51.346
- [Colin] Steven, stop eating,
you're gonna make me sick!

00:04:51.346 --> 00:04:52.216
(laughter)
- [Steven] It's all good.

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:54.366
- [Colin] I can't watch you eat anymore!

00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:58.826
- Freddie is fully unresponsive,
boy I am still sweating.

00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:01.176
(laughter) Oh man.

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:02.596
- This is not as easy as it looks people.

00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:03.346
- Yeah

00:05:03.346 --> 00:05:04.686
- Just eat and be merry.

00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:07.026
- It's not fun, eating all this food.

00:05:07.026 --> 00:05:10.678
- We take this bullet
for, the viewers at home

00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:12.976
so that you don't have to, you're welcome,

00:05:12.976 --> 00:05:15.906
yeah, exactly, you know, no apologies.
