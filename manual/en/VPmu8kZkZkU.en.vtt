00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.510
 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.800
Hi everyone. So today we're taking a look at

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.939
Wolfenstein The Old Blood, the follow-up
and expansion pack to Wolfenstein

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.349
New Order. Now, as you will be aware

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.720
I absolutely adore the new Wolfenstein game.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.769
When New Order was released it was truly spectacular and this expansion pack

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.119
really does take everything MachineGames learned

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.390
from the first and has really applied it
here to their expansion.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.780
Now one of the interesting things is
this is an expansion pack

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.980
in the truest sense of the word in the
old-school sense of the word.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.150
It's on at a budget price of £15,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.240
around $20, and it does pick

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.360
up in a kind of game play sense exactly
where

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.020
the New Order leaves off. Not within the
story

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.660
but within the kind of way that the game just drops you straight into action.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.230
Action, action, action. You get a kind of
20-minute warm-up

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.360
as it were to flex your muscles and then
really it is right back into that

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.230
hard to win action that keeps you right on the edge of your seat.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.450
The new guns they've come up with just
work beautifully really.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.010
I mean it all fits with a kind of Nazi theme. These are experimental weapons created by the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.780
Nazis to attempt to win the war.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.940
Obviously BJ gets hold of those and turns them to his advantage,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.970
ie. blowing up Nazis. Brilliant! The game
play here really is

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.080
just like New Order. Now that is both a
positive

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.190
and a negative. If you really loved that
gameplay you are going to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.380
absolutely love this. But if you found the game too difficult

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.350
originally then I'm afraid you may very
well have the same problems here.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.520
In fact I'd say you almost certainly will. This

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.610
is a game that doesn't really care if
you've played

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.130
the previous Wolfenstein game. You could just jump straight in

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.340
but there's not a lot of character
development here

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.789
unfortunately. It kind of almost feels
like they've put together the levels but

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.490
not necessarily with the kind of same

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.969
story or even the same kind of love and attention to detail

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.860
in the cut scenes that we had from the first game. But there again this is about half the

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.369
price of

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.549
the first game as well. For me, I'm looking for more Nazi killing

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.430
action and Wolfenstein Old Blood
absolutely ticks that box multiple times

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.860
over.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.980
One of the things that I found really interesting this time around is

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.250
the game engine itself is not annoying
me to death.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.829
Now previously I had lots of problems
with the IDTech5 engine, that mega texture

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.700
system, the way the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.310
data was streaming in and around too fast, it was horrible at times.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.510
Here, I haven't actually noticed it which is just fantastic.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.150
Because now it feels like we get a game
which has got phenomenal graphics

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.660
with no down side. Brilliant! I mean
really these are some of the most

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.230
beautifully detailed

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.599
but dark looking environments we've
probably ever seen in a game

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.129
and they are just gorgeous when lit up
with gunfire.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.519
It all gives a kind of beautiful feedback

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.670
into the game play as you're playing, that
this world is just

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.730
alive with gunfire and evil Nazis.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.780
Just perfect really. Those edge of your seat moments from the first game

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.819
are still here. You will find yourself
quite literally going

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.069
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, as you're trying to run away from a giant

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.549
well, killer dog but this one happens to
be made of

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.600
well metal and robotics. At the end of
the day the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.370
developers here have captured everything that was perfect with the first game

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.510
but given us more of it. Absolutely fine
by

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.079
me. Now the story is spread over eight
chapters and as I say this

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.190
is really a prequel to the first Wolfenstein  game.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.919
It kind of picks-up with BJ heading into

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.180
the Wolfenstein castle having been
captured at some point

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.680
and having to basically fight his way out
whilst attempting

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.840
hopefully to rescue various people and
obviously kill that really evil

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.110
ultra Nazi at the end.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.190
Now it all works very, very well. I

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.760
would have liked a little bit more
character development I think, just

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.460
because we've  become quite invested

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.610
in this character and just a little bit more
texture there to his story would have been

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.620
great. The stealth sections are a little
bit irritating at

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.980
times but what you have to bear in mind is these are very much breaking up the

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.150
action to give you those moments to
breathe

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.519
because without them this game would be
a little bit too visceral I think.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.540
There are real moments where you can almost lose track and

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.140
sense of what's going on within a fight
because there's just so much

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.260
gunfire and the frame rate nature  at 60
frames a second on PC really kind of adds

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.430
to that. You're getting so much information

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.350
so quickly it feels like you're playing,
well, the very best

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.590
of first-person shooters from over the
years all kind of folding into one

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.040
evisceral game type. I mean it just is
fantastic.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.060
And once again the developers have
decided just to focus on single player

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.620
here, there's no multiplayer component

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.160
at all. And actually I thank them for that
because this is all about

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.250
this experience, this single player
experience of you

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.390
and this game. Without having to muddy it 
particularly with

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.340
other players. Now in future I would love
to see a co-op version of this game, I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.979
think it could

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.620
really work well. But what they've
delivered is well worth £15,

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.680
the polish here is really excellent, the improvements to the engine are outstanding

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.020
and the gameplay underlying it all is
absolute Wolfenstein

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.070
to its core. I cannot recommend this game enough.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.540
Looking around the web so are an awful lot of gamers. This one has yet again

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.100
absolutely nailed what Wolfenstein
actually is and it shows

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.300
the developers have got a great love and
this franchise is in very good hands.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.130
 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.230
 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.920
