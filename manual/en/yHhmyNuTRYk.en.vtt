00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:08.160
Ok, now I've sewed my two pockets together.
And I've cut out two pieces of lining material.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.910
The same size as my pockets. And first I want
to trim off some of this excess fabric. You

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:25.119
can trim it down to about a quarter inch if
you like. And if you have any sharp corners

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.670
you can trim them a little close. These are
pretty soft corners, so we don't have to worry

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.890
about it so much. You trim off that excess
fabric and then turn the pockets right side

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.800
out. And just kind of push your fingers into
the corners. And there's your pocket. Now

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.289
to make the lining, you're going to take the
two pieces of lining material and sew down

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.879
the sides only. Leaving the bottom open. And
leaving the top open. So we're only sewing

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.200
the sides, and you want to do it with the
same seam allowance. If you want, you can

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:18.520
place the pocket on the side and draw a line.
So that you know where to sew your lining.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:27.139
Ok, now I've sewn both sides here. Now take
your little pocket purse and slip it inside

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:37.840
the lining. Like this. And match up the top
edges. So you want to match the top edges

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:49.139
like that. And if you want, you can pin them
in place. And we'll sew along the top edge.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:56.489
Again, you may want to use a zipper foot to
get nice and close to the edge of the top

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:09.920
of the pocket. I'm going to put my zipper
foot in. And then you place the pocket, right

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:18.680
there on the machine feeling for the edge
and start back and forth to knot it. And then

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.269
follow right along the edge of the top of
the pocket. And just sew in one big circle

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:34.040
all the way around. Now I've sewed all the
way around the top to sew the lining onto

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.969
the pocket. And now just pull the pocket out.
And theres your lining sewn to the top. And

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:51.489
to close the bottom, we're just going to fold
it in. Just fold it in about a seam allowance.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.470
About a half inch to three quarter inches.
And then we'll just top stitch to close the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:19.900
bottom of the lining.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.220
And then you just have to tuck that lining
right into the purse. Like that.
