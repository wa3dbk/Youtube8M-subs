00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.140
The word that springs to mind about almost
every aspect of Re-Volt Classic is 'competent'.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.620
Everything it does, it does reasonably well.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.830
It never makes you gasp, but it rarely makes
you cringe either.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.610
It's just quite good.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.060
But in this day and age quite good doesn't
cut it.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.749
There are so many games vying for your attention
on the App Store that if one doesn't blow

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.910
your face off with entertainment bombs from
the get go it's always going to fall by the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.140
wayside.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.920
Re-Volt Classic is a port of a pretty well-received
Dreamcast-era RC racing game.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.620
You drive a little car around a series of
tracks that take you through museums, botanical

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.240
gardens, suburban streets, and famous wrecked
ships.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.300
There's a variety of control methods at your
disposal.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.100
The default takes acceleration out of your
hands and lets you concentrate on steering.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.020
There's also a passable on-screen joypad and
buttons option, and an almost unusable twin-joystick

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.020
choice.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.740
There's rarely any feeling that you're actually
moving really quickly, though, with the oddly

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.100
lifeless graphics adding to an overall lack
of excitement.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.360
The interesting bits of the race, when you're
bunched together and vying for positions,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.020
are too often spoilt by long, boring stretches
of chasing or leading the pack.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.240
The controls do little to help, turning cornering
into a precision art form when what it really

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.250
needs to be is a power-sliding grin-producer.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.330
Slightly ropey physics add to the feeling
that you're not quite attached to the ground.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.510
Mario Kart-style power ups and weapons litter
the tracks, and add an extra level of tactics

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.659
to the race.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.020
They're enjoyable to use, but the lack of
a multiplayer component ultimately makes them

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.370
a little drab.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.300
A Stunt mode sits alongside the standard races,
and sees you pootling around a track filled

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.920
with jumps, loops, and other dangerous obstacles.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.510
The aim of the game is collecting the stars
that sit at the apex of the jumps and in the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.070
centre of the loops, which you can use to
get new tracks and vehicles.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.930
There's certainly a lot of content to unlock,
with extra tracks and new radio-controlled

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.600
cars becoming available as you complete races
in Championship mode and dig up stars in Practice

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.799
and Stunt.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.130
Difficulty settings can be tweaked to let
less experienced racers get a feel for the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.619
game, but - while this is a good way to ease
newcomers into the Re-Volt experience - it

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.820
only adds to the strange blandness that permeates
every pore of the game.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.470
Even after a last-corner victory, when you
should be panting, dripping with sweat, and

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.890
cackling like an escaped lunatic, all you
can think to yourself is “hmm, that was

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.950
nice”.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.750
The problems add up to create a game that's
reasonably interesting, but nothing more.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.700
It's a console game that's been dumped onto
touchscreen devices with no consideration

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.670
for the nuances of the new hardware, and it
really shows.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.620
Re-Volt Classic isn't a terrible game - for
all of its faults there's still a lot here

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.620
to like.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.080
The problem is, its competitors are designed
for touchscreen devices, built with mobile

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.680
gaming in mind, and it leaves the game feeling
old-fashioned.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.400
If you're a fan of the original, your rose-tinted
spectacles will probably see you through.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.390
For everyone else, Re-Volt Classic is likely
to be a disappointment.
