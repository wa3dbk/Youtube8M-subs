00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.620
 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.960
OK, so for those wondering why I eat so slowly,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.060
I think maybe it's because my digestive ability is weaker than other people's.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.040
That's why if I don't chew very thoroughly, my digestion speed slows down.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.560
If I chew well, it speeds up, and I'm not as uncomfortable.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.760
If I don't chew really well, I can only eat about 50% of my max.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.760
That's if I don't chew well, yeah?

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.980
I think maybe my body can't accept the food.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.480
There's a burden on my body [from eating].

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.800
That is, when I eat a lot my shoulders and lower back start to hurt.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.820
There's a few kilograms of food in my stomach, so that load is placed on my shoulders and lower back.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.360
That's about all that's bad.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.560
If we were to draw a picture,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.920
this here is me.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.720
And this is a regular person.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.780
This is the stomach here.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.980
A normal person's stomach is just that size and doesn't stretch much.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.480
When this little stomach fills up, you can't eat anymore, but

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.660
for me, a stomach that starts out this big

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.740
becomes about like this when eating.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.180
The stomach is infinite... Well, not infinite, but

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.400
it gets bigger.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.320
That's why I can eat so much, yeah?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:30.220
And because I can eat so much, my body tries to get it out of there quickly and doesn't absorb it.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.740
In other words, because most people can't handle that volume [of food], their body can absorb at its leisure.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.680
OK, so let's go back and say I'm eating. And it goes in here, right?

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.420
Normal people get full and can't eat any more, right?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.560
For me, food goes out so more can come in.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.480
It goes out, so eating a lot means I don't gain weight,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.540
and processing speeds up as I eat a lot.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.880
I hope that made sense...

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.700
No, that's absolutely hard to understand. Haha.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.200
Also, to move this through, a lot of water is necessary.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.140
Most women are like this, but if you don't get enough water, it's easy to become constipated.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.180
So...

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.180
I don't get constipated,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.460
but my body wants water, right?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.400
To sum up, it's my body type that keeps me from gaining weight.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.360
People often say "you're so thin," but really... I'm not so thin.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.220
My upper body doesn't really put on weight very easily.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.740
This area,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.660
and this area don't really get fat.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.600
There's a fair amount on my legs and butt.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.960
That's the worst, right? I can't gain any weight up here.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.020
I have a cursed body.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.600
I looked up the ideal weight for my height on the net once.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.560
And my ideal weight was 49kg.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.580
It said plus or minus 5kg was the range.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.740
I'm in the minus. I'm a bit on the thinner side, but well within that 5kg.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.040
It's not like I'm just barely within 5kg of that ideal spot.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.300
I want to put on weight in the right places.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.360
The way it is now is... It can't be helped, I just want what I can't have.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.660
I'm hungry.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.060
If I eat a little bit, I get really hungry.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.060
If I eat a just a little,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.500
my stomach balloons up again.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.420
It's no fun, but eating nothing at all is the most bearable.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.380
My stomach gets small and enters hibernation mode, so that's the most bearable.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.660
And after I eat I think blood doesn't go to my brain.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.200
So my brain doesn't work [then].

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.160
When I have work to do that requires thinking, it's best not to eat anything.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.120
I pealed my clementine. I give my thanks.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.060
That's about all for today.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.380
If there are more questions, I'd like to answer them another time.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.920
Goodbye!
