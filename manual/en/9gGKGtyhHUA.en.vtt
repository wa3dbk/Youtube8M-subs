00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.580

You know that's right!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.000

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.900
What am I supposed to do, to console myself when you're gone, huh?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200
I'm gonna be gone for 2 hours

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100
But thats an eternity,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.020
without you my love

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.600
NO!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.340
*Shock* Fine!

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.180
This is the end of junk food

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.740
You can eat these!

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.860
Okay, I'm off to baby-sit, I'll be back soon

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.160

I can't believe you!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.440

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.100
