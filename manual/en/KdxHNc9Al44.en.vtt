00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:02.967
Dr. Hibberd&gt;&gt; I also just want
to touch base on something that

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:05.800
most people wouldn't
even think of as a probiotic,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.700
but guess what?

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.900
Fecal transplant meets
every single word

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.733
in the definition
of a probiotic.

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:18.267
And as we all know, it's
an innovative approach

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:20.900
for recurrent C. diff.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.200
There hasn't been a
huge number of trials,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.933
and unfortunately like
everything in probiotics,

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.067
there's a lot of variability.

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:31.333
A lot of variability
of the preparation,

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.400
a lot of variability as to
how these fecal transplants

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.133
are occurring.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.967
In general, the
published results show

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:44.167
that the results
are positive.

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:48.667
And that the microbiome of the
person who gets the transplant

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.167
is much more like the donor.

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.667
These are some
data from January

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.800
in the New England
Journal of Medicine.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.067
After just one
infusion of donor feces,

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:06.867
there was already a huge
percentage of cure versus the

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:09.433
routine Vancomycin therapy.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:13.167
In fact, this trial
was stopped early.

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:16.500
Probably some of you have
heard of alternative approaches

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.933
because people are concerned,
well how on earth do you safely

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.400
give people other people's poop?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.167
So what the Canadian group
are doing is they're actually

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:34.733
choosing 33 organisms that
they think are probably safe,

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:40.000
and essentially transplanting
those 33 organisms.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.400
These are all being reported at
the patient level at this stage,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.867
but in general, it seems like
providing these organisms is

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:54.700
able to change the
microbiome in these people.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.000
So the scary thing
is, what's next?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.633
Fecal transplants are already
â€”they've already been done

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:07.033
for people who have
metabolic syndrome,

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:10.333
getting improvement in
insulin resistance.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.767
And one of the things I'm a
little scared about is we may

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:17.233
have some very interesting
data from Jeff Gordon's mice,

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:21.900
but that doesn't tell us
that we're ready to do fecal

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.500
transplants for obesity, but I
have a ghastly feeling

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.667
we're going to hear
about it really soon.

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:33.767
So the bottom line is,
what do we need omics to do?

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:39.667
It's very clear to me that
we cannot test every single

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:43.167
organism that
could be a probiotic.

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:49.400
We won't get a single answer
or a whole set of answers for a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.033
hell of a long time,
and it's not helpful.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:57.700
We must find ways to move the
field forward such that we can

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.833
make assessments of likely
safety of particular organisms,

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:06.433
likely ability to
prevent disease,

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:09.233
likely ability to
treat disease,

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:13.300
and also who may be
likely responders.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.367
And I am pretty sure that it's
going to take a combination

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:20.467
of methodologies.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:24.333
But somehow, we need
to do this efficiently,

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:29.367
cost effectively,
and with valid data.

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.867
So with that, I'd like to
conclude and say that since

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:38.933
2001, when probiotics
was such a simple concept,

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:44.933
I think enthusiasm for
probiotics has persisted,

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:49.833
but the scientific basis
and mechanism studies still

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:52.767
lagâ€š we're not there yet.

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:58.267
I think omic tools
are rapidly evolving.

00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:00.567
They're in their
infancy right now,

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:04.800
but I think they will help
us understand the microbiome.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.800
I think there are lots of issues
about whether lobbing in a

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.233
single organism or multiple
organisms or whole microbial

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:17.033
communities, as in
fecal transplants,

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:21.300
raises an interesting
question, but I think right now,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.800
we're too early in the field to
make any real predictions about

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.433
how to make this go forward.

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:31.300
But probably the
simpler, the better.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.833
And finally, this is a
multidisciplinary approach.

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:40.967
It needs to bring many,
many people together

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:43.033
to figure out whether
probiotics are

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:46.333
hope, hype, or reality.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:49.767
I would like to thank the
incredible team that I work

00:04:49.767 --> 00:04:55.100
with, specifically pointing
out Dr. Fraser who is here,

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.200
and Dr. Gloria, who is also here,
and a huge thank you to

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.700
Dr. Linda Duffy, who has really
shepherded this work and enabled

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.900
us to move at least
something forward.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.833
Thank you.

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:11.733
And thank you for
your attention.

00:05:11.733 --> 00:05:12.733
[applause]
