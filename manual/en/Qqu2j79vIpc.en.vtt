hello namaste

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.650
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.449
Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to
learn how to make murunga keerai sundal

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.949
curry, this is nothing but the tender leaves of drumstick cooked with moong dal

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.539
a day preparation, dear friends let's go
ahead and learn how to make this for

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.100
this take some oil in a pan and in this
add some red chili, mustard seeds when

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.199
the mustard seed tickle tickle tickle

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.379
add cumin seeds, chana dal and just we're going to cook it till they're slightly

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.780
colored and another crunchy ingredient what I love to add in lot of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.179
preparation is urad dal and this urad dal when it is nicely roasted even

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.679
if you add to two gravies it'll still have a
little bit of crunch left over so this is all

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:05.460
good in this add a little bit of chopped ginger, turmeric and some chopped

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.759
green chillies to this add some curry
leaves

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.920
usually they add the greens directly to
this but i wanted little bit moist so

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
I'm going to add chopped onion this is
not required this chopped onion is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.899
optional but I love to add because that
gives little bit of moist to this

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.380
preparation and in this add little bit
of salt

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.600
once the onions have sweated in this
add the greens that is the chopped

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.509
drumstick leaves and just let this cook
along with this onions and everything

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.490
these greens are nicely sauteed little bit in
this we're going to add the moong dal,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.219
this moong dal is cooked in such a way
that the grain remains intact

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.229
ok it doesn't mash but on the bite it is nice and soft

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.409
some people like to roast this moong dal on a slow flame and till it slightly dries

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:58.979
out

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.609
it depends on your taste if you want it 
little bit soft you can leave it little

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:08.310
soft or else you want to make it nice dry just keep roasting it till the dal

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.319
is nicely dried out

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.530
now look at this, this is all dry

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.129
and nicely separating it out in this
we're going to add some you know nicely

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:29.640
grated fresh coconut and that's good and
just you know toss this and as soon as

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.379
you add the coconut just toss it real quick switch off the flame and put the

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.840
lid on and just eat it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.959
nice fresh hot with rice

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.150
even with chapati or anything you can
enjoy this thoroughly now look at this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.569
this is nice dry and this coconut gives
the nice sweetness to this preparation and

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.139
wow even, even with the flavor the nice moong dal and the coconut flavor along with

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.579
the drumstick leaf as I told you many
times the drumstick leaves when this is

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.989
cooked nice dry it gives a nice
clarified butter that is a ghee aroma

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.400
