Hi Groovers, Chris here from www.MTBtips.com

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.020
The right tires make a huge difference
to the way you ride,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.740
how you apply your skills and how much
fun you have on the trails.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.350
Using this simple six step Guide you'll learn

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.679
how to choose the right tires for you with
confidence.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.230
Remember: Knowledge is Power.  At the end of this video

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.910
click 'like' for me, then click the
Complete Guide on screen or in the video

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.650
description.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.419
The complete guide includes lots of
helpful tips about tire selection that

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.470
I've learned from the last

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.840
27 years of mountain biking.  BUT! You can learn it all in a matter of minutes.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.629
You'll discover how particular features, tire types, tread patterns,

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.180
widths, rubber compounds, TPIs and
other specifics

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.269
can enhance and inhibit your performance on different types of terrain.

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.890
I've made it so easy for you!  With this Guide you're going to love choosing tires.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.359
And part of choosing tires is deciding how much to spend.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.000
So I asked around to see who could help
out with the special discount on tires

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.949
just for the MTBtips Community.  You'll
find that special deal

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.000
and the discount code you need at the Complete Guide.  It's for a limited time, so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.870
be quick!

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.030
Let's choose your tires.  Steps 1 and 2 are easy, so I'll make them short and sweet.  Step 1.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.440
Diameter.  Identify your current tire size.  The first number is the rim diameter in inches,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.600
when measured at the bead.  And the second number, after the X,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.770
is the tire width in inches.  Your new tires
must have the same diameter

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.190
but you can choose a different width,
which we'll do shortly. Today I'm

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.540
shopping for a tire

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.410
for my 27.5 inch wheeled trail bike.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.160
Step 2.  Tubed or Tubeless, in all its forms.  Identify which of the tire systems you

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.140
currently ride.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.240
I'm a big fan of a Tubeless setup for
three reasons: 1. there's no risk of pinch

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.270
flatting the tube, because there is no tube.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.080
2. You can run lower tire pressures, enhancing grip and rolling efficiency over rough

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.660
terrain and,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.590
3. Small punctures are sealed by the sealant inside the tire.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.290
If you're not on Tubeless, maybe it's
time to switch. Which may mean converting

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.220
your current rims

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.000
using a quick and easy tubeless conversion kit.  Check the Guide for more

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.700
information.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.159
I've added 'tubeless' to my list.  Step
3:

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.000
Riding Style.  Really have a think about what type of riding it is that you do.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.739
Downhill shuttle runs and nothing else?  Perhaps you ride groomed cross-country

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.500
trails with a monthly

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.829
XC marathon race?  Maybe it's a mix of
hardcore Enduro and technical

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:26.980
cross-country riding.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.349
If you're a mix of styles on the one bike choose your most dominant style as a

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.370
starting point for tire selection.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.489
Add that to your list.  I've added Enduro and

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.969
cross country to mine.  Step 4: Terrain.

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.120
What type of terrain will you be riding?  Don't just choose the tires your mate

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.709
rides!

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.379
He may have chosen wrongly.  Is it loose and rocky, sandy,

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.510
loamy or hard-pack?  Muddy, wet, hilly, and on it goes...

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.870
Is the terrain technical, or not?  A combination of several types, or just one?

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.260
Add that to your list.  My list now includes:

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.310
Loose or loose over hard-pack technical terrain.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.739
Steep, rocky climbs.  Step 5:

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.159
Width.  How does tire width affect your ride?

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.639
Use the Tire Width Comparison Guide the
Complete Guide

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.459
to decide which width is best for you.  Step 6:

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.129
Choose your advantages.  What do you want your new tires to do the best?

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.159
In what ways do you want that new tire
to enhance your riding?

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.129
From the Features and Benefits List at the Complete Guide at Step 6, 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.670
determine the Top 3 to 5 most
important things your new tire must be

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.670
capable of.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.540
Time to prioritize.  Check Step 6

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.999
at the Complete Guide.  Add your 3 to 5 most important benefits that you're looking

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.060
for to your list

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.560
and 'Hey Presto!'  Now you've got a list
that tells you exactly the type of tire

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.389
you're looking for and you can be confident

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.310
it'll be the right tire for you.  Please click
