[ Water, motor sounds ]

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:19.596
&gt;&gt; So my name is Nejc Zupan.

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:20.676
I come from Slovenia.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.996
I'm a junior at Dartmouth
College and a breaststroker.

00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:26.696
And [inaudible name] and I are on the swim team.

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:30.696
I was initially drawn to swimming because
I like the competitive nature of the sport.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:35.546
When you dive in a pool, it's just you and the
clock and the pool, and each lane's the same.

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:36.896
You don't depend on luck.

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:38.456
You only depend on yourself.

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:40.086
Each person's on his own.

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:43.056
And I think that's why I was
initially drawn to swimming.

00:00:43.446 --> 00:00:48.576
I guess now that I look back at it, what I
like and what made me stuck with swimming is,

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:51.926
you know, that feel that you get
each time you dive in a pool.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:57.166
It's hard to describe, but you feel like water's
sort of insulating you from outer distractions,

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.316
and it's just you with your own thoughts.

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:04.026
It's -- it's a special kind of
feeling, and I -- I really enjoy it.

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:07.956
Some of the best friends that I made during
my college career were definitely the friends

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:09.636
that I met on the swim team.

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:11.786
We're very close with each other.

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:13.706
It's a special kind of bond
that ties us together.

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:15.376
You know, we practice together.

00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:17.016
We wake up at 5:30 together.

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:17.946
We go eat together.

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:18.876
We live together.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:20.456
It's definitely a unique experience.

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:24.336
And it's definitely something that made
this work way more enjoyable for me.

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:27.536
I think the team aspect is really
important, especially on the college level.

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:31.456
And I think that our team has
that special thing that, you know,

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:34.976
makes going to practice is
much easier for each one of us.

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:40.836
It's definitely, you know, a huge honor to be
able to represent Dartmouth on a national level.

00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:44.296
I definitely feel like it's also a
huge responsibility for me, you know,

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:47.656
since I'm the first swimmer
after 33 years that is going

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:51.136
to be representing Dartmouth
on -- at the NCAA championship.

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:54.926
But I'm definitely excited about the
meet, excited to show what I can do.

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:59.146
And I hope that everything works out
at the end and that we come out ahead.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:05.500
