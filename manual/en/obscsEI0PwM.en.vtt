Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.640
[pause]

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.849
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.509
In the same week 3 viewers asked, first, “What's
the difference between

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.770
blackheads and whiteheads”, then, “what’s
the difference between pimples

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.160
and blemishes?” and last, “ Are all pimples
acne?” So... I guess its time

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.130
to explain the terms that are used for the
different acne BUMPS and spots

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.439
that almost everyone gets. Today I'll explain
“papules, pustules, and

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.210
cysts”, and in the next episode on the language
of acne, I'll explain

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.920
blackheads, whiteheads, red marks, brown marks,
and scars. Here it goes.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.000
Acne BLEMISHES is the broadest term… it
includes all types of CURRENT

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.430
outbreaks, as opposed to the marks and scars
which sometimes are left on

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
your skin AFTER blemishes go away. So Lets
start with blemishes…. your

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.210
actual current outbreaks. They’re divided
into 2 categories. “inflammatory”

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.140
and “non inflammatory” and the first,
“inflammatory”, is what the rest of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.770
today’s episode is about. They’re all
raised bumps and because they have

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.939
features of inflammation…. like redness,
pain, or even pus…that’s why

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.740
they’re called inflammatory. There are 3
types of inflamatory blemishes:

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.539
papules, pustules and cysts. Papules are solid,
skin colored or red

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.590
bumps.... solid meaning there’s no visible
pus or liquid in them. They are

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.719
less than 5mm in size which is a fifth of
an inch. Pustules are bumps that

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.159
contain pus so they start out red with a yellow
top, and become completely

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.859
yellow before they break or dry out and become
crusty. The yellow color is

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.659
pus that you can actually see. And pustules,
like papules, are also less

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.420
than 5mm. And BTW, these papules and pustules
are what we're talking about

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.540
when we say "pimples" or "zits". The last
type of inflammatory blemish is a

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.499
Cyst. Cysts are larger than papules and pustules,
so they’re more than 5mm.

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:08.390
When they're skin colored, they’re usually
painless, but when they're

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.530
red... or red and yellow... they're usually
painful and can look like giant

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.989
pustules. In the next episode on the language
of acne, I'll explain

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.010
blackheads, whiteheads, red and brown marks,
and scars, so the next time

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.909
you read or hear about acne, you’ll understand
just what they’re talking

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:37.799
about, and that way you’ll also have an
even better idea of how to treat

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:38.799
it.
