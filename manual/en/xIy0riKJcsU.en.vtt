00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.810
Hi my name is Chuck Werley

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.450
I'm a Mechanical Engineering Technology student

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.649
and I just got back from working for five
months for BMW over in Munich

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:16.410
I got that job because through a family connection
an uncle of mine

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.800
had spent

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.890
many years living over there studying music

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.220
and established many business connections over there

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.430
some of whom knew some hiring people

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.329
over at BMW

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.659
when I arrived they gave me a brief introduction
to my department which involved

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.210
the support work for the front end

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.390
of every BMW that is

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.980
produced

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.670
specifically

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.540
we worked on pedestrian protection
which is a new series

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.670
standards in Europe and Japan that'll be soon
coming to America involving the safety of vehicles

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.940
hitting individuals on the road and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.780
creating them so that they're able to absorb
the impact better

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.810
the best part of my co-op experience

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.820
it was all great

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.390
probably the one of the best initial parts was Oktoberfest
I got to go with all my colleagues

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.609
from BMW

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.150
on my very second day

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.860
we skipped out at noon

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.000
and we all went and got a table and stayed until
probably ten o'clock at night

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.690
it was very nice it's a big part of the culture
lots of fun as a college student and a great

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.290
time to bond with my co-workers.
Professionally I'd say the best part of my co-op experience

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.390
was just being able to contribute

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.010
to such a big company such a big project

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.230
the work I was doing actually mattered and they
made sure that I knew that

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.119
it was an important part of a big system that's going to be
implemented in the next line of vehicles

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.680
i'm actually going to be able to stand back
someday and look at my small part in this project

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.860
when these products roll out in the years to come

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.600
and that was very rewarding to me, personally

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.979
so I'd say professionally that was probably the biggest part for me

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.700
living in a foreign country I'd have to say

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.650
the most difficult thing to get used to

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.710
was personally for me, getting around
I'm a big car person so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.290
not having a car in Munich was a challenge

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.700
fortunately

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.170
and this is typical of most major european cities

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.409
they have a very well articulated mass
transportation system

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.029
the subways were what I used to get to most places

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.659
they're very clean, very efficient

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.739
it's a wonderful system and for me to be exposed
to that

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.840
be able to make use of that and see that

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.089
where in America there is negative stigma to some

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.859
of those subway systems and rail systems

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.809
I think was very beneficial

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.009
the most difficult thing actually

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.129
turned out to be a blessing in disguise

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.189
did I need to speak German?

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.139
I went over there with a few years of classes
behind my belt from high school

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.770
as far as the absolute necessity of needing

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.659
to know the language

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.169
particularly in Munich

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.089
or any big european city really

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:50.489
most people speak english they were all taught
it from a pretty young age

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.299
most of them are fluent enough that you can
get by

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.289
obviously it's always a help to try to speak
the language they appreciate it very much

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.130
when they see

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.889
that you're trying to integrate yourself into their
culture

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.109
But even if you just put forth that little effort
that will certainly meet you half way

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.560
and that was always the case at BMW

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.489
they were very helpful to me

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.459
communication was never really an issue

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.769
go into it with a very open mind

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.369
these people are real people

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:20.939
in a real country

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.869
and it's different it'll seem a little goofy

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:27.309
the way other people do things

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.609
there is always a method to the madness and if
you go into it

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.180
willing to accept it

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.159
you'll enjoy it and it's just

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.899
a huge opportunity to look at things differently

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:44.279
I think in a foreign country I'd say the most difficult thing
to get used to was for me, not having a car

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.309
I'm a big car person

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.359
and

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.339
over in Germany, and this is typical of most european

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.760
countries I had to take the subway everywhere

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.689
and it was daunting at first but it actually
turned out to be a blessing in disguise it

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:58.500
exposure to a different part of culture that

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.889
I'm sorry I was itching my hand and I didn't realize
I was goofing around

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.499
I'm getting nervous!
(Camerawoman) It's getting worse and worse now!

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:08.959
(Camerawoman) oh I got a bug

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.039
okay alright, last time

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.759
tiger face! lemon face!

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.009
okay
