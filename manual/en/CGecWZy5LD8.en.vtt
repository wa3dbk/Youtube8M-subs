Hi, I'm Tim Gipson, and I'm going to talk
to you about how to measure for shades. Now,

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.030
in this particular application we've got blinds
installed in this window. If you were going

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.189
to put a shade on this window though, and
it was what we call an inside dimension shade

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:26.289
it would be hung the same way. And what we
want to do if I pull these curtains out; we

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.640
want to measure inside face to inside face,
and in this case, we've got thirty five inches.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.300
So, what we'd want to do in choosing our shade
is that we'd want to take about a half an

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.180
inch dimension off that, so we would want
a shade in this case that is thirty four and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.570
a half inches wide. What that allows us to
do is to have at least a quarter of an inch

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:57.750
face on each side of the shade. Now, other
shades are designed where just like this curtain,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.679
they actually hang over the surface of your
window. And in that case, what we want to

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:11.460
do is we want to measure that thirty five
in inch width and add at least an inch or

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.070
two to each side, depending on the type of
a, the shade that you want to get. And then,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.790
the last part would be to measure the length.
So, if it's an inside shade we would want

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.869
to measure from the sill of the window up
to the top of the opening, which would be

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.990
seventy and a half. And in this case on the
shade; on the length of your shade, you want

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.310
it to be just a little bit longer, so we'd
want at least a seventy two inch shade; if

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.560
not a a couple inches longer, say you know,
seventy four or seventy five inches. And that

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.200
makes sure that when you draw that shade all
the way down that you've got enough travel

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.810
to cover that. And then, on the outside it's
the same thing. You would be mounting your

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.490
shade at least two or three inches, so in
this case you'd want to be pulling it down;

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.110
maybe all the way to the floor for decorative
purposes, or maybe just a couple inches. So,

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.920
you can measure the distance from the floor,
which in this case would be eleven inches.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.290
So, we could add fourteen inches to the length
of the opening if you're doing the shade all

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.920
the way to the floor, or simply add for two
or three inches above and below, add six inches

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.120
if you're mounting just above the window and
going just below. I'm Tim Gipson, and that's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.680
for some tips for hanging a shade in your
window.
