Welcome to Belle Rave where Bane, a Goomba,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.070
this storm trooper, and your high school
goths are taking over the asylum!

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.100
I kid of course.  So last night, Suicide
Squad director David Ayer tweeted out

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.869
this group shot with the caption of "task
force assembled and ready".

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.250
As a DC brat, I'm not really a fan of
the new 52

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.119
but I like this!   The ensemble looks
gritty and hardcore

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.000
but before we identify who's who let's
address who's not in the group shot

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.560
first.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.149
Jared Leto as the Joker who's
supposed to be an antagonist in the film

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.860
hence why he's not featured.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.700
Viola Davis as Amanda Waller.  Scott
Eastwood whose character has yet to be

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.440
revealed.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.969
Ben Affleck as Batman who's role in relation to the film remains unknown at this time.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.760
And the recently cast Common who's
rumored to be Jon Stewart but who really knows.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.039
So why are these villains assembled?  The
Suicide Squad also referred to as Task

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.550
Force X is a team of super villains manipulated
into serving as

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.640
assets for the United States.  Under the
direction of Amanda Waller and assembled

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.449
in Belle Rave federal penitentiary

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.400
each villain was outfitted with a micro
implant to ensure compliance.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.619
If they fail to comply with the
directives of Amanda Waller and her

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:12.299
higher-ups

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.280
then they'll detonate the implants.  The lineup has undergone a number of changes over

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.049
the years in the comics so let's focus on
David Ayer's version.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.009
Alright, let's start with Adam Beach on
the far left who's playing Slipknot, A Fury of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.390
Firestorm villain whose specialty is hanging his victims.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.130
Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, an
Australian villain originating from the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.070
Flash comics.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.079
Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, an
ethically challenged schizophrenic with

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.130
magical powers.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.470
Karen Fukuhara as Kitana ... no relation.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.460
You've got Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg who's
tapped by Amanda Waller to lead the Suicide Squad.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.049
Margot Robbie is Harley Quinn.  This is
awesome!

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.450
I'm going to do a full breakdown of Harley
Quinn in a separate video so come back

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.509
and subscribe for that.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.219
Will Smith is Deadshot.  He's more
anti-hero than villain and he stemming

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.240
from the Batman comics.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.630
Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is Killer Croc.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.840
I hope i pronounced that properly but
he's a former alligator wrestler from

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.020
florida with a gnarly skin condition.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.410
And finally Jay Hernandez as El Diablo,
the Chato Santa version.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.880
Let's keep the discussion going.  Tell me
your thoughts in the comments below and see

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.620
