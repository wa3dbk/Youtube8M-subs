00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.780
One evening...when...the sun went down...

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.220
and the jungle fire was burning!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.940
Down the tracks came a hobo hiking...

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.320
and he said "Boys, I'm not turning!"

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.220
"I'm headed for a land that's far away!"

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.040
"Beside the crested fountain..."

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.280
I guess they still can't hear us.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.020
Do you remember how Alice wasn't always in Wonderland?

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.299
She fell down, down, down deep in a hole!

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.589
Right, well, I wasn't always in Room.

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:42.492
I'm like Alice.

00:00:42.886 --> 00:00:44.566
Now we've got a chance...

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:45.779
I'm scared!

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.780
I know.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:51.867
- Truck. - Truck...

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.780
- Wiggle out. - Wiggle out...

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.400
- Jump.  - Jump...

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.029
- Run.  - Run...

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.502
In the big rock candy mountain...

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:08.761
there's a land that's clear and bright!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.640
I'm headed for a land that's far away...

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.700
Thanks for saving our little girl!

00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:16.941
beside the crested fountain...

00:01:18.074 --> 00:01:19.514
You're gonna love it.

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:20.436
What...?

00:01:21.363 --> 00:01:22.083
The world.
