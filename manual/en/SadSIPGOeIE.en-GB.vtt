00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.580
So we are in the gallery that is looking very closely at the work made in the 1990s

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.680
which of course has become very synonymous with the Young British Artists who emerged at this time

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.920
It is also important to remember that London really emerged as a multi cultural city 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.040
and was very much heralded as a new centre for contemporary art.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.520
So as well as being an important centre for art

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.500
London as a subject was a recurring fascination for artists during this period 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.960
and I'm standing in front of Leon Kossof’s painting of Christchurch in Spitalfields.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.560
In this painting, he depicts the church leaning very heavily to the right

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.140
in order to allow the sort of social fabric if you like, of the city to emerge. 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.220
And I think the very energetic brushwork really does suggest that time is really of the essence

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.300
that it won't be too long before churches like this become surrounded by new office blocks

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.520
and that their characters will be lost forever.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.800
It's very interesting that we’ve tried to juxtapose an older artist’s depiction of London

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.320
with a painting by a much younger artist who emerged at this time.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.560
This is Keith Coventry, 'East Street Estate' from 1994

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.620
and on first glance this painting looks perhaps a lot like abstract painting from the very early Twentieth Century

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.140
perhaps, by Russian artists like Malevich.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.220
But in actual fact, these very abstract, very simple markings depict the plan of the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.620
East Street Council Estate in South London

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.080
and show us where the buildings are situated on a very simplified map. 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.180
Chris Ofili emerged in the 1990s with paintings like this; 'No Woman No Cry'

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.140
which really pulsate with the colour and energy of the artist’s brushwork

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.700
to which he adds intricate layers of resin, colleague magazine cut outs. 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.820
This painting was conceived as a tribute to the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.100
and after a formative trip to Zimbabwe as a student, Ofili started to investigate elephant dung 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.980
as a potential media in his art and soon afterwards he began to apply balls of dung sourced from London Zoo

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.520
onto the surfaces of his canvasses and also as a prop to prop the works up from the floor.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.120
And Ofili’s canvasses from this period have a range of disparate sources

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.980
including contemporary and popular culture and he often has talked about how he approaches a painting

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.780
like a hip-hop DJ or a rapper, you know, sort of sampling and mixing disparate elements

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.820
in order to make something new. 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.580
I think this room really captures the spirit of the many different ways that artists were seeking to

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.540
communicate their ideas to a wider public

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.360
which I think is something that really epitomises work from the 1990s.
