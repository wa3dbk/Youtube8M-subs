00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:55.599
Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, my life

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:01.271
Try to make ends meet,

00:01:01.343 --> 00:01:06.079
You're a slave to money then you die

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.880
I'll take you down the only road
I've ever been down

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:29.581
You know the one that takes you to the places
where all the veins meet yeah,

00:01:32.462 --> 00:01:38.002
You know I canÂ´t change, I can change,
I can change, I can change

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:43.114
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold

00:01:43.473 --> 00:01:49.106
But I'm a million different people
from one day to the next...

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.087
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no

00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:57.775
Have you ever been down?

00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:14.099
Well I've never prayed
But tonight I'm on my knees yeah

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:24.329
I need to hear some sounds
that recognize the pain in me, yeah

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:36.659
I let the melody shine,
let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.669
But the airways are clean
and there's nobody singing to me now

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:56.239
No change, I can change
I can change, I can change

00:02:56.364 --> 00:03:01.569
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.034
And I'm a million different people
from one day to the next

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:13.113
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no

00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:17.290
Have you ever been down?

00:03:24.673 --> 00:03:32.970
Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony that's life

00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:37.709
Try to make ends meet

00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:43.726
Try to find some money then you die

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:55.120
I'll take you down the only road
I've ever been down

00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:06.230
You know the one that takes you to the places
where all the veins meet yeah

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.519
You know I can change, I can change,
I can change, I can change

00:04:15.017 --> 00:04:20.161
But I'm here in my mould,
I am here in my mould

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:25.353
But I'm a million different people
from one day to the next...

00:04:25.412 --> 00:04:31.657
I can't change my mould, 
no, no, no, no, no

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:43.250

Ever been down
