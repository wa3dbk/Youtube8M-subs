00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:02.467
The President:
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:05.567
I want to say a few words about
the tragedy that took place this

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:08.400
week in West Virginia,
but before I do,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.233
I'd first like to comment on
the news that Justice John Paul

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:15.033
Stevens will retire from the
Supreme Court at the end of its

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.834
current term.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:20.867
When President Ford was faced
with a Supreme Court vacancy

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:23.233
shortly after the nation was
still recovering from the

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:27.133
Watergate scandal, he wanted
a nominee who was brilliant,

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:32.734
non-ideological, pragmatic, and
committed above all to justice,

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.700
integrity, and the rule of law.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.767
He found that nominee
in John Paul Stevens.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:43.333
Justice Stevens has courageously
served his country from the

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:47.967
moment he enlisted the day
before Pearl Harbor to his long

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.533
and distinguished tenure
on the Supreme Court.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:55.467
During that tenure, he has stood
as an impartial guardian of the law.

00:00:55.467 --> 00:01:00.333
He's worn the judicial robe
with honor and humility.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.500
He has applied the Constitution
and the laws of the land with

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.467
fidelity and restraint.

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:09.800
He will soon turn 90 this month,
but he leaves his position at

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.567
the top of his game.

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:14.266
His leadership will
be sorely missed,

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.934
and I just had an opportunity to
speak with him and told him on

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:24.533
behalf of a grateful nation,
that I thanked him for his service.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.800
Now, as Justice Steven expressed to me in the letter announcing

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.033
his retirement, it is in the best interests of the Supreme

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:34.333
Court to have a successor appointed and confirmed before

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.767
the next term begins.

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.033
And so I will move
quickly to name a nominee,

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.734
as I did with Justice Sotomayor.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.934
Once again, I view the process
of selecting a Supreme Court

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:48.600
nominee as among my most serious
responsibilities as President.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.734
And while we cannot replace
Justice Stevens' experience or

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:56.967
wisdom, I will seek someone in
the coming weeks with similar

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.567
qualities -- an
independent mind,

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:02.567
a record of excellence
and integrity,

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:05.100
a fierce dedication
to the rule of law,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.533
and a keen understanding of how
the law affects the daily lives

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:10.600
of the American people.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.900
It will also be someone
who, like Justice Stevens,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.400
knows that in a democracy,
powerful interests must not be

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.066
allowed to drown out the
voices of ordinary citizens.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.233
Much like they did
with Justice Sotomayor,

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:25.033
I hope the Senate will move
quickly in the coming weeks to

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:28.233
debate and then confirm my
nominee so that the new Justice

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:31.467
is seated in time
for the fall term.

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:36.800
Now, let me say a few words
about what has happened in West Virginia.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.467
This has been an unimaginably
difficult week for the people

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:43.800
who live near Montcoal.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.367
31 workers were inside the
Upper Big Branch mine when an

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:51.700
explosion ripped through its
walls on Monday afternoon.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.400
Two were saved.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.767
25 were lost.

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:57.400
And for the four
who remain missing,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.233
we are praying for a miracle.

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:03.800
I want to offer my deepest
condolences to the friends and

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.000
the families of the fathers
and the husbands and brothers,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.533
nephews and sons who were
killed in this accident.

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:14.834
I'm also in awe of the courage
and selflessness shown by the

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:18.433
rescue teams who've risked their
lives over and over and over

00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:21.734
this week for the
chance to save another.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.767
They've worked around the
clock, with little sleep,

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:28.200
for the past few days, and this
nation owes them a debt of gratitude.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.934
Now, mining has a long and
proud history in West Virginia.

00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:35.333
For many families
and communities,

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:39.700
it's not just a way to make a
living; it's a way of life.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.700
And the jobs they do in these
mines help bring heat and

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.734
electricity to
millions of Americans.

00:03:45.734 --> 00:03:49.266
It's a profession that's not
without risks and danger,

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:51.600
and the workers and their
families know that.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.700
But their government and their
employers know that they owe it

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.467
to these families to do
everything possible to ensure

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:03.433
their safety when they
go to work each day.

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.834
When I was in the Senate,
I supported the efforts of

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:09.967
Senator Byrd and Rockefeller
to try to improve mine safety,

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:12.734
but it's clear that
more needs to be done.

00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:15.433
And that's why I've asked my
Secretary of Labor as well as

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.266
the head of the Mine Safety and
Health Administration to give me

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:23.934
a preliminary report next week
on what went wrong and why it

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:26.967
went wrong so badly, so that we
can take the steps necessary to

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:30.367
prevent such accidents
in the future.

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:33.300
Because mining is a tradition
that's often passed down through

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.300
generations, it's not uncommon
to see an entire family choose

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.867
this line of work.

00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:41.667
And sadly, when a
tragedy like this occurs,

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:47.133
it's also not uncommon to lose
almost an entire family all at once.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:51.900
I spoke to some surviving
members of one such family on Wednesday.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.100
This week, Tim Davis, and two
of his nephews, Josh, age 25,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.266
and Cory, age 20, were killed in
the explosion in the Upper Big Branch mine.

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:05.767
Rescuers have reported that Tim
and his two nephews were all

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.467
found together.

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:11.166
Two other members of their
families that worked in the mine

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.533
were able to escape unharmed.

00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:16.200
Before he left for
the mine on Monday,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.066
Josh wrote a letter for his
girlfriend and young daughter.

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:23.433
And in it, he said, "If
anything happens to me,

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:26.834
I'll be looking down
from heaven at you all.

00:05:26.834 --> 00:05:28.100
I love you.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.834
Take care of my baby.

00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:33.667
Tell her that daddy loves her,
she's beautiful, she's funny.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:38.066
Just take care of my baby girl."

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:41.166
Reflecting on that letter, and
the losses she endured in just

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:46.600
one week, Josh's
mother Pam simply said,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.734
"It is just West Virginia.

00:05:48.734 --> 00:05:52.700
When something bad
happens, we come together."

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.200
When something bad
happens, we come together.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.734
Through tragedy and heartache,
that's the spirit that has

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:01.734
sustained this community,
and this country,

00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:03.467
for over 200 years.

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:06.500
And as we pray for the
souls of those we've lost,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.734
and the safe return of
those who are missing,

00:06:09.734 --> 00:06:13.467
we are also sustained by the
words of the Psalm that are

00:06:13.467 --> 00:06:15.834
particularly poignant right now.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:20.467
Those words read: "You, O
Lord, keep my lamp burning;

00:06:20.467 --> 00:06:25.100
my God turns my
darkness into light."

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.433
Thank you very much.
