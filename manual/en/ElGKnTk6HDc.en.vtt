00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
Multiplicate our spirits!
Super-Combination of the Super-Duper-Battery!

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:17.708
We have to find a solution or we're dead!

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:22.996
Give me your electric generators!
Right now!

00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:29.037
Volta! What are you doing?
You will die!

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Maybe, but there is no other way!

00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:35.123
Volta!

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:37.731
When we put two different metals in contact,

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:39.731
an electric current is created.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.550
If we insert a tissue damped with salty water,

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:45.509
the current becomes a lot stronger.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.285
If we pile up 2 or 3 of these things,

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:52.832
the current may become 2 or 3 times stronger,
maybe...

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.090
Yes, maybe!

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.930
It's too risky, Volta!

00:00:56.103 --> 00:00:58.423
It's better than dying without
trying anything!

00:01:07.247 --> 00:01:10.247
Volta, do you remember?
You told us, one day,

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:12.514
that this planet would disappear,

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:15.982
we, we still had our home planet...
do you remember?

00:01:16.303 --> 00:01:19.303
I've completely forgotten.
It's an old story...

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:22.995
Volta, our home is here,
on this planet!

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.615
There is Volta, and everyone,
our life is here!

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.273
We may be born on another planet,
but it doesn't matter!

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.640
We will protect this planet till the end!

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:33.895
My friends...

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:37.645
We won't let you die, Volta!
Never!

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:40.405
Aah, always joking, you, my friends...
You f*cking stupid animals...

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:44.639
Let's go,
it's our last experiment!

00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:47.268
Super-combination!

00:01:48.748 --> 00:01:51.908
Wow! Fantastic power 2!
A little bit more...

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.885
It's my turn!

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.690
Roooah! Fantastic power 3!

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:59.859
Volta!

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.919
And don't forget...

00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:05.173
She, who was abandonned by Furoshiki,
she is with us!

00:02:07.643 --> 00:02:11.323
Yes my friends, our spirits are now one!

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:14.087
Fantastic power 4!

00:02:14.307 --> 00:02:17.307
Let's go!

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:24.043
Super-Combination of the
Super-Duper-Volcanic Volta!

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:46.654
The current becomes stonger 
when we pile up?

00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:50.403
When we put in contact 2 metals,
an electric current is created.

00:02:50.563 --> 00:02:55.003
If we insert a tissue damped with salty water,
the current becomes stronger.

00:02:55.287 --> 00:02:58.287
And if we pile up several of these,

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.529
the current becomes even stronger.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
This is the way Volta invented the
first electric battery!

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:08.224
It has been improved by many others 
to become...

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:11.165
...the battery we know now.

00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:14.345
You are pretty cool Volta, well done!
