00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.895
I'm happy to see that Bible
publishers are coming out with

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:07.211
new printings of the King James Bible

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:10.413
and King James study Bibles,
King James reference Bibles,

00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:12.939
and then with the
higher prices on leather,

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.949
they're coming out with leather
substitutes that hold together pretty well.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.056
But there is a limit to that.

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:23.018
And there's a secret that
these publishers are hiding.

00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:25.937
Hi, I'm David Daniels
from Chick Publications.

00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:32.628
A number of new, King James Bibles,
study Bibles, have come out recently.

00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:37.648
But they have these
anti-KJV, Bible-doubting footnotes!

00:00:37.648 --> 00:00:42.600
Why? Because these
publishers don't believe

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.041
the King James Bible is
God's preserved words in English,

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.246
and they don't want
you to believe it, either!

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:49.802
Why?

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:56.160
Because if you did believe that the
King James Bible is God's preserved words,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.557
then they wouldn't
make a lot of money with you,

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:04.666
buying all their alternate
versions and alternate editions.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:09.336
You see, when I got
the NIV Bible, right here,

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:16.476
when I got the NIV Bible handed
out to me for free, in Bible college,

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.506
the first thing I wanted to do, and did,

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:26.158
is get an NIV Greek-English New
Testament, an NIV Hebrew-English Old Testament,

00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:33.502
and a NIV concordance, and NIV
dictionaries, and Bible handbooks and references,

00:01:33.502 --> 00:01:36.455
all keyed to that version!

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:40.203
But a couple of years later, guess
what happens? A new version comes in!

00:01:40.203 --> 00:01:45.158
And it's got new endorsements.
It's got your favorite ministers,

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:49.794
a new requirement in Bible college,
your preacher is preaching from it,

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:52.974
it's the new preference
that's up on your screen at church,

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:57.516
and wow! That's a LOT of extra sales!

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.019
But here's something you need to know.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:05.598
These big Bible companies
are not owned by Bible-believers.

00:02:05.598 --> 00:02:13.230
Zondervan is under HarperCollins,
under News Corporation, under Rupert Murdoch.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.753
World Bible Publishers that some of you remember,

00:02:15.753 --> 00:02:19.863
was bought a few years ago
in 2003 by Thomas Nelson.

00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:25.533
In 2012, Thomas Nelson was
bought by secular HarperCollins,

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.749
under News Corporation,
under Rupert Murdoch.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.564
That's 55% of the Bibles.
I can stop right there.

00:02:34.564 --> 00:02:38.168
You see, someone could say,

00:02:38.168 --> 00:02:42.858
"David, seriously, why are you
picking on these Bible publishers?

00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:47.007
They don't actually write these books."

00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:50.969
But see, a Publisher
decides what will be published.

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.574
If they don't like the material
that's in it, they will not publish it.

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:56.648
End of story.

00:02:56.648 --> 00:03:06.888
There's a lot of business to be had,
getting people to doubt the word of God.

00:03:06.888 --> 00:03:09.838
1 Timothy 6:10 says,

00:03:09.838 --> 00:03:14.616
10 "For the love of
money is the root of all evil:

00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:18.966
which while some coveted after,
they have erred from the faith,

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:23.066
and pierced themselves
through with many sorrows."

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:29.433
And 2 Corinthians 2:17 says,

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:34.441
17 "For we are not as many,
which corrupt the word of God:

00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:37.124
but as of sincerity, but as of God,

00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:41.445
in the sight of God speak we in Christ."

00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:47.322
See, there's a sinister motive in
getting people to doubt God's preserved words

00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:52.732
It's so they can make money off us
with all these Bibles and Bible materials.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:57.041
Don't let them manipulate you
into spending all your hard-earned money

00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:02.254
on faith-destroying
Bibles, footnotes and materials.

00:04:02.254 --> 00:04:09.304
Get yourself a King James Bible of good
quality and put your trust in God's words.

00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:13.659
Trust me. It will pay off in the end.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.756
God bless you, and have a wonderful day.
