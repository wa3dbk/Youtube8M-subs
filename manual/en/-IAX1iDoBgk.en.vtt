00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:03.460
I’m Cavera, I’m 23 years old and my mom is a visual artists, 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.730
so I started out at home, as a kid, I’d 
 doodle or do a bunch of crap, 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.934
so I said to myself “Man, I should do that on the streets”. 

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:18.692
So I started doing small stencils and so, a quick thing, a simple thing,

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:23.484
I’d just do the tag, do a small stencil, so I started making figures

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:26.959
and been on graffiti for about four years. 

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:03.490
One day I hung out with a friend, like, in an abandon factory

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:08.230
and that was a brand new world to me, like, I 
 got in and was like “Man, look at this shit”,

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:12.210
it looked like a place right out of Call of Duty. 

00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:36.480
There you’re not in a movie scene, you’re right in the middle of dirt,

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:40.330
polution and trash to the extreme.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:44.100
[Using ] The factory as a support it’s awesome.

00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:24.010
I wanted to send an alert message, like a protest to Catholic Church,

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.810
not everything that’s imposed to you should be accepted, 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:32.080
you have to pick that up and question 
 it so you can understand it. 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.520
There’s people that won’t talk about religion, but 
 I don’t have a problem with it.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:43.690
I like messing around, I like provoking… I’m an 
 atheist, you know, so I don’t care. 

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:42.980
I see things differently now, like, a lot of things, cause of graffiti, 

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:47.970
cause of the places I’ve been to, people I 
 met there, like, I don’t know, 

00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:53.230
you walk into an abandoned place, you meet a guy 
 that’s a stoner or, I don’t know, 

00:04:53.226 --> 00:05:00.490
I guy that went to college and had bad luck 
 in life, I’ve met people like that. 

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:03.340
I went to a different direction with my work, 

00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:07.110
I experienced some things that changed me, I don’t know,

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:13.840
a lot changed, at the time I wanted to show one thing 

00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:18.480
and nowadays it’s another thing, I mean, I rethought things throughout the time. 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.500
I’ve worked four years in music, like, in a studio

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:45.280
and I always listened to rock, death metal, hardcore, more extreme things.

00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:50.520
And I’d pick up the art cover of the 
 CDs, vinyl covers I’d buy from the 80’s,

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:55.660
I’d buy Napalm Death and go mad with that cover, it looked like silk,

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:57.680
so that why I’ve been doing stencil to this day. 

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:12.270
You come to this abandoned place, usually there’s stoners only, 

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:16.740
unfortunate people, so sometimes, I don’t know, 

00:06:16.744 --> 00:06:21.280
someone sees an angel like a good thing, but it isn’t always like that,

00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:25.580
sometimes it can be a sad thing, a fallen angel. 

00:06:34.128 --> 00:06:39.830
Doing what you like it’s a pleasure, right, you’re 
 not pissed off the whole day, 

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:42.500
complaining, I don’t know, wanting to do something and not being able to.

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:45.940
You’re doing what you like, even if for a small period of time,

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:51.880
a day of the week, doing that already covers 
 for the whole month, the whole week,

00:06:51.876 --> 00:06:58.450
you wake up in the morning, paint in a factory, do your thing, man,

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:03.390
graffiti is awesome, that lifestyle.
