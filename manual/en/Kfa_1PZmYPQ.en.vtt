00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.600
VERISON 6:  THE  NEW  VILLAGE

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.800
BE &nbsp;THE &nbsp;ARCHITECT &nbsp;OF &nbsp;YOUR &nbsp;OWN &nbsp;EMPIRE

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.800
MONY DOCHEV - CEO OF IMPERIA ONLINE
Every single player will have the chance to personalize their
village in accordance to their own perception and taste.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.500
The users will be able to construct their medieval villages
choosing from buildings in different styles.

00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:28.850
Thus they can create their ultimate look,
however they like it.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.700
They will feel at home
in their own empire.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.850
In this way we will be able
to produce the effect of entering

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.760
not just your account but a unique
virtual space of your own.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600
THE &nbsp;WOW! &nbsp;EFFECT

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.200
This will be the most noticeable change for the users
and will be spotted at a glance.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.600
We have prepared a considerable
number of modules that will foster

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.360
appreciation after at least
a couple of months' constant play.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.600
The village is the first thing
that players face in the game

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.570
and we hope it will produce
the "wow!" effect immediately.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.600
BLOOD, &nbsp;SWEAT &nbsp;AND &nbsp;TEARS

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.100
PETKO SEYMENAROV - HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT
Considering that by village we mean the whole package
of the new mechanism for cunstruction,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.450
the option to freely arrange buildings on the village map
and the user inteface,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.720
the village itself certainly makes it into top 3
of the biggest game functionalities.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.760
From this point of view, it requires
hard development work.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.200
Among the most challinging tasks
was the development of

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.600
a new concept of buildings,
the option for freely arrangement

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.030
in the village, the choice of different styles.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.000
Another very difficult task for us
was the migration to full-screen,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.060
namely the development
of the necessary menus and views.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.600
TEAM &nbsp;PLAY

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.700
The easy part is when you work with people
who have the will and the ability to achieve

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.200
the final results and give off
their best to do so.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.500
That's why the teams in Imperia Online Ltd. are constantly
putting efforts towards the goal,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.660
that is players getting
pleasure from the game,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.860
just as we do, developing it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.100
IMPROVISATION

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.960
The programming of such a module
certainly leaves room

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.840
for innovation and new initiatives.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.200
We had to use some custom-made solutions,
related to the flash environment -

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.600
the visual part with
which the players interact

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.700
and where the village is situated.
We had some non-trivial problems there

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.400
and we overcame them
with our own solutions.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
AWESOME &nbsp;PAINТING

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.600
TODOR IGNATOV - HEAD OF ART TEAM
I dare say it's gonna be way, way more awesome.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.300
We have prepared a set of
brand new buildings

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.200
such as castles, governor offices,
head quarters, roads,

00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:12.500
also lots of decorations and monuments
(fountains, aqueducts, statues and others).

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.450
The new thing is that the stages of construction
will be visible.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.650
I would like to point out here
that the variations

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.670
for castles alone are more than 70.
This is only for the castles.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.920
The fortresses, I mean.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.940
The whole art department
dived into the creation

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.320
of hundreds of medieval buildings' concepts.
We looked for the most appropriate style.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.650
This took us more than 2 months hard work.
After that we formed three 3-member teams,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.850
which had to develop
the new village for Version 6.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.100
Within a 6-month period we created
over 400 different buildings.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.600
A &nbsp;NEW &nbsp;WAY &nbsp;OF &nbsp;THINKING

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.100
The main challenge that our artists faced was
that they had to change their way of thinking -

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.400
because in isometric graphics
there is no perspective.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.500
The scale of the pictures
also caused us some hardship.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.000
They had to be tiny
but with exquisite details.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.660
This is quite difficult
and requires a lot of efforts.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.670
At first the teams didn't have
this kind of knowledge

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.100
but gradually acquired
the necessary skills.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.600
SONGS &nbsp;ABOUT &nbsp;KNIGHTS

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.250
HRISTO HRISTOV - COMPOSER / SOUND DESIGNER
Because of the fact that Imperia Online
is played all over the world

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300
and is an extremely diverse game,
it gives the dream platform

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.580
for career fulfillment of every composer.

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:57.600
Firstly, because his music would be heard all around the planet,
and secondly, because he can use all his abilities.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.800
The music for Version 6 will be adaptive.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.700
It will change along
with the state of the domains

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.700
and with the occurrence
of important events.

00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:12.100
Luckily, I work with people who trust me

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.015
and the possibilities to convey different moods
and atmospheres are almost endless.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.670
Of course, there are cases, for example the making of the
trailers of the game,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.970
when there are boundaries
coming form the length,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.170
the synchrony and the overall concept of the video.
Then we have to take all these into consideration.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.000
However, when you work with a professional team
and there is good communication,

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.400
the limits are broken fast.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.200
DREAMS, &nbsp;REALIZATION, &nbsp;PERFECTIONISM &nbsp;AND &nbsp;LIFE

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.240
We wrote all kinds of music in order to reflect
all possible situations in the game.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.200
The main goal is to have music
pulsing with life.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.760
The new village of Imperia Online
is a dream come true for me.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.270
Up until now we have achieved
everything that we wanted.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.290
We do not make compromises with the quality.
Ever.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.900
THE &nbsp;NEW &nbsp;VILLAGE &nbsp;COMES &nbsp;IN &nbsp;SEPTEMBER &nbsp;2013
