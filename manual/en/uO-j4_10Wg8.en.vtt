Alright so this series is going to be how
to draw female cartoon characters freehand.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.820
I'll tell you just right off the bat female
cartoon characters are no walk in the park,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.010
particularly compared with say male cartoon
characters. Now I honestly don't know why

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:27.650
this is, could be any number of reasons. Honestly,
I think it's just because the female body

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.870
is more of a work of art. It also just seems
like that when it comes to drawing female

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:51.230
characters, there's less of a margin for mistakes.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.949
Impossible to really explain why, honestly.
I don't really know I haven't given much thought

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.250
to it. All I know is when it comes to drawing
women I definitely take my time and I don't

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.110
just rush into any particular part of the
process. Just because more often than not,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.460
it seems like when you do rush you wind up
making way more mistakes with women; that

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.320
are a lot harder to correct for some reason
when drawing female cartoon characters less

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:28.909
leeway . Mistakes just seem more permanent
for some reason. Still the goal this series,

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.420
this particular series is to hopefully help
you get comfortable enough to where you can

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.810
create a whole line of female characters freehand.
Feel comfortable enough doing it so you?re

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:54.130
not constantly second guessing yourself. So
basically that what's this series is about

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.800
Female Cartoon Characters from A-Z. And hopefully
when we're done, you'll feel just a little

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.240
bit more comfortable drawing female characters
from scratch. Alright so here we go we start

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.549
with a blank slate...
