00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.440
This video is brought to you by Sailrite.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.269
In this video we will demonstrate using HH-66
Vinyl Cement underwater.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.700
We’re going to use some clear vinyl from
Sailrite this is a 20 gauge Plastipane, but

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.370
other vinyl products could be used also as
long as they do not have a protective coating

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.300
applied to the surface.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.120
It is important to cut the vinyl patch out
so that it is a round or oval shape.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.110
This shape results in the best adhesion for
the edges of the patch.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.829
The round can sizes of HH-66 have a brush
applicator built into the top.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.829
Here you can see we are applying the HH-66
Vinyl Cement to the clear vinyl window material.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.780
Be sure to coat the surface thoroughly and
insure that the extreme edges are covered

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.399
well in the cement.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.069
Since we are applying this patch underwater
we will fold the patch in half forming a taco.

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:59.950
This should not be done if applying on a normal
out of water application.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.050
Immediately submerge the patch in the water
and position it above your application vinyl

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.750
repair location.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.780
Then unfold the patch and apply over the vinyl
to be repaired.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.390
This repair vinyl should be free of dirt and
algae for best adhesion.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.780
Work out as many air bubbles as possible assuring
that the patch is pressed firmly against the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.390
repair vinyl.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.550
As always for the strongest bond it is best
to wait 24 hours before testing the bond.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.590
We will not remove this vinyl from water,
it will stay submerged at all times until

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.590
the following day for inspection.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.740
One day has passed and we are ready to check
the strength of the HH-66 Vinyl Cement.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.360
Angela will try to find an edge where she
can pull the patch off the vinyl repair.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:06.020
Here is our weakest edge, but she cannot remove
the patch easily.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:21.530
Let’s get Jeff to try he is slightly stronger.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.260
Jeff will try to remove the patch will a pair
of pliers.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.180
As you can see the bond is excellent even
when applied underwater.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.150
If you look closely the vinyl coating of the
Shelter-Rite brand vinyl material is being

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.580
ripped off the substrate Polyester in some
locations.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.280
That means the HH-66 Vinyl Cement bond is
so strong that it is ripping apart the fabric

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.760
rather than the bond failing.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.500
Use HH-66 to successfully repair vinyl pool
liners and mush more.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.810
HH-66 Vinyl Cement is available in various
can sizes at Sailrite.com.
