00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.610
Jarrah: Another characteristic that the propagandists
point to are tiny craters supposedly caused

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.500
by micrometeorites, otherwise known as zap-pits.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.579
On page 175 of the Desert Publications edition
of his book, Bill Kaysing discussed a method

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.989
that NASA could have used to fake the tiny
craters.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.989
“There is a laboratory in Santa Barbara
that specializes in extremely high-speed impact

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.019
studies.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:51.010
They’ve achieved velocities of 32,000 feet
per second with a two stage projectile system.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.320
Obviously, rock specimens could be exposed
to high-speed particles thus simulating small

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.440
particle meteorite bombardment.”

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.800
Here Kaysing offers up one of his famous “I
know a guy who knows a guy” stories.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.729
It’s no more than a bare assertion fallacy.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.560
Kaysing says that some unidentified company
in Santa Barbara had equipment back in the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.640
sixties that was capable of emulating micrometeoroid
impacts and thus produced the zap pits found

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.860
in NASA’s fake moon rocks.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.960
So, why didn’t Kaysing give us the name
of the company?

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.530
Was it a secret?

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.899
No.

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.649
Was he protecting a source?

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.100
No.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.939
He just didn’t want to make it easy for
anybody to check the facts.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.189
It’s not impossible to figure out who the
company was by looking at the clues Kaysing

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.649
left us.

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.070
Kaysing said this laboratory used a two stage
projectile system capable of 32,000 fps.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.909
OK.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.420
He’s obviously talking about a two-stage
light-gas gun.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.740
Two-stage describing the design, light-gas
describing the gas in the pump tube, usually

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.590
hydrogen or helium.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.570
I’m not going to waste valuable class time
describing how this gun works, but if you’ve

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.229
ever played with a pellet gun you already
understand the concept thoroughly.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.310
The salient point here is that the projectile
has to fit snuggly into the barrel, if they

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.080
wanted to maintain control of it and hit their
[intended] target.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.770
Now, there were about a dozen of these guns
in labs across the US in the sixties.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.130
One was in Santa Barbara, at the General Motors
Defense Research Laboratories.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.410
Long story short, they were hurling 1-1/4
inch metallic disks (either aluminum, or copper,

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.440
or tungsten) at targets (sheets of steel and
other metals) and measuring the shock wave

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.140
characteristics to calculate the shock Hugoniot
equations of state.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.840
In other words, they were probably trying
to figure out if they could induce enough

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.820
shock or vibration to detonate a Soviet ICBM
reentering the earth’s atmosphere, by throwing

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.050
a fast moving cloud of custom designed shrapnel
at it.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.650
That’s my educated guess as to what their
“defense” contract was about.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.690
They had more things to worry about back in
the sixties than manufacturing moon rocks.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.560
The limiting factor in using this gun is that
the barrel was designed for 1-1/4 inch projectiles

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.260
weighing 100 to 200 grams.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.570
If they tried to fire microgram sized shot
with this gun, they would have difficulty

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.730
controlling it.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.810
They’d have no directionality.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.940
If more than one high-velocity shot hit a
silicate rock simultaneously, the multiple

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.620
stress points would probably fracture the
rock.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.110
In fact, if they used too much shot they would
pulverize their targets.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.170
And if they used too little shot, it would get 
hung up in the sabot or get lost in the barrel.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.380
But most importantly, this gun fell short of the
32,000 fps bogie that Kaysing claimed it had.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.140
So, maybe he didn’t even know about this gun
afterall and he just made the whole thing up.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.180
That’s possible.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.840
Then from a more practical standpoint, how
would anyone back in the sixties know what

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.370
a micrometeoroid impact looked like?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.100
How would they know how to simulate it correctly?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.420
What data would they have used to verify that
their projectiles were the right shape, size,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.270
weight, material, and traveling at the correct
speed?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.520
NASA performed their first micrometeoroid
impact studies in 1966 and 1967, by sending

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.810
detectors to moon on the five Lunar Orbiter
missions.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.439
The data NASA collected from that experiment
was used to calculate a risk assessment and

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:29.840
determine how much protection was necessary
for the Apollo astronauts and their spacecraft.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.550
“Artificial” micrometeoroid impact studies
were not even dreamed of until the long-term

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.430
missions came around - the Shuttle, Skylab
and the International Space Station.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.930
Jarrah: If NASA were concerned about distinguished
traces of projectiles, being found in the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.349
fake moon rocks, why wouldn’t they just
use projectiles made from the same metallic

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.370
elements found in the samples?

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.680
Such as aluminum, which, as a matter of fact,
is exactly what NASA does today to simulate

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.009
micrometeoroid impacts on the International
Space Station.

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.080
Aluminum pellets?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.050
First off, ACTUAL micrometeoroids bear no
mineralogical or chemical similarity to the

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.710
aluminum alloy pellets used during today’s
micrometeoroid simulations.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.520
Like their big brothers, the meteorites, micrometeoroids
are made of rock, mostly iron and a few oxides.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.239
ESA, mainly, farms out this type of testing
today for the International Space Station.

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:31.919
They’re testing the long-term reliability
of the exterior of their spacecraft and the

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.189
effect on spacecraft functionality by shooting
the hull with aluminum alloy pellets.

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:42.840
And although there is aluminum in some moon
rocks, it’s in the form of aluminum oxide

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.870
and fine metallic grains.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.289
You definitely wouldn’t expect to find aluminum
clumped around ALL the zap pits.

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.949
And the aluminum pellets used to do micrometeoroid
impact studies on earth would be made of an

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:00.729
aluminum ALLOY, and they would leave an obvious
trace of metallics at the surface during impact

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.249
and down through the tiny boreholes.

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:08.810
It might be suspicious to a lab tech who cross-sections
one of NASA’s moon rocks and by performing

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.479
a basic spectrographic analysis identifies
a common aluminum alloy on the inside of a

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.909
moon rock, an alloy that is knowingly manufactured
on earth.

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.259
That wouldn’t fool a geologist’s grandmother.

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.909
Jarrah: I have never claimed everything Bill
Kaysing says is accurate.

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:31.310
As wishful as it is, there will never be any
material from either side of the fence that

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.320
will be without error.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.520
My attitude is not simply because Kaysing
said it.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.729
My stance is:
Bill said it, and I have verified it.

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.090
Really?

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.659
So how did Jarrah verify this particular claim?

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.860
Did he give us the name of the company that
supposedly did the micrometeoroid impact

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.580
studies in the sixties?

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.239
No.
0:06:54.239,0:06:00.400
Did he demonstrate a tiny ring of aluminum
alloy exists around even one zap pit?

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.279
No.

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:08.849
Instead, just as he always does, Jarrah blindly
accepts and repeats Grandpa Kaysing’s nonsense

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:11.289
without question.

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.669
So far, NONE of Kaysing’s claims, which
were subsequently “verified” by Jarrah

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:22.999
and used in any of his videos that I’ve
seen, has passed even the most casual inspection.

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:29.240
Kaysing’s Conspiracist’s Bible appears
to be nothing but TOTAL speculation and innuendo.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.949
And Jarrah is doing almost as well with HIS
groundless moon rock claims.

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:40.949
Ciao moon hoax conspirators, wherever you
are.
