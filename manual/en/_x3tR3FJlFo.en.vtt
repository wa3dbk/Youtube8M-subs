00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.220
Hi Guys! I'm Laura Vitale. On this episode of Laura in the Kitchen I'm gonna show you how to make

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.400
homemade

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.950
strawberry jam. Yes! It is...uh

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.390
I do it every single year. I've been
doing-I've been making strawberry

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.239
jam since I was a little kid with my grandma so this you know it-it's something to

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.040
look forward to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.250
every year as soon as strawberry season is here,
homemade strawberry jam production is on

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.870
its way

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.890
Let take [INCOHERENT] ingredients so we can get started

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.750
You're gonna need some

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.879
fresh strawberries, some sugar

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.929
fruit pectin, and lemon. Now if you want
to use different berries

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.329
That's gonna make the difference on
how much sugar you're gonna need

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.329
so that is a lot of sugar but that's just is what makes it so delicious!

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.449
Now if you're planning on doing canning like
I'm going to be showing you how to do

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.170
today

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.630
We're preserving it. You're gonna need youre canning kit.  You're gonna need some mason jars which I have

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.640
simmering right now

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.320
in a large large pot and your gonna need just some essential tools

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.350
that comes to canning. I have a canning funnel here. I just have a few different

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.049
tongs

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.210
and this is just to screw on the lid and this is a knife

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.229
and also a magnet which I show you what
we're gonna need that for

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.329
But I took my canning jars and I put the jars
in my large pot

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.180
there that's filled with water and those are
simmering and I also have the lids

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.399
in a separate pan and simmering as well

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.189
but just the lid and not the screw on tops. So first things first

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.840
let's go into it and actually get started.
Shall we? Okay in this big pan I'm gonna

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.450
put on

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.710
medium high heat. Get that ready. First thing Imma do is mash up some of my berries

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.979
I have clean hands. I think it makes the best tool

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.960
and I'm just gonna squish these around.
My strawberries are all mashed up

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
I like to leave some chunky because I do like some chunks in my jam but you can do this

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.159
however you like

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.289
I'm gonna put that into my pan here

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.210
and then I'm gonna grab a knife because I don't
have one on hand

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.740
Juice my lemon

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.680
That's good

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.810
I'm gonna let this stir and I'm gonna let this come to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.950
a boil and then I'll show you the next step.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.280
I'm gonna add in my fruit pectin

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.700
and this is what gives it that jammie
consistency. Stir that in really well

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.120
Now I'm gonna put in

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.400
all the sugar and it is a lot of sugar but
that is just

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.379
Thats what it takes to make homemade jam

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.420
So I'm gonna give this a stir really well

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.500
so that sugar is fully incorporated

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.340
The sugar is all mixed in

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.209
Now I'm gonna put in my candy thermometer and
I'm gonna let that come to a boil

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.599
and boil away until it reaches 220
degrees

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.280
My mixture is up to 220

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.100
Take out my thermometer

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.020
Give this a stir and making jam is a science

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.700
so there are-these tools I feel like you need to have

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.870
So now what I'm gonna do

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.220
I'm gonna skim off all the foam that's collected on the top

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.390
or much of it as you can manage

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.819
I've skimmed all my foam or as most of it off the top

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.989
so now ready to pretty much get canning. So

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.299
you take your mason jars that have been simmering in water

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.440
You get rid of the water

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.280
Line them up

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.130
Okay. So now...you take-I'm actually gonna

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.430
make just a little bit-you take your canning

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.549
canning funnel put it in each one and you're gonna

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.519
fill it up til you have a quarter-inch left
at the top

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.620
of your mason jar. And I'll show you-Just like that!

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.659
See that? That's perfect. So now I'm gonna continue

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:14.939
to fill each one

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.960
Last one

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.820
Really important you take a clean

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.820
wet cloth or paper towel and you run it

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.789
around all the edges. Now that you have them all filled either with a canning knife or

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.259
just a regular night make sure it's
really really clean

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.590
Your gonna run around the side and this gets

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.039
rid of any air bubbles. You don't want
any air bubbles when your preserving

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.080
Now

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.220
with the opposite side which is why I
love this little tool

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.299
which is-because it's a magnet you
pick up

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.699
You pick up each

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.150
each lid that was simmering and you sit it right on top

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.320
centered. You wanna make sure it's centered

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.920
on top

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.140
Last one

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.500
And now you're gonna put on your screw top

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.900
which you don't plan on so so tight. You
just wanna put it on

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.020
tigh enough that its holding everything together

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.009
Now that everything is sealed I'm gonna put these into my canning basket

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.789
and I have my pot back on the burner
here now I'm waiting for that to come to

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:25.830
a high boil

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.270
and once it does I'm going to put these with
the basket and all

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.620
right in there and I'm going to let them boil away for twenty minutes

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.039
Not 21 minutes. Not 19. 20

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.059
minutes

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.590
My jam is ready. I put my jars in boiling water and I left them and I

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.050
I covered them and let them cook for 20
minutes

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.400
You hear the pop?

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.600
If you hear the pop

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.660
Your jars are sealed

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.540
That is a good sound my friend

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.860
and just like that now now you can go
in and get em nice and tight

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.960
Tighten all your lids

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.110
Tighten the last one. Now here's something that I have always done

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.800
my grandmother's all we've done this. I
thought the on counter

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.130
for 24 hours and that just assures

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.720
that all of them are sealed properly. Don't
bother them otherwise if some of them

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.630
haven't popped

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.780
yet and you're bothering them chances
are what

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.349
chances are that they might not seal
properly if you just mess with them so

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.419
just put them in the counter for 24 hours

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.699
just ensure that all they're all popped and they're all sealed. Once you hear that pop

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.660
you know you got to go but I just like
to take that extra twenty four hours

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.919
just to make sure

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.460
and that's it. You got homemade strawberry
jam on hand

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.750
for whenever your hearts desire and these make awesome

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.009
awesome gifts by the way. Hope you enjoyed spending
time with me

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.479
I do have the recipe written on laurainthekitchen.com

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.740
step-by-step as to what you need to do
when it comes to cannning and making your

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.729
own strawberry jam

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.050
at home. I hope you enjoy spending time
with me time and I'll see you next time

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.709
Bye bye [Music]
