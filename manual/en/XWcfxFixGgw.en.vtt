[♪ upbeat music ♪]

00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:10.958
What's up beautiful people? It
is your homegirl Ms. Shameless,

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:12.250
all up in your building.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.833
And this is my
updated curly hair routine,

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.417
all up in it to win it,

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.958
you guys have been
asking me on Instagram,

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:23.375
here on YouTube, and I haven't
had much hair to do a video,

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:26.917
but now that I'm growing it
in, and it's actually curling,

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.542
I figured let's start
the summer off right.

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:31.000
For all the girls
that are rocking

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.750
short curly hair this summer

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.333
this is [foreign language].

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.667
I do the shampoo
and the conditioning

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.750
super fast and
simple, because it is short,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.333
so shampoo, lather,
wash, condition, leave it on,

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.750
deal with the rest
of your body, wash.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.208
And then the magic happens
when you style, that's the key.

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:50.208
Once you let your hair air dry,

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.250
you can be a product
junkie, like myself,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.125
or you can stop
and call it a day,

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.375
but I will show you what I do.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.042
I like to use this
leave-in conditioner,

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:04.667
which is nearly
gone, Kinky Curly,

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:05.917
but use your favorite.

00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:07.833
I put it in my hair
when it's soaking wet,

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:10.917
and then I let it
dry, as much as possible,

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:12.542
completely dry or almost dry.

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:17.708
Then I use my sealant,
which is my DIY Shea butter

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:20.083
that did I with
Ms. HeyFranHey Hey,

00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:21.750
so I used that to
seal in the moisture.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.458
And also to like add
more to texture to my hair,

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:26.625
because this one
doesn't do much.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:29.083
So I like to style the front,

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:31.500
because that's
where it's my longest,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.625
and just finger style.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:36.667
I like to play up the
little finger wave baby hairs.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:40.917
And then I use my
favorite EcoStyler gel,

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:42.208
I've used this for years.

00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:44.208
It's a few bucks
in the drugstore,

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:45.417
and it will last you forever.

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.125
So you take more gel,

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.375
and then you just get these,

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:52.667
just get these
puppies right here, OK.

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:55.625
Did you miss these guys? 
Did you miss these curls?

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.083
So I style with this,

00:01:57.083 --> 00:02:00.375
and I style with this
to finger wave it out.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:01.625
Oh, oh, oh.

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:03.458
S-curl your way on the side.

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:06.042
Oop, ooooo-oop.

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.208
You can get like
really all up in it,

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:10.708
but depending on
your hair texture, too,

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:14.042
maybe if you have tighter curls
you could do like more smaller.

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:16.167
Figure out what
looks cute on you,

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:18.208
because I don't
want it to look too,

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:19.542
I did this, but I did.

00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:20.667
I want it to look natural,

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:23.708
but not like so done
up, so I'll remove it.

00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:25.833
But make sure you use
product that doesn't flake,

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.958
and if it does you
got to like make sure

00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.167
you don't see those flakes,
because that's not cute, OK.

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:35.875
And then when it's dry I
pry off the finger wave,

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.458
so it doesn't look like I
glued my hair to my head,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:39.875
which I did. [laughs]

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:43.667
And that's the look,
this is the completed look.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:46.125
Profile. Profile. Mug shot.

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:51.417
See when you give your
face and the mug, it's cute.

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:54.208
And that in a nutshell
is my curly hair video.

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:56.125

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.333

I have a secret giveaway,

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:03.583
I guess it's not so
much secret anymore,

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:04.833
but I'm not going to
tell you what it is,

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.292
just read the description box,

00:03:06.292 --> 00:03:08.500
and it's a bunch of
cool, awesome products, OK.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.667
That's it for me.

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.333

how you rock your do,

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:13.750

And that's it.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.708
Remember to do you,
be you, and stay true.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.375
Be shameless.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:35.375
