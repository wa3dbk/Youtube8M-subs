Sergio Limone interview, First, 2 cameras.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I am Sergio Limone, good morning,
and I graduated in Turin Polytechnic in 1972

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.000
with a thesis about Formula Monza,
a single-seater powered by the engine of the 500 Giardiniera.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When I turned 24 years old,
I was employed in Abarth and I remained in Abarth,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
with of course all corporate transformations
(Fiat Auto racing, Fiat Auto sporting activities, N. Technology, etc.)

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
until 2005

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I dealt initially of Fiat, Fiat 131 Rally, as helping boy

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:32.000
because there was to do the tests
and I ran also because the staff was really minimized.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Then as responsible I worked for the Lancia Rally Design,
better known as 037,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.000
then I managed the S4 development (not design),

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the years of Delta always lived as responsible
for the design and development vehicle,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.000
having fun a lot because , must be said that I have been very lucky 
because I found the golden years of Italian motor sport.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Claudio Lombardi interview, First, 2 cameras.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Well, I'm Claudio Lombardi, I'm a mechanical engineer,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:21.000
I was born in 1942 and I began working in the Fiat Group in 1968

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.500
at what was then the Research Group,
which later would become the Fiat Research Centre.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:39.500
Since the beginning 80s I became Technical Manager
of the Lancia Racing,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.500
which at that time had moved as logistics headquarters
to the Abarth in Corso Marche.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.500
At that time the technology was proving that to win in the rally
was necessary to develop the technology of the 4-wheel drive,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.500
Fiat had no such technology.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.500
Ghidella engineer, at this point, decided to finance
and make a big effort, both technical and financial,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to ensure that Lancia Racing could build a 4-wheel drive car,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.000
which was to be the car that allowed to win the Rally, but also
the laboratory car which was used to develop these technologies

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.000
that were missing as know-how to the Fiat Group.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:41.000
Then he asked us to develop this car but keep in close contact
with the production and the design standard,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.000
as it really happened: at this point comes the DELTA S4.
