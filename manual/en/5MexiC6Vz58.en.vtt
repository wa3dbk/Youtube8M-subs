00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.900
When I was in grade nine, I went to a high school that shared its building with another high school.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.080
Basically, St. Marcellinus was a newly built high school,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.400
and at the time, we only had two years worth of schools to occupy the building:

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.440
the freshmen, and the sophomores.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.040
And because of that, almost half of the classrooms in the school were vacant.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.020
This allowed another school, St. Joan of Arc, to use those available spaces until their school was built.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.840
I didn't really think much of it,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.560
until I met Joyce.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.140
"Hey Dom, I don't think you make it obvious enough that you're not using real names in your stories."

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.080
"What, really, you mean people are actually searching 'Erin Kim' on Facebook?"

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.020
"Yeah."

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.040
"Hmm."

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.660
Anyway, my first period was French,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.340
and the classroom happened to be at the border [at] which my school,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.900
and St. Joan of Arc, were separated.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.560
One day, as I was waiting in front of my classroom for the teacher to come and open the door for us,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.740
I happened to catch glimpse of a cute girl from the other school who was also waiting for her teacher.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.820
"Dom, it seems like you get into a lot of shit when you

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.000
notice a cute girl.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.560
Is this gonna be one of those stories?"

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.500
"Shh, shh, just,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.700
just sit down. Let me tell the story."

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.440
So this continued nearly every day.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.940
I get to my class early

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.300
just so I could get a chance to look at the cute girl before she entered her class,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.740
like the creep I am.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.520
I think I did it often enough where she eventually recognized me, because

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.220
one day I came across her Asian Avenue website.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.480
If you don't know what that questionably exclusive website was,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.880
it was basically a Myspace,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.800
but, you guessed itâ€”

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.060
for Asians!

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.160
So I found her page, [and] recognized from the pictures that she was the same girl.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.740
13-year-old me said, "what the heck? I'll leave a message."

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.980
I said "Hey, you look familiar.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.660
Do you go to St. Joan of Arc?"

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.860
She said, "Yeah! you go to St. Marcellinus right?"

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.860
[GASPS]

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.780
(I've been noticed...)

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.200
And that was the start of a new friendship.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.280
We started meeting up before our first classes, and although they were short, I cherished it.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.480
We even began strategically planning the paths we took to our next classes,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.520
just so we could briefly run into each other.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.400
She gave me this nickname,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.280
Domz,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.540
and it just stuck with me. I liked it,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880
even though it was just adding a letter to my name.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.760
She found my art really impressive,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.180
and having her support really made me want to do better and improve my skills

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.840
I still remember her saying,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.300
"Domz, if you ever become a famous artist, don't forget me!"

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.040
Eventually we found ourselves talking every day, whether it was at school or online.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.640
I didn't have a phone, believe it or not, little six-year-old with an iPad.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.100
I really liked her,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.620
but was it worth the risk of spilling my feelings

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.560
and possibly making the friendship awkward?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.960
"Yes"

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.160
I mean, I was happy where we were.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.160
We shared personal secrets with each other.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.080
She came to me whenever she had problems; I came to her with mine.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.640
Intimacy was probably the only thing separating us from being a couple.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640
I became acquainted with one of her close friends,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.460
and even she thought I should ask her out.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.860
But I've never done that before.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.220
I've never had a girlfriend at that point,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.213
and everything before that was merely a series of crushes on girls

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.820
that I never had a chance with.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.560
But I thought to myself that

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.420
if I was ever gonna have a first, she would be my pick

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.440
I decided to tell her how I felt.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.420
I believe that had a good chance seeing as how we were best friends.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.000
We already had that bond, that trust.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.700
I told myself that if she does say no,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.900
I would respectfully accept it and still remain friends with her.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.700
Easier said than done...

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.860
and...

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.540
that's what happened.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.840
I wasn't sure if there was someone else or anything, but regardless,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760
she just didn't see me in that way.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.060
I felt crushed (pun intended),

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.480
but it felt amazing to get that off my chest.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.540
She didn't find it too weird.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.140
She was an open-minded girl.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.400
And yes, I titled this "Best Friend Zone" because that is what it was.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.400
I was in a realm of the relationship of which I could not proceed to the next.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.240
I'm not using the term as a means to bolster the egos of over-entitled "nice guys."

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.460
She didn't owe me anything.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.820
I'm not saying that just because her friends and I thought we would be a good couple, [means] we should have been one.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.555
I'm simply saying that although I didn't exactly

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.440
get the girl,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.100
I was happy that I still got to stay best friends with her,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.360
and even though I could never breach that barrier

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.760
I was alright with it.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.060
If you're one of those people that claim you got friendzoned

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.520
but complain about it like she owes your relationship,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.850
then that's not the friendzone, mateâ€”that's the pity zone.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.729
Politely accept the rejection and move on.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.100
Anyway, I obviously didn't get over her right away

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.770
I accepted her answer, but my feelings still lingered along with questions of why I was inadequate as a boyfriend.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.040
But I guess that's the mistake most people make when facing rejection.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.180
They just invest so much into one person that they get tunnel vision,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.060
and when they get rejected by them they can't fathom the possibility that maybe they're adequate for someone else.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.880
I came to realize that, and soon enough Joyce and I were back to our usual friendship.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.840
She became interested in other guys; I became interested in other girls.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.520
But we were there for each other.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.600
In a way, it was probably for the best that we didn't end up together

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.000
Because at the end of my sophomore year, I came to her with some news.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.620
"My dad got a job in Virginia."

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.880
"I'm moving."

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.160
"No no no no, Dom, you come back here, and you continue this right now."

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.420
Okay, okay! Geez...

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.720
can't appreciate a cliffhanger?

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.760
"I'm moving."

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.740
And this definitely wouldn't be the last time I hurt someone by leaving them.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.140
We've been best friends for two years, and it wasn't easy for us to say goodbye.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.860
I had no idea how long I'd be in Virginia. I couldn't promise her I'd be back,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.880
but I definitely visited from time to time.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.960
We still kept in touch online, but she wanted to keep her updates special, so she preferred to write letters.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.800
However, while we had all these methods of communicating,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.960
we were in two different worlds. Two different environments.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.500
I made new friends,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.540
and when her school finally moved to their new building, she found new ones as well.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.320
We started talking less.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.740
Eventually it drifted apart; not as total strangers.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.460
We would still be what you consider... friends,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.400
but not like before.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.400
And that happens.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.060
We can't always find someone or something to blame for it.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.210
As long as you enjoyed the experience, then it was definitely worthwhile.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.300
And even if you didn't,

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.080
it would at least make a good story.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.480
[The feels...]
