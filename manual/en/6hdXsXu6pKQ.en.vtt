00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.350
How do we hold and handle our pet snakes?

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.460
It's very important number one, to understand
the type of snake that you have.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.250
Now this is a ball python.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.200
He's a constrictor and it's very important
that you give him something that the back

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.460
end of him can hold onto.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.900
So the back one-third you want to wrap around
your arm.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.949
For the smaller ones around the fingers, and
then control the middle half, and then these

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.080
guys are docile, so give them some room.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.180
Let them look around.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.850
You don't need to control the head, all right.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.910
The snake will go where the head goes so if
the snake is heading this way, it's a simple

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.500
thing of just moving the snake in a different
direction, and that's how you can control

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
them.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.930
They go the way that their head is pointed.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.200
If you have to control the head, it is very
important that you hold along the base of

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.040
the head so that way you can control the teeth
and the biting area.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.309
But if you notice I don't have a lot of pressure
along the bottom of the snake, and the reason

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.630
for that is that's where the windpipe is.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270
It goes down into the lung.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.930
If we squeeze in this area here, then this
poor guy can't breath, and he will get a lot

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.520
more feisty than just by controlling his head.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.560
So any constrictor, control the back so he
feels secure, support the middle and most

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.540
of the time, your docile larger snakes are
fine.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.880
Now remember that with your larger pythons
and constrictors, if your snake is longer

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.650
than four feet, you need one person for every
four feet, because they are very powerful

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.270
snakes and if they wrap around you, around
your neck or something of that nature, you're

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.909
going to need someone to help unwind the snake.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.409
They are stronger in the front half and weaker
in the back half, so if you have to unwind

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.480
them, you'll unwind from the tail to the head.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.270
Another snake that we're going to talk about
is a garter snake.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.189
Now the reason for that is, is that this one
is a common pet but they aren't constrictors,

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.509
so they tend to want to scoot when you bring
them out.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.840
So when you bring these snakes out, it's a
good idea you have two hands and intertwine

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.040
the snake in your fingers, and have your thumb
there support again, the middle half of the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040
body.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.599
Let the head explore and take a look and this
guy is very, very secure.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.730
But if he was a little more nervous and would
scoot, you have an area that you can hold

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.790
onto before he takes off.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.900
If you were to just lay him down you'd be
surprised how quickly a garter snake would

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.900
take off.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.660
They are less inclined to constrict, they
are not constrictors.They're more inclined

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.660
to run.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.450
So your garter snake you want them to intertwine.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.090
Don't squeeze, hold them loosely, but always
be on the ready with your garter that he doesn't

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.450
off, and there's a few helpful hints on how
to hold your snakes.
