00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.800
We won't bother you anymore.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.520
Good day, sir.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.920
What the...?

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.140
Come on, Clippy! Let's get out of here!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.980
What was that?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.780
Don't ask me...

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.140
Ray, may I ask you something?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.180
W... what is it, Alec?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.700
Well, what the hell is this?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.640
I don't know!

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.760
I'm going to find out what's going on...

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.800
Excuse me...

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.400
...did you hire us?

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.620
Who are you?

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.220
I never called a band!

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.980
Yes you did, mom.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.760
Yequil...

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.580
...where did you get those?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.500
I invented them, mom!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.840
You liar!

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.920
Why did you call us?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.840
I'm tired of you guys practicing all the day!

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.140
I can't concentrate when I'm doing my evil inventions!

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.800
It's time for my revenge!

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.660
Well, I'm out of here.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.260
You're not going anywhere!

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.300
And who will stop us?

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.080
Oh...

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.700
...them.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.460
Great!

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.040
Yequil, what are you doing?

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440
It's none of your business mother!

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660
Okay, Robo-Yequils!

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.720
Let's show this clowns who's the boss!

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.720
Robo-Yequils...

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.900
...it's time to take out the trash!

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.640
Okay, what's next? A... flying pig!?

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.400
Let's see who's the favorite of the crowd!

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.660
Hello dudes!

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.620
Obey your master, master...!

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.180
You suck!

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.640
Oh, come on!

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960
Do you have any idea what music is?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.180
Okay, it's happy birthday time!

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.840
Uh...?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.040
Just follow me.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.460
Hi, we're the Lyosacks, and we're gonna play a song called "Happy Birthday"!

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.660
Here it goes.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.120
Happy Birthday... to you.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.760
Happy Birthday... to you!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.060
Happy Birthday, Evil Yequil...

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.200
Happy Birthday...

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.280
...to you!

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.740
Wow, that was amazing!

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.520
I don't even remember what I'm doing here...

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.460
Well, as you can see, we are the favorite of that crowd.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.480
So let us go.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.040
This is not the end, Lyosacks! I'll be back!

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.060
Yequil...?

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.460
Mom, you're embarrassing me...

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.580
Well... this was weird.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.980
Yeah, but at least we know that we're a good band.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.320
Uh, so tell me, how are we gonna find our home?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.240
Did we really take a taxi to come here!?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.400
Nice party...

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.000
Ya... quil...?
