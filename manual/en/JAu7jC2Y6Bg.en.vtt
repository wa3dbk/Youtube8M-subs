00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:08.500
Agriculture

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.930
Agriculture is a key industry in Great Britain.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.550
Different sectors of the agricultural industry
would cover growth of cereals, production

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.750
of milk and dairy products and the production
of meat animals.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:29.460
775 million birds; 15.6 million sheep, lambs
and goats; 7.9 million pigs and over 2 million

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.980
cattle are processed each year in Great Britain
in 400 slaughterhouses and game handling establishments

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.480
The Food Standards Agency Operations Group
(FSA) is there to protect public health and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.770
animal health and welfare with a vision of
safe meat produced from well cared for healthy

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.450
animals.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.230
Meat Inspection has been carried out in meat
premises for many years with the FSA delivering

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.430
these controls since 2000 before which meat
inspection was carried out by the same personnel

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.689
but working for the Ministry for Agriculture
and Food and previous to this Local Authorities

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.680
The FSA Operations Group delivers official
controls in approved meat premises to protect

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.240
public health and animal health and welfare

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.979
Farmers have a critical role in supplying
well cared for and healthy animals into the

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.569
food chain

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.659
This farmer is working with his Private Veterinary
Surgeon in ensuring the animals for sending

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.799
for slaughter are correctly identified and
accompanied by the required traceability documents.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.430
Cattle traceability is achieved by cattle
passports which is unique to them

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.899
Traceability

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.820
Animal and meat traceability is critical in
ensuring safe meat.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.000
Cattle, sheep and pigs are uniquely identified
and this identification stays with them.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.100
Cattle are usually identified by ear tags
as are sheep and pigs but there are other

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.099
means of ensuring identification such as electronic
‘chips’ either embedded in ear tags or

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.659
placed inside the animals stomach

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.859
Traceability continues throughout the meat
distribution chain but is achieved by labelling

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.120
Traceability becomes important when controlling
animal health and disease controls

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.230
Regulatory framework, MOC, MIG

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.010
The Official Controls carried out by the Official
Veterinarians (OVs) and Meat Hygiene Inspectors

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.360
(MHIs) is prescribed in EU and GB regulation.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.370
Regulations would list the responsibilities
of slaughterhouse owners or Food Business

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.860
Operators and the requirements placed upon
them in the running of their premises

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.620
Official Veterinarian and Meat Hygiene Inspector
have their work prescribed by similar regulations

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.980
All approved meat premises are audited by
Official Veterinarians - findings from these

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.510
audits are raised with the operator and audit
findings reported openly

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.510
Lairage

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.390
When animals arrive at meat premises they
are unloaded into the animal holding facilities

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.840
or a lairage where they are rested and sorted
into batches

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.870
At this point an FSA Official Veterinarian
carries out a check to make sure that the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.489
animals are fit to be admitted into the human
food chain.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.280
Sick and unwell animals will be rejected at
this point.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.239
This check is conducted on all animals

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.000
Slaughterhouse owners or Food Business Operators
would also carry out checks within the holding

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.319
area

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.219
For example it is a requirement that animals
arrive for slaughter with Food Chain Information

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:34.609
which informs the abattoir of animal history,
identification, any previous health issues

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.209
and if any treatment has been administered.

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.450
An important FBO control would be to only
admit clean, healthy and properly identified

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.840
animals

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.209
Slaughterhouse operatives check cattle identification
to make sure that actual identification as

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.030
shown on the ear tag matches documented identification
as shown on the cattle passport

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.709
Slaughter

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.910
From the holding area the animals are humanely
slaughtered before commencement of processing

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.910
animals into meat

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.420
Processing usually starts with hide and fleece
removal or the removal of bristles from pigs

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.459
and feathers from chickens.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.700
Once the ‘outside’ of the meat is clean
the carcase has its internal organs removed

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.750
Inspection, health marking and detain

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.660
In terms of meat inspection and returning
to the numbers of animals processed in GB

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:33.450
meat premises each year – 775 million birds;
15.6 million lambs; 7.9 million pigs and over

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.600
2 million cattle each and every carcase receives
a detailed post mortem inspection to again

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.890
ensure its fitness for human consumption

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.861
The regulations prescribe the inspection the
Official Veterinarian and Meat Hygiene inspector

00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:53.700
would carry out but is often a visual inspection
of carcase meat and offal parts.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.720
The regulations also prescribe more detailed
inspection of certain parts of the carcase

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.450
and offal that are at higher risk of showing
disease for example detailed inspection of

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.910
the heart and liver

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.440
There are some things that visual inspection
cannot identify for example bacteria are too

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.730
small to see with the naked eye

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.350
Once the MHI has carried out his post mortem
inspection and the meat is passed as fit for

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.610
human consumption and the meat is health marked
by application of a stamp identifiable to

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.750
the Meat Hygiene Inspector and meat premises;
you may have noticed these marks on meat or

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.220
meat packs

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.190
Some meat may be unfit for human consumption
and is detained separately pending any further

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.900
inspection, sampling and disposal out from
the human food chain

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.560
Testing

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.080
Some samples are sent for further test and
analysis

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.830
For example samples would be submitted for
particular disease tests and for random medicines

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.610
and drug residues to check that any medicines
administered while the animals were alive

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.931
are no longer contained in the meat

00:06:01.931 --> 00:06:08.650
All 4year old and older cattle have a nervous
tissue sample sent for analysis to test for

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.660
Transmissable Spongiform Encepalopathies commonly
known as BSE

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.130
samples for BSE testing are submitted to laboratories
for test and these labs usually work over

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.920
night returning test results for the following
morning.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.510
Once the Official Veterinarian and Meat Hygiene
Inspector receive these results the meat is

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.550
fit to be released into the human food chain
