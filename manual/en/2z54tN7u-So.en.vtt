00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.669
This video shows how to print double-sided
media on the HP Latex 260 and 280 printers

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:16.300
- formerly known as the Designjet L26500
and L28500 - using Onyx ProductionHouse

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.410
X10 software.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.000
Note that the printer model numbers are interchangeable
in this context.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.210
The printer shown is the HP Latex 260, but
the steps also apply to the HP Latex 280 printer.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.580
To begin, load substrate material, if necessary.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.580
If you print immediately after loading, the
printer will automatically leave the necessary

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.220
blank media.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.220
If the substrate was already loaded, you must
manually leave 50cm/20in of blank media.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:13.500
First press the "Move substrate" button
on the front panel. Then press OK.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.210
Press and hold the down arrow to advance the
substrate the correct amount.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.210
Double-sided printing can be selected in your
Raster Image Processor, or RIP software, or

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.500
at the printer's front panel.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.890
The RIP settings take precedence when used.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.500
For this demonstration we will use Onyx ProductionHouse
X10 software.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.500
When setting up the software, HP recommends
you adjust the following settings.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.000
Click the Change button to begin.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.780
Select "Print Jobs Individually" from
the drop-down menu.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.220
Click Setup.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.220
Unset the "Automatically start printing" option 
at this time to allow for further setup.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.170
If using edge holders, you must leave at least
10 mm margins.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.100
Click the Options tab to continue with adjustments.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.100
Deselect the "Print Multiple Rows at a Time",
"Horizontal Copying", and "Grouping"

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.410
options.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.300
Then click OK.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Click OK, to close setup window.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.500
Click the Open Folder icon and then select
the files you want to use for double-sided

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.470
printing.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.000
Each of the files you selected will then be
loaded into the print queue.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.400
You can now adjust individual settings for
each file you previously selected.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.500
Refer to your RIP program's user guide for
details on what each option does.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.489
You can now proceed to print side A jobs.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.600
Click on Change, to reopen the printer control
window.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.500
Click Setup.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.500
Re-enable the "Automatically start printing"
option by clicking the checkbox.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.770
Then click OK.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.590
Click OK again to begin processing.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.000
The side A printing job will now process each
file in the queue.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.209
Some RIPs automatically generate side B and
add to the queue.

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.100
Side A will be printed for each of the images
in the queue.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.970
A black registration line is printed after
each job. These will be used to align the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.120
matching job on the second side.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.500
When side A printing is complete, you must
manually advance and cut the substrate.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.100
Begin this step by pressing the "Move substrate"
button.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.000
Press the down arrow to advance media. Be
sure to leave a few centimeters of blank media

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.110
after the last side A print.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.860
Press OK when done advancing media.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.500
Now, cut the substrate from the front panel.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.600
Select the substrate menu icon.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.500
Press OK.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.069
Select "Form feed and cut", and then press
OK again.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.110
Unload the cut substrate.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.900
You can now set up and print side B jobs.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.900
Before reloading the cut substrate you must
unload the roll.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.000
Press the down arrow to select the substrate
menu and then press OK.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.749
Press down arrow to move to "Substrate unload",
and then press OK.

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:04.009
Press OK once more to unload roll.

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:09.500
Reload the substrate with side A facing up.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.400
The front panel will prompt: "Would you
like to load substrate for printing as side

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.900
B"?

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.069
Select "Yes, load as side B" and press
OK.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:32.169
The printer automatically searches for the
first registration line and calibrates the

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:32.900
substrate advance.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.159
If the printer fails to find the registration
line, the front panel asks you to move the

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:44.700
substrate using the Up and Down keys until
the reference line is aligned with the permanent

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.000
line on the platen.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Once the registration is successful the front
panel will indicate the printer is ready to

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.100
print side B.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:00.900
If the RIP does not automatically generate
side B prints, manually generate them now.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.619
Select Yes when the RIP prompts "Start printing
Side B jobs?."

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:09.990
The printer will now begin processing the
side B queue.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.550
The printer will automatically print each
file in succession until the job queue has

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.800
been completed.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:26.659
Progress and status will be indicated on both
the front panel and RIP displays.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Between each job, the printer will locate
the correct registration line, and then it

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.600
will print the next file in the queue.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.800
After all of the print jobs are completed
you will unload the completed substrate.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.000
On the front panel, press the "Move substrate"
button, then press OK.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.369
Hold the down arrow button until the substrate
advances completely and unloads.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.199
Your double-sided print project is now complete.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:08:01.100
