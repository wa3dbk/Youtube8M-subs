00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.540
How hard is it to shoot down RC target drones...

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.969
with machine guns?

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.519
 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.250
 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.840
rat a tat tat

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.450
pew pew pew

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.270
 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.750
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.650
 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.590
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.950
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.129
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.710
 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.710
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.729
hee hee haw haw

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.100
 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.569
why you.... I   oughta...

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.110
 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.700
 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.040
 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.040
whoosh!

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.470
 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.720
 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.210
 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.650
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.650
 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.830
 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.200
 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.950
This is typically what you guys do to an airplane.  .

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.450
You shoot the motor out of it

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.110
It dropped like a brick.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.750
We have not been able to shoot down this other one

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.670
It runs out of gas each time.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.390
Come on,  will you hit it?

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.970
We'll fly that again.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.880
You can see on the bottom a big scar.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.260
 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.660
Crash it into them if they don't shoot it down.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.390
How many planes did you bring this time?

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.810
I built 30 for this shoot.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.580
We were able to salvage parts off damaged planes.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.330
and the one airplane that did the best
today it was this

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.420
eight or nine passes. I was diving over their heads

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.980
 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.120
It ran out of fuel and it landed in a big
bush

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.870
It's got two holes in it,  it's perfect other than that.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.870
Flying the target drones at night

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.330
 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.169
 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:41.169
 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.120
 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.120
 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:19.190
da plane  da plane!

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.490
 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.640
 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.510
 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.070
 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:55.070
 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.440
 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.610
 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.970
 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.720
 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:23.720
 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.720
Plane down!

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.749
 

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:41.450
 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:48.450
 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.040
 

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.650
Nice!

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.989
 

00:07:59.989 --> 00:08:02.489
