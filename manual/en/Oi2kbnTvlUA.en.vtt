00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.026
[Question] I've heard it said

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.812
Baptist churches have a lot of lost people in them

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:10.910
that think they are saved.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.467
They are at least attending the Sunday morning services.

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.335
I've heard it said a lot.

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:18.532
And it's very grieving.

00:00:18.532 --> 00:00:20.049
I was wondering how you felt about that.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.416
[Paul Washer] Well first of all it's true.

00:00:23.416 --> 00:00:26.372
We do, and it's not just confined to Baptist.

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:32.338
It's not confined, it's rampant in Evangelicalism today.

00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:34.808
And the reason for it is, first of all,

00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:37.498
the gospel that is preached is no gospel at all.

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:39.750
It's a gospel reduced

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:43.416
from Christ the God man

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:46.170
going to a tree and dying under the wrath of His Father,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.034
and rising again from the dead,

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:49.788
and seated at the right hand of the Father,

00:00:49.788 --> 00:00:51.496
and calling all men, commanding all men

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:52.724
to repent and believe;

00:00:52.724 --> 00:00:54.636
and that the proof of saving faith

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:56.488
is the continued fruit in their life.

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:57.840
We've reduced all that down to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.922
'five things God wants you to know.'

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:01.191
Or 'four spiritual laws'

00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.730
and if you jump through each one of those

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.860
and say yes, and then pray the little prayer in the back

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.370
some evangelist who should spend less time preaching,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.748
and more time studying his Bible declares you saved.

00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:14.174
I'm very opinionated with regard to this.

00:01:15.184 --> 00:01:17.233
That's just the point. So our Gospel.

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.132
Second of all.

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:27.108
I don't consider the Catholic church to ever have been a church.

00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:29.410
But when I look at the Catholic church,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.491
when I look at Anglicanism

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.332
and what was going on in England.

00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:36.494
When I look at what was going on in New England,

00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:38.282
and what goes on today.

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:41.208
It seems to me that always the devil works it out

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:44.134
so that the great assumption is: their saved.

00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:47.060
The least amount of time it seems eventually

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.902
is given to discerning 'what is the gospel,'

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:51.918
and whether a person is truly saved.

00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:54.412
If they just walk up front and they pray that prayer

00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:57.335
we declare them saved, and start discipling them.

00:01:57.493 --> 00:02:00.469
We should maybe be working with this person for months

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.315
that they come to a biblical assurance.

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:05.471
And so our churches are filled with lost people,

00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:06.497
and it's by and large

00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:09.783
because [of] the superficiality of pastors.

00:02:09.783 --> 00:02:12.175
And most of them have gone to church growth schemes

00:02:12.175 --> 00:02:14.955
and turned their church into a six-flags-over-Jesus.

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:18.365
And they no more are preaching the Gospel than a man on the moon.

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:25.185
[Mack Tomlinson] It's not just a contemporary problem.

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.635
I read this week where A.W. Pink,

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:31.571
I mean, he got pretty discouraged at times

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:33.857
and seemed like he could be harsh.

00:02:33.857 --> 00:02:35.580
But in his day,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.303
in the 1930s and 40s,

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.526
He made the statement that 'he wondered

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:44.194
if two percent of Protestantism

00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:47.032
were born again at all in America.'

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:48.974
[PW] Well even one of the greatest,

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:51.756
most well known evangelists in America today

00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:53.741
has said that 'if even five percent

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.103
of all the people that have been converted in his

00:02:56.103 --> 00:02:58.505
meetings are Christian' he would be happy.

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.030
And another thing that is so important is

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.858
the idea of a compassionate,

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:05.294
loving,

00:03:05.294 --> 00:03:07.220
church discipline.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.463
I find it very strange

00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:11.576
that people do not practice church discipline

00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:13.229
because they love their congregation

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.382
more than Jesus does.

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:16.647
Jesus commanded them

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:18.422
to practice church discipline.

00:03:18.422 --> 00:03:20.769
Not upon sinful people, we're all sinful,

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.827
but upon rebels who show no fruit

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.755
and will not turn.

00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:28.539
And the thing that is really bad is

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.993
we have just come out of liberalism.

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:33.124
There was a move among many denominations,

00:03:33.124 --> 00:03:34.875
especially in the Southern Baptist Convention,

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.704
seeing that liberalism is out.

00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:39.613
It hasn't taken us not even a decade

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:41.982
to go right back into neo liberalism.

00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:43.218
Which in my opinion,

00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:44.692
the new liberalism is

00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:46.536
basically the church growth movement.

00:03:46.536 --> 00:03:48.329
Where everything is done on

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.742
marketing strategies, and

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:54.376
'tell us what kind of church you want and that's what we'll give you.'

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:58.716
Instead of asking God what kind of bride He desires.

00:04:00.953 --> 00:04:03.786
[Bill McLeod] I have a daughter named Joanna and

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:05.502
she professed to be saved,

00:04:05.502 --> 00:04:08.097
was baptized, joined the church.

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:12.193
And seemed to be a very genuine Christian.

00:04:12.193 --> 00:04:14.742
When she went to school she

00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:17.716
always had a Bible on top of her school books.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.798
The principle of the school told us,

00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:21.576
"We sure like having your daughter in our school."

00:04:21.576 --> 00:04:23.054
I said, "Why?" And he said,

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:25.802
"If there's any hanky panky going on and your daughter finds out

00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:28.330
she blows the lid off this place,"

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.836
he said, "We're so glad she's there."

00:04:32.154 --> 00:04:34.334
Then during the revival she came to me one night

00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:37.979
and said, "Daddy, I'd like to be saved."

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.818
I said, "What? You mean you're back-slidden?"

00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:44.509
She said, "Daddy, I've never known the Lord.

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.323
I knew the language, I got the language from you and mom,

00:04:47.323 --> 00:04:50.158
but I've never known the Lord."

00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:52.371
And so I led her to Christ.

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:56.428
And then, before the revival I had an assistant pastor.

00:04:56.635 --> 00:04:58.442
Great song leader,

00:04:58.442 --> 00:05:01.209
and great teaching children.

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.147
But he was with us six or eight months

00:05:04.147 --> 00:05:07.522
and the deacons and I felt he's not producing.

00:05:07.737 --> 00:05:08.879
We had talked with him,

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:11.142
and finally we had to ask him to leave,

00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:13.529
and he did.

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.843
During the revival he phoned me one night long distance

00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:17.997
and he said,

00:05:18.327 --> 00:05:19.680
"Last night I was praying

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.562
and God showed me

00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:23.614
that I've never been born again.

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:27.295
Can I come down to Saskatoon and you can spend some time?"

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:28.496
I said, "Certainly."

00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:30.881
So we came down, we got some pastors together.

00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.573
And he knelt, and we all knelt,

00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:33.975
and we counseled with him,

00:05:33.975 --> 00:05:35.697
and he prayed.

00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:38.087
And I'll never forget,

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.653
he suddenly cried,

00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:42.529
"God is real, God is real!"

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.917
What a transformation!

00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:47.541
So there's likely lots of people like that,

00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:48.452
that know the language,

00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:50.323
they've heard it from others.

00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:53.046
But they don't know the Lord.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:06:00.035
[Bob Jennings] This must have been a burden

00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:01.586
for the Lord Jesus too.

00:06:01.586 --> 00:06:04.997
Because one time it struck me that almost all,

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:08.047
if not all of the parables

00:06:08.047 --> 00:06:09.676
that the Lord spoke

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:12.655
had to do with this matter of true and false profession.

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:15.157
I mean the Two Builders,

00:06:15.157 --> 00:06:17.699
the Sower and the Soils,

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.408
Wheat and the Tares,

00:06:19.408 --> 00:06:21.607
the Sheep and the Goats.

00:06:21.607 --> 00:06:23.474
And just almost all of the parables

00:06:23.474 --> 00:06:26.511
have to do with this very thing.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.572
[Moderator] Anything else brothers?

00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:31.777
[PW] Greatest mission field today is the church,

00:06:31.777 --> 00:06:33.527
or what's called the church.
