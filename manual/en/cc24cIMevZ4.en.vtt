&gt;&gt; Eloise Stiglitz: Opening the QUAD across the
street from the campus as an additional 300 beds

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.250
of student housing means that
we're growing as a campus.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.330 position:69%
It's a very visible sign that we're growing.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.680 position:63%
When I've talked to students, I've heard
a number of students say they want to go

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.160 position:73%
to a real university and for a lot of students,
that real university means residential.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.760
Calling this their home will
build the idea of campus,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.350
community in a much more
[inaudible] kind of way.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.780 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Brian ten Bosch: That area out there
is just setup so perfectly in a way

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.640
that residents could just come
out and hang out with each other.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.160
I'm most excited just by the
ability of having more people.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.570
Have that experience of living on
campus because living on campus,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.850
I know for myself if I hadn't
lived on campus my first year,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.930 position:59%
I'm not sure if I would still be here.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.860
&gt;&gt; Eloise Stiglitz: I think the
university was very creative

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.140 position:70%
in designing this private public partnership.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.070 position:72%
By joining with University Village San Marcos,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.760
we were able to take the best
of what we both had to offer.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.000
We have a lot of students
who want to live on campus.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.300 position:73%
What UVSM brought was the building and we don't
have to pay for that building so in the time

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.410 position:56%
with budget cuts; it's a gift to us.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:38.190 position:64%
They get the first stage of their larger
north city project and a lively community

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.390
of new students living in the area.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.720 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Michael McDonald: We have a much larger
project in mind and the QUAD happened

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.270 position:56%
to be really the first phase of that
which is this north city concept.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.150
The core of it is our retail
main street and it's meant

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.460
to have very broad sidewalks so
there are the outdoor dining.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.010
You know our goal is that when
those new perspective freshmen

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.690 position:67%
with their parents drive off of Highway 78,
they're going to see this very exciting,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.040 position:61%
you know, retail mixed use environment.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.500
&gt;&gt; Eloise Stiglitz: It's
a win-win for everybody.
