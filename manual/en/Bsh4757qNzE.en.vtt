00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.819
All right, today in this 2013 Ford Explorer,
were going to install part number C56093 from

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.870
Curt. First thing we need to do is open up
the back hatch and get access to our wiring.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.110
To do that, were going to have to remove the
threshold in the back. Well start off by prying

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.020
the threshold up closest to the door to loosen
up the fasteners there. We use a trim pan

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:36.480
tool to help get everything loosened up and
started then we can go ahead and remove it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:01:13.520
from the car. Then, therell be two fasteners,
one 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:51.609
on each side of 
the threshold that we have to work 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:02:51.140
loose as well. There&amp;#39;s a small cover,
right where 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:32.200
our seatbelt goes in towards the floor, but
go ahead and 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:04:43.460
remove it, but pop out 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:58.910
the bottom edge first, and push down the edge
closest to 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.960
the side.
