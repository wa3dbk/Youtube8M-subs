00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.933
HOW IS YOUR LOVELY WIFE,
ANNA?

00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.366
- ANNA IS GOOD.

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.100
25 YEARS,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.833
WE'RE COMING UP
ON 26 YEARS MARRIED.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:07.966
- THAT'S A WONDERFUL THING.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.100
[cheers and applause]

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.933
- THANK YOU.

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.200
IT WORKS.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.333
- ANYMORE SECRETS
THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH US?

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.733
- WELL, IN THIS TOWN,
YOU KNOW,

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.466
THAT'S GOT TO BE A RECORD
IN THIS TOWN.

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.400
- IT IS.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.566
- BUT I THINK IT WORKS
BECAUSE,

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.766
IF YOU ARE SOMEONE,
YOU KNOW,

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.266
WITH "FAME,"
WHATEVER AMOUNT,

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.166
IT'S GOOD TO BE MARRIED
TO SOMEONE

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.700
WHO IS NOT IMPRESSED
WITH THAT AT ALL.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.300
- UH-HUH.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.766
- SHE--YOU KNOW,
I'LL SHARE A STORY.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.666
THIS HAPPENED
THE OTHER MORNING.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.533
AND I'LL JUST--

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.933
I DON'T NEED TO CLEAN IT UP,

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.366
BUT I'LL JUST--

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.100
IT WAS THE MORNING,
AND I DECIDED,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.400
I'M GONNA TRY
AND GET ROMANTIC,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.600
SHALL WE SAY.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.800
YES.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.066
AND THE THING
THAT'S GOOD

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.766
ABOUT BEING MARRIED
FOR THAT LONG IS,

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:55.266
YOU KNOW RIGHT AWAY WHETHER
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN OR NOT.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.500
YES.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.766
SHE--AND MY WIFE
IS VERY GOOD--

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.066
SHE'S VERY SUCCINCT.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.433
SHE LETS ME KNOW.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.100
AND SO THAT MORNING,
I WAS--

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.100
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST--

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.133
SHE WASN'T EVEN FACING.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.533
SHE WAS LOOKING THE OTHER WAY.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.466
AND I WAS JUST, EH, YOU KNOW,
I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.200
AND, YEAH.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.533
AND I MAKE MY MOVE,

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.166
AND MY MOVE IS JUST TO PUT
MY ARM ON HER SHOULDER.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.066
AND SHE KNOWS.

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.466
IT'S THE MORNING.

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.433
IF I'M TOUCHING HER
IN THE MORNING, SHE KNOWS.

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:21.866
YES.

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.933
AND HERE'S HOW I KNEW
IT WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.533
SHE DIDN'T EVEN MOVE.

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.433
MY HAND HIT HER SHOULDER,
AND SHE SAID,

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:31.000
"WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?"

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.333
[laughter and applause]

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.333
AND RIGHT AWAY,

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.566
REMOTE.

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.033
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:43.466
- "WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM"
IS MY NO, IS MY NO.

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.333
BY THE WAY, THE MORNING,

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:48.233
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW,
FOR MARRIED MEN,

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.866
I THINK AFTER A WHILE,
THEY REALIZE

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.166
THE MORNING'S YOUR BEST SHOT.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:53.766
THE MORNING IS--YOU HAVE

00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:56.266
A HIGHER PERCENTAGE
IN THE MORNING.

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:57.733
WELL, THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS.

00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:02.566
ONE, SHE CAN'T SAY SHE'S TIRED,
REALLY.

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.066
NO, BUT SERIOUSLY.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.833
SHE'S HAD--

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:09.200
SHE'S HAD EIGHT HOURS SLEEP.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.700
I WATCHED THE LAST TWO OF THEM.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.766
- [laughing]

00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:16.700
- AND ALSO, IN HER MIND,
SHE'S THINKING,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.000
"I'M GONNA SHOWER ANYWAY.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.033
I'M GONNA SHOWER."

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:24.200
AND THE THING--

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.366
BUT THE BEST THING
YOU HAVE GOING FOR YOU IS,

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:29.066
SHE CAN'T REALLY SEE YOU YET.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:31.466
SHE--YOU KNOW,
SHE COULD SQUINT YOU

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:35.233
INTO BRUNO MARS
IF SHE HAD TO.

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:38.033
SO THAT'S--
I USUALLY SHOOT FOR THE MORNING.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.700
- UH-HUH.
- YEAH.
