00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.300
This is the Explanation Video for the Iron Bakery.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.820
It's not a tutorial yet, because I am really busy at the moment

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.980
and I have no real way to build it without mods yet.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.660
But i'll show you this later

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.720
How this works is that the doors are different villages. You might have seen this in the showcase.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.500
For Example this row is a village

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.240
The row next to it is another village and so on.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.340
That means we have 10 villages, because there are 10 rows.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.400
And these rows go all around

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.140
So the inner rows belong to the same village. The one next to it and so on.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.880
There is one little trick to do this.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.440
These are all many villages stacked into each other.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:04.660
If you place 64 blocks of the center away a door and a villager a new village will be created.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:15.880
There is one rule that a door gets added to the closer center of a village.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:26.880
So if I place a door that is closer to the outer village than to the inner it will be added to it.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.020
So if you move the center step by step you can easily stack villages.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:46.980
We place a door that is just closer to the outer village so the door gets added.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.520
And if we break this door the center moves to the other existing door.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.780
Let's do the same thing other here that the door is again closer to the outer village

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.060
So the center will move again after breaking this door.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.680
Make always sure that a villager is in range.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.140
The two blocks above are also required to detect it as a 'house'

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.160
Because the sun light has to be partially disconnected

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.040
So now the center is exactly where the door is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.860
So if we go other here we can see in the F3-Screen that we are closer to that center.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.820
Because the other villages have all 24 houses (doors)

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:48.040
That means we can place 6 doors belonging to another village.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.440
If break this door we have there another village than this and this and this...

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:10.380
To place more doors we have to get another villager, because the others are to far away.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.800
They are more than 16 blocks away from this area so the doors wouldn't be detected.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:28.100
So we place several doors with blocks on top to be sure.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.680
Then the doors move the center to this side.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:47.600
Let's place some more doors with blocks.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.040
Still not enough doors to have the center closer.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.420
Now we can place again our 6 doors

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.540
Then break the other doors and you should have 12 doors in your village

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.920
The andesite lines of doors are now inside the same village.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:32.780
When you made this around the entire farm you will have golems spawning and the center perfectly in the middle.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.340
That is perfect :)

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.860
Repeat the same process

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.500
close together

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:56.180
You could calculate the exact distances between the doors but this is easier.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:07.880
I place all of these doors to be 100% sure.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.980
Let's see if I did something wrong...

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.440
Everything is fine. The doors are still in the correct village.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.940
The center is still too far away so we can break some of the older doors.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.700
because they manipulate the center

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.460
so it should be easier.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.580
That is why I haven't done a tutorial yet.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.360
Now we can continue placing doors.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.780
Let some temporary doors remain

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:16.440
Because if you would break them you couldn't place more doors to the village.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.540
Bla bla... same thing here.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.340
Don't forget the villager in the corner.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.160
Last row.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.000
Not every single door is required but it's safer.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.600
That was the last row. So if we break all temporary doors...

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.880
Everyone and also the one behind there.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:01.480
Then we will have an 11th village and the efficiency 11 times greater than the common iron farms.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.180
We now have added a village successfully.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:14.900
...to increase the efficiency. After doing this 10 times you will have the product like the one in the showcase.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.798
You now can create a new village and repeat the process.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:24.280
Place and break doors again and you can add a 12th village.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.480
This is how it works so you get an idea of what's going on.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.420
And the mods help you view in which village you are currently

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:41.440
That's why there's no real tutorial yet but I promised making an explanation video

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.820
Und hier ist es fÃ¼r die Iron Bakery
