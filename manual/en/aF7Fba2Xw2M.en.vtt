00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.589
Welcome back, I'm Chef Donno, and on behalf
of Expert Village, welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.410
We're making Spanish omelettes today. We've
already cut our produce, browned off the meat.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.400
Now, it's time to make omelettes. What I usually
use is an eight-inch pan. Nowadays, you can

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.770
get these pans already covered with the Teflon
or what-have-you so they're non-stick. Back

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:33.000
in the old days, you used to have the stainless
pans like so, and you'd have to season it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.329
with salt, heat it up, and rub it out so it
would be non-stick. Nowadays, it's very easy

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.519
with your Teflon pans. I use the eight-inch.
For larger omelettes and different variations,

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.600
I'll use a larger pan. So before we get to
actually cooking the omelette, you're probably

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.159
thinking, "Well, I'd like to do that, but
I don't know how to flip the omelette." I'll

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.770
show you how to do that. I've trained literally
hundreds of cooks how to make omelettes, and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:09.820
they feel silly doing this, but this is how
it's done. Piece of bread in your pan, okay?

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.030
Now, this pan is curved up, so when you flip
with the wrist, everything comes back at you.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:26.630
So what you do for one minute is flip the
bread half a revolution just like so. You're

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.369
using your wrist, you're going down, up. It's
like you're scooping, okay? Just like this.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.460
Circular motion like so. Do it for one minute,
really. Time yourself, get comfortable with

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.770
it. The most important thing when you're making
the omelette, when you're flipping the omelette,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.500
don't hesitate, don't stop. You might -- you'll
end up with half the eggs on the stove, half

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.439
in the pan. Don't hesitate, be comfortable
with this action. When you have the eggs in

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.759
the pan, it's no different. Just be comfortable
with the motion. And when you're saut?ing

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:12.690
anything for that fact, saut?ing vegetables
or whatever, it's the same motion. Circular

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.330
motion, digging, scooping, okay? Don't go
nuts and see how many flips you can do. You'll

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.030
have an omelette on the floor and your pets
will be glad you did that, okay? So flip,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:35.440
flip, flip. Get used to the motion. The pan
is designed for the food to do this, okay?

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.610
Just like so. Now that you have your flipping
technique down, let's make a real omelette.
