00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.860
The whirr of the change machine.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.410
The five year old who can’t understand he’s
only got enough tickets for ONE fruit roll-up.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.150
The rhythmic pounding of the overweight guy
on the DDR machine.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.430
The smell of the overweight guy on the DDR
machine.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.000
All part of the arcade experience, lost to
the ages.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.570
For better or worse.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.440
But, since there’s always a market for nostalgia,
Warner Bros. have jammed together another

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.440
compilation of their classic Atari arcade
titles, to bring you Midway Arcade Origins.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.840
Sound confusing yet?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.840
Yeah.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.370
It totally is.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.710
You may be familiar with any of a number of
other Midway compilations of the last generation;

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.630
volumes 1, 2, and 3 of the Midway Arcade Treasures
collections were well-received on the PS2,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.780
Cube, and Xbox, and a stripped-down version
even got ported to the PSP.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.270
They breathed life into some of the great
names from a previous age, while adding historical

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.770
data, interviews with the original developers,
and so on.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.270
Midway Arcade Origins, on the other hand...
doesn’t.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.610
Aside from some moderately-interesting text
that scrolls by on the control explanation

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.460
screen, you’ve just got 31 arcade games,
and that’s it.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.679
Let’s see if I can list them all in one
breath: Defender, Defender II, Gauntlet, Gauntlet

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.760
II, Joust, Joust 2, Spy Hunter, Spy Hunter
II, Rampage, Total Carnage, 720, APB, Arch

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.649
Rivals, Bubbles, Championship Sprint, Tournament
Cyberball 2072, Marble Madness, Pit-Fighter,

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.849
Rampart, Robotron 2084, Root Beer Tapper,
Satan’s Hollow, Sinistar, Smash TV, Super

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:57.250
Off-Road, Super Sprint, Toobin’, Vindicators
Part II, Wizard of Wor, Xenophobe, and Xybots.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.250
Woo.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.250
Brass instruments.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.330
Anyway, aside from a menu that shows you the
original cabinet art and configuration, the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.670
games themselves don’t really get any help
from our 21st-century technology.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.800
It’s all just sometimes-dicey emulation,
with controllers that can’t really match

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.720
the arcade originals.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.739
Decent ports, such as Smash TV here, are more
the exception than the rule.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.520
Unfortunately, there’s an elephant in this
arcade (and he’s not on the DDR machine):

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.930
A couple of these games, enabled with new
3-or-more-player multiplayer and online leaderboards

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.349
though they may be, were once standalone titles
on XBLA.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.760
I’m lookin’ at you, Smash TV.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.609
For five bucks, you could have had just that,
just the one game that everyone seems to love,

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.170
instead of this bundle of things you’re
significantly less likely to play.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.349
PSN folks never had to deal with this crap.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.260
(‘Cuz they never got the originals anyway.)

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.590
But still, if there are more than a couple
games you just can’t leave behind, or if

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.879
you want to relive those days of quarter-extending
domination, Midway Arcade Origins (copyright

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.920
Warner Bros.) isn’t a bad bet.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.719
And there’s this awesome intro animation!

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.910
With a token slaloming through the Marble
Madness course!

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:16.279
That’s gotta be worth something, right?
