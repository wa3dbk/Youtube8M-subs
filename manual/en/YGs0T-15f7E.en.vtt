camera right now as I do this and I want
to walk you guys up here it's gonna take

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.369
me a minute because it's really really
thick but uh I planted some plants out

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.949
here and it was actually it I would love
to tell you I plan it this way it was

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:39.609
June 7th today's the 8th so or what's

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.640
rolling back here and I want to show you

couple minute walk from where my wife

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.820
and kids are so I can like go back out
here and just chill very very thick so

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.530
I'm rocking these last time I had
sandals it was not fun so check this out

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.220
hopefully I can catch some frogs on
camera the last time I was here I was

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.260
fortunate enough to see a little baby
turtle

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.160
catch some frogs jumping out here we
look at that water - Wow there we go

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:18.070
miss them you can see some stuff
rippling around mosquitoes all over me

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.300
already
what's that there's a little gardener

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.920
snake I was out here earlier yeah check
this out

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.090
sorry frogs interrupt your morning so
now that we're here I'm gonna interrupt

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.080
the other silences beautiful natural
spot to bring it to you all so check it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.350
out we're looking for a couple of plants
we're looking for the hygrometer formas

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.730
we're looking for the Ella dia and
Acuras we're looking for the giant Val

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.040
and the Italian Val and I also have like
this random weed so this thing I knew

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.440
would be fine this was in one of my
pawns I tore down doing just fine

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.160
the water hyacinth is completely
multiplying all of us I'll go check that

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.810
little frog out there little little tiny
frogs swimming along here so the highest

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.190
in has gone crazy as expected its people
had some valid heat in the other videos

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.269
about me putting invasive species in
upon this don't do this at home these

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.750
won't survive the winter or whatever so
I don't feel bad about putting them

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.340
private pond not connected to anything
but regardless if they're good here and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.310
by the way just as a connection to your
guys's own aquariums I'm trying to

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.820
reduce the amount of this funky algae in
here by adding a lot of plants same

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.290
exact concept that goes on in your
aquarium so down here now I planted over

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.639
here some high groffle DeForest the
water wisteria I don't see it I don't

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.300
know where it is
I pretty sure it didn't make it but

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.050
folks it is with my great pleasure to
show you the plant that I wanted my

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.270
coffin now growing at my in-laws house
does it get any better than that

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:59.260
jungle ba-bum ba-bum bringing it to you
on a sunday growing natively they're not

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.480
natively but growing in the wild for me
so look at this junk of all folks this

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.800
started with probably twelve pieces you
can click the link and check out the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.420
whole video two months ago this is two
months worth of growth and I'm really

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.010
really really excited to see just this
robust growth here and you can see it's

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.730
headin like it's not done yet it's
heading way out and heading there and

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.920
I'm actually gonna uproot some of it and
spread it out even more so we could just

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.190
go I'm not gonna harvest any of it I'm
not gonna you know whatever I'm gonna

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.240
leave it I want to let it just get going
crazy so really really really pumped

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.950
about that you can see the water lettuce
and the highest in here going nuts I was

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.520
looking for the taro I don't think those
made that those who were native I don't

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.460
think those are the ones I brought those
or some sort of you know whatever thing

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.140
but the lily is alright I don't see any
blooms on it but Don there's one in the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.140
center there but that would that had all
of like you know four leaves on it two

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.280
months growth guys too much growth
natural sunlight so really Jack then I

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.390
got this let's pull this up and see what
this is here I don't know what you are

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.680
that's some sort of funky stuff but
let's get into this jungle well shall we

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.080
actually I'm just gonna put the camera
down and rip into this it's too hard to

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.270
deal with two hands with one hand
alright so here is the jungle Val out

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.090
there I believe it's the Italian validol
I did plant two different species

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.020
gigantea and the Italian Val there it is
out here and then out there and then I

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.460
took this bit right here I was trying to
show you guys this odd this plant mass

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:38.140
this is pretty legit right here so I've
got all of this nice new growth I'm

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.240
gonna say triple probably quadrupled
again two months time look at that heavy

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.330
growth obviously it's growing in dirt
growing in mud shocker it's growing

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.100
really well in mud in full sunlight but
I'm really excited to be you know

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.890
playing with this I mean look it's one
of my favorite plants I said I've said

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.760
it a million times I want this plant in
my coffin when I go and now I've got one

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.640
of my favorite plants growing out there
in a nice big chunk so I'm actually

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.630
gonna take this and what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna spread it out even more so we

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.810
can just send a runner show that where
it was where it was real thick and I

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.830
noticed that it was growing in this way
meaning you see a little runner there I

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.900
was heading inland with the shallower
water growing just more naturally that

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.140
way so what I've done so taken I hope
you guys can see with the glare I've

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.120
taken all these little individual pieces
of jungle vial and I've spread them out

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.310
all along the shore here so that they
can grow and spread out in the shallower

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.890
water shallower water equals more
sunlight equals more growth for D so

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.340
we're paused about that and then also
I'll show you guys this this is Elodie

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.720
and that Chris but what's interesting
about this guy's is that it's got like

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.560
narrower leaf growth on it Alex you know
the leaves are a little more narrow in

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.350
there look when I planted it there a
little thicker so I'm not really sure

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.120
but I'll show you how that's this is
probably half this is where it's growing

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.900
right here I'll put it up close to the
shore now my goal a couple things I want

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.580
to make sure I'd love it to make it that
this pond could support fish life I

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.160
don't know if that's even possible with
the urea fertilizers they use or

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.450
whatever but I'd love to get a ton of
time on a ton of like you know tropical

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.620
plants or you know native plants elodie
a jungle val can be found in the United

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.550
States so I'm going to get a ton of them
in this pond and you know obviously I

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.030
have my own supply but I'd also have you
know could support life better so I'm

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.690
really jacked to see this just grow and
I'm gonna spread this out well and kind

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.990
of out-compete you know some of the
algae here I have no idea what the

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.590
fertilization is here but this is such a
sweet little pond - couple of huge

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.730

day from over there so having a good
