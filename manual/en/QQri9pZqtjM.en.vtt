Hi, I'm Aaron Phillips for Expert Village.
And there's nothing like a bike like this

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.370
to make you start yelling out to random people
on the street "I'll get you my pretty and

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.700
you're little dog too." Kind of makes you
feel like the wicked witch of the west, all

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.800
you need is a hat. You're sitting up straight,
you're relaxed. You know you're ready to take

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.590
that you know, you're ready to be the wicked
witch of the west. And you can bring home

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.820
the bacon, too. You can go to the grocery
store on this, fill it up full of groceries,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.610
irresponsibly huge amounts of pretzels, I've
have this for like two years and I'll never

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.620
be finished. Well anyway this is a beach cruiser.
Of course you've got the bell which is really

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.340
nice. You've got a nice upright position this
is a great bike for cruising around at the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.250
park or on the beach or on the boardwalk,
checking people out. You can go at kind of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.580
really nice slow speeds and keep your balance
this bike because it's so so nice and maneuverable.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:09.060
So laid back. It's even got a kick stand,
so nice bike to have, it should be in everybody's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.400
quiver of bikes. Fenders on this bike help
to make it kind of an all-weather bike, you

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.151
can ride in the rain if you need to without
getting that stuff sprayed all over you. You

00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:20.970
don't usually have fenders on mountain bike
or something like that because of the added

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.140
weight and the additional mechanical problems
that can be associated with fenders. But a

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.190
bike like this has them and they are just
absolutely great. You've got a chain guard

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.000
here so that you can, kind of like you had
on your bike as a kid right, so that you can

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.890
avoid getting all greasified and disgusting
while you ride along to your business meeting

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.700
or church, school, liquor store, what have
you. This bike is different from a lot of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.720
beach cruisers in that its got some gears.
You got a I think about a seven, three, four,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.120
five, six, seven. Seven or eight speed cassette
back there with a really nice extra low gear

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.400
for climbing hills. This makes it a great
little beach cruiser to have for areas like

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.170
where we live where you really can't go anywhere
without pretty much going straight up a hill.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.900
Other beach cruisers will feature fewer gears.
The pedals here are just basic little plastic

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.030
platform pedals with the added benefit of
little reflectors. If you're buying a bike

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.700
and you're going to be riding in town you
want to think about visibility. Low light,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.300
night, you want to think about having reflectors
on the bike a lot of bikes will come with

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.700
reflectors on the seat post maybe on the wheels
here. One of the things about reflectors is

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.950
that if you put them in a moving place on
the bike like pedals or wheels, the research

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.870
shows that motorists are tend to be more aware
or cautious of something thats moving around

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.440
so if they see a reflector like on pedals,
moving around they see you, it cues in on

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.050
their brain, there is something about the
cognitive effect of that that makes people

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.319
less likely to run you over and make you flat.
You don't want to be flat, you want to be

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.130
straight up, sitting up and riding around
like the wicked witch of the west. That's

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.900
a beach cruiser!
