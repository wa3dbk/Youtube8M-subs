00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.139
I am Oskar from The Coding Universe.

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.119
This is the first episode of a series called
"Java Game Development".

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.689
In this video I will set up the environment
needed for creating and running our

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.480
project in Eclipse.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.109
You're going to use Eclipse,

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.710
the lightweight java game library,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.570
and Slick Util.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.110
So let's go to http://www.eclipse.org,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.680
downloads, and select either the Eclipse IDE for Java developers or the classic

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.610
IDE.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.380
You can download and install that and create a shortcut to your start bar.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.790
Next we're going to download the lightweight Java game library by going to htttp://www.lwjgl.org, 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.250
download,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.070
stable version,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.580
and the zip file

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.720
So I have already downloaded that I am not going to download it right now.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.670
For the Slick Util you need to go to wiki,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.030
slick_util library introduction,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.360
and click on this link here.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.480
Click on the jar file.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.480
And we'll just save it to our desktop.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.750
So now let's open up Eclipse. 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.810
I have already set up my workspace to that folder there.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.560
Create a new project,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.070
we're going to call it "JGame".

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.460
Just hit ENTER.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.100
Now we can minimize Eclipse. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.699
Open up the project folder within the workspace.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.859
And also open up the lightweight java game library zip file.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.719
We are going to create a new folder called "lib".

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.599
In that folder we're going to create two new folders.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.619
The first is called "jars",

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:30.549
and the second is called "natives-win".

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.499
Going over to WinRAR,

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.189
we can copy 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.909
the following jar files.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.709
We're also going to go to 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.549
the Windows native folder.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.579
Now copy all the dll files into the "natives-win" folder.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:01.579
Oh, and we also need to add the slick_util jar file into the jars folder.

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.209
Let's go back into Eclipse

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.039
and open up our project properties.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.389
Go to "Java Build Path" and 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.309
add some external jars.

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:16.919
So go to our jars folder and

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.709
select all the jar files.

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.969
Click on the lightweight Java game library jar file and

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:29.969
specify the natives folder.

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.789
There we go! It should all be up and running.

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:40.879
But just to test we're going to create a class

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.659
and call it "Main".

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.989
In this class we're going to type: 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.209
"Display.create();".

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.169
Do this try-clause.

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.699
Once I run it should show 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.749
a window

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:11.749
and the window should immediately disappear (do not copy that pronounciation) again.

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.019
It worked!

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:15.619
Thanks for watching!
