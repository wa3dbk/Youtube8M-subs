00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.020
Hi.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.550
I'm Jeanie Tse, and I'm here to answer the
question, "How do you support your spouse

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.460
with schizophrenia?"

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.210
Because schizophrenia starts to set in around
the ages of 25 to 35, many people get married

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.280
before they discover that they have schizophrenia,
or they discover their spouse has schizophrenia.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.830
And so, it can really change the relationship
and the dynamic in many ways.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.820
I've identified four Ls that people should
think about when they're trying to support

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.860
their spouse with schizophrenia.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:44.380
The first one is to learn about the disorder,
to learn that it's a brain disorder, take

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.640
away the blame, and to understand what are
the triggers for relapse for your partner

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.420
are really important.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.440
Learning about to help them self-manage their
illness is important as well.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.440
Learning.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.309
The second is listening.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.540
So, people with schizophrenia can sometimes
feel very alone.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.920
Sometimes they're paranoid and feel like nobody
understands them.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.170
So, just stepping back and listening, and
we talk about reflect listening, where all

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.530
you do is repeat what the person is saying
to you so that you show that you're understanding

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.060
and not judging.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.479
That's one way of regaining the trust that
may have been being broken down in your relationship.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.470
So, learning, listening, linking up.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.400
You need support to.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.490
On the plane they tell you, "Put on your own
oxygen mask first, before helping somebody

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.619
else."

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.279
And so, gaining support, which is available
through organizations like the National Alliance

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:45.299
for the Mentally Ill.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149
They have lots of groups for families.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.969
It's NAMI.org, if you want to look it up online.

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:52.969
That's really important.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.130
So, having friends and family around you for
support is important.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.210
So, the fourth L is love, though.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.929
To constantly try to remember the things that
brought you together, what makes that person

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.319
so special to you, and what your hopes and
dreams are together, because there is a chance

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.450
at full recovery for people with schizophrenia.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.850
So, you and your partner can still lead a
healthy and productive life together.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.310
Those are really important things to remember.
