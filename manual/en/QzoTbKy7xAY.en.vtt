00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:13.150
There's not one word of any of this in our
History...

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.010
SHUT UP

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.939
Cartoons

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.810
It’s a hoppin Friday night at the
local malt shoppe, and look who’s

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.249
decided to join the fun.

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:31.490
It’s LaBarbeque, the colored boy
from down the street.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.930
But uh oh, Jimmy doesn’t seem too
pleased.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.690
Things that I can’t understand
scare me.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.870
Like how you can
maintain that rockin tan... in the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.070
middle of winter!

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.090
But we can’t blame him.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.530
After all,
skin color is what Caucasians fear

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.530
most.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.590
His name is Pigmantius, evil god of
pigment, and he gets his powers by

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.800
devouring the souls of little
children.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.059
But he CAN’T be working for
Pigmantius.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.390
Say it ain’t so,
LaBarbeque!

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.530
I told you.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.469
It’s simple science,
Susie.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.320
Science and nightmares.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.860
All you see is a rockin tan and
genetic physical advantages, but

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.460
there’s more to our friend here
than you think.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.800
Come on, give him a chance, Jimmy!

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.210
I gave him a chance when I trusted
him with my grape soda!

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.630
When LaBarbeque’s people crash
landed their mother ship on earth,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.590
they were forced to acclimate to
life among the indigenous pale

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.590
population.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.230
At least until we could gather
enough fuel to return home.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.659
Thanks LaBarbeque.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.510
Fuel is found within the oils and
juices of certain animals and

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.770
fruits, which can be synthesized to
form--

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.113
Bequeath to me the sizzurp!

00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:36.860
The captain receives a vile of liquid.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.960
So until then...

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.299
We’re here to stay!

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.299
Thanks LaBarbeque.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.470
Wait wait... there’s not one word
of ANY of this in our history

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.470
books.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.689
Oh ok, there.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.070
Well then why does he live in a bad
neighborhood?

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.439
Makes sense if he’s
a BAD person!

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.229
Since space money doesn’t work on
earth, we forced them into lower

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.840
income areas in order to survive.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.539
I’m sorry about your space money,
LaBarbeque.

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.140
I didn’t know!

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.100
And since then his people have
contributed greatly to American

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100
culture.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.100
Like music!

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100
Peanut butter!

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.100
Bouncing cars!

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.300
That’s the spirit!

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.050
White people
have even adopted elements of their

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.550
native language, such as adding
extra z’s to words, because of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.790
their hip funky sound.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.790
For rizzle...

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.400
Oop, I just said it!

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.390
Oh Susie, your cuteness is rivaled
only by your appetite.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.200
So let’s not worry about how we’re
different, but instead focus on how

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.250
our differences can enrich each
other.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.870
This is just making so much sense
to me.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.590
As it turns out, LaBarbeque’s
people are actually fighting an

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.019
intergalactic battle AGAINST
Pigmantius and his army of

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.019
Melanocytes.

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.840
Our champion, Michael Jackson,
fights him as we speak.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840
Too soon!

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.340
So this whole time I thought you
were my worst enemy, you ended up

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.150
being my best friend.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.950
Awwwwwwwww!

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.209
Fo shizzle my nizzle.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.440
I mean...
for sure my ni--

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.450
And now that you’re no longer
ignorant, let’s keep today’s lesson

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.430
in mind when the day comes where
you’ll meet even more types of

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.760
different people.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.599
Maaaaaaang.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.440
Maaaaang.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:30.950
Come on
mang!
