Hi, I'm Nat

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.266
and today I will tell you the tale

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of the tomato and the cucumber

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.400
from my series of stories that rhyme

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.533
thanks for the drawings

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.866
and stay tuned to facebook where we publish

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.666
the drawings that we need

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.200
I hope you like it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.266
The tomato and cucumber came across in their path

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.533
with a wrinkled lettuce was dressed up

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.400
they asked her where was she going and if anyone was following her

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.666
but she did not answer, she only laughed

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.333
intrigued they looked at each other, and walked together to discover the mistery

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.733
and arrived at a monastery

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.266
there they saw an onion that was resting on a pot

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.600
and was looking at a boiled egg that drew and drew and drew on a wall

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.666
they asked them what were they doing and if anyone knew

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.800
but they did not answer, they only laughed

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.133
intrigued they looked at each other, and again walked together

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.933
to discover the mistery, but this time a bit more seriously

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
on their way they met a pepper

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.266
that was very happy

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.466
with an olive that was very active and very positive

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.466
and with a carrot, that had no memory

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.800
they also ran into a fennel

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that very distrustful look askance at them

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.400
they asked them if they believed that some day they would discover

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.800
but they did not answer, they only laughed

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.666
intrigued and slightly upset they looked at each other 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.533
to uncover the mystery that was already bigger than the whole empire

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.800
upon arrival they saw it and soon realized

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600
with a simple glance they saw the salad

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.600
everyone was there, dancing and singing

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.733
were jumping with joy, it was a fun party

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.266
and with the mystery solved and the seasoned dish

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.200
tomato and cucumber arrived at their destination

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
ï¼Ÿasta otra!
