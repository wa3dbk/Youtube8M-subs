00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.440
Next question is from AbsoluteSilence who
has asked what is the ultimate goal of transhumanism

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.900
and how does it serve democracy, if it serves
it at all and I guess in the respect does

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.220
it offer more personal freedom or less?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.340
I think it depends where you're coming from.
If you're coming as a human who values the

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.020
human race and wants the human race to stay
in the driving seat, if that's what we're

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.570
in then it's probably not good news really.
But if you're looking at it as ok, we're limited

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:47.030
as humans in what we do and the goal of transhumanists
is to become cyborgs with superhuman abilities

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.000
and so on then if you were a transhumanist,
a cyborg with superhuman abilities it's great

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.270
and you can have democracy or whatever you
want between that group. But you're going

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.079
to leave humans behind so I can't see a human
saying "Hey! I think you should do this."

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:12.970
Well they're going to be communicating with
this old-fashioned speech form of communication,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.180
we're going to be communicating by thinking
to each other, you're going to understand

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.220
the world in hundreds of dimensions, you're
going to sense the world in a much broader

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.409
way as a cyborg, a post-human so I don't think
you're going to take any notice whatsoever.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.983
A bit like now if a cow came into the lab
here, Moo moo, get out what's this cow doing,

00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:39.820
not that it's going to come in but if it did
we wouldn't take any notice of it and try

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.310
and get rid of this filthy thing that can
only make stupid noises and I think the post-human,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.030
the cyborg would be the same with humans.
They'd come in saying "Yes, yes..." and we'd

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.600
be like get out you filthy thing and I think
that as a cyborg, the goal of transhumanism

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.200
would possibly be democracy within that group.
