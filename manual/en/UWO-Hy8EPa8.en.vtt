00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.280
What's going on?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.280
Little dap.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.759
It's Jared Montz former pro and founder of
Soccer Academy.

Soccer Coaching

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.080
Being sore after a hard session is natural.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.080
Soccer Training Drills.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.790
Part of being a good pro is managing your
body and resting properly.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.540
Best way to remove soreness is by taking an
ice bath!

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.540
Burrrrr...

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.450
I'm glad we are not doing that video today!

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.760

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.760
Soccer Help.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.770
An ice bath is the top way to remove soreness
in my opinion.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.050
For this video I'm going to teach you how
and why to get your legs up to remove soreness.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.050
Soccer Skill.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.099
This is for when you are watching TV, lying
in bed, etc and you don't want to be freezing

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:58.099
in an ice bath!

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:02.440
Key Point #1 -- Get your feet up above your
heart.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.689
There are a few ways you can do this.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.699
Soccer Drills.

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:18.850
Yoga Style -- Uuuuuummmmmmmm, Ummmmmmmm

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.460
TV Watching Style -- Mom, the meatloaf!!!

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.620
Youtubing in Bed Style -- Aww those are sweet
freekicks.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.420
Kiss me goodnight Ming.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.750
These are three basic legs up styles.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.750
Soccer Drill.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.630
Feel free to be creative but it's fairly straight
forward.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.870
Just get your legs up!

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.530
Reason being is this will alter the blood
flow to your legs and help move that soreness

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.530
outta there.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.100
Some people say this is a myth.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.990
I'm not a scientist but all I can say is it
worked for me when I was a pro, they do it

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.960
in yoga and I know other athletes that rest
like this with their legs up.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.449
Key Point #2 -- Do something productive when
you are relaxing.

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:09.900
Read a book, watch how to videos, watch pros
play soccer/football, do homework, etc.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.300
Soccer Drills for Kids.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.309
Key Point #3 --For the couch and bed leg up
styles you can lay with your legs up as long

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:21.209
as you'd like but don't do it for 5 minutes
and expect results.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.580
It takes a while.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.259
The Yoga pose is pretty intense.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:25.259
Soccer Skills.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:30.309
I'd do that one for no more then 5-10 minutes
depending on your yoga skills!

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.039
Namaste!

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:38.770
If your leg soreness isn't going away remember
that this is not flip the switch medical advice

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.770
here.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.900
You won't feel a massive difference right
away but it will help over time.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.199
The main point is to take care of your body
and rest.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.919
For example if you have a morning game and
a night game in the same day.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.509
Don't be walking around the mall all day when
you should be laying in bed with your legs

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.559
up, resting, relaxing and hydrating.

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.539
