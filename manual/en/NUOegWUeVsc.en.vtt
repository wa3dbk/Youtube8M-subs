Hey everybody what's up and welcome to Rock
Gamer your number 1 stop for all things Rock

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.771
Band 4, Guitar Hero Live and Amplitude related
and what I wanted to do now that E3 is on

00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:12.380
is give you a daily recap of everything we
learned today. It was kind of hard to track

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.660
down all the info but we got a lot of information
today about pre-order, about online play,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.880
about new songs being announced, pre-order
bonuses, pricing, release date. So lets get

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.640
started with the one thing i talked about
last week. I don't want to brag but i did

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.850
kind of call it. Although i am not really
happy to announce it. Online play will not

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.370
be part of Rock Band 4 at launch. In a Q&amp;A
that Aaron Tries did for Rock Band 4 he said

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.829
that at launch they are only focused on supporting
local multiplayer which means just you playing

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.800
in a living room with other people and they
are not going to launch with online play.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.469
It seems a lot has to do with how many people
actually play online. And It's a pretty big

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.049
investment to have online play at launch . It
seems like maybe they'll do it after launch,

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.350
but right now no online play at launch .I
am really bummed out about that, but lets

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.879
see what they do in the future. The other
thing we learned about was freestyle guitar

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.430
solos. If you remember a couple weeks ago
i had a video up showing exactly what the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.000
freestyle guitar solos look like and i took
it down because i didn't want to ruin any

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.590
surprises that harmonix had for E3 and we
finally saw how it works and basically it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.350
looks like during your solo section in a song
i think you can choose exactly when to deploy

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.880
it or when you use it from the articles i've
read. You get to basically improvise the solo

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.661
in any song whether it's a current rock band
4 song or it's past DLC so it looks like it

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:34.460
works with old DLC because in the trailer
for it they are playing Running Down a Dream

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.829
by Tom Petty and that was an old DLC song
that came out a while back. So you can basically

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.310
choose to play whatever you want and you can
choose to have the game score you on it or

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.310
you can choose not to have the game score
you on it. Or if you don't want to do freestyle

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.689
guitar solos you can just turn it off . So
the way it works the game will sort of guide

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.929
you in terms of what to play in terms of the
solo. So there you maybe prompted to just

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.079
play one frets, there maybe other prompts
to play certain frets on the guitar neck and

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.740
then there's certain props to just play whatever
the hell you want . And the game apparently

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.330
scores you and they've also said that it's
really impossible to make a bad guitar solo

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.910
or come up with a bad solo. They've made it
so it sounds good no matter what you're playing

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.320
So that's a new interesting feature to learn
about. I'm kind of curious to know what do

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.720
bass players do for their own freestyle expression.
Are they going to have the same thing. or

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.750
do they have their own thing for bass players
because you know it's bad enough getting stuck

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.291
playing bass and now you can't even do your
own freestyle bass section. But we'll see

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:35.440
what they announce. They also announced five
new songs that would be on the setlist and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.220
on disc for the game. We have benjamin booker
violent shiver. If you saw the new trailer

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.790
that came out today that's the new song. We
also got bruno mars by uptown funk. I predicted

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.650
this song in one of my setlist videos and
i also requested it as well. We also got Elvis

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.510
Presley which i think is the big name they
were talking about on the IGN May long reveal.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.790
The song Suspcious Minds, we have Queens of
the Stone Age My God is the Sun, which is

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.090
another song i predicted. So so far i am not
doing too bad And we got Scandal The Warrior

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.340
So these are the five new songs in addition
to the seven they have already announced.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.630
So let's talk about pre -order and pricing
.So the game will launch on October 6th worldwide

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.070
on PS4 and Xbox One. The game will come with
a couple different skus. You can buy the band

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.700
bundle which is $250.00 US Dollars or if your
into Canada like i am you'll pay $300 CDN

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.950
plus tax which is a ridiculous price for me.
If you want the guitar and game bundle that

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.170
is $130.00 US or $170.00 Canadian. That's
on par with roughly i think how much the guitar

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.370
hero live bundle will be as well. It's $130
US or maybe it's $130 Canadian.. Just check

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.830
it on ebgames. The other thing they announced
is that there will be 30 bonus songs. Oh before

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.940
i go onto the bonus songs i want to give you
guys some retrospective. Rock Band 1's bundle

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.900
was $169.99 Rock Band 2's bundle was $189.99
so the price has gone up maybe because the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.530
quality of the hardware is much better than
its as on the previous generation. Maybe that's

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.650
why there is a significant price increase.
The other thing they announced is that if

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.810
you pre-order rock band 4 regardless of where
you pre-order from there's going to be a couple

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.590
advantages to pre ordering. So first and foremost
they've said that there is going to be a shortage

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.970
of stock of this game so if you don't pre
order now you may not be guaranteed it at

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.780
launch. The second thing is that you'll get
thirty free bonus songs so if you remember

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.860
rock band 2 when it came out you got 20 or
25 bonus songs they were all harmonix bands

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.270
so you'll see harmonix bands again if you
guys want to see the entire list click the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.000
description box below you'll see the 30 songs
you get. The other thing they also announced

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.440
is that if you actually pre-order from Amazon
you'll actually get 4 bonus songs no top of

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.190
the 30 songs and you'll get Alabama Shakes
Don't Want to Fight, Breaking Benjamin Failure,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.940
Death From Above Trainwreck 1979 and The Pretty
Reckless Follow Me Down .That basically summarizes

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:07.160
everything we learned about Rock Band 4. I;m
a little taken aback by how expensive it is.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.450
Like i was planning on getting new instruments
but now i am starting to question it because

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.850
maybe i can get some older instruments for
a lot cheaper and maybe use that money to

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.780
invest in something else. I also want to know
what are you reactions from the lack of online

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.330
play. From the responses i've read online
some people don't care because they never

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.960
played online, but for me i like to play online.
I've had people who i play with for the last

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.260
5-7 years and it's kind of sad i can't play
with them at launch but i want to hear what

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.300
you guys have to say and we're probably going
to learn a lot more at e3 So come back tomorrow

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.050
i am going to have a full recap of E3. Thanks
for watching guys. If you guys want to stay
