00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.800
Welcome to another video from Outsite.org

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.640
I'm here in the beautiful Bidstrup woods on Sealand (Denmark). 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.040
It's a forest where you are allowed to camp anywhere, and it's free.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.640
Just make your camp away from the paths. You can camp one night at the same camp.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.640
So get out there! The nature is great and it's free.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.520
I'll take a moment to show how I like to store the tent.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.460
I've stored the pegs and rods on the outside of the backpack.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.320
Or you can store them inside.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.420
And in the room used for the sleeping back I've got..

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.394
...the sleeping pad.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100
And the sleeping back

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.540
Also the rest of the tent.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.980
This saves some space in the backpack.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.320
We've lent the Abisko Lightweight 2 tent from Fjällräven.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.100
We've started our hike in Abisko so it was obvious to bring the tent with the same name.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.060
It a lightweight tent, so not a Ultra Light tent.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.420
The weight is 2,6 kg. (91.7 oz.) and it's a reliable tent in the mountains.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.280
It's a 3 season tent, so use it spring, sommer and fall.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.600
The Abisko tent is made of the Akka model.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:59.200
They've upgraded the materials and therefore saved some weight.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.440
If you'll like to same 400 grams. (14 oz.) more, you can get the Singi tent. 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.220
On Singi the awning is much smaller.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:24.040
The inner cabin is 2,25 meters (7.4 feet) long. Enought space even for the tall ones.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.660
I'm 1,96 meters (6.5 feet) and have enough room.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.940
It's 1,30 meter (4.3 feet) wide and that leaves 65 cm. (2.15 feet) for one sleeping pad.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.240
The measures makes it a real 2 persons tent.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:47.540
The tent is 90 cm. on the highest point. It's enought for a tall person like me, to sit up inside the tent.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.180
But, it's only in the middle of the tent.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.800
Like other Fjällräven tent's it's eas to get inside.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.740
Use the zipper with only one hand to get inside.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.380
When we get inside, we'll have a look at the awning. 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.480
I can sit upright and there is room enough for two person to cook a meal if bad weather outside.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.880
Put your backpacks here. Enough room for two backpacks.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.280
On our week long hike, the packs did not use more space than to this strap.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.180
Enough room for entrance to the tent. 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.700
A nice feature is that the door that opens obliquely over the tent.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:57.600
So entrance/exit is very easy. You don't have to bow your head and hassle, like in other tents.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.040
Vent ducks in both ends.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.460
Mosquito net.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.440
The vents and the door are reinforced.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.420
The sleeping area, let's get inside.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.120
There are two zippers so you can get out from both sides.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:33.480
2 pockets for storering. Normally there's 4 in the Akka series , but two is just fine.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.820
In the roff top we have a clothesline. Fine for drying your wet things.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.780
On a resent hike I got separated, due to an accident, from my tent buddy.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.080
He had the pegs and poles for the tent.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:58.820
I had to catch up with the group and had to camp using only 4 pegs and walking sticks.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:12.280
It all went surprisingly well, and the tent was stabel and fine to sleep in, thanks to the clothesline. A funny story. 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:19.020
The sleeping area bends inwards as you can see, so you'll have to have your head in this end. 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.820
It's not a problem and there are plenty of lengths in the tent.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.040
But as a tall guy like me, it's hard to get into the tent and take of your clothes .

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:40.520
If your buddy is already in the tent, it can be hard to turn around, to get your feet in the right direction.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.280
It was hard not to hit him with my feet in the movement. 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:55.080
Duo to the tent side it was a little hard, but I'm a tall guy.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:08.860
But my buddy Miko is 188 cm. (74 inches) and he had no problem and loved this tent.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.780
On our resent hike to the mountains the pole in the middle broke.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.420
I can't make the accident count in this test as this tent is a test tent from Fjällräven.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.840
I don't know the person who had this tent before me. He might've accidentally stepped on a pole or what ever...

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.640
The tent has also been used for "Fjällräven Classic" by the volunteers.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.980
So it's had to say why this pole broke.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:45.420
But what I can say is that a repair kit does come with the tent, so you can fix it on the spot.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.080
And we made a video for you to watch of how to repair the pole. (click on the link to see it).

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.900
Many users ask about this, so it is great to show how to, in a video.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.820
Thank you to: Fjällräven

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.280
