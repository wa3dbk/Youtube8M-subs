00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.000
To be or not to be, that is the question.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.200
Oh excuse me, hello and welcome, my name is
Big Buck Bunny indeed you might know me from

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.410
such films as, Big Buck Bunny.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.120
Welcome to my home, now just make yourself
comfortable while I open this book, my friends,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.460
let me tell you a sad but true story.&nbsp;

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.091
Did you ever ask yourself what happened to
all those loveable characters you used to

00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:38.730
see on the big screen when you were growing
up.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.060
No matter what they might have told you in
the movies they didn't live happy ever after.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:51.160
And as awful as this may sound, many of them
were locked away in the deep dark dungeons

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.940
of mount copyright.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.610
Only to be guarded by the terrible beasts
we call "lawyers".&nbsp;

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.759
Unlike many of my friends I was a lucky one,
by releasing me under the Creative Commons

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.750
Attribution licence, my makers garunteed that
I at least would be able to enjoy a long and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.770
prosperous career doing what I love best,
acting.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.760
This means I am able to be here with you for
as long as you want and take part in new adventures,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.850
some of which even my creators couldn't have
dreamed of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.900
My dear friends, let us come together and
make sure that more rather sizeable white

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.710
rabbits like myself will be able to jump around
and be free to act for whoever and in whatever,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.580
this means that future generations, your own
children can grow up together with their favourite

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.580
characters.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.369
Who knows they might even sleep better.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.560
Thank you for listening.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.970
Now where was I again.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.189
Erm, ah yes [...]
