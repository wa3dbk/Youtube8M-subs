Hi dear subscriber! Mostly you who's here for my Final Fantasy XI video!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
No i didn't forget about you! with my last video i've tried to give more kind of content!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But today we're here again on Final Fantasy XI and not for just a small boss because we're doing a Mythic one!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Absolute Virtue!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So who's this absolute virtue ? It's the ultimate boss from the 2nd addon of the game, Chain of Promathia

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's a little like Pandemonium Warden, i made a video of him before!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Of course once again, this fight is happening at level 99, So he's far from what he used to be back in the old days!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I think it was a fight that were supposed to last for more than 10 hours

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Most of player gave up on him, this is why Square-Enix released a video on their official website

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
To help player, it showed .... Barareo!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
No it's not a joke! I think everyone who fought this boss were traumatized

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But to give you an idea of his power, even at level 99, we need to be careful for his Meteor attacks

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Which can do a few thousand damage point! So imagine what it used to be at level 75

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The best is to go with a few summoner who'll use Perfect Defence and the usual Zerg Strategies

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
One of the good part is that the items he's dropping is actually still quite good!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Unlike most of the old boss from the game which doesn't give anything interesting anymore

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And it's easier to get access to him now since most of the Jailer

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It's the boss we had to fight to get access to him, are much easier and can be solo'd or Duo'd

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So not much more to say about him, this boss will stay a Mythic one

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
even though it's a little sad to see him fall like this!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Since Square-Enix is remaking old event to level 99, like Nyzul Isle

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Maybe one day we'll get a Level 99 Absolute Virtue, who knows!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I hope you enjoyed watching this video and it helped you if you wanted to try this boss!
