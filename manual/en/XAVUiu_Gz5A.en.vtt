00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.100
American Alligators are apex predators in the Everglades.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:26.655
They can grow between 10 to 12 feet in length and 
 they don’t have very many enemies at that size.

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958
Especially snakes.

00:00:57.028 --> 00:01:00.828
There is a new type of predator surfacing in the Everglades these days.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:02.715
Burmese Pythons.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.300
Alligators, especially adult alligators are certainly not used to being attacked by snakes.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.400
In this extremely rare footage, an overly aggressive Burmese 
 Python actually attacks a full grown American Alligator.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.800
A python of this size normally is no match for an adult alligator.

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:09.370
However, nature does take an extreme turn form time to time.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.400
And in this instance, instead of the alligator tearing up the snake to shreds,

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:19.820
It’s actually intimidated by the python and retreats.
