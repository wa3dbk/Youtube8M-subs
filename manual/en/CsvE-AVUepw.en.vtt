00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:08.050
Wow!

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.860
The flames are in full force now.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.210
Glass is shattering from the heat generated
from this inferno.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.839
Huh.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.140
Even the chard wood is beginning to splinter,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.949
Unable to withstand the weight of the 2nd
and 3rd floors above.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:36.229
You know, it is fires like these that made
me want to become a fireman.

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:43.129
To see raging death dance across the floors,
walls and ceilings is an incredibly beautiful

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.550
and mystical sight.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.399
Don't you agree?

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.870
With each person I pulled out of this burning
tomb

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.269
I saw more and more flashes of cameras from
my fans and admirers.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.269
It feels incredible to be loved and honored
like a hero.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.940
It is intoxicating even.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.750
I cannot get enough of it.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.200
That's why I keep going into the jaws of death
to save these irrelevant people.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.460
People like you.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.770
What they do not know is that I already know
how the flame is going to spread

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.460
And I know where it is safe and where it is
not.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.240
That's why I started the fire there...there...and
over there.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.160
Haha.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.960
Unfortunately, for you, I cannot pull you
from this beautiful place.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.270
You are the last one in the building...

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.010
well besides me.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.010
ttt.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:06.800
My fans tend to question how dangerous fires
like these can be if no one dies within them.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.450
That's why I must leave you here.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.400
My people must know how much danger I put
myself in.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.609
The adoration is more sincere this way.

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.190
You understand don't you?

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.590
*sigh* Look, here is some advice for you my
friend.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.040
Inhale the smoke.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.150
Haha.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.879
Trust me when I say that it is better than
the alternative.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.889
Okay then...uh

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.650
See ya after the cinders die out, I guess.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.220
hmhm.
