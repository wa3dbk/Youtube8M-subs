00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.890
ultimately the provision of space and
the ability to live in large groups

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.160
can enhance a chimpanzee's life We
we're bringing in

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.789
111 additional chimpanzees it will
double Chimp Haven's population and it's

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.869
definitely a turning point in our campaign

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.070
we're starting to see more chimpanzees
go into retirement as we've been

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.519
successful over the years

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.910
I've worked with Chimps for over 15 years

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.710
and I've worked with them in the laboratory environment prior to coming

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.130
to Chimp Haven and to witness chimps

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.290
coming out into the natural habitat
after seeing what they've been exposed

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.410
to in the past

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.930
is rewarding beyond anything I can say

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.630
seeing the chimps step out into the yard
for the first time

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.800
and to be

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.730
kind of faced with all of this immense space where they just sit

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.040
and look up and with this awe of amazement

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.870
like "there's no bars above me" it's just absolutely

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.510
phenomenal to witness

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.860
several of us have known some of these chimps prior to them being here

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.060
and to actually see them step on ground
for the first time

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.610
and not be very unsure about it because they've never touched it before

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.910
or to see another chimp and realize there's no bars between them and to be able

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.000
to groom

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.310
and just learning the dominance
hierarchy

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.170
who's going to be submissive in a group
it was going to be dominant its it's a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.040
very exciting

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.710
process it's amazing to witness and
really is a testament to how much the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.560
chimps grow once they get here to Chimp Haven

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.120
this is unprecedented this is the largest group of government owned chimpanzees

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.440
to be retired from a laboratory And now these chimpanzees get to come out and be in

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.340
big groups

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.310
and exhibit the same type of behavior that
their wild counterparts would do

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.690
it just makes me speechless

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.300
we believe that these chimpanzees who
have given so much

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.040
to humankind that it's only fitting that
we give back to them

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.720
and let them enjoy their retirement
years

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.720
and in as close to a natural habitat as we
can possibly create for them

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.409
some of these chimpanzees are over 50 years old

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.330
so it's incredible to see that they came from the wild where they were

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.500
able to climb trees

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.049
and now they're back to climb trees in a more natural setting

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.390
this is not like anything we're able to do usually

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.260
working on it you prevent additional research often

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.360
but you don't actually physically
see animals get out

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.120
to a place like this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.720
so this is a huge victory and with hundreds more in laboratories

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.400
we're very close to getting them here It's been a long road
