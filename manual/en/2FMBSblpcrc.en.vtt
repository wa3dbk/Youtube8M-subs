00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:21.327
571,230,000 pounds of paper towels

00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:25.093
are used by Americans every year.

00:00:27.313 --> 00:00:29.737
If we could --
correction, wrong figure.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.235
13 billion used every year.

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:35.324
If we could reduce
the usage of paper towels,

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.354
one paper towel per person per day,

00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:45.557
571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.

00:00:45.618 --> 00:00:47.831
We could do that.

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:51.330
Now there are all kinds
of paper towel dispensers.

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:53.252
There's the trifold.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.080
People typically take two or three.

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:58.456
There's the one that cuts it --

00:00:58.456 --> 00:00:59.815
that you have to tear off.

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:02.754
People go one, two, three, four tear.
This much, right.

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:06.372
There's the one that cuts itself.

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:08.820
People go one, two, three, four.

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:13.892
Or there's the same thing
but recycled paper.

00:01:13.893 --> 00:01:15.312
You have to get five of those

00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:17.460
because they're not
as absorbent of course.

00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:18.930
(Laughter)

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.520
The fact is you can do it all
with one towel.

00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:27.269
The key, two words.

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:31.198
This half of the room
your word is 'shake.'

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:32.571
Let's hear it, 'shake.'

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.107
(Audience) Shake.
Joe Smith: Louder.

00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:35.484
(Audience) Shake.

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:37.541
Your word is 'fold.'

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:39.876
(Audience) Fold.
JS: Again.

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.623
(Audience) Fold.
JS: Really loud.

00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:43.420
(Audience) Shake.
(Audience) Fold.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.225
OK. (Laughter)
Wet hands.

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:52.158
Shake. One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:57.661
Why 12? 12 apostles. 12 tribes.
12 zodiac signs. 12 months.

00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:01.942
The one I like the best
it's the biggest number with one syllable.

00:02:01.943 --> 00:02:03.154
(Laughter)

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:06.998
Trifold.

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:08.015
(Applause)

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:09.043
Fold.

00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:13.963
Dry.

00:02:15.043 --> 00:02:16.368
(Applause)

00:02:18.898 --> 00:02:20.199
(Audience) Shake.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.820
(Audience) Fold.

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:28.625
Cuts itself. Fold.

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:31.333
The fold is important
because it allows

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:34.600
interstitial suspension.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.098
You don't have to remember
that part but trust me.

00:02:37.098 --> 00:02:38.566
(Laughter)

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:43.491
(Audience) Shake.

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:47.841
(Audience) Fold.

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:50.579
Cuts itself.

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:57.691
The funny thing is I get my hands drier
than people do with three or four

00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.337
because they can't get in
between the cracks.

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:03.116
If you think this isn't as good.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.581
(Audience) Shake.

00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:08.732
(Audience) Fold.

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:15.517
Now, there's now a real fancy invention.

00:03:15.517 --> 00:03:18.917
It's the one where you wave
your hand and it kicks it out.

00:03:19.288 --> 00:03:21.573
It's was too big a towel.

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:23.991
Let me tell you a secret
if you're really quick,

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:26.779
if you're really quick
and I can prove this...

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.150
This is half a towel
from the dispenser in this building.

00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.286
How? As soon as it starts
you just tear it off.

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:37.699
It's smart enough to stop
and you get half a towel.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.224
(Laughter)

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:41.818
(Audience) Shake.

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.849
(Audience) Fold.

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:56.287
Now let's all say it together.

00:03:56.287 --> 00:03:58.355
(Audience) &amp; JS: Shake.

00:03:58.355 --> 00:03:59.834
(Audience) &amp; JS: Fold.

00:04:00.602 --> 00:04:02.970
You will for the rest of your life

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.508
remember those words
every time you pick up a paper towel.

00:04:07.508 --> 00:04:12.286
And remember: one towel
per person for one year.

00:04:12.287 --> 00:04:15.999
571,230,000 pounds of paper.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.646
No small thing.
And next year, toilet paper.

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:21.945
(Laughter)
