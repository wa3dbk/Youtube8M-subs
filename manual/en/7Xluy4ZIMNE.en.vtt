00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.489
Good morning, agent Rodol Phito.

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.090
Before he disappeared last year Doctor Dvorak
developed an autonomous weapon. New intel

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.329
suggests that the item designated as "Rhodes
3" is being upgraded and is currently held

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.660
in a secret facility behind enemy lines.
Your mission, should you choose to accept

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.510
it, is to break into the highly secure weapon
factory, steal the "Rhodes 3" and destroy

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.630
the facility.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.140
As always, should you or any member of your
team be caught or killed, the Secretary will

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.500
disavow all knowledge of your actions. This
message will self-destruct in five seconds.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.000
Good luck Rodol.
