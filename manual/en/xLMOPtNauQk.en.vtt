00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.200
in the United States tens of millions of
children and adults lack adequate access

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.450
to a fundamental component of wellness
dental health care we have the best oral

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.340
health care delivery system in the world
but it just doesn't reach as far as it

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.130
needs to in north and northwest
philadelphia lack of education and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.740
poverty merge to deny the care this
population desperately needs if you had

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.390
the choice between you know spending
your afternoon trying to make sure heat

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.980
is turned back on or making sure that
you can pay your bills that's going to

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.800
be a higher priority than your oral
health some challenges are cultural in

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.780
rural wetumka Oklahoma many of Bonita
Baker's patients are young children

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.710
raised by relatives and they're never
taught the importance of basic oral

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.159
health care I was raised really poor and
when I see a lot of these kids I see a

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:08.509
lot of myself and these kids we had a
child that came in and had decay in

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:15.020
almost every baby tooth and when I would
talk to him and explain him and how

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.350
important it was to brush his teeth you
know he said well I don't have a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.039
toothbrush I don't have toothpaste I
don't have anything the group and other

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.909
Native American tribes in Siskiyou
County California face yet another

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.450
challenge geography some of these
patients live out in areas where there's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.090
not even electricity they may not have
running water cell phone service is

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.280
non-existent the impact of it being very
remote on dental care is profound

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.890
because those patients that live in some
of those outlying areas they really may

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.149
not have any way to even get to our
clinic. Open really big for me like

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.009
an alligator! delivering dental health
care to these underserved populations is

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.359
not a new challenge but the American
Dental Association has a unique new

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:11.540
solution the community dental health
coordinator or CDHC is this tooth back

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.260
here that's when giving you the problem
CDHC received 18 months of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.060
cross-disciplinary education then
provide oral health services and act as

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.650
a conduit between those in need of care
and the dentists who provide it forty

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.180
percent of bacteria causes ninety
percent of all disease in the mouth it

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.030
allows folks to go in and do the kind of
education and community mapping and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.170
outreach that we haven't done before in
dentistry and it's great when they're

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.830
people that are from the community that
the people know and you give them the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.510
skill sets that they need to go into the
community where they come from and then

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.410
educate navigate and bring people in or
that you'd receive the kind of treatment

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:02.340
that everybody deserves patients are
often more comfortable with me as a CDHC

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.870
rather than a doctor because they can't
relate to me more because i'm from the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.739
community when you gain access to those
families and you have ability to educate

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.200
them and make a little bit of a
difference in the field then those

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.700
families aren't quite so frightened to
come to the clinic and be seen before

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.390
she pulls the two without we want it to
be cleared won't be any affection in

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.760
here okay the CDHC curriculum is a
comprehensive mix of dental and public

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.470
health education combining online course
work through Rio Salado college with

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.609
hands-on clinical training they always
want to know more everybody has to have

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.760
a passion if you want to if you want to
be a part of that program whether as an

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.540
instructor or is this as a student and
as anybody ever showed you how to brush

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.329
your teeth when people don't have
healthy teeth you get this you know and

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.299
nobody smiles when they feel good about
their mouth you get this and you see a

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.950
difference in the overall personality of
the patient what happens in your mouth

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.870
affects what happens everywhere else
beneath everything beneath all the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.940
hardship and the suffering that goes on
sometimes in our community I think that

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.549
there is truly good underneath all of
that and so if we can work to restore

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.870
things if I can be a part of that then
that's great really enjoy taking a class

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.530
and I know it's going to be helpful
community this has been one of the most

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.110
rewarding professional work experiences
I've ever had some of our trainees had

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.170
absolutely no dental experience coming
into the program but they are absolutely

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.340
high-quality highly skilled oral health
professionals now who are proud to have

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.110
an impact in their community I think
it's an excellent work for small I think

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.530
it has a tremendous amount of merit and
potential and I think it's something

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.240
that hope could and should be adopted
and become a new member of the dental work

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.300
force team awesome good job

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.699
you
