00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.170
Hello Viewer. In this video I will talk more
in depth about the Goblin Workshop/Gnomish

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.480
Gearworks.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.480
At level 1 this building will create one of
4 random items for you each day.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.970
The Sticky Grenade launcher shoots a bomb
at a targeted enemy. It has about a 2 second

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.869
cast time and taking damage interrupts the
"cast". Once it is succesfully launched it

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.140
will tick for 6 seconds and then explode,
dealing a pretty nice amount of AoE damage

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.940
centered on the target. This item has 25 charges
and has a 6 second cooldown. As with all the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.260
workshop items, you can get more charges if
you run out, or if you destroy the item. It

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.359
may be a bit boring, but the DPS boost is
quite good.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:54.289
The Pneumatic Power Glove is in my opinion
purely for PvP. It pulls the target towards

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.320
you (DK style) if you are melee, or knocks
them away if you are ranged. It also deals

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.450
a minor amount of damage. It has a 2 minute
cooldown and 10 charges. Great fun for knocking

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.790
enemy players off a ledge, but mobs just run
up a wall like nothing happened.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.479
The Robo Rooster summons an angry chicken
which will fight your enemies for 10 minutes,

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.939
or until it accidentally takes damage from
an AoE ability. It has only 20k hitpoints so keeping

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.030
it alive is pretty hard. While it is alive
though, it deals a minor amount of DPS to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.640
your enemies, until it goes berserk. When
that happens it starts hitting pretty hard.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.740
Its cooldown is the same as its duration,
10 minutes, and it has 5 charges.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.740
The final level 1 item is the Skyterror, which
is a rocket and goblin glider combo. It shoots

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.060
you pretty high into the air and then deploys
a glider, similar to the one engineers can

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.119
make. This item is awesome, period. The only
downside is that it only has 2 charges before

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.229
you have to return to your base. You can use it
while in combat though, to escape like a coward,

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.590
or generally to travel to areas you normally
cannot reach. Or just, you know, because flightpaths

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.850
are for losers.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.510
At level 2, 5 more items become available
for the random selection.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.010
The Prototype Chopper is a mount, except it
has a vehicle interface with a shiny red button.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.740
When pressed it will blow up the motorcycle,
dealing a nice amount of AoE damage around

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.920
you and knocking you into the air. You do
bring a parachute so you won't take any damage

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.530
yourself. This item has 10 charges. Unfortunately
it's only as fast as your regular mounts,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.510
and it will cost you a charge every time you
get off. Still, could be fun in Ashran.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.780
The "Bullseye" Guided Rocket is a flying mount.
It will also boost

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.760
your speed by an enormous amount for the first
few seconds, AND it will explode if you fly

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.260
into an enemy. However... It only lasts for
1 minute, after which it disappears without

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.600
giving you a parachute or glider. Also, the
boost you get is fairly uncontrollable, so

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.700
make sure you deploy this item on a hill or
facing a nice open field. Also it has to be

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.420
deployed, so it will be hard to use it in
combat, and it only has 2 charges. Still,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.820
its a flying mount in an expansion without
flying, so... best item in the game!

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.920
The Sentry Turret Dispenser lets you drop
3 turrets next to you that will start shooting

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.100
your enemies. Their damage is decent, and
their hp is fine considering there are 3 and

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:50.100
they only last 30 seconds. A fine allround
item for soloing. It has 5 charges and a 30

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.900
second cooldown.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.540
The Micro Jetpack turns your jump into a superjump
for 10 minutes. You will jump sort of like

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.750
a forward disengage, and when you land you
deal some AoE damage. The damage is pretty

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.670
minimal, but still fun to kill critters with.
It has an extremely low cooldown, after you

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.420
land you can almost immediately use it again,
and it is pretty fun. I don't think it's faster

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.280
than mounting, but in Ashran it can definitely
be beneficial to get away from melee fights,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.410
or jump right in and chase people, if you're
one of "those" players. It's also great for

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.180
moving quickly inside areas where you cannot
mount. Unfortunately it will not let you jump

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.120
off buildings or mountains with superspeed.
10 minutes duration, and 5 charges.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.120
And finally the NUKULAR Target Painter. It's
the red dot of death from StarCraft. You mark

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.250
an area and everyone around you will receive
a warning. Then after a few seconds a very

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.300
powerful AOE will hit, killing everything
it touches, or at least everything that has

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.300
less than 500k health. Of course only stupid people
will get hit by this, like all NPC's ever,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.350
or that alliance guy I polymorphed, but still...
who doesn't want to have their own nuke? 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.680
It has a 1 hour cd and 1 charge.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.090
To unlock level 3 of this building you will
have to use all the random items a certain

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.940
amount of times. Since you can keep spawning
them over and over in the same day it shouldn't

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.060
take too long. At level 3, in addition to
the random items, you will be able to summon

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.280
a siege vehicle once a day. It has no time
limit, but once it's destroyed that's it

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.560
for today. Sadly I was not able to get this
achievement before beta ended, so I can't

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.560
show you the Demolisher in action. Let's just
watch it stand here instead.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.450
I don't know it if was a beta bug or intended,
but when I built my level 2 workshop I got

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.690
both the nuke and another random item each
day. Except occasionally when only the nuke

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.950
would be available. I kinda hope Blizzard
will not fix this if it is a bug, because

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.780
I'm not sure if 1 item at a time will outweigh
the permanent bonuses the other large buildings

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.180
give. Still...

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.600
How can ANYTHING POSSIBLY compete with THIS!

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.460
And that's it for this video. Thanks for watching and cya later!
