00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
hello friends welcome to Rock &amp; Play today
let's learn to give the flamenco hit

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.210
There are different types of
hit and we will learn for example the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.980
of the rumba ... the blow is going to hit
this finger or with these two to make it sound

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.950
deeper the movement that they are going to
do the fingers is going to be like that

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.570
generally at the same time that the finger hits
the thumb has to go down

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.149
then you have to do the thumb this
movement and the annular and the middle of

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.149
this other so that it sounds at the same time

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.379
not doing so with the hand the
thumb that supports the sixth string and to the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.030
time the other finger goes down it hits

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.730
we play with a rumba rhythm

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.309
we make a wheel

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.940
this blow is also used in the rhythm of
sevillanas

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.320
we make a wheel for example

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.890
also used in the bulería rhythm is
the only thing that the blow usually goes to

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.670
be done while we go down with the
index this time you have to practice this

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.570
movement as if we were playing the badges

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.240
you see that this time the thumb has not
moved and has stayed there

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.710
the last blow I can think of is the one that
it is given here

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.920
careful to do it diagonally nothing
to do it so you hurt yourself

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:37.550
It is usually used in many
ends to a normal rumba wheel

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.020
It gives you a style that is much more
rich

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.260
finally there are people who to the bulería
instead of doing this hit ..... it makes

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.550
movement with the thumb too

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.690
well, this has been everything in relation
hit
