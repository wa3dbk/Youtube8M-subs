00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.119
I wanted to teach but not the bathroom duty
Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.250
Wanted to receive attention for my theory
Wanted to be left along to teach the beauty-

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.840
of Mathematics that I see- wanting it both
ways

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.770
this may be difficult- but that effort's rewarded
when the students- begin to connect things

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.530
cause all i want to do is help them be the
best they can be

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.910
and teaching- let's me share all that I see
Gonna challenge what you think

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.160
Forget what you thought that you knew, it's
obsolete

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.360
and without understanding of math it's incomplete
It's logic so I'll finish my proof/verse with

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.829
Q.E.D.
That's Quad Erat Demonstrandum don't you see?

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.750
Droppin some Latin, I'm hopin this one goes
Platinum

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.949
but I'm just a math teacher, and I'm...

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.390
I'm friends with the numbers inside of my
head

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.280
Always solvin equations, when I'm in my bed
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.830
Cause you think I'm crazy, but math is amazing

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.229
Even though most of ya don't know it
I'm always trying to show it- how math's affecting

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.900
you, impacting- everything you do
walking around streaming your favorite song,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.920
well none of that happens without the Fourier
transform

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.539
you see a signal can be broken down
into sines and cosines making it that much

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.960
smaller

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.030
it forms the basis of data compression
and it's just one reason you should pay attention!

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.219
Cause my flow is differentiable
and I'm rapping continuous on this interval

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.229
go back to the beginning and take the sum
of my lyrics

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.990
you'll find they're absolutely convergent
on the subject mathematics

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.450
Geometry's leading you and me innorexibly
To the precipice, calculus

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.390
I'm just relaying what the greats of the past said

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.380
I'm just a messenger- and I'm friends with the...

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.200
I'm friends with the numbers inside of my head

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.980
Always solvin equations, when I'm in my bed
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.260
Cause you think I'm crazy, but math is amazing

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.880
Call me crazy but I had this vision, one day we'd-

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.700
all understand, with mathematic precision

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.860
But until then I'll keep teaching- working on reaching

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.869
My message I'll be tweaking- for the kids

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.609
who tend to fight back- saying they learned way back all

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.500
the math they ever needed they were done at division

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.860
well a world without math's a metaphorical prison

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.830
I gotta say, it kinda limits your vision

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.819
but for each kid in my class

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.810
Who has struggled in the past and starts to understand that's great!

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.120
It pays back-all the work you're putting in that

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.010
math class- turn effort into skills and you can take that

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.939
into the world, make a difference- chase your
vision, make a big splash

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.239
maybe I need a math conference, face facts
I am nuts for math, and I'm okay with that

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:38.890
It's everywhere, so I'm friends with the...

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.340
I'm friends with the numbers inside of my head

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:53.189
Always solvin equations, when I'm in my bed
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.549
Cause you think I'm crazy, but math is amazing
