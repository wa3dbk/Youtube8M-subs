00:00:01.416 --> 00:00:05.036
This is a face of
distracted driving.

00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:07.176
This is Casey Feldman.

00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:09.846
Casey was a daughter,
granddaughter, sister,

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:11.986
niece, cousin, and friend.

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:15.266
She was kind, caring, had
a great sense of humor,

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:21.186
lived life to its fullest,
and was loved by many.

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:24.216
She was so funny,
and so vibrant,

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:28.906
and so beautiful in every way.

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:31.516
She was smart, she was
intelligent, she had goals

00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:34.526
for herself, she was really
grounded, and she was someone

00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:37.066
that you knew would grow
up to be somebody special,

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.516
somebody important
to other people.

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:45.056
Casey's life ended
on July 17, 2009.

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:46.236
She was struck and killed

00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:48.806
by a distracted driver while
she was crossing the street

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:50.266
in a crosswalk.

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.906
He had taken his eyes off the
road for just a few seconds.

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:57.556
It was the first time
that I ever lost somebody,

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:00.006
a friend, and someone my age.

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:05.976
And it just made me realize that
that could have easily been me,

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:09.646
that could have been my sister,
that could have been anybody.

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:14.146
Before Casey's accident I would,
I drove distracted and, like,

00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:17.446
I would let people who were
driving me be distracted.

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:19.076
I know, in high school, rushing

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:21.096
around to activities I'd
be eating in the car,

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:22.026
and doing make up in the car.

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:24.616
I actually wrote a
speech in the car once.

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:28.986
I was changing the radio while
backing out of a parking spot

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:30.616
and I hit a utility pole.

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:32.936
I would take my eyes off
the road to do make up,

00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:35.356
to text message,
to use my phone.

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:37.346
I think definitely as a teenager

00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:41.156
when you're first driving
you do feel invincible

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:43.506
and driving can become
a secondary task

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:44.456
to whatever you're doing.

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:46.486
You're basically
operating a weapon.

00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:47.916
I think that people
need to realize

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:50.536
that they're operating something
that has the power to change,

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:51.976
like, a thousand lives.

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:53.856
No matter what it is
you're trying to do

00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:54.666
in the car, it's not worth it.

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:57.736
When you're driving, you are
not, it's not a secondary task.

00:01:57.736 --> 00:01:59.756
It is the only task
you should be doing.

00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:01.396
We must learn from Casey's death

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:03.506
that as young people
we are not invincible.

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:06.306
And we learn that it just
doesn't happen to other people.

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:11.196
It happened to Casey, someone
that we love and miss very much.

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:14.906
I think of Casey lying on the
roadway after her accident

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:18.766
and when the police officer
asked her how it occurred she

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:20.996
said I want my mom.

00:02:20.996 --> 00:02:23.786
And I wasn't there to comfort
her in those last moments.

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:27.296
What will it take for us
to change the way we drive?

00:02:27.296 --> 00:02:32.086
I've stopped having
meals in the car.

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:34.776
I put one CD in and I
just don't change it.

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:36.966
I make sure my purse is
in the back seat now,

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:38.196
my phone is in the back seat.

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:40.926
If I'm driving that's
the only thing I'm doing.

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:43.886
This is the picture I have in
my car of Casey to remind me

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:45.846
to keep my eyes and
mind on the road.

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:47.466
You could do the same
with a picture of somebody

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:52.696
that you love and care about.
