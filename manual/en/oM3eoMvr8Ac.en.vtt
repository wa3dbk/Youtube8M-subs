realize it

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.730
to keep our risk

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.840

secure so dawn just in the bombing kids
like n_p_r_'s attack

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.789
and it isn't that much but

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.319
uh... but he's

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.919
for carryovers was developed right and
i'd rather than last year

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.569
any sucked for me rakhi

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.699
indian school any text as that

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:25.879
but impromptu awful

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.799
and i think is brandon jacobs the there
shortly

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.469
digest pretty good

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.019
uh... but i still didn't hate to keep
our

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.699
as some of them is a act on the guy
ernie's great right but you know

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.819
i don't hate them but i got a it's a

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.099
it seems like he's doing this so he
could artist rights in t_v_

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.089
like m_t_v_ you got to be there you know
you there's a different profession this

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.759
profession we criticize the people on
the field

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.409
and honestly he's being

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.719
enquiries a stroke

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.329
many is not some sort

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.579
bold strong leader

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.589
and he doesn't leave wrote the little
bit

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:05.580
but it seems like tds doing kind of a
proven south of the t_v_ guys

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.080
which is a lot of fortunate

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.359
i like them any struck by the aussie
anyone with it all

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.190
and they're both good guys

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.180
and it

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.619
they you know the thing that many has
really write about

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.520
even though i don't like the lining as a
playwright these kind of

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.260
newsweek's austria has made

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.049
uh... includes the bed

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.060
is barbara if you were so strong and you
are such a great leader

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.009
why'd you retired

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.500
forty-one and all time but i also
passion the fire inside

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.560
use the passion in the party cable run
tel aviv all but again i a passion fire

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.519
read the article saying time

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.769
the kind of illustrates exactly what
although also

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.259
report after the first

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.689
yelping seems to be coming up soon them
like this in the first place where is

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.019
that i was there don't deserve it before
and what's people said this in what they

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.349
got along when they played him

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.859
after what he said things not really
that was the most part of the legality

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.339
care bears

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.599
because some of the summer course that

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.459
you learned that he is that what i want
to money and and

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.349
and criticize my will talk about no
admitted that he he kind of half way to

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.149
go if you get a fire fight can fire
homie

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:13.319
do you think of downtown is like a lot
of saving battle bottom

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.910
it's cavalry within whether that kind of
gives up when you have worked in seizing

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.979
handed to them and be some kinda idea
but i do you like him and made a it you

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.430
know how old uh...

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.719
that player

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:27.749
uh... are guarded and what they say
'cause they don't want face a blog

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:28.960
proportion

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.830

really present to you for sending this

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.990
