Words can not always express our feelings, specially in such emotional occasions

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.560
One time I was asking him why don't you use PC

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.540
He always hated technology

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.880
He was a sincere employee who always like to keep people waiting

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.900
So he told me

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.400
You know he doesn't speak

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.480
But what I understood from him that he enjoys searching for files manually

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.980
Now it's time to hear poetry by me

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.860
What's wrong with you guys, he is dead he can not hear anybody, just bury him already

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.340
You're the dead one, he is alive! here, in our hearts!
