00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.240
Hello everybody my name Helder Reis

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.180
welcome to my channel, today i'm gonna
sharpen my bandsaw blade

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.929
using this file. So i'm gonna start
by removing the blade,

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.200
make sure the machine is unplugged.

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:25.969
Now that the blade is out, I'm gonna 
clamping it in my vice.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.620
So as you can see

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.120
it doesn't take much, just to bring back
the edge

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.340
on each tooth,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.340
a few strokes, once you get to rhythm, I
think I can do this blade in about ten

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.160
fifteen minutes.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
Try to maintain	

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.650
this angle

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.800
so you don't cutting just, or removing
material 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.290
just at the tip, try to remove evenly

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.860
across the tooth

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.400
coming up to the end

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.500
one more

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.479
Welcome back,

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.110
took me roughly fifteen minutes, it's done,
I'm gonna put it back again in the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.930
machine,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.750
and make a test cut.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.590
Nice and tight,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.410
put some tension

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.700
on the blade,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.270
and we're going to a test cut.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.920
Next step will be to make the test
cut, and I have planned not just a

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.830
small test cut, this will be a
heavy-duty test cut, check this out!

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.680
big fork

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.799
leftovers from firewood, that
we use in the fireplace.

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.529
Let's see if the blade cuts.

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:50.939
Actually

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.889
i'm impressed

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.689
very very hard wood

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.249
I'm gonna make a secund cut,

00:02:58.249 --> 00:02:59.790
to have a better view.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.039
Amazing

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.959
it went through the log, like if it
was nothing.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.139
I'm very impressed actually, for fifteen
minutes or so, of filing,

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.899
this blade is cutting as 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:58.119
very close as if it was new, for now I
just have to say, thank you for watching

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:02.099
my videos, and I see you next time
on Mrmyvids4you. Thank you
