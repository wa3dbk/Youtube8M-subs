00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.270
I’m Dan Gray for MPGomatic.com and this
is the 2012 Buick Verano

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.590
The 2012 Buick Verano is equipped with a direct-injected
2.4-liter inline four cylinder engine and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.860
six-speed automatic transmission.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.940
The DOHC FlexFuel four produces 180 horsepower
and 171 foot pounds of torque.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.230
The Verano’s capability to run E85 ethanol
offers a significant advantage in certain

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.030
geographic locations, in these uncertain times.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.019
The official fuel economy estimates for the
2012 Buick Verano are 21 city / 32 highway

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.400
miles per gallon (MPG).

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.040
We traveled well over 400 miles in our Crystal
Red 1SL review unit and waved to the official

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.820
mileage estimates, with an average of 34.8
MPG on the Interstate highway and 29.6 MPG

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.930
combined with temperatures ranging from the
thirties through the sixties.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.310
While the Verano’s no rocket on rails, the
2.4-liter Ecotech four clears the launch pad

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:23.530
with ease.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.810
The monochrome Driver Information Center provides
a wealth of data, including tire pressure,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.740
oil life, and fuel range, along with those
essential average and instant fuel economy

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.100
displays.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.450
What you may have heard about the Verano is
true.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.680
The cabin is exceptionally quiet.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.280
Buick’s use of acoustic laminated glass
and sound absorption materials turn the sedan

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.200
into a veritable library on wheels.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.680
Our tester was fitted with the 1SL Leather
Group option package.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.370
The front buckets have three-level heating,
with six-way power adjustment in the driver’s

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.370
seat.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.670
The beefy leather-wrapped steering wheel provides
full controls and is heated as well.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.680
Parking chores are eased with ultrasonic rear
parking assistance.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.100
Intellilink and a 9-speaker Bose audio system
clearly demonstrate that this isn’t your

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.140
Grandpa’s Buick, with all the goodies, including
a seven-inch LCD display, XM Radio, and Pandora-integration.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.170
Handsfree Bluetooth, OnStar and USB input
are standard.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.810
iPod integration is good, although we experienced
some hiccups with our old iPhone 3G.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.239
There are two twelve-volt outlets: one concealed
at the base of the dash, and one at the back

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.849
of the center console.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.769
The USB and auxiliary audio inputs are located
inside the center console.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.049
The back seat provides 37.8 inches of headroom
and 33.9 inches of legroom.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.980
The fold-down center armrest provides two
drink holders for passengers so inclined.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.689
The Verano’s trunk provides as much as 15.2
cubic feet of storage.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.730
The amount of storage space drops to 14 cubic
feet if equipped with the spare tire/jack

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.389
kit and Bose premium audio system.

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.720
The 60/40 rear seat folds down to accommodate
longer items.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.360
All-in-all, the 2012 Buick Verano succeeds
by delivering a quiet ride and solid fuel

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.090
economy, at price significantly below many
of its competitors.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.930
The Verano’s FlexFuel-capable engine should
put it at the top of the short list in geographic

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:27.629
locations where E85 ethanol is plentiful and
markedly less expensive than unleaded gasoline.

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.979
