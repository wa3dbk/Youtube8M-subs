data realty builds world-class data
centers in lower-cost secondary markets

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.289
that are designed to power in the
analytics of the day that we house

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.059
organizations around the country whether
it be further disaster recovery or

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.929
primary data hosting house their data
here in south bend in a lower-cost

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:21.560
market

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.399
data realty was building a facility in a
secondary market what we did what to do

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.249
with sacrifice on quality in any way and
so we went with best debris from a

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.809
design standpoint from every piece of
the infrastructure all the way through

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.000
wattenberg they've offered us was an
ability to gain allot more cabinets in a

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.809
smaller amount of space because of the
ice so floor design and also be able to

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.390
bury arco lila hotmail designed such
that we can actually who'll a lot more

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.570
contained space actually drive more once
per square foot into our facility

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.260
perfect is with us every step of the
design process providing cad drawings

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.490
very early on that we could work with
our

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.960
entire datacenter design team to be able
to really maximize our space should give

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.230
us a vision early on and what we wanted
this facility to be

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.640
because the verdict for doesn't require
all the pedestals at a traditional floor

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.260
does

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.799
it was about half the time of insulation
for what we were able to do so it really

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.430
does shorten the construction timeframe
they were able to keep us on schedule in

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.670
our ongoing growth will be able to put
their foreign much quicker time

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.090
the panel system itself is is a very
strong foreign system

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.670
because of the substructure up being a
tube steel frame

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.020
uh... it is much more weight bearing
their traditional pedestal floor so did

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.799
not require est bein extra support
materials that go underneath the florida

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.970
support heavier equipment whether it be

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.810
the cooling loads of the p_d_ use or
actually the heavy sam's that are out

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.090
there were a group of them directly onto
the floor were able to actually utilize

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.830
less brownie points as well where we
only needed to win the space

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.400
the perfect floor allowed us tremendous
flexibility in that you could do to put

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.320
out a two to three foot tiles dvd forty
two inch tiles depending on what the the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.790
depth of your cabinet what's and because
of that we are able to go in our design

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.360
four-foot how tiles and three-foot
holdouts

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.549
the three-foot airflow panels by being
able to be customized in being able to

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.420
pick up that foot in each row actual
out-of-state increase our revenue by ten

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.959
to fifteen percent projection over what
we have done previously so the verdict

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.120
floor being able to carry heavier weight
loads being able to do the three foot

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.010
hole dousing condense it to be able to
pressurize those in a way that we can

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.850
handle backseat and be able to get rid
of it in a very efficient manner perfect

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.269
allowed us to further our vision for
what we want to stay centered

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.119
as we all know things can change to
customers who want something different

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.409
than what you ever expected the nice
thing is that the verdict floor has

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.669
enough flexibility in the press to
continue to meet those needs

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.939
the customer service throughout with
spectacular they were on-site numerous

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.369
times before during and after the
installation process

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.299
and they follow that many times
afterwards continually say how they

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.260
could improve

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.409
what the best way to install their
product is at the same time making sure

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.939
we understood all the benefits of what
their product for up to us

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.459
what are you other things that attracted
us to berkeley when they looked at

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.870
making their intrinsic states is that
they chose american made steel dot was

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.370
produced actually here in the midwest
that was something else played into her

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.939
decision making this initial site in
south bend is one of many that we plan

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.749
on doing data realty is going to
differentiate itself nationally not only

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.999
by the way that we design our centers
but more importantly how we help

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.469
organizations to utilize their data to
make business transformative decisions

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.079
and so as we continue to grow we look
forward to continuing our partnership

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:20.619
agreement
