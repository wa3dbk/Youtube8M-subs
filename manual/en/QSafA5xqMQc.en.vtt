00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:05.535
- Okay, this is a typical

00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:08.673
metal door with wood frame.

00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:10.900
We're gonna put a
Vancouver Special on here.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.218
We're gonna change the Weiser deadbolt

00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:14.815
or any deadbolt

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.342
to a heavy-duty Schlage.

00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:18.444
We're gonna put a door reinforcer on the,

00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:20.344
to make the door harder to kick in

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:21.727
and we're gonna put a security plate

00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:22.763
on the edge of the door.

00:00:22.763 --> 00:00:25.001
And if you just look at
the front of the door here

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.335
and this is a typical
install we see in everywhere.

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:31.584
In most condos nowadays you have one door.

00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:34.112
We have a residential grade deadbolt

00:00:34.112 --> 00:00:36.451
that you can buy at any Home Depot store

00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:39.274
and just a lever handle or a knob set.

00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:40.349
And this is the typical

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:42.394
to light-duty deadbolt.

00:00:42.394 --> 00:00:44.311
We have the metal frame

00:00:46.043 --> 00:00:48.441
with wood down the center

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.237
and the thumb turner on the inside.

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:51.657
A lot of times on these doors,

00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:54.063
when they kick the door in,

00:00:54.063 --> 00:00:57.060
the bolt will just break off

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.015
or this whole door here will split open.

00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:01.617
Sometimes as well,

00:01:01.617 --> 00:01:03.133
on a strike,

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.467
this whole door will be kicked open.

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:07.068
So this one's at least okay.

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:09.816
It has the three-inch screws
in there, so that's good.

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:11.097
But if you look at the hole,

00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:12.572
they haven't even drilled it in one inch.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.888
So this door has never
locked properly anyways.

00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:16.897
It's a poor install from before.

00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:19.054
So we'll put on a strike plate on here.

00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:22.476
This is the door
reinforcer or a mag plate.

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:24.694
It makes the door harder to kick in.

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:26.999
So when you saw the
metal edges on the wood,

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.623
this will fit on the door

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:31.100
and it'll make it harder to,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.861
for the door to split

00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:34.611
when somebody tries to kick it in.

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:37.434
It also offers some protection
against icepick attack.

00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:39.418
So again this lock,

00:01:39.418 --> 00:01:40.642
this will keep,

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.911
they say it doubles the
strength of the door.

00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:44.816
So it just makes it harder to kick in

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:46.099
and for these doors to spread.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.398
Okay we're gonna install
the door reinforcer.

00:01:48.398 --> 00:01:52.273
What's really good is we put in three

00:01:52.273 --> 00:01:53.448
three-inch screws.

00:01:53.448 --> 00:01:55.304
They'll catch the stud in the door frame.

00:01:55.304 --> 00:01:57.497
So again this makes the
door harder to kick in.

00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:59.222
So we'll install this on here.

00:01:59.222 --> 00:02:01.044
Put it in the three-inch screw,

00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:02.985
the three-inch screws all the way down

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:05.052
and it'll make the door
way harder to kick in.

00:02:05.052 --> 00:02:07.136
You can see here now,

00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:10.014
the door reinforcer goes right
around the edge of the door.

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:12.356
At the back of the door we have the good

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:14.813
600 series deadbolt in there.

00:02:14.813 --> 00:02:16.175
It's a commercial-grade.

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:17.976
Same thing as the
hospitals and the schools.

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.771
And you see it doesn't
look like a monster lock.

00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:22.182
It fits in well.

00:02:22.182 --> 00:02:24.415
Some people like the full plate down here.

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:26.858
We never install the
deadbolts down there, hate it.

00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:28.884
Dead bolts always go here or higher.

00:02:28.884 --> 00:02:31.717
This was just, we took out
the old Weiser deadbolt

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:33.138
or light-duty deadbolt

00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:35.518
and we put in a heavy-duty deadbolt.

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:39.122
And this will make the
door harder to kick in

00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:40.369
and again some people sometimes

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.333
will put the full plate.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:44.009
We just wanted that plate

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:45.434
and again the door is way harder

00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:46.663
to kick in.
- Yeah.

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:49.847
- [Terry] Because it's the
new Schlage Everest system.

00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:50.842
It's six pins.

00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:52.191
It's got the side pin.

00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:55.699
Really hard to pick, hard to bump,

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.241
and very very difficult to pick.

00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:00.317
Actually, we don't have
a good time picking this.

00:03:00.317 --> 00:03:03.173
- [Locksmith] Let's open
the door and show the lock

00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:05.796
and the plate kind of together.

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:06.629
There's the plate.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.745
- There's the plate.

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:10.676
Got the three-inch screws.

00:03:10.676 --> 00:03:11.911
We have four of them.

00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:13.740
They've all caught the stud.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.115
It's a well-built house.

00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:17.106
So it's got the good frame

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:20.420
and now that will make the
door way harder to kick in.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.762
So this is our Vancouver Special

00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:25.975
heavy-duty commercial grade deadbolt.

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:28.683
It could be the high
security pick resistant lock

00:03:28.683 --> 00:03:30.310
or the 600 series.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.337
Schlage, absolutely love this.

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.759
My dad was installing
similar locks to this

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.181
and the door reinforcer
that goes across the front,

00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:40.319
the edge in the back of the door

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.402
makes it hard to kick in.

00:03:44.962 --> 00:03:46.939
And with the plate,

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.316
with the three-inch screws caught the stud

00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.718
makes the door harder to kick in.

00:03:51.718 --> 00:03:53.468
This is a good solid,

00:03:54.753 --> 00:03:57.836
the key even, it's a six pin Schlage.

00:03:58.777 --> 00:03:59.841
It's hard to pick.

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:01.704
Very very difficult to pick.

00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:03.763
It's not rated as pick resistant.

00:04:03.763 --> 00:04:06.255
The one up, lock up from this
is rated as pick resistant,

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:07.245
drill resistant.

00:04:07.245 --> 00:04:10.044
But this is a perfect
Vancouver Special install.

00:04:10.044 --> 00:04:10.877
- [Locksmith] Mhmm.

00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:11.710
- And again, you have it,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.060
commercial-grade Schlage

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.766
or the high security lock

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:16.033
that's just pick resistant.

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:18.077
It's the only difference between the two.

00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:18.910
Okay.
