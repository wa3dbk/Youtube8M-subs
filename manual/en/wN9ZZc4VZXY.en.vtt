00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.870
Hi I'm bakardi, im going to show you how to
get to the blazing chest in ordon sactuary.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.770
without the cape and without agroing any of
the adds.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.889
we'll be flying over from the jade forest.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.679
When you go over the water you will get a
bit of fatigue but, it is a short distance

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.179
so you don't need to worry.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.119
we're going to head to the north western corner
of the Timeless Isle to this little island

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.390
off the shore just here.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.160
it is pretty easy to spot as its a really
tall, kind of pillar island.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.580
as you can see just here.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.980
you're going to want to make sure you get
enough height that you will be able to slow

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.940
fall without hitting the edge or side and
not to high that you'll miss it.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.050
You will get this little buff or debuff here
that will stop you from flying when you get

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.080
close enough.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.940
as soon as you get dismounted, hit the slow
fall button.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.430
when you get close to it you can cancel it
but don't cancel it if you're too high, wait

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.430
until you are closer.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.289
If you're too high you will die on top of
the island and you will have to start all

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.130
over again.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.119
now you can heal yourself up if you've taken
some fall damage like myself.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.740
have a look around while you're up here.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.280
we're going to aim for the island which is
straight over there we are going to try and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.569
get to that doorway.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:29.499
you will need a running start, make sure you've
got your mount out and make sure you know

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:30.759
where you are going at least.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:41.219
we're going to aim for the top of the doorway.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.439
now this will be the same as before, when
you are mid air, so when you run and jump

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.630
you're going to hit that levitation button
or your slow fall and float all the way down.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.659
depending on your camera angle it may look
like you're going to miss, but if you've got

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:15.069
that levitation click just right you should
land right on top of this doorway.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.299
You can see from here, that's where the chest
should be.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.540
I've already got it on Bakardi so it wont
be showing for me.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.879
Once again, we're going to mount up.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.439
Aim for where the chest should be, or were
you will be able to see it.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.290
We're going to take a running leap and then
hit the levitation or your slow fall at the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.939
top of your jump, and just float all the way
down.

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.870
And now you should be able to open your chest.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.040
If you don't want to fight or run on the way
out, you can just hearth or use any of your

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.310
teleport trinkets if you have any.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.349
And now you have your blazing chest.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.319
Thanks for watching my video, I'll see you
next time.
