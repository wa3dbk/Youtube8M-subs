00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.540
Now that we determined the size of the strap
that we're going to use and we've determined

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.490
what we need to cut and we determined it was
39 inches by 6 inches. And I just have a piece

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.590
of fabric that I cut off the main piece of
fabric that I'm using. I haven't even cut

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.730
it yet. I haven't even measured it. But I
did make sure that one side of the fabric

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.480
was right along the grain. And if you have
a print on your fabric that's great or if

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.540
you have a selvage edge that you want to use
to measure against that's a really good idea

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.910
also. Me, I already cut mine. I know it's
pretty straight. And so what I'm going to

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.469
go ahead and do is I'm just going to cut 6
inches in. I'm going to mark the whole thing

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.059
6 inches over. Here we go. I'm not even going
to worry about the length of it yet because

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.110
I'll do that right after I cut this long piece.
Then we'll just measure 39 inches out and

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:06.189
cut that off. I'm just going to flip it over
and measure the other side. There we go. Here.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.820
That's 6 inches. I'm going to make some marks
in between just so I'll have a good guideline

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:21.490
when I'm cutting. So now that I have it marked
I'm just going to cut this out. Okay. I like

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.950
the thick straps. It's a good idea because
it disburses the weight of whatever you're

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.950
carrying in your messenger bag across your
shoulders. The thinner the strap the more

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.939
pressure it puts on your shoulders when you're
carrying your bag. That's why a lot of the

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.479
messenger bags you see out there have really
thick straps. Usually 2, 2 1/2 inches wide.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.920
Sometimes more. Maybe 3. Okay. So, there we
go. There's that. I'm just going to get rid

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.060
of this piece. So what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to measure 39 inches out and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.259
I have a ruler, a long ruler, a 36 inch ruler
on the front of my sewing machine so if you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.479
have a yard stick you can just use that. I
like to just run over here and measure this.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.790
There's 36 inches. And I'm going to do 3 more.
Okay so here's 39 inches. I just have it pinched

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.160
with my finger right here. And I'm going to
make a little mark but instead of just doing

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.700
39 I think I'm going to cut maybe just a little
bit more. I like to be, I'd rather be safe

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.790
than sorry. And then when I finish making
the straps, sewing it together I'll do a final

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.090
measurement before I actually sew it to the
bag itself. But for the next clip what we're

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.599
going to do. I'm going to show you how to
actually make the strap. And let's get started

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.550
on that in the next clip.
