00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.290
[music]

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.849
Beltone First is a revolutionary made-for-iPhone hearing instrument.

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.849
Along with being a great hearing aid unto
itself, the connection Apple devices

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.000
offers tremendous functionality to
enhance the end-user experience.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.360
This video series will provide you with
the necessary information

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.360
to get you up and running successfully.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.650
 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.400
In this segment to the Beltone First
instructional series

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.950
I'll demonstrate the HearPlus app and
all the great features that are

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.810
available to you.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.059
The first screen that you'll see when
using the app

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.710
is a volume control screen. If you push
the volume up

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.090
it will increase the volume. If you pull
the volume down

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.800
it will decrease the volume for both
hearing aids. At the bottom of the screen

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.670
is a mute button for the hearing
instrument microphones. Below the mute

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.160
button

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.790
is a switch that allows you to control
each hearing aid individually.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.210
The volume on the right controls the
right device.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.540
The volume on the left controls the left
device.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.710
You can also use a pinch to separate or

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.710
combine the volume controls. To enter the
program screen

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.399
tap the keypad icon in the upper left
hand corner.

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.070
On the screen you'll see all the
programs that are available to you.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.149
You can choose the one you want by
pressing the corresponding button.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.619
The program you've selected will become
highlighted.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.650
You can also choose a streaming program.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.830
Within these, you have the opportunity to
adjust the balance

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.770
between the hearing aid microphone and
the stream signal.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.020
You can adjust this balance for the
overall system,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.270
or, in each ear

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.570
individually.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.909
To adjust the treble and bass on the
instruments,

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.679
tap the icon in the upper left hand
corner. You'll see a selection to adjust

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.720
the treble and bass

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.480
at the bottom of the screen. Within this
screen

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.030
you have the opportunity to adjust the
low frequencies or the high frequencies

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.030
up or down by as much as 6 decibels.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.170
After making adjustments to the
instruments, you can save these

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.769
an associate them with the GPS location.
You can do this by tapping the icon

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.260
in the upper left hand corner and
choosing "At a place."

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.690
The next time you return to this place

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.019
you'll be prompted to load these settings
into your instruments.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.140
Across the top of the menu screen you'll
see a connection screen

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.819
which shows the status at the hearing
aid connection. Next to that

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.939
is a battery indicator which provides you
with information

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.829
about how much battery life is left in
the hearing instrument. Next

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.090
is the hearing aid finder. The hearing aid
finder has two modes

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.030
a nearby mode and a map mode. The nearby mode

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.359
uses the strength of the radio signal to
assess the distance that the hearing aids

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:26.720
are

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.920
from the Apple device.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.300
Within the menu there are a few other
items. First is "My places."

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.340
This provides you with a list of geo tags
you have associated with your hearing

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.480
instrument settings.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.530
Next, is "My hearing aid." This is an
on-board user manual.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.900
This section provides you with an
overview of device functionality,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.950
care and maintenance, and troubleshooting
techniques.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.030
Finally under settings there are some
additional items.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.030
Most importantly is an area where you can rename your programs.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.520
Thanks for watching and I hope this
information helps enhance your

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.600
experience with the Beltone First.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.340
 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.680
 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.930
