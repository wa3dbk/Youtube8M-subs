00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.830
One of Dr. Ehrman’s most well-known claims
about the New Testament textual tradition

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.730
is that scribes intentionally modified the
text for theological reasons. He suggests

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.140
that it is not just that you have accidental
changes in the New Testament tradition, you

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.260
also have intentional ones. His claim suggests
that these intentional ones are motivated

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.150
by a sort of theological agenda, or axe to
grind, or doctrinal bias. The scribes are

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.710
supposedly not satisfied with the way the
text looks; so they want to change the text,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.420
and therefore change the doctrine. Dr. Ehrman
has made that claim at numerous points. The

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.920
quick answer to the question, “Did scribes
ever change the text for doctrinal reasons”,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.370
is yes. They did. No doubt, Dr. Ehrman is
correct that there are certain instances in

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.909
the New Testament scribal tradition that we
can see a scribe change the text, probably

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.409
for a theological purpose. That is not what
is in dispute though. What is in dispute is

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.600
what those instances do to the overall integrity
of the textual tradition. Does it impugn our

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.091
ability to know what the original writer actually
said? The trick behind Dr. Ehrman’s claim

00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:14.280
is that he makes a lot of ‘hay’ out of
these theological changes, but in order to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.440
know they are theological changes requires
him to know that they were not originally

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.950
in the text in the first place. Once he says
that they were not originally in the text,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.500
then their relevance for reestablishing what
the original text must have been goes away.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.869
They do not have much effect at the end of
the day. Whether a text was changed for wanting

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.810
to preserve a clear picture of the virgin
birth or to protect the deity of Christ, if

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.450
we know those are scribal additions, then
we can work our way back to the original text

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.910
and what it actually said. Intentional theological
changes, at the end of the day, do not affect

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.860
the integrity of the New Testament.
