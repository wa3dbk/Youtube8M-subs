00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.300
Choosing a theme or concept.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.400
Place to start is with your own passion.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.070
What are you excited about?

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.240
What fires you up?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.730
What are you thinking about?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.770
What is this idea that you have for a restaurant?

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.180
Can you articulate it?

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.270
Can you be specific about it?

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.540
Is this going to be a theme or concept that's
a showcase for your extraordinary culinary

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.540
talent?

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.340
Is it going to be a showcase for your design?

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.230
Is it going to be a showcase for your joir
de vivre, and your spirit, and your excitement

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.510
about the restaurant business?

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.610
What do you want to create?

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.740
What do you want to spend your time, your
money, and your effort on creating every day

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.860
for people who come to your restaurant?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.900
Now, once you start with your passion, the
good news is then you're going to have a lot

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.240
more fun.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.390
You're going to be the person with the enthusiasm
to get through the tough times.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.860
You're going to have an exciting idea that
you want to put out there for the world to

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.500
enjoy and hopefully that you can reap the
rewards of as you run a great restaurant.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.050
Before you do that, however, it's a very good
idea to test your idea, test your passion

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.650
in a way.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.970
Is it something that people will be interested
in?

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.280
Not everybody likes the same things you do.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.520
Not everybody's excited about the same things
you are.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.300
You might want to spend some time in the area,
or region, or neighborhood that you're thinking

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.130
of putting your restaurant, and see who the
people are.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.350
How do they live?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.540
How do they spend their time?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.200
Are they likely to be the kind of folks who
will enjoy the restaurant you want to put

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.750
in their community?

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.830
It's probably not a good idea to put a very
expensive restaurant in a college town.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.780
You might want to think about the schools
that are nearby, the businesses that are nearby,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.740
the traffic.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.270
What kind of concept would work in that particular
location?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.670
Once you've identified your passion and how
that will connect to your concept then it's

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.190
a good idea to test what you're thinking.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.800
How will the market respond to your idea or
your concept?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.450
Is it something that will be embraced by the
area you're thinking of putting your restaurant?

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.069
Is it something that is an idea that needs
the advice of other people and the input of

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.040
other people to be developed more fully?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.020
Is it an idea or a concept that's not been
tried before?

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.520
You can start something new.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.050
You can also take something that's been done
and express it in a new way.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.430
It's important that you gather experiences
of restaurants and you find a way to take

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.580
all of those experiences into your own plan
and your own idea and make them yours.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.940
Yes, there may not be anything new under the
sun, but you can always do something in a

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.050
new way.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.959
You can add a new value.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.430
You can add a new element to your idea or
concept that will make it stand out in people's

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.829
minds.
