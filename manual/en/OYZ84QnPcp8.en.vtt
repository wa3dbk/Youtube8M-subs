Our ancestors established our culture

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.860
Sadly we don't use some of it nowadays.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.560
(*snoring)

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.360
HEY JUAN, wake up! Why are you sleeping at my class?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.300
I've been explaining for hours &amp; you just sleep?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.880
ah sir, did anyone ever mentioned to you

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.580
that you have a VERY lovely voice!

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.980
Lovely voice huh? Are you kidding or fooling me?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.140
Sir,  I've been listening to you all along

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.240
and because of your golden voice, it feels like I'm in heaven

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.840
and I can't resist but fall asleep.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.940
HEY Juan, don't try to fool me!

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.060
that's a bad excuse!

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.900
If my voice is that good, why didn't your classmates fell asleep?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.440
let's see what dumb excuse you have

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.920
sir, it's simple...

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.040
the reason they didn't fall asleep

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.980
is because

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.860
they are not listening

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.160
nyek!
