00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.580
I think barefoot running
is so intriguing.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.730
There's just not much
information out there about

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.990
barefoot running and how it
might impact performance.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.180
There's thoughts, but there's
really no concrete data.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.110
Our study is really focusing
on running economy between

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.160
barefoot runners and runners
who run in shoes.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.030
And you can hop on whenever
you're ready.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.630
We're matching a barefoot runner
to a shod runner and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.040
seeing if there are any
differences between the two.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.730
The other really kind of unique
thing is that we're

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.465
looking at performance.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:49.270
Good job, Caitlin.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.600
And so we're going out and
having the runners run a 5K

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.670
race on a track.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.640
Great job, 7:38, 39.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.580
And we're collecting data while
they run that race.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.160
We're recruiting subjects all
over the state and into

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.220
Massachusetts and even Maine.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.160
They have to be competitive
runners.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.540
They can be either barefoot
runners or shoe runners.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.450
What they'll do is they'll come
into the lab two times.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.240
So this is your speed.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.800
Still feel good?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.070
They'll get their VO2 max test,
where we find out their

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.440
maximal oxygen consumption.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.040
The test starts at
an even grade.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.100
They stay at the same speed
the whole time, and every

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.220
minute we go up 2% grade.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.120
So they keep ramping it
up, ramping it up--

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.470
Push, push, push, push.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.070
--until the subject cannot
run any longer.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.190
OK.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.070
Nice job.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.840
And then they'll come back four
to seven days later and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.970
do their running economy.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.210
You comfortable?

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.110
OK.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.950
And we get them right
on the treadmill.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.960
And what we're doing is having
them run at three different

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.710
speeds, on flat, decline,
and on an incline.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.220
OK.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.220
You can hop off.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.440
Hands on the hand rail.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.520
Just jump to the side.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.430
After that is all
said and done--

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.720
Great job.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.950
--we walk over to the indoor
track and have

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.870
them run their 5K.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.860
We try to cheer them on the best
that we can because it's

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.270
like running a race alone.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.050
One mile left.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.790
You have it.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.080
Come on, push it through,
push it through.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.470
They've really come a long way
in the engineering department,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.140
I'd say, as far as the masks
that the subjects get to wear.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.530
A lot of people are really
wary about it.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.690
They go, what the heck is
this thing on my face?

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.050
But you know what, once they
start running, that's the last

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.950
thing on their mind.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.610
And it's actually not
that uncomfortable.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.410
It's called the COSMED.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.830
It's analyzing and recording the
data that is coming from

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.350
your mouth.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.110
So your oxygen and CO2 breaths
per minute, that all goes into

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.080
the computer and is analyzed
and used for our data.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.100
Our two main hypotheses would
be that the barefoot runners

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.550
are more economical than their
matched shoe runners and that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.610
the barefoot runners will
run a faster 5K race

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.970
than the shoe runners.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.640
I run in shoes.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.060
So until I finish my research or
am convinced that barefoot

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.000
running is actually more
economical, I will stay with

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.100
my running sneakers.
