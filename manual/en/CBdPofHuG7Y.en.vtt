00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.410
HOST: Each year the Department of Veterans
Affairs recognizes some of its finest nurses.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.170
It's an important honor that's given in the
form of the Secretary's Award for Excellence.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.160
VA Secretary Eric Shinseki says these are
exceptional individuals--VA's best who serve

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.090
our nation's Veterans with quality, compassion,
and care. In this edition of The American

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.640
Veteran, we'd like to introduce you to one
of these very dedicated people. A nurse who's

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.790
representative of the many health care professionals
at VA that go above and beyond 24/7.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.770
NARRATOR: Aneita Morgan knew she wanted to
become a nurse ever since she was a little

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.440
girl growing up in Jamaica. Today she's realizing
her goal by caring for patients at the James

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.780
J. Peters VA Medical Center in the Bronx.
ANEITA MORGAN: "I came here as a nursing student

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.780
on the surgical telemetry unit and I fell
in love with the place. I love being a nurse.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.120
It comes naturally to me."
MORGAN (speaking to patient): "Remember the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.120
red one is to call the nurse and this one
watches your television, right?"

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.330
NARRATOR: Aneita is assigned to the intensive
care unit as charge nurse. There, she's responsible

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.260
for overseeing administrative, logistical,
and personnel management issues for this crucial

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.171
20-bed unit.
MORGAN: "Then I usually make rounds to all

00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:30.200
the patients and I introduce myself to them
and, you know, ask them if there's anything

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.560
I can do--let them know I'm available to them
and their family. And then the day goes from

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.140
there. Whatever happens, I handle.
NARRATOR: Sylvia Barchue, patient care director,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.100
hired Aneita and has watched her hone her
skills as a nurse.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.689
SYLVIA BARCHUE: "Aneita portrays a lot of
what I feel that nursing is about. Not only

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.470
that she's dedicated and caring for the Veterans,
but her professionalism which is so unique

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.759
to be seen in such a young nurse. She is also
a role model for a lot of the staff in this

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.940
facility."
NARRATOR: In fulfilling her duties as a nurse,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.080
Aneita takes an active interest in every aspect
of the medical center's operations--even serving

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.909
on a number of performance improvement committees.
BARCHUE: "She takes her work seriously. She's

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.629
very committed. She's on a lot of different
committees and she would come into work on

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.099
her day off just to attend these meetings
to go to the medical center, walk through

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.950
the other areas, and basically just be genuinely
there for anyone who needs her at any particular

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.169
time."
NARRATOR: Aneita, like many on the staff here,

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:42.109
feels that her own commitment is fueled in
part by the commitment to health care excellence

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.249
at the Bronx VA.
MORGAN: "We're very high-tech here. We have

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:52.559
all the newest, you know, equipment that comes
out. So we always try to keep up to date with

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.909
the newest technologies."
NARRATOR: According to Aneita, there's another

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.430
important incentive that contributes to her
commitment to provide Veterans with the best

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.680
care possible.
MORGAN: "I think in my own way I feel as if

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.059
I'm serving my country--my adopted country,
of course."

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:14.489
HOST: The American Veteran congratulates Aneita
on her special achievement. To give you an

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.180
idea of how impressive this accomplishment
is, consider that VA has one of the largest

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.840
