00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.379
Now, we will fold the final section for our
Spinning Top. Starting with a blitz base,

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.430
we are going to fold three blitzes all on
the same side. So, points to the center. Already,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:24.090
we have one blitz. This is our second blitz,
points to the center.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:35.609
And, our final blitz our third blitz again
points to the center.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:46.969
Points to the center. And, then folding the
unit in half on the diagonal we get our guiding

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:56.949
creases. And, also fold it horizontally. Valley
fold horizontally, so that you get a nice

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:08.600
rectangle. Open it up, do a perpendicular
horizontal fold dividing the thing in half

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:19.439
and opening it so that all the blitzes are
on the bottom. We are going to do a fold for

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:31.549
a water bomb base with this blitz that we
just did. Fold the creases in like this, we

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:41.810
have a water bomb base. Open it, so that it
looks like a nice X. Now, putting the entire

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.600
thing together. We have our first base. We
are going to take our second base and taking

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.609
this corner insert it into this pocket between
these two points. And, do that for all four

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:13.650
sides. Insert it into that little pocket and
it stays in place. Taking this top base, we

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.500
are just going to insert it into these little
pockets. Put the little points into those

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:29.250
little pockets and it stays in place. And
now, we have our Spinning Top.
