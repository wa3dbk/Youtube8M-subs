00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.780
Hi I'm Michael from Ivanhoe Cycles. I'm going
to go through the basics of removing a road

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.529
bike front wheel, taking it out, putting it
back in, re-adjusting the brakes and making

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.550
sure they're centralized.
The first thing you need to know is most brakes

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.259
have a lever that releases the brakes apart
a little bit. This allows the tyre to fit

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.160
through the brake pads.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.940
We're going to release the quick release skewer.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.320
Unwind the left-hand side

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.060
and drop the wheel
out. Now, something that can often happen

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.730
is the brake gets bumped and moves across
on an angle. So then when you put your front

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:54.060
wheel back in, you wonder why the brakes are
touching one side. You can quite easily push

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:03.050
that across gently, put the front wheel back
in, do the skewer back up, making sure that

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.530
the wheel's seated fully up in the bottom
of the forks. And it's in the centre.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.740
I'm just going to close the brakes up again.
Now, if I look at them, one side's got a gap

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.069
and the other side hasn't. There's two ways
to handle this. One, you can just grab your

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.670
brakes and gently maneuver them of shift them
across. The other way to do it - most brakes

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.590
either have a three or a two mill allen key,
or possibly a a phillips head on one side.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.340
By adjusting that, it'll actually move your
brakes back into the centre.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.499
Now we've got clearance on both sides.
Always, when you've removed and replaced your

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:53.450
front wheel, put your brakes back on etc.,
grab a handleful of lever - see if they actually

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.649
work before you ride.
That's the basics of taking a front wheel

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.369
out and putting it back in.
Thanks for watching.
