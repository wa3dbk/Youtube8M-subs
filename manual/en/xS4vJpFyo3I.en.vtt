Okay, are you keeping your score card? We've
had nine outfits, now we have nine more to

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.389
do. So, we've got this wonderful black blazer.
It's going to take you right into the work

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:20.760
meeting, could take you to a dinner. So here
we go with the black pants and the black turtleneck

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.820
with the black jacket. That would work together.
The black pants again with the red T-shirt.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.200
Black pants would work together. With the
ivory underneath and the black pants would

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.809
work together as yet another outfit. So we're
going to put down the black pants and we're

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.799
going to pick up the skirt again. The skirt
works terrific with the black jacket for an

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:58.869
entirely different look. So we're going to
put that now again with the ivory. So that

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:06.780
will work. It works back again with T-shirt
underneath. Gives it a little, the T-shirt

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.200
a little bit of a dressier look under there.
For a great work look. And the black mock

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.500
turtleneck would work under there with the
black skirt. See how that works? It makes

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:28.219
great sense to do this. Now pretty much as
we go forward here it's the same thing with

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:35.100
the ivory pant. Works with the black jacket.
And again we're going to grab our old friend

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.109
the red and put that under there. For another
outfit. And we're going to just repeat this

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:51.909
again with the T-shirt - with the sweater
under there. And last but not least, our black

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.679
mock neck turtleneck with the ivory pant.
Okay? So that's very basic what we're doing

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.749
with getting all eighteen outfits. Now you
can see, can you see in your mind how that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:11.970
would be a wonderful way to travel? Now I'm
going to show you next how to add in the accessories.
