Hey YouTube, in this video I'm ganna show you how I cut my hair

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.120
I've been styling my own hair and wigs for the past five or six years

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.130
so I have a little bit of practice but, I'm
in no way a professional nor have I had

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.400
any training this is just what I personally do.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.289
The style I'm going for is an asymmetrical pixie cut
Although I'm not sure what the end

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.150
result will be

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.220
so, I'm just gonna cut until I'm satisfied. I want
to explain a couple techniques that I

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.199
use and,  again, this is just how I personally approached hair trimming.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.609
The first one is I'll take a small
strand of hair and I'll make small snips

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:28.890
with the scissors pointing downwards

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.230
and, I think this helps with layering

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.700
The next is, if I feel that a strand of hair is too thick or has been cut too bluntly across

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.210
or looks choppy

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.920
I'll take the scissors facing towards
the end

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.920
of the hair, vertically, and I'll cut out small sections

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.520
and, this just kind of thins it out.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.860
My last bit of advice is to work in small sections and, to work really slowly

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.059
and that'll help prevent you from cutting off too much hair.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.500
Okay so, what I've done now is I've dampened my hair and, I've sectioned it off and I'm ganna start

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.649
on this section here in

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.210
front of my ear.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.140
Okay, this is what I have so far and, now I'm just going to continue cutting along

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.380
this back section here.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.020
This is what I have so far.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.960
Now I'm ganna continue cutting the top portion here.As you can see the top is all

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.590
pretty much one length straight across and, I'm ganna make it so it's shorter on this side

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.830
and then it'll gradually get longer on
this side.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.880
As I get around to cutting this side of my hair

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.820
I will be cutting it but,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.520
just a tiny bit I don't want it as short as this side.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.840
This is what my completed haircut looks like. I hope you
enjoy the video. Thank you for watching! Bye!
