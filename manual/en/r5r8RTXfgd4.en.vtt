00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.670
The round turn and two half hitches is a knot
that is used to tie a single piece of rope

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.440
to a fixed object.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.300
This is particularly useful when tying a boat
to a cleat on a pontoon or its trolley.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.359
Loop the tail of the rope underneath the fixed
object and wrap it completely around one complete

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.789
turn.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.960
Continue passing the tail back around until
it points back towards you.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.320
Next take the tail and pass it underneath
the main part of the rope and loop it back

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:52.330
around, poking it through the loop that has
just been created.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.370
And pull tight.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.680
Repeat this a second time, taking the tail
back underneath the main part of the rope

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.370
and poke it back through the loop you have
created, and pull tight.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.980
Letâ€™s have another look.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.330
Pass the tail under the fixed object and loop
it completely around.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:22.540
Continue looping until it points back towards
you.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.500
Pass the tail underneath the main body of
the rope, and poke the tail back through the

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.900
loop that you have created.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.560
Pull tight.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.670
Repeat it once more, tail behind the main
rope.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.460
Bend it back around and poke the tail through
the loop and pull tight.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.390
An alternative when using a cleat on a pontoon,
is to make a series of loops in a figure of

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.590
eight like this.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:24.720
Do this several times finishing off with a
full turn.
