BROMINATING TABLETS ALONG WITH
THE FLOATER.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.849
AND THE THIRD STEP IS TO SHOCK

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.980

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.319

LET'S GO!

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.579

THE HTH THREE STEP SPA CARE
SYSTEM.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.079
ARE YOU READY?

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.079
YES!

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.079
I'M READY.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.540
THE FIRST STEP IS TO TEST THE
WATER AND BALANCE IT WITH THE

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.739
HTH 6 WAY TEST STRIPS.

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.939
YOU
SIMPLY GRAB A TEST STRIP.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.219
SIMPLY DIP IT IN, PULL IT OUT,
AND WE COMPARE WHAT'S ON THE

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.549
STRIP WITH WHAT'S ON THE VILE.

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.950
AND IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING IS
IN REALLY GOOD BALANCE EXCEPT

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.541
YOUR SANITIZER IS A LITTLE BIT
LOW WHICH WE CAN TAKE CARE OF IN

00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:54.541
THE NEXT STEP.

00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:57.040
SO, IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO TEST
THE WATER AND THE SPA BEFORE

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.299
EVERY TIME WE USE IT?

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.499
YES, IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA TO
TEST THE WATER EVERY TIME YOU

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.709
USE THE SPA TO MAKE SURE IT'S
READY TO BE USED.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.709
OK.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.920
WE'VE ALSO MADE IT EASIER FOR
YOUR TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SPA BY

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.680
GOING TO HTHPOOLS.COM
UNDER SPA CARE AND WE ALSO HAVE

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.560
A
SMART PHONE APP HTH TEST TO

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.560
SWIM.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560
WOW!

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.560
THAT SOUNDS GREAT!

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.560
SO, WHAT'S STEP TWO?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.160
STEP TWO IS TO SANITIZE THE
WATER TO KILL THE BACTERIA AND

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.850
THE ALGAE AND ALSO TO KEEP THE
WATER CLEAR AND CLEAN.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.259
TO DO SO, WE CAN USE OUR EITHER
HTH BROMINATING TABLETS, OUR HTH

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:23.900
SANITIZING GRANULATED PRODUCT.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.080
BOTH ARE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AT
SANITIZING THE WATER.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.160
IT'S JUST
PERSONAL CHOICE.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160
OK.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.180
FOR YOUR PARTICULAR SPA WE ARE
GOING TO GO AHEAD AND USE THE

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.569
HTH BROMINATING TABLETS.

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.599
WHICH SIMPLY ARE ADDED TO THIS
FLOATER, WE ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.250
BROMINE GOING TO THE TOP BY
SPINNING THE TOP AND WE SIMPLY

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.250
THROW IT INTO THE SPA.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.480
WELL, SO FAR SO GOOD.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.830
THAT WAS EASIER THAN I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.830
WHAT IS STEP THREE?

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.160
STEP THREE IS TO SHOCK THE SPA
WATER.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.560
WE WANT TO DO THAT EVERY WEEK TO
CLEAR THE WATER OF CONTAMINANTS

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.250
AND OILS THAT BUILD UP.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.770
SPAS ARE REALLY WARM WATER THAT
CAN BUILD UP WITH OILS AND

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.280
LOTIONS AND BY SHOCKING THE
WATER EVERY WEEK WE CLEAR THE

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.840
WATER OUT OF ALL THOSE
CONTAMINANTS.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.980
TO DO SO, WE USE OUR HTH NON
CHLORINE OXIDIZING TABLETS.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.150
WE ADD THESE ONCE A WEEK TO THE
SPA.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.030
FOR YOUR PARTICULAR SIZE OF SPA
IT ONLY TAKE THREE TABLETS, ONCE

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.030
A WEEK.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.860
OK, SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I
NEED TO KNOW?

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.340
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, WE NORMALLY
SUGGEST TO DRAIN A SPA EVERY 3O

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.169
- 90 DAYS DEPENDING ON USAGE.

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.450
WE ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMEND
CLEANING THE FILTER EVERY 30

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.450
DAYS.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.800
AND FINALLY, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO CONSTANTLY TEST THE WATER TO

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.600
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SAFE TO BE
IN AND COMFORTABLE AS WELL.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.050
OK, WELL, THIS SOUNDS EASY AND
FUN AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.050
