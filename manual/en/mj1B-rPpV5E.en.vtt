Hey Everyone, this is Sarah with SewingPartsOnline.com
and today we're going to talk about snap on

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.440
presser feet.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.980
If you're wondering,Hey Everyone, this is
Sarah with SewingPartsOnline.com and today

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.370
we're going to talk about snap on presser
feet.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.610
If you're wondering, why would you want a
snap on presser foot, mostly because it's

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.610
easier and cheaper.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.230
So, it's easy to install, it's easy to remove,
and it's cheaper because all of these are

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.230
in generic form.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.640
And if you're a brand person, just know that
generics are just as good as the brand.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.070
So, I'm just go into each one that it has.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.870
So, it's a nine piece set.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.480
It also includes a quilting bar, this is great
for making all those parallel lines.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.110
It's a great guide, pretty much.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.920
A seam ripper, because, ya know, most run
away.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.220
So, always good to have another one along.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.920
So, basically we have the nine, and we have
a snap on adapter.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.890
This is low shank snap on adapter.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.080
If you don't have a low shank machine, don't
freak out, we have snap on adapters for slank

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.850
shank, high shank, so just give us a call
and we'll find the right one for you.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.610
So, going in to the feet.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.280
This is a blind hem foot, it's an adjustable
one.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.240
It's great, a lot of people, when you hem
clothing you definitely want this.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.680
It's basically an invisible stitch.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.500
And we have video on all of these so if you're
like "I'm overwhelmed, I don't know what these

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.750
do", don't worry, they're super easy.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.880
They're really great feet to have.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.090
This is a cording foot, it's mostly for decoration.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.890
For adding cording, like metallic cords or
yarn.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.330
It's a lot of fun.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.280
This is a hemmer foot, right here, it's a,
the end hem in 1/8th of an inch.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.920
It's great for hemming fine fabrics, like
chiffon.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.740
A must have.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.229
The other one is a zig zag stitch foot.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.080
Everyone needs a zig zag stitch foot.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.770
This is a zipper foot.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.330
It's not a invisible zipper foot, don't get
those confused.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.990
It's a zipper foot, but these zipper feet
are also really great for making cording and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.140
sewing on cording.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.150
And we have that in the video as well.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.869
And we'll leave a link down for all of these,
in case you're interested.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.890
Make sure you want to use these feet before
you buy.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.509
This is a sew on button foot.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.109
So much easier than hand sewing.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.760
This is a straight stitch foot.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.060
It also has three little millimeter lines
there for really good accuracy.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:28.390
This is really great for light fabrics, for
sewing fleece, and also for sewing jersey.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.969
Great foot to have.

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.309
Love that foot.

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:32.980
And this is an overcast foot.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:41.080
So the overcast is kind of your mock serger,
it finishes your edges really well like a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.689
serger does, but without buying a serger.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:44.689
So this is a lot of fun.

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.790
You can also do some decorative stuff with
this little foot.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.120
And like I said, it's all in the video and
we'll leave links and little buttons you can

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120
press.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.200
This is the 4 step buttonhole foot.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.010
We'll also have a video on how to use this
one.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.010
It's super easy.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.489
It's a great beginner set to have.

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.150
I mean, I've used every single one of these
feet and I use them all the time.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.219
They're such a big help.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.939
Having the right foot really makes a difference.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.239
