00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:07.209
There is, let's say, a little mystery in this
concept about collection, also sometimes referred

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:13.290
to as submission. We're going to try to simplify
it and make it available to even a most novice

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.311
rider. It is the piece that often brings your
horse to a much better performance, and I

00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:23.481
don't mind at all, and I try to get my novice
riders to start putting a little bit of collection

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:28.070
in to their ride fairly early on. As soon
as their hands can remain quiet in front of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.860
the saddle, and it seems as though they can
not interfere with the horse, but rather compliment

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.310
the horse, we begin to teach that idea of
collection. Collection is just part of a horse's

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.120
ability to what we call move forward off of
those strong haunches, the hind quarter, in

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.400
a round fashion, and submit to the pressure
of the bit. We don't want to think of it as

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.470
we're trying to bring that horse back in to
collection and jam them in to it. We want

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.230
to think of it as they move forward in to
the bridle. Even as we stand here, we can

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.750
learn a lot about this process of collection.
Then we can take it to the moving forward

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.470
piece, which is the very important part about
they move forward in to the bridle. In order

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.690
to collect a horse, the rider wants to remember
their very basic elbow to the horses mouth,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.640
straight line position. Depending on your
discipline, that may require that you're hand

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.409
be a little bit lower, maybe a little bit
higher, or even higher yet for some of our

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.920
saddle seat kind of horses. For our Western
horse here, we're going to be right here,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.820
positioned in front of the pommel. We're going
to create what we call an elastic rein length.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.220
My rider's going to hold her rein securely
with her fingers closed, so that she can create

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.150
the feeling that there's elastic here in the
rein. And just by drawing her fingers back,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.280
as though she were what we call, "half haulting",
that drawing back of our fingers with out

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.560
moving our hands, she's going to ask this
horse to begin submitting. Inside the horses

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.250
mouth, the mechanism of the bit creates a
pressure against the roof of his mouth that

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.850
he should want to move away from that pressure.
As a horse submits, we begin to see him what

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.050
we call, "chew softly". That's a sign of a
horse's recognition that he needs to be compliant

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.030
and submit to the bridle. We see him begin,
he's right on target, and now after he's done

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.160
this "chewing softly", we should feel him
backing away and want to experiment with how

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.630
to make this bit feel the best in his mouth.
Certainly, the piece of the horse moving forward

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.630
in to bridle is going to be very important
as we move to the next frame, but knowing

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.000
and understanding how your basic mechanics
in the way of holding the pressure, not pulling,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.750
but rather holding the pressure, will begin
to bring this horse in to an easy and basic

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.310
collected frame.
