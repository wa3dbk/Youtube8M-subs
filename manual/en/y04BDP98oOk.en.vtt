hi again and welcome to my kitchen is this is whatocook

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.380
we are going to do coconut dumplings now

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.260
like I said in my other video that I
have a whole bunch of coconuts

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.000
my husband got for me check them out in the background there I have a whole bunch still remain

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.400
and for this next video now I am doing every thing one time coconut oil, coconut dumplings at the same time

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.950
when I was done those videos I was exhausted. So the other video today

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.930
its coconut dumplings

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.200
with fresh coconut - grated coconut and fresh coconut milk

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.200
So let's get to it!

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.700
I have a cup and a half or probably a cup and almost 3/4 of coconut milk

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.050
and the grated coconut itself

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.590
I am going use this to make the coconut dumplings.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.200
I might not use all but I will try because I want the coconut dumpling to really have that flavor

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.200
of the coconut itself. So most likely  I will use all to blend the dough together.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.570
Okay I am going to start my recipe - Coconut Dumplings with a cup and half of flour

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.390
I'm not making much

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.510
a pinch of salt and

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:26.700
and I  am going to add the ..... fresh coconut milk with the grated coconut inside of here I will add it gradually

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.400
Actually what I am going to do I am going to take out the husk

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.320
grated coconut part of it

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.500
and then add the liquid because I want to get all the grated coconut inside of here

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.850
settle down to the bottom

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.400
I did this recipe I did this today because I wanted to do another recipe about making coconut oil

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.200
so I said while I said while I am in this process I can make coconut dumplings the same time.  Why not?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.900
So I am going to knead this in.  Make a dough.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:11.000
So we using basically coconut milk to form our dumplings.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.200
I like coconut dumplings.  I like to taste ...  I like coconut on the whole

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.580
I like to taste the crunchiness of the grated coconut

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.340
in my dumplings I just love that.  I don't do this often

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.250
because you know the amount of calories that we will get with a dish like this

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.000
I need to add a little more flour because it is a little too sticky

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.470
Okay my dough is basically ready what I will do now put a pot of water on the fire, let that boil, come to a boil

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.680
and then I will make my dumplings and put them in the boiling water

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.280
before go further I'm doing this recipe

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.820
because I was making some coconut oil

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.620
basically doing everything from scratch. Now if you don't have the fresh coconut

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.900
that takes time so the easy way is you can buy some coconut husk

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.600
already pre packed in the store buy a tin of coconut milk and you could make this coconut dumpling

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.100
within minutes you're done it's much
easier.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.500
I just did the long way because like I said I was doing the coconut oil.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.959
I know there was something I forgot to mention

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.600
the amount of grated coconut that I had in the cup here is basically

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.700
a cup of it of the coconut milk and the grated coconut and as you see I did not use all of it

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.200
because of the amount of flour that I had to use.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.900
Okay I am back.  The water is on the fire right now boiling .. getting ready to boil

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.100
So I am going to make my dumplings

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.280
into like little balls and then ....  excuse my hands

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.709
from the in front of the camera

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:52.709
I think I need to knead a little more flour into this

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.950
So basically what I do first I make them into little balls

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.950
it still a little sticky I will add extra flour

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.120
put the piece of dough in the palm of my hand and kind of like make them in to round balls like that

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.800
make it easier

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.900
and kinda like make then into a ball I use my finger tips to kinda knead them into a ball

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.000
and then for the final thing just roll the dough in my hand. It does not have to be perfect.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.900
I will just keep on doing this with the rest of the dough

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:56.490
Okay so when I am done making the balls

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.490
I will take each ball

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.449
and then I will then put the ball in the palm of my hand

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:15.000
and just kind of flatten it out like  .....  again it does not have to be perfect

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.600
You should get something like that

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.800
And when the water comes to a boil, I am going to put in in the boiling water

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:24.889
I don't really put them in the water before the water comes to a boil

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.800
because what happens is they basically drop to the bottom of the pot

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.430
and they will all stick together.  My aunt taught me that told me that years ago

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.879
Auntie Winnie, she use to live Morvant, she is not deceased

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:45.449
I have never forgotten that tip.  So let me finish up these

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.919
put them in the pot then you will see how it looks

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.890
coconut dumplings boiling!!!

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.410
coconut dumplings served with some saltfish

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.330
Oh gosh all ya this will taste soo good!!!  I am going and have lunch now

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.510
its now 3.35pm
