*Red Vs. Blue Guitar Intro*

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.880
Simmons: "What do you mean "leaving?" Where are we going?"

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.260
Caboose: "AH! IS IT TO THE PARK? OOH, I KNOW! IT'S THE BEACH- Wait a minute, you're not taking me to the vet are you?"

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.340
Tucker: "No, we're going to break into that compound and bust out our friends."

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.420
Simmons: "But, we still have some time left to train the squad. Why would we leave now?"

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.040
Tucker: "Because the squad's not coming with us."

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.420
Caboose: "Are they going in a separate car?"

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.920
Tucker: "No."

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.660
Caboose: "Ah, so they're flying."

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.800
Caboose: "Y'know I have an extra bag to check is that going to be a problem 'cause-"

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.560
Tucker: "No, Caboose we're going on this mission alone."

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.760
Caboose: "Alone with the squad. Got it."

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.800
Grif: "Why would we do that?"

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.100
Tucker: "I don't know if you guys have noticed, but our super-elite team sucks. There's no way they'll be able to pull off a rescue mission."

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.300
Simmons: "We don't know that. Kimball could still pass us."

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.500
Tucker: "I'm not talking about passing. I'm talking about our trainees blowing up, or getting shot, or disintegrated or something."

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.860
Simmons: "Oh. Yeah, that's a problem."

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.240
Tucker: "Look, Felix was right. We're just going to end up getting more people killed."

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.720
Grif: "So you're saying we should just get ourselves killed instead."

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.700
Tucker: "Hey, we've done crazier things than this."

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.420
"Remember that time we fought, like, a bajillion-hundred robots? We didn't fuck that up!"

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.200
Simmons: "We had Church."

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.220
Tucker: "Ok, well what about C.T? Or the Meta?"

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.900
Simmons: "We got lucky!"

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.800
Tucker: "Bullshit."

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.100
Tucker: "Now maybe we can't teach a bunch of people how to fight, but the four of us can totally pull this off!"

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.800
"We're not going to get another chance like this. We just gotta go in, and get our guys back."

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.320
"After that, Wash will know what to do."

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.500
Simmons: "But even Felix couldn't break into this place."

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.800
Tucker: "We're not Felix."

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.900
"Felix is smart. The Feds won't be expecting dumb."

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.780
Caboose: "Hey! Who are you calling dumb?!"

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.480
Simmons: "Shut up."

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.920
Caboose: "No Simmons, I was just asking for some clarification. I'm a little lost..."

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.020
Tucker: "Look, we keep trying to strategize, and use codenames, and act like we're real soldiers. But we're not!"

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.640
"We haven't been from the beginning. So why are we trying now?"

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.000
"I say we get in there, and do what we do best."

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660
Grif: "Uhh, which is?"

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.320
Tucker: "I have no idea! But, whatever it is, it's worked for us before."

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.680
Simmons: "That's your plan?! We just show up and wing it?!"

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.100
"That's the worst plan I've ever-"

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.280
Grif: "Alright, let's do it."

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.720
Simmons: "What, Grif?! YOU wanna do this?"

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.880
Grif: "Yeah, so what?"

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.080
Simmons: "So what?! You NEVER wanna do anything! Ever!"

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.860
Grif: "Simmons, I've been following orders I never liked for years."

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.120
Simmons: "No you haven't! You disobey orders all the time!"

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.860
Grif: "Well, I don't wanna be the guy that GIVES shitty orders that nobody wants to follow!"

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.860
"I will not become a Sarge, dammit!"

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.480
"There's no way I'm making a bunch of stupid rebels get shot for something I want!"

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.480
"So yeah, whatever! Let's just do it!"

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.740
Simmons: *sniffs* "That's the most selfless thing you've ever said!"

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.580
Grif: "But I wanna steal more food before we go."

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.060
Simmons: *sniffs* "Okay, that's more like it."

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
Caboose: "Yay, mission!"

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.300
Tucker: "Simmons?"

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.080
Simmons: *sighs* "How are we getting there?"

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.480
Tucker: "Haha, yes! Okay. I snuck into Kimball's office and grabbed all the data I took from the Fed's lab!"

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.800
"We've got a map that'll lead us straight to them! All we need is a ride!"

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.920
Grif: "Vehicle bay's got plenty of Warthogs, I guess."

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.920
Caboose: "And I can drive a tank!"

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.480
Grif, Simmons, Tucker: *In unison* "No."

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.100
Caboose: "Well, you're all just jealous."

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.200
Simmons: "Wait, what about the rebels? I mean, I don't think they'll be happy with us just leaving like this."

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.900
Bitters: "Hey Matthews, have you seen the Reds and Blues around? I can't find 'em."

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.620
Matthews: "No, but that might explain why two of our jeeps are missing."

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.820
Simmons (via recording): "Hello, everyone. If you're listening to this, it means we're already gone.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.660
Tucker (via recording): "Look, it's not you. It's us."

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.540
Caboose (via recording): "Tell them not to leave the lights on!"

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.860
Grif (via recording): "Caboose! Not now!"

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.540
Caboose (via recording): "I miss you already! I promise we'll call!"

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.040
*recording cuts out*

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.320
Kimball: "Damn it Tucker."

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.320
Palomo: "They just...left us?"

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.180
Felix: "Who left us?"

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900
"Oh no."

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.840
Simmons: "Okay, the ability to fly... North."

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.180
Grif: "Ehh, I dunno."

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.600
Simmons: "What do you mean? That's a great terrible superpower!"

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.220
Grif: "Yeah, but you can still fly."

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.220
Simmons: "You can only fly North! It's so inconvenient!"

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.860
"Once you land, you gotta walk wherever you were going!"

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.680
Grif: "Mm, I guess so."

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.480
Simmons: "Okay, what about the ability to teleport...one foot at a time."

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.480
Grif: "Mmm...meh."

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.280
Simmons: "You're "meh". This road trip sucks."

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.620
Tucker: "Hello? Anybody home? We've got some cars that need fuel!"

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.660
Caboose: "Yeah, yes, we would also like to purchase some lottery tickets!"

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.240
"Yeah, I know the odds, but I just-I still think it's just fun."

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.580
Simmons: "This place looks deserted."

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.360
Grif: "Woo-hoo! Let's loot! I've always wanted my own Slurpee machine!"

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.260
Tucker: "Oh, dude, let me know if they've got any magazines."

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.140
Caboose: "Me too! One with pictures!"

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.440
Tucker: "Specifically ones with pictures. You know what I'm sayin'."

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.720
*loud sound*

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.520
Simmons: "What was that?"

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.720
Tucker: "Maybe it's the owners."

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.440
Grif: "Aw, man! Can't we just pretend they're not here and loot anyway?"

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.720
Tucker: "Hey Caboose, go tell them they've got customers. You guys start filling up the cars."

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.720
Grif: "Do it yourself. I'm gonna take a leak."

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.720
Caboose: "Oh, alright, but be sure to get my lottery tickets."

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.400
"My numbers are 5...7..."

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.480
"Now don't forget them."

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.160
Tucker: "I know I said a bunch of inspirational crap back at the base,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.740
but, it's times like these when I really wonder how we haven't been killed yet, y'know?"

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.960
Simmons: "The power to turn into the Hulk, but only when you're asleep."

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.900
Grif: "Hello? Just here to use the bathroom! Also, someone emptied out your Slurpee machine!"

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.900
"Might wanna get that filled!"

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.900
*muffled* "Man, what kinda gas station doesn't have hot dogs?"

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.960
*coughs* "Whoo! Jesus, smells like somebody died in..."

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.920
"...here..."

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.400
Caboose: *humming*

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.720
"Love that song."

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.380
Control: "Do not disappoint me."

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.200
Jackson: "Understood, Control."

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.840
Caboose: "Oh! I think I hear the sound of new friends."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.440
"Hellooo-oh!"

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.780
Caboose: "Tucker! Perfect! You can help me and my friends come up with a secret high-five!

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.800
Soldier 1: "So what's the word?"

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.500
Jackson: "Control says to give it 30 more minutes."

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.660
Soldier 2: "Ugh, this is a waste of time!"

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.620
Soldier 1: "Agreed."

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.660
Grif: "Who are these guys?"

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.740
Tucker: "Well, they're definitely not the gas station attendants."

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.340
Grif: "Wow, Tucker. I can really see why YOU'RE the leader."

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.320
Tucker: "Up yours."

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.320
Simmons: "Quiet! I can't hear what they're saying!"

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.520
Jackson: "You know what they say: Orders are orders."

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.320
Locus (over radio) : "Jackson."

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.420
Jackson: "Yes, Locus?"

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.780
Locus (over radio): "Change of plans. Report back to base immediately."

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.900
"The Reds and Blues will be requiring...an escort."

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.100
Jackson: "Understood."

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.740
"You heard him. Grab the gear and prep for evac."

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.700
Caboose: "Where are they going?"

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.580
Simmons: "Tucker, wait!"

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.580
*loud sound*

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.480
Tucker: "They just...vanished."

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.380
Simmons: "Vanished?"

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.460
Grif: "They said something about "Reds and Blues"."

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.680
Caboose: "Oh my God! I know those colours! They're us!"

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.300
Tucker: "They were Feds. I heard one of them mention Locus."

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.000
Simmons: "Well they didn't look like the typical Stormtrooper guys. You think they were special ops?"

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.060
Tucker: "I think we should get to that base as fast as possible."

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.060
Tucker: "C'mon, let's go."

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.800
Simmons: "Hello everyone. Now that we have our own YouTube channel, I've taken the liberty

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.820
of reoarganising everything for a streamlined viewing experience."

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.820
"Just hit "Subscribe" to put it to use."

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.500
Grif: "You're supposed to CONVINCE them to subscribe! Not put'em to sleep! You loser!"

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.640
Simmons: *sighs* "I hate him so much."

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.700
*metallic whoosh*

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.600
*Rooster Teeth Outro*
