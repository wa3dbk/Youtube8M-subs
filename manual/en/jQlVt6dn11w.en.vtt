The story I am about to tell you today is How marry is chosen by God. A long

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.700
Time ago God sent Gabriel to Nazareth a small town in Galilee there he came

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.000
Before a young woman called Mary. Mary was soon to be the wife of Joseph

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
A carpenter who was related to the family of King David. Gabriel said be Happy Mary

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Because God is with you. You are the most blessed of all women.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Mary was not able to understand the meaning of the strange message. She asked

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
What are you saying and Why have you come to me.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Gabriel said do not be scared Mary, God really loves you you will have son Mary

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And you must call him Jesus. He will be a great soul the Son Of God. So he will rule forever

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Over the people of God.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Mary thought How can this be possible and I am still a young girl

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And not even married. How can I have a child.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The angle said Holy Spirit will come to you and God's power will cover you. The Holy Child will

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Be called The son of God.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Your Aunt Elizabeth will also have a son even she is a little old now

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Anything can happen if you're really believe in God.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Mary God down before the Angels knees and put her head down. She said

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I am God's loyal servant and I will do whatever he asked me to do. When Mary

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
