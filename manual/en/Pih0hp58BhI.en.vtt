Will Connell, Performance Director, British
Equestrian Team: It’s been a fantastic summer

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.089
for the Equestrian teams, and the championship
season’s now over. Great opportunity to

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.599
bring the riders, the athletes and the team
staff to Greenwich and to see it – for most

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.450
of them - for the first time and to really
start to feel where the 2012 venue is going

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.470
to be for Equestrian competitions and of course
part of Modern Pentathlon. So it’s an opportunity

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.440
to really see and understand the venue and
to get it in their minds and see it as a target

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.200
for 2012.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.170
Tim Stockdale, Show Jumper, British Equestrian
Team: This is my first time here and I’ve

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.969
been bowled over by the magnificent park.
Where the situation is with regards to the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.629
heart of the city and the backdrop, it has
blown me away I must say and it’s been a

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.489
great morning to see the plans.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.260
Lucy Wiegersma, Eventer, British Equestrian
Team: Quite honestly, I don’t know why noone’s

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.659
tried to have a cross-country event in the
park before. It really lends itself very well

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:54.499
to it - lots of undulations and natural features
and I think it’ll be a fantastic course.

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.760
Sophie Wells, Para-Equestrian Dressage rider:
It’s a lovely venue and it’s really motivating

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.550
to come here and see where it’s going to
take place and, yeah, it motivates you in

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.300
everyday training – what you’re here to
do.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.190
Simon Laurens, Para-Equestrian Dressage rider:
Well, I think for disability sport bringing

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.610
it to the heart of England – you know, London
is the heart of England – and we really

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.030
need to be close to all the other sports which
is something that’s been missing for a long

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.340
time. I mean, this will hopefully be my second
Games, but certainly the Hong Kong thing 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.420
- although fantastic -it was missing that
element where we didn’t feel actually connected

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.090
to the rest of the sports.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.160
Sophie Christiansen, Para-Equestrian Dressage
rider: It’s amazing, you know, to be in

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:41.160
the centre of London and have an amazing green
space like this is just… it really highlights

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:53.000
that Equestrianism can be in the centre of
a big host city and just the history in the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
place really highlights what Great Britain
has to show.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Nicola Wilson, Eventer, British Equestrian
Team: It’s the most wonderful setting. Having

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.620
not been here before and just heard about
it, it’s lovely to have a walk round the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.319
Park and see where the course could go. And
there really is nowhere else in the world

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.589
where you could get the opportunity to jump
the Meridian Line.
