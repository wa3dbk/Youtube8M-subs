00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:07.286
We are here with NightEnD

00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:10.088
the winner of the PGL finals

00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:13.004
How do you feel after another victory?

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.802
Very relievable. I don't know.

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:19.220
How was the final?

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.405
It was pretty hard. He (DeathAngel) played very good

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:24.504
but he made several small mistakes

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:25.857
and I took advantage of that. That's about it.

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:32.022
I havn't seen all the games but I heard that

00:00:32.022 --> 00:00:34.698
some called you an "all-inner"...

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.402
Well he called for an All-In because in each game

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:40.581
he puts the 3rd expansion much to soon

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:44.424
He has no army, only drones. What should I do?

00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:48.736
If I would have let him to take the 3rd expand

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:52.978
and make a big army of course, he would have had a to big advantage

00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:54.019
it's his mistake

00:00:53.902 --> 00:00:56.563
How is this matchup, PvZ in the present?

00:00:56.563 --> 00:01:00.771
Of course, a lot of people compain that the zerg is weak

00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:02.199
and that the protoss is to good

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.336
but I don't see the things that way

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:08.502
I think that ... and this is my opinion

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:10.457
it's harder to play with the zerg

00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:16.933
You need more macro, map control

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:21.022
and that's about it. If you let the protoss to do whatever he wants

00:01:21.022 --> 00:01:22.401
of course you will lose.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:29.974
What will we see in the future? You qualified yesterday in TLOpen

00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:34.845
after you beated in the final... who? And who else did you played.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:41.964
Well in my opinion the best game was vs. digintas player ... Killer

00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:43.604
I played him in Quarter Finals. I beated him 2-1.

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:48.832
After that Fnatic.TT1 in semi-finals 2-0.

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:53.696
and in the finals ... Morrow 3-2. Him having 2-1 I got back into the game.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:58.819
You had a big victory vs Morrow a lot of players say his on "the wave"

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.213
since in the last month he wins a lot of games

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:02.687
Yes his a very good player.

00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:05.314
How is he better? As Terran or as Zerg?

00:02:05.314 --> 00:02:10.397
I think as Zerg. He plays incredible well.

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:17.828
Where should we see you in the future? Competitions, etc?

00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:23.416
I have no idea. We will see.

00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:25.115
Why did you left mTw?

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:29.824
I had a better offer from praetoriani

00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:32.996
double than what mTw was offering

00:02:33.824 --> 00:02:37.908
mTw offered to rise the contract but with not to much

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:44.325
Plus that in Praetoriani I already played 2-3 years ago

00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:47.744
It was about my 4th clan from Warcraft

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:51.233
And I remained friends with them

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:55.555
Always chatting with the manager and this was like a plus.

00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:59.871
How do you see the future of Starcraft 2 in Romania?

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:05.346
Well if we would have more competitions

00:03:05.346 --> 00:03:07.965
with bigger prizes and better players

00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:10.882
Of course, I will see a great future.

00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:16.460
What's the secret?

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.137
There is no secret. If you play a lot and you wish to win

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:21.320
you will succeed.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.055
How do you train? ..... do you watch replays?

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:29.104
Yes. I watch the replays.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:33.086
Especialy the replays with me when I lose, to see why I lost.

00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:36.806
And when I know I did mistakes even that I won I still watch the replay

00:03:36.806 --> 00:03:37.811
to see what was my mistake exactley.

00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:39.462
Don't you think it's a waste of time?

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:40.044
No. Not at all.

00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:44.074
A lot of times I see a lot of mistakes

00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:49.819
I see that I forghot to make probes a few seconds

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.048
I was supply block

00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:56.507
My opponent had a hidden expansion.

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:58.957
me not knowing about that the whole game

00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:00.529
Yea, yesterday Spook (Terran Player) had one the whole game

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.650
and you didn't saw it

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.730
From Romania, besides you and DeathAngel

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.281
who do you think is an interesting player, or with potential?

00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:16.190
The first one would be noise (terran). I really liked how he played.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.656
With macro and micro. 

00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:30.045
And I also liked fishlips (Zerg), Cyclone (zerg), Pufulete (protoss)

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.349
