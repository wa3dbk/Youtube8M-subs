00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:04.935
This is more than a car, it's genesis for an entire breed.

00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:11.053
Sure, there were luxuruous off-roaders, but the BMW X5 meant a breakthrough for the SUV.

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:19.147
The looks of an off-roader, but the handling of a big 5-series.

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:27.546
Its succes spawned cars like the Porsche Cayenne and Range Rover Sport.

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:38.903
This 3rd generation X5 will therefore have more competitors, and gas prices mean the large SUV is less popular.

00:00:39.464 --> 00:00:41.462
So, how are the new X5's chances?

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.252
Once you're inside, you can quickly see the appeal of this SUV.

00:00:54.586 --> 00:01:02.570
High quality fit and finish and spaciousness mean it's a comfortable place to be.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:11.153
It's also practical: passengers have enough room and there's plenty of space for luggage.

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:17.695
Also, it can be fitted with two extra seats, which are...

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.867
Well, not exactly spacious and they eat up all your luggage space.

00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:39.264
The new X5 is a comfortable cruiser, it rides very well and absorbs bumps with little effort.

00:01:40.247 --> 00:01:47.180
However, the X5 has always been a sporty SUV to drive.

00:01:47.904 --> 00:02:01.503
To ensure driving pleasure the suspension is relatively firm and the steering very direct.

00:02:02.063 --> 00:02:07.058
And for more than 2.000 kg's of car it feels pretty nimble indeed.

00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:13.139
But because the steering is also very light it feels inaccurate

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.734
and bumps midway a corner make it dance around a bit.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.606
This just isn't a car for racing, it's a car for cruising.

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:36.976
Cruising also suits the drivetrain better.

00:02:37.377 --> 00:02:46.458
We drive the 30d, a 3-litre straight six biturbo diesel which produces 258 hp and 560 torques.

00:02:47.157 --> 00:02:54.090
It's mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission which makes it a very fluent car to drive. 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.530
In normal conditions, it never exceeds 2.000 rpm.

00:02:58.742 --> 00:03:10.745
And when you do hit the throttle, it sounds good and feels seriously fast.

00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:17.462
In all, it's a very refined drivetrain which suits the X5 very well.

00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:24.201
It's nearly as refined as a petrol-unit, but it also consumes fuel like a petrol-engine.

00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:37.192
No matter what you do, more than 12 kilometres per litre is impossible.

00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:41.156
So, the X5 is not a car for people on a tight budget.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.009
But then: to buy a BMW X5 you need at least around € 70.000.

00:03:53.602 --> 00:04:01.545
For a price, you can get leather upholstery, electrically operated everything, satnav and much more.

00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:08.041
That means our test-car costs € 112.000.

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:19.881
So why not a 5-series Touring with similar specifications for less money?

00:04:20.352 --> 00:04:25.810
Well, because if people thought like that, the X5 wouldn't have been such a hit up until now.
