00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.040
NGC 602: The Galactic Empire

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.360
Narrator (April Hobart, CXC): Our galaxy,
the Milky Way, is more than just a giant barred

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.880
spiral containing hundreds of billions of
stars.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.689
It's also the centre of a colossal empire
and rules over about 20 smaller galaxies that

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.880
orbit around it, similar to the way our Moon
orbits the Earth.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.340
The shining stars and glowing arcs of gas
in this picture reside in one of these subjects:

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.850
a dwarf galaxy called the Small Magellanic
Cloud.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.440
If you live in the Southern Hemisphere or
near the equator, you may have noticed two

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.510
bright but blurry clouds in the dark night
sky.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.899
The smaller of these clouds is the Small Magellanic
Cloud, one of the Milky Way's so-called 'satellite

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:53.899
galaxies'.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.039
It is a dwarf galaxy, meaning that it contains
far fewer stars than galaxies similar to our

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.550
own.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.260
While the Milky Way is made up of about 300
billion stars, the Small Magellanic Cloud

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.550
has just a couple of billion.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.050
On a cosmic scale, this galaxy is extremely
close by.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.020
Moving at the fastest speed known in the Universe
(the speed of light), it would take less than

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.540
200 thousand years to travel there from Earth.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.920
Being so close to us, the Small Magellanic
Cloud offers astronomers an opportunity to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.230
study phenomena that are difficult to examine
in more distant galaxies.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.090
This picture shows an area of the galaxy called
the 'Wing'.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.190
It contains three star clusters that astronomers
have been studying recently to find out how

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:58.310
young stars are born.
