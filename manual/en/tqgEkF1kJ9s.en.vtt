00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.387
Utopia is on the horizon. I walk two steps,

00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:10.809
it moves two steps away and the horizon

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.605
runs ten steps further. So what is utopia for?

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:17.418
That, to keep walking.

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:21.157
The spirit of La Casa Uruguaya is to move

00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:22.933
towards a more sustainable future,

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.172
knowing that there are many barriers

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:26.949
that we need to raise, never losing sight

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.573
that our project must be thought for people.

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:33.197
We seek throughout this competition to put

00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:36.072
in practice the technological innovations for

00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:39.748
social housing and the devolpment of technology

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:43.072
in order to reach all social classes.

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:45.572
We dream of a utopia that make us walk in order

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:48.700
to reach it, and imagine an austere but technological

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.775
and economic house, which can help generate energy

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:55.197
efficiency habits, with active participation of the

00:00:55.197 --> 00:00:57.307
user interacting with the systems of the house.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.092
Less is more? or, more for less? We strongly

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:02.853
believe that we can make with this project

00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:04.686
more efficient houses with less energy consumption,

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:07.449
more comfortable houses with less resources and reach

00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:10.572
sustainability with less effort.

00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:13.823
With little but smart actions, organized together around

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.093
an integral design, will drive us to a new concept

00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:17.780
that can change the way we make houses.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.980
Achieving integration of the various areas of

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.987
engineering with the architecture of the house

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:24.775
is one of our main challenges. We propose

00:01:24.775 --> 00:01:27.885
to use techonolgy and wit to help residents

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:31.557
use resources more efficiently.

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:34.450
Through architecture we aim to generate a flexible

00:01:34.652 --> 00:01:37.996
house with wide and comfortable spaces, as far as possible.

00:01:37.996 --> 00:01:41.464
Adapting it also to CaliÂ´s orientation

00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:44.306
for maximum use of the incidence of the sun.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:47.199
We intend to build a small house as a prototype

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:49.808
that can be stackable both in Cali and Montevideo,

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:52.979
that has a possibility of expansion and form blocks that can

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.406
help to solve the problem of social housing.

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:57.749
We seek to create furnitures that adapt to the users,

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:00.671
allowing free movement and transformations according

00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:01.948
to the needs of each space.

00:02:01.948 --> 00:02:04.994
Since the conception of the house until its construction,

00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:07.800
passive strategies prevail active ones,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.073
in order to reduce energy consumption to the minimum.

00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:15.622
We will use simple components and low-cost technological systems,

00:02:15.622 --> 00:02:18.260
reinventing the concept of domotics.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.375
The communication of La Casa Uruguaya has two key objectives,

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:24.214
on one hand we aim to educate, sensitize and raise

00:02:24.214 --> 00:02:26.136
the awareness of the importance of

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:28.527
use of renewable energies in social housing.

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:31.338
We want to generate a cultural change on the incorporation

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:33.609
of these tencnolgies to social housing

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.214
and in this way make them more sustainable.

00:02:36.214 --> 00:02:38.791
On the other hand we intend to disseminate the project

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:43.386
through major media and through all media informatics

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:46.978
to report the project to the various audiences of the

00:02:46.978 --> 00:02:49.964
house and position ourselves as diffusers

00:02:49.964 --> 00:02:51.714
in the area of sustainable housing.

00:02:51.714 --> 00:02:53.932
