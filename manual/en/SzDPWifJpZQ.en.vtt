00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.200
Alright check it out. Here is
another FX series laptop from Gateway.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.900
This is the P7808U and 
it's kind of like the one that I use,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.460
I know a lot of you guys out there
have seen that one before, 17 inch,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.060
but this one is even 
probably a little bit better.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.400
It's got a little bit more
hard drive space

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.790
and it's definitely got 
a better processor.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.040
Vista score on this thing
is incredible, it got a 5.6,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.560
the lowest sub-score being
the hard drive,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.700
everything else was a 5.8 and 5.9
which is a maxed out score, very nice.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.680
Now let's talk a little bit
about the specs on this thing.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.840
Now first of all, it's good for gamers,
this is obviously a gaming laptop.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.840
Don't fool yourself, it really is,
it's not meant for anything else.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080
Now some of the other 
FX series 17 inch notebooks

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.710
they have a 1920 by 1200 display.
This one has as 1440 by 900 display

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.890
which means that even though
the resolution is a little bit lower,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.460
it might not be as good
for multitasking,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.450
it's going to be better for gaming
because you're going to be getting

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.960
higher frames per second because
you're running at lower resolution,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.760
the graphics card doesn't have
to work as hard

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.070
and in the end you get 
better performance in your games.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.800
Now this card has
a 9800 GTS Mobile in it,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.420
so a 9800M GTS by NVIDIA
which is a very nice card

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.910
especially for a laptop.
It runs very fast,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.670
it will play pretty much 
any game you want it to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.580
whether it be Crysis, Call of Duty,
you know The Sims 3,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.340
you name it it will play it,
it's not going to be an issue

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.220
on this type of laptop. Now here's what
makes this thing really really special,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.630
I have something to show you. 
Zoom in on this little sticker

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.530
over here in the corner.
Right there.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.560
See that right there?
Centrino 2 Intel VPro, ok?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.730
And this is not just 
your regular Centrino chip,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.700
this is one of the first
Quad Core laptops.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
This is Core 2 Quad Q9000
from the Centrino 2 line,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.300
it's a 1066 megahertz front side bus,
6 megabytes of L2 cache

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.780
and it's clocked in at 2 gigahertz
which is very very impressive.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.910
Now as far as memory goes
you've got 4 gigs of DDR3 on here,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.870
you have a 500 gig 5400 RPM drive
which by the way,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.630
it was really weird to see
a 5400 RPM, 500 gigabyte hard drive

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.730
get that type of Vista score,
5.6 for data transfer.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.940
Incredible! So look at these scores,
5.8 for the processor, 5.9 for memory,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.210
5.9 for graphics,
5.9 for gaming graphics

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.250
and 5.6 for the data,
this data transfer rate.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.350
It's absolutely incredible
and that's not where it stops,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.950
there's still plenty more on 
this laptop so let's keep going.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.420
Now first of all
you look right up here,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.520
obviously we do have a webcam,
1.3 megapixel,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.450
it looks absolutely great,
it's stunning.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.360
If you look, it's got one 
of the bigger webcams,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.490
it actually looks nicer.
It might still be 1.3 megapixel

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.700
but it's got a nicer lens,
it's nice and big

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.730
and it produces some great imagery. Now
also on here you have N-Draft wireless

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.370
so as far as connectivity goes
you have multiple in, multiple out,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.400
300 megabit per second. If you have
an N-Draft wireless network at home

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.460
it's going to be really useful.
You know it's going to be,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.880
give you that advantage 
in speed and in range

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.150
so it's a double sided sword,
it gives you a host of extra benefits.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.260
Let's take a quick tour on here
while we're here.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.550
Starting over on this side 
you're going to notice

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.350
you have there a Kensington lock,
you have 2 USB 2.0 ports right there.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.260
This is your fan louver
for your 9800 Mobile GT,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.610
it does get a little bit hot
and here is your DVD drive,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.100
DVD-RW, RAMs, ROMs,
you name it.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.800
It also has Labelflash,
which is pretty much like Lightscribe,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.670
it uses, puts a high contrast image
on your disk using the same laser

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.410
it uses to burn the DVD.
Coming over here

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.910
this is your switch for you wi-fi
so I just turned it off by accident,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.550
turned it back on,
is right there.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.010
Coming over to this side, 
this is going to be your SD,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.230
MMC, MS, xD card slot right there,
so pretty much everything you want

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.090
it's going to fit right in there. Now 
the secret one is right underneath it,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.090
this is a 54 millimeter 
Express card slot

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.290
so tons of peripherals
you can have on it.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.830
This laptop already has
everything you need

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.840
but if you want add 
like let's say a TV tuner

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.280
you very well could,
you just throw it right in there.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.010
It's a nice feature to have,
here is your input and outputs

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.220
for your headset 
and microphone.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.380
This is a 1394 Firewire AKA i-link,
it's the really small one,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.410
you've got USB 2.0 
right there

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.390
and here is your 10/100/1000 
ethernet connection,

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.490
HDMI which is fantastic,
you will love it

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.760
and now that you have
a 9800 Mobile GTS on here

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.130
versus the older 8800 Mobile GTS
which was just the same architecture,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.590
just a different chip, this actually
does do sound over the HDMI

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.790
which is great, the older ones did not
so that's a nice upgrade.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.700
You also have eSATA in case you want
to connect to some hard drives on here,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.430
with 500 gigs I don't know
if you'll need to

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.670
but it would be nice
if you wanted to you know,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.510
connect it to your external 
that has a lot movies or something

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.210
and of course you have
a VGA port right there.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.600
Now let's take a quick look at some
of the design features on this.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.320
Let's talk about, first of all
I want to show you

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.200
where the power button is,
it's right over here.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.760
That's your power button right there,
Now moving on over,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.870
this brings your movie,
this brings up your DVD player,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.540
all your media keys and then of course
your volume over here

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.700
and this is your mute.
So just so you know for volume

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.040
you just, you go like this,
you don't actually have to tap here,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.540
you just slide your finger
and it's going to increase your volume.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.610
Now this thing has
two great speakers on it.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.200
I'll tell you what,
incredible speakers for a laptop

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.650
whether it be a 17, a 15 or even one
of those monster like 19 inch laptops,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.490
these speakers are incredible.
They're loud, they sound great

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.710
and they're quite quite impressive,
I like them a lot

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.150
and then finally, one of the last
things on here that's really cool,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.730
I'll show you on the back
there's a couple of things.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.500
First of all there's a modem over here,
yeah right there, V92 56K modem

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.640
if you're ever going to use it.
Well whatever's good for you

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.470
you can use it. 
Great for emergencies, hurricanes

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.380
and the battery. This battery mind you,
you know this laptop is a monster,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.800
it's got a Quad Core, 
it's got 4 gigs of DDR3,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.380
it's got a 500 gig hard drive
and a huge video card.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.910
Obviously it's going
to waste a lot of power

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.210
but this is a 9-cell
lithium ion battery

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.160
so you're probably going to get
about 3 to 3.5 hours

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.130
even on this
ridiculously powerful laptop

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.020
just off that battery right there.
So very nice,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.240
it's the Gateway P7808U FX series,
so it's still 17 inch,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.500
a little bit lower resolution so
you're going to get better frame rates

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.700
in some of the games,
you're not doing 1200 lines,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.610
you're only doing 900 lines,
it's a big difference.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.540
It's got the Quad Core processor so
if you're multitasking this is for you,

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.620
it's got a 9800 Mobile GTS
so for gaming or for graphics,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.360
mind you remember all this stuff
does CUDA, it all does PhysX,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.490
you can do a lot of stuff on here.
You can fold with this laptop

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.690
if you'd like through the video card
or through the processor,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.490
lots of good stuff. 
This thing is a powerhouse

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.050
and it is an incredible 
incredible deal

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.790
so Gateway P7808U
from the FX series.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.240
You have any questions on it
feel free to email me

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.660
and I will see you guys
next time.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.280
