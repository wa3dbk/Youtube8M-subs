00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:10.616
First we'll deal with the
controversial bit.

00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:13.366
This car belongs to Ferrari.

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.986
And I'm probably not supposed
to be driving it.

00:00:15.986 --> 00:00:17.616
But I'm not going to
dwell on that.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:21.336
Someone kind of subcontracted
it to me, let's say.

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:22.466
And if I'm offered
to drive in a

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.706
Ferrari I don't ask questions.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:26.826
I just drive it.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.005
The problem with this situation
is that I'm now at

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:31.906
least a year late to reviewing
the Spider.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.356
You've all read about it and
watched the video so you need

00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:36.326
to see something different.

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:38.036
Now I've searched YouTube and
there are lots of beautiful

00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:42.828
shoots and factual films, but
there isn't much bad behavior.

00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:45.366
I've, therefore, decided in
the interest of original

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.421
programming that I'm going
to drive this car

00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:50.990
like a complete idiot.

[CAR ENGINE]

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:25.266
Well, I have to say, it's dead
impressive for a car with a

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.116
conventional construction
that's got no roof.

00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:41.013
570 horsepower, at about
1550 kilograms, at

00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:43.935
little bit less, actually.

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:47.296
It's just as fast as you ever
wanted a car to be.

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:48.509
Very direct steering.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.038
I've got the suspension in
full firm at the moment.

00:01:52.038 --> 00:01:54.673
But I might just try and soften
it off a bit and see

00:01:54.673 --> 00:01:54.966
what it does.

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:56.436
[TIRES SQUEALING]

00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:58.056
It might make the car
a bit lazier.

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.826
I hope you can get some
of this noise.

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:01.726
Because it's--

[CAR ENGINE]

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:06.130
That's the defining
aspect of the 458.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.495
It's normally aspirated.

00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:10.116
It makes a noise that
the McLaren just

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:11.396
can't hope to match.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.296
The problem with these flippin'
Spiders these days is

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:21.256
they kind of undo my argument
that you have to have a hard

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:22.666
top on the driving front.

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:25.611
I mean, I don't have any
doubt that the Coupe is

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:26.666
a little bit better.

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:29.226
But the difference is
not night and day.

00:02:34.496 --> 00:02:38.866
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:41.446
This car is barely
a convertible.

00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:45.176
The roof aperture is so small
it's more of a targa really.

00:02:45.176 --> 00:02:48.066
And it's quite a fussy shape
from some angels.

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:50.576
Those rear buttresses rise
unexpectedly high.

00:02:50.576 --> 00:02:53.726
And those ultra-low profile
tires leave annoying amounts

00:02:53.726 --> 00:02:56.086
of vacant space in
the wheel arches.

00:02:56.086 --> 00:03:01.306
And this particular example has
63,000 pounds of extras on

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:04.666
top of the 200 grand
list price.

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:09.736
The titanium wheel bolts
are 1,900 pounds.

[CAR ENGINE]

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.576
But it's just, it's a very,
very exciting car.

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:22.566
It's very obedient, the
steering's fast.

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:27.776
The controls lack quite
a lot of feedback.

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:33.076
But it's really interesting how
quickly you can kind of

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:35.426
adjust your inputs to the
speed that they require.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:44.996 --> 00:04:47.216
Now I have to apologize, because
I haven't talked about

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:49.701
the clever folding hard
top or the neat gear

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:51.716
shifts in auto mode.

00:04:51.716 --> 00:04:52.566
I didn't have the time.

00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:55.946
Because remember, I was too busy
driving the 458 Spider

00:04:55.946 --> 00:04:58.466
like I was in some sort
of computer game.

00:04:58.466 --> 00:05:01.756
But in doing so, I can now tell
you that it's an absurdly

00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:03.353
good car to drive.

00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:06.436
You can chuck it around like
a cheap rally car, and that

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.846
shouldn't really be possible.

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:11.356
Of course I could never buy a
convertible Ferrari for all

00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:12.499
the obvious reasons.

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.916
But I could just about
forgive anyone who

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.416
bought one of these.
