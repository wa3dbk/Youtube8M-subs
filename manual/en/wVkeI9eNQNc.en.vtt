00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:05.226
- [Voiceover] Now, on City Ballet.

00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:08.440
- [Lauren] When I first met Chase,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.232
he kinda came in as a big shot at the

00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:11.653
School of American Ballet.

00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:16.653
So we were younger, I think
he was 17, and I was 15.

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:19.667
And I remember, he kinda came in

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.216
as this really talented student.

00:00:23.464 --> 00:00:26.320
We kinda started as
partners in the company.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.800
We'd dance together in
a few different roles,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.355
so I'd see him around work,

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:33.184
and kinda became friends
in the back of the studio.

00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:35.354
I guess that's how a lot of people meet.

00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:38.875
I never thought he liked me at all.

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.947
He was too popular, and I was too weird.

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.502
We danced together last year in Vail.

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:49.254
We did soiree,

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:50.954
and this year will be kind of

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:52.085
a different thing for us.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.668
This is a classical ballet;
we're doing Giselle.

00:00:54.668 --> 00:00:57.373
It's totally new for me,
I've never done it before.

00:00:57.373 --> 00:00:59.487
Yeah, I'm excited.

00:01:02.305 --> 00:01:05.302
(laughs) Should I maybe be more on my leg

00:01:05.302 --> 00:01:06.421
before you do that?

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:06.949
- Well I just...

00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:08.365
We're rehearsing Giselle...

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:10.873
- For the Vail International
Dance Festival.

00:01:10.873 --> 00:01:12.229
On my leg.
- I think, I think...

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.758
- (laughs) Perfectly on balance.

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:16.178
When you're dating
somebody, it has challenges,

00:01:16.178 --> 00:01:17.920
and it has good things too.

00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:21.322
I think we work pretty well together.

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:22.178
- [Chase] Yeah.

00:01:22.178 --> 00:01:24.414
- (laughs) I dunno.
- [Chase] This is really only

00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:26.862
our second real rehearsal.

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:28.117
This is still pretty new for us.

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:29.260
- [Lauren] Yeah, for sure.

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:34.072
(both laugh)

00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:35.123
- [Chase] The first rehearsals we

00:01:35.123 --> 00:01:36.295
had the Ballet Master here.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.747
He gave us some pointers,
but it's nice to,

00:01:38.747 --> 00:01:41.267
as dancers, just to get in there together,

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.647
and figure out what's good for us.

00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:45.208
Together.

00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:47.056
- [Lauren] I think the cool thing is

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:48.315
I can trust him with anything,

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:49.888
I can ask him anything.

00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:51.047
Since we know each other so well,

00:01:51.047 --> 00:01:52.930
we can communicate that way.

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:57.781
- Yeah. - Do you want me to
get to my position sooner?

00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:00.558
It's also hard, cause when
you're dating somebody

00:02:00.558 --> 00:02:02.506
you can still be honest
with what you need,

00:02:02.506 --> 00:02:03.579
and what you want, but you have to

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.318
say it in a more sensitive way.

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:06.736
It's cause I went without you.

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:08.658
Cause you don't want to
get in fights at home.

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:10.134
- Split the difference.
- Yeah.

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:12.063
Let's try it again.

00:02:12.063 --> 00:02:13.591
You didn't have to call me short.

00:02:16.755 --> 00:02:17.759
That's better.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.169
So that's what I was doing,

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.556
I was trying to help you
by being in a good pliĂŠ,

00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:24.262
but I'm just like...

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:26.425
- Yeah, but it's like...

00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:28.287
So, it's just making it seem less

00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:30.012
like a new piece that
I've never done before,

00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:32.226
and just kind of working out the kinks.

00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:34.489
- That's what today is: working.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.329
- Yeah.

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:38.741
- [Lauren] This job's
always challenging me

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:40.776
because you have to be really smart.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:44.437
You have to learn things
really, really fast.

00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:45.729
- [Chase] You know, you'll go though weeks

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.461
where you'll do three or
four different ballets,

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:49.977
maybe even more.

00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:51.033
It's a little strenuous,

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:55.093
especially having come off
this injury, my broken foot.

00:02:55.093 --> 00:02:56.641
- [Lauren] I'm sneakin' a peak.

00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:57.932
Watching Chase.

00:02:59.657 --> 00:03:01.420
Sometimes between
rehearsals when I get water,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.585
I come and watch.

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:07.861
He's just really serious
when he rehearses.

00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:12.427
Albert hates when I watch in the door.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.952
- [Albert] Lauren, stop
distracting, stop distracting!

00:03:15.952 --> 00:03:17.578
Here we go!

00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:19.717
- I have to go, bye.

00:03:24.098 --> 00:03:27.240
It helps to have somebody that understands

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.292
what you go through every day.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.531
- [Chase] We know how hard our days are.

00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:33.284
We know how to talk to
each other about them.

00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:35.960
When I get home I have to just like...

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.404
- [Lauren] If you're having a busy season,

00:03:37.404 --> 00:03:39.488
most the time you really
just want to go home

00:03:39.488 --> 00:03:41.411
and nurse your body back.

00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:44.111
- [Chase] This I got when I broke my foot.

00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:47.516
Take this, close it up, and turn it on.

00:03:47.516 --> 00:03:49.156
And it runs for about 20 minutes.

00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:51.135
Promotes healing.

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:53.492
- I don't know, for me resting
seems like it's the best.

00:03:53.492 --> 00:03:55.524
Wearing good shoes is big for me.

00:03:55.524 --> 00:03:57.351
It's kinda busted.
- [Chase] Your new shoes looked great.

00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:58.964
- I'm trying out some Capezios.

00:03:58.964 --> 00:04:01.584
- And you can probably
put a brick on your foot,

00:04:01.584 --> 00:04:03.084
and make it look good, but...

00:04:05.772 --> 00:04:06.797
- This is my spot.

00:04:06.797 --> 00:04:09.428
This is where I sit and watch Chase cook.

00:04:09.428 --> 00:04:11.421
- [Chase] I like to make it like, perfect.

00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:13.257
- Chase is like, very...

00:04:13.257 --> 00:04:17.653
See, look, all the
asparagus are the same size.

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:20.072
- It lets me forget about
all the choreography

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:23.492
I have to remember for
tomorrow, for a little bit.

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:25.533
So, I have a tendency
to sit here and like...

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.836
Keep repeating it over and over.

00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:29.480
- That's why I like
dancing with Chase though,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.728
because, I don't know,

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:34.552
I like having a very
predictable partner, I guess.

00:04:34.552 --> 00:04:36.145
- Predictability isn't
a bad thing, sometimes.

00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:38.689
- Fantastic, it's awesome
- [Chase] Yes.

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.105
- [Lauren] I mean, we
started dancing together

00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:41.377
almost right away.

00:04:41.377 --> 00:04:42.945
We did West Side Story together.

00:04:42.945 --> 00:04:43.924
- Yeah.

00:04:43.924 --> 00:04:45.410
- He was my first Nutcracker partner.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.541
- [Chase] Oh yeah, yeah.

00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:48.041
- [Lauren] You used to get on me.

00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:50.321
I have a problem trusting
my partner sometimes.

00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:52.432
"Trust me, you can trust me,

00:04:52.432 --> 00:04:54.143
"just stop doing it yourself."

00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:55.710
- Well, you were trying
to do it all yourself.

00:04:56.656 --> 00:04:58.735
- Chase didn't like that very much.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.689
We've gone through our ups

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:01.957
and downs even together.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.245
We've had times when we
broke up for a while, but...

00:05:05.245 --> 00:05:06.556
- That was no fun.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.937
- I will say it's hard
when you're in the company,

00:05:09.937 --> 00:05:12.176
and there's a problem.

00:05:12.176 --> 00:05:15.002
- Yeah, it's everyone else's business.
(Lauren laughs)

00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:18.301
- Your personal life is
everybody else's gossip.

00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:20.240
- Just learning about each other, really.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.160
- We're just really crazy about each other

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.064
so we keep coming back.

00:05:24.064 --> 00:05:27.005
- [Instructor] This is
good, this is all good.

00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:29.873
That tee ta ta ta ta tee...

00:05:29.873 --> 00:05:31.530
Go a little bit this way...

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.342
- [Lauren] With me and Chase,

00:05:32.342 --> 00:05:34.734
it's always felt really real.

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:35.603
When I look at Chase,

00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:38.188
I don't have to come up with

00:05:38.188 --> 00:05:39.403
any kind of fake scenario,

00:05:39.403 --> 00:05:41.631
I don't have to pretend
like he's anybody else.

00:05:43.358 --> 00:05:44.718
You don't have to make up chemistry.

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:46.175
It's already there.

00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:50.735
- [Instructor] That's right.

00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:51.903
Yeah.

00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:54.187
- [Lauren] There's something special about

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.648
dancing with somebody,

00:05:55.648 --> 00:05:57.109
especially somebody that you're with.

00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:58.571
You know, I see people all the time that

00:05:58.571 --> 00:06:00.774
pay to have lessons to dance,

00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:03.318
and that's a date night for them.

00:06:03.318 --> 00:06:04.706
- [Instructor] Shoulders,
not so much your arms,

00:06:04.706 --> 00:06:05.948
shoulders.

00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:07.483
That was good Chase.

00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:10.323
- [Lauren] It's romantic and
it's fun, and it's wonderful,

00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:13.542
and then you're like this is my job,

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:15.258
and I get paid to do this.

00:06:17.466 --> 00:06:19.283
Dogs are supposed to love 'em.

00:06:19.283 --> 00:06:20.953
We have a lot of dream roles we want

00:06:20.953 --> 00:06:22.686
to dance together, like Romeo and Juliet,

00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:26.218
is like both of our dream role to dance.

00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:28.287
Pretty awesome, I can't complain.

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:29.950
We'll see.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.537
Fingers are crossed.

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:33.319
- Sorry, I had to.
