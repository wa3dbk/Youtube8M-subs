00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.240
You heard it over and over again from your mom.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.830
“eat your carrots, they’ll help you see better!”

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.579
Well get ready to throw it back in mom’s face,

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:10.929
with science!

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.279
(reactions theme)

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.919
Actually before we get to the science,

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.500
let’s have a history lesson.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830
During world war two, british pilots

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.300
had this fancy new top-secret system for

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.050
spotting enemy planes called “radar”.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.890
No not that radar. Look it up, kids.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.050
Our chemist friend chad jones

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.519
picks up the story from here:

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.779
“this fancy new radar system gave pilots

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.280
a huge advantage over their enemy.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.660
To keep this advantage a secret the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.989
british royal air force started a rumor

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.399
that their pilots ate lots of carrots to

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.879
help them see the enemy better at night.”

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.879
Of course it wasn’t the carrots, it was

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.340
just the radar, but the rumor actually stuck,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.840
and it still circulates to this day.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.949
And the funny thing is, there’s

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.570
actually a bit of truth to it.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.370
Carrots have in them a chemical compound

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.460
called beta carotene

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.489
(and…no, it’s not named after carrots).

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.410
When you eat foods with beta carotene,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.980
your body converts it into vitamin A.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.830
And that vitamin A gets turned into retinol.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.540
Now retinal is found in your eyes

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.090
 inside vision cells called "rods".

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.320
At the very tip of the cell you'll find

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.180
retinal wrapped inside of a protein.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.580
That protein is twisted and compact 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.540
a little bit like this ball of yarn...

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.570
And retinal sits comfortably inside - like

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.660
a baby wrapped in a tight blanket. But, when

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.180
light shines on this happy, sleeping baby...

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.100
It stretches out from this form (called cis)

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.470
to this form (called trans).

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.860
This stretching unravels the protein,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.220
starting a chain reaction that leads

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.060
down the rod cell, through the nerves,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.380
and to the brain letting you know

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.510
it's not dark anymore.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.970
And that’s how you see light.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.030
So where does that leave our carrot myth?

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.170
Well, any food that has vitamin A will

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.930
be good for your overall eye health.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.400
That’s carrots, lettuce, spinach, mangoes,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.240
milk, cheese, cantaloupe and peas.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.890
But if you already have a diet of vitamin A,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.830
these foods won’t actually improve your vision.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.750
So don’t forget your vitamin A,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.040
but don’t count on getting rid of

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.990
your glasses any time soon just

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.259
because you’re chomping on a carrot.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.459
Big thanks to chad jones.

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.319
He hosts a great podcast called

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.420
the collapsed wave function,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.680
we’ll include a link in the description.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.950
We talk a lot of food on Reactions.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.900
