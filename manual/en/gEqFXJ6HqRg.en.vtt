00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.770
Marc Luber: Hey what's up everyone? Welcome
to Careers Out There. I'm your host Marc Luber

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.290
and we're helping you find a career that fits
you. Our guest is Doctor Jeff Garland, who

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.010
has offices in Gray's Lake, Illinois and Highland
Park, Illinois. What you're watching is a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.140
short version of the interview with Dr. Garland.
To learn more about being an internist, you

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.410
could see the full interview at Careers Out
There dot com. Alright - let's meet Dr. Jeff.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.500
I think most of us know what a doctor does.
We all go to the doctor - we've been going

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.390
to the doctor our whole lives. At least you
all should be! What we don't know is a typical

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.740
day. Walk us through a typical day for an
internist.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.350
Doctor Jeff Garland: First of all an internist
is an adult doctor - a physician for people

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.520
over 18 years old. Typical day is kind of
like a triathalon. The first part is like

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.660
the swim. It's going to the hospital. You
go to the hospital. Some doctors go to one

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.470
hospital, some go to two. You see your patients
and you re-assess how they're doing: can they

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.979
go home, do they need any new tests or a new
antibiotic. How are they doing. So you evaluate

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.410
them, you listen to their symptoms, you review
the data and then you make decisions. After

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.560
that then you get to converse with other physicians.
Then after that you go to your office. That's

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.000
the second leg. Kind of like the run.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Marc Luber: OK.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.509
Dr. Jeff Garland: Or the bike. I don't really
run triathalons so I don't know how it goes!

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:42.069
[Laughing] We'll call it the bike! So that
part is patients come to your office with

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.759
their medical problems. A lot of them have
blood pressure or cholesterol, diabetes, back

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.510
pain, sinus infections, they come for their
physical...and you listen to their problems

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.959
and you try to put them on the right medications.
Some of them just need someone to listen to

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.930
them. Other people need treatments. You do
that during the day - there's a lot of interruptions

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.319
 - the hospital calling, the pharmacy calling,
other doctors calling. And then after that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.790
 - the run - you review all your paperwork,
which could be lab results, CAT scan results,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.769
mammogram results, x-rays. For a lot of them
you have to call the patients, "you need another

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.909
test" or "your test is OK". And then you can
go home and hopefully you won't have to go

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:30.909
back.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.830
Marc Luber: What's the most rewarding part
of it all? The most fun part and the most

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.830
rewarding part?

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.850
Dr. Jeff Garland: I think the most rewarding
part probably is being able to get involved

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.580
in people's lives. You are a part of hundreds,
perhaps thousands of people's lives where

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.040
you know them, you know about their family,
about good things that happen to them and

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.769
bad things that happen to them. I think I
chose to do a private practice because it

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.450
just kind of happened. I interviewed at a
bunch of places. I think in a private practice

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.290
setting you might work harder, more being
on call, but more rewarding. You actually

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.290
get to decide what your hours are or when
it's time to hire a doctor you kind of get

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.200
to pick. Where if you work in a big hospital
system, they tell you when you're going to

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.700
work and who your receptionist is going to
be and who your lab tech is going to be and

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.840
who your next partner is going to be, so you
definitely lose a lot of say as far as how

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.330
things are going to go. I think it's more
rewarding to be in a situation where you have

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.489
more control. If you work in a big group they
could fire you - you never know what's going

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.959
to happen. But there's less that you have
to worry about in some ways. You might not

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.860
be able to do as well financially the first
couple of years but after a while you usually

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.879
do better in a private setting.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.689
Marc Luber: And now if I'm watching out there
 - I'm interested and I'm not yet in med school

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:56.010
 - what are some keys to success? Give everyone
some keys to success for being an internist

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.800
so they could kind of have some guide posts
to go by.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.450
Dr. Jeff Garland: I think you have to take
the science courses and see if you can do

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.260
well in them. Not everyone can. A lot of people
can but not everyone. So take the courses.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.099
Getting through the process is like a long
journey and it seems like it's never gonna

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.620
end. Test after test, finals after finals,
the MCAT, boards, other boards...but eventually

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.860
one day you're done. Along the way there could
be a setback: you could get a C in a course,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.230
things might not always go your way, you might
have to take the MCAT a second time...But

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.750
if you're determined you could get through
it. And then to be successful a lot has to

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.889
do with whether you have the right personality.
Do you like people, do you like talking to

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.090
people. Sometimes you're the therapist for
a lot of patients. A lot of people don't see

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.500
a psychiatrist or psychologist. They're just
sort of too busy, they don't like to, the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.250
stigma...so a lot of people use you as that
person they want to talk to. Some people really

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.530
enjoy that. I do. You get to hear a lot of
stuff. You're almost like the hairdresser!

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:08.090
They get to hear all the good stuff! So if
you like hearing about people's lives, if

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.680
you enjoy people, if you enjoy giving advice
 - sometimes advice can help them more than

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.879
anything. So if you enjoy talking to people,
socializing...it's definitely a good job for

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.970
you. A lot of people have jobs where they
have to sit at a desk all day. So this is

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.970
great - you get to talk to people.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.169
