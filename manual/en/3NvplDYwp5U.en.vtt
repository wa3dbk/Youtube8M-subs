00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.319
Where am I?

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.819
Hey, are you going to
let me out of here soon?

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.559
This week, we're making
anatomical heart valentines.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.839
It's getting humid in here.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.879
[Anatomical Heart Valentine]

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:21.819
[degree of difficulty]
Still learning.

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:24.200
[20 minutes]

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.799
I love this little card so much.

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:29.159
First you need to find
your image online,

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.339
unless you're really good
at drawing anatomical hearts.

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.819
The image I found comes from
The Graphics Fairy.

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:37.939
Love that name.

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:41.000
Save it to your desktop
and open it with Preview.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.179
Select the print option
in Preview

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.319
then set it to print two images
per page,

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.099
setting the scale at 50%
so they both fit on there.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.699
Print it out,
then take it over

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.719
to your craft table,
and cut the page in half.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.140
Then take out a piece of card stock
and fold that in half.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.339
Fold it the other way
and back again.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.699
Then run a hard object
along that seam to really make
that fold a fold.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:08.979
Place your image on top,
and use a straight edge
and a cutter

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.639
to cut the card stock
to fit the area of your heart.

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:13.839
You can use that other piece
of card stock you cut off

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:16.220
for another card project.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.179
Next, cover your work space
and spray some spray adhesive

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.319
onto the back of your image.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.479
If you don't have spray adhesive,
a glue stick would probably work
just fine.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.159
Press the image onto the front side
of your card stock,

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.239
making sure to align
the side of the image
with the fold of the card.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:34.099
Cut off the sticky overhang pieces
then take your time

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.139
cutting along the outline
of the image.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.299
I find it helps to turn the image
as you cut,

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.499
getting into the turns
all the way with your scissors,

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.740
keeping them open as you turn

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.280
and cutting when the scissors
are in the direction of where
you want to cut.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.320
Does that make sense?

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.860
You really want to make sure
not to cut the part of the fold

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.240
that connects the front of the card
to the back of the card,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.520
where the image meets the fold.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.100
Next, use some rubber stamps
to add a clever message.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.260
If you don't have
any rubber stamps,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.280
just right it on there.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.540
My favorites are "I'm open"
on the inside

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.580
or "you are here"
on the outside.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.860
I also use that heart template
to create a garland.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.680
Just attach the images
to different colors of card stock,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.840
make some holes
with a hold puncher,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.340
and string them up
on a thin piece of yarn.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.340
And you have a garland that's neato
from both sides.

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:29.881

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.901
Oh, and don't forâ€”

00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:35.721
[scissor snipping sound]

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:38.721
