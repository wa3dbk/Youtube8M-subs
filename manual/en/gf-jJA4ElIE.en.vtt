00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.126
What is up guys? In today's video, I'm going to show you How To Unlock Nexus 6 by Motorola so

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:08.252
that you can use it with any GSM sim card in the world.

00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:17.694
So I recently got this phone. This is apparently one of the best phones I have ever tested, and it is

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:22.385
very cool. It has great design, great power. The only problem is that I have it locked to my

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:28.112
original carrier. I brought my phone on AT&amp;T so it is obviously locked to AT&amp;T, and I'm going

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:32.405
to show you how to unlock it, so that you can use it with any GMS sim card. In this case, I'm

00:00:32.405 --> 00:00:36.801
going to use it with my T-Mobile sim card. So we're going to do it step-by-step. It is very, very

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:40.929
simple. All you need is your computer with an Internet connection, and you will be able to

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.904
unlock your phone. Now, in this case, I'm going to show you how to do it, unfortunately, there is

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:52.147
no possible way to unlock this phone for free, but trust me guys, it is worth every penny to have

00:00:52.147 --> 00:00:57.445
your phone fully factory unlocked. We will have to pay a small amount, but it is well worth it.

00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:01.381
All right, so I'm going to show you the way to unlock it. The first step is to open your phone

00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:07.004
application just as if you were dialing a call, and you type the following command. You type

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:14.813
star, pound, zero, six, pound. As you will see here on the screen, the 15-digit IME number will

00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:19.634
appear. This is probably the most important step. All you need to unlock your phone is this

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:23.967
number. So based on this number, we're going to request the unlock code. For now, we're going

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:27.869
to put it here to the side, and we're going to switch to the computer.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.208
So once you're in your computer, open your Internet browser, I use Google Chrome, and we're

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:38.543
going to go to the website unlockriver.com. All right, so I'm just going to adjust the camera a

00:01:38.543 --> 00:01:45.192
little so that you can see it better. All right, we go to the website, and once you're in this website,

00:01:45.192 --> 00:01:50.938
you will request the unlock code. So we just need to fill in here the information of our phone. So

00:01:50.938 --> 00:01:55.822
we're going to start by selecting the original carrier. This is the place which your phone is

00:01:55.822 --> 00:02:01.022
currently locked to. In this case, my phone is locked to AT&amp;T United States, so I'm going to

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:05.375
select that one, and then you will select the brand of your phone. Of course, we're going to be

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:12.532
unlocking a Motorola phone, and then you will have to select the exact model. So you will have

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:18.298
to look for your exact model. For this video, we are going to be unlocking a Motorola Nexus 6,

00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:22.790
so I'm going to select that one, all right. Perfect.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.222
The next step is very important. So remember we got the 15-digit IME number at the beginning

00:02:27.222 --> 00:02:32.379
of the video, so just make sure you copy and paste it here. Just make sure it is 100% correct.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:39.049
Otherwise, this method will not work. So just copy it there, and the following step is to write

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.889
down your personal email where you want to receive the unlock code. So just make sure you

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:48.480
write it down correctly your email. If you scroll down, you will see an average delivery time and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.056
a price to unlock your phone. So this is what your carrier charges and how long it takes them to

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:58.032
unlock your phone. So we're going to click on unlock now, and on the following screen, you're

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:02.543
going to see a summary of your order. Just make sure everything here is correct, all right.

00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:06.185
As I promised you, I was going to show you step-by-step how to unlock it, so I'm going to go

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:10.665
through the payment in front of you. I'm just going to click checkout with PayPal, and we should

00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:15.277
be redirected to the checkout page. So this is just going to take a couple of seconds, probably 10

00:03:15.277 --> 00:03:20.151
seconds at most. It is very, very fast, I promise. If you don't have a PayPal account, don't worry,

00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:24.698
you can always click down here where it says create a PayPal account or you can just log in if

00:03:24.698 --> 00:03:29.321
you do have a PayPal account. I have a PayPal account, so I'm just going to log in really quick,

00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:34.024
and I'm going to click where it says Pay Now, and that's it guys.  We have submitted the request

00:03:34.024 --> 00:03:39.824
to unlock our phone, so we're just going to wait for the confirmation message right now.

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:46.702
So as you can see here, yeah, it says your order is in process, thank you for your order, and that's

00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:51.575
it. All you have to do right now is wait. You have to wait until they send you your unlock code.

00:03:51.575 --> 00:03:57.778
It can take 30 minutes. It can take five minutes. It can take two hours and up to two business

00:03:57.778 --> 00:04:02.206
days. It depends on every phone. So I'm going to show you how the email will look like. We're

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:06.352
going to go to my personal email. As you can see here, I have received this email from Unlock

00:04:06.352 --> 00:04:14.361
River. Your Motorola unlock code is ready. So we're going to open this email. All right, as you

00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:21.592
can see here, I received this email saying that my unlock code is ready, and it includes

00:04:21.592 --> 00:04:25.844
instructions on how to insert your unlock code and, of course, it includes the most important part,

00:04:25.844 --> 00:04:27.553
which is the unlock code.

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:32.188
So I'm going to show you how to insert this unlock code into the phone. So I'm going to grab my

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:37.063
phone here, and the first thing we're going to have to do is power off completely. So I'm going to

00:04:37.063 --> 00:04:41.744
click the power off button and click power off to confirm. So it's going to take a couple of

00:04:41.744 --> 00:04:48.291
seconds until the phone is fully off. The following step is very important. We're going to remove

00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:54.982
the sim card tray, and we're going to insert the new sim card you want to use your phone with.

00:04:54.982 --> 00:05:01.162
For example, my phone here is locked to AT&amp;T, so I'm not going to use this AT&amp;T sim card.

00:05:01.162 --> 00:05:03.500
I'm going to use a different sim card.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.285
So I'm going to grab here my T-Mobile sim card, and I'm going to insert it into the phone. So

00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:14.374
once you have your new sim card in, you will power on your phone, and it will detect that you

00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:20.338
have inserted a non-recognized sim card. So it will require to enter an unlock code. So here's

00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:25.819
where I'm going to insert the unlock code I received in the email. So remember this only works

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:41.583
one time, the unlock code.  So I'm going to insert this unlock code 0-2-5-8-6-7-5-2. We're going

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:46.573
to click okay, and when I click unlock, you will see a success message. Network unlock

00:05:46.573 --> 00:05:47.885
successful.

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:52.621
That's it. That's all you have to do guys. The phone is now fully factory unlocked. The phone will

00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:57.163
restart. It will take a couple of minutes until the phone is fully back on, and once it's on, you can

00:05:57.163 --> 00:06:02.886
test it to see if it works. So I'm just going to make a quick test here. I'm going to insert a totally

00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:10.025
different sim card from Claro, a GSM sim card in Central America. I'm just going to put it inside,

00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:18.005
and I'm going to try to make a test call to the US just to check if it works. So I'm going to wait

00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:24.591
until I get a full signal, my bar is full, and I'm going to try to make a test call. So just for this

00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:31.172
example, I'm going to try to call GoDaddy (thank you for calling GoDaddy. Your call may be

00:06:31.172 --> 00:06:35.801
monitored and recorded).  All right, sounds perfect. The phone is now fully factory unlocked and

00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:36.527
working.

00:06:36.527 --> 00:06:41.155
