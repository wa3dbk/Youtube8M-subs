00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.390
hello everyone once again we have the
samsung galaxy note 2 in front of us

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.599
today i just want to show you
hidden feature that i found that is very

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.780
useful and a tip for people who have
multiple batteries a little bit

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.650
better way to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.389
change batteries so you could save your
screen

00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:23.099
first thing i want to show you is
hidden in future

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.640
say that you have a full screen app

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.999
or

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:28.940
or you're playing a video

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.970
and you want to access to status for

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.050
so for example i'd love the new status
for especially because

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.760
it has the brightness controls and i
love always being able to adjust

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.580
brightness because

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.140
to be honest the automatic brightness
control is still couple of years away

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.710
from being perfect

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.190
so say that you have a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.740
full-screen app open

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.649
it could be

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.660
it works on every app

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.930
so say that you have this game open then you
have to get used to this movement

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.500
movement if you do it too slow doesn't
come out you have to do a quick

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.050
swipe up because literally start off the
scream and

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.160
quick swipe down

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.030
there we go

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.740
and that brings up the stats for

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.610
and now you could change the brightness

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.900
once again

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.930
slow doesn't work

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500
but quick swiped down

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.930
sometimes let's try twice then you could get this
satisfied

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.110
works on

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.050
virtually every app that I tried

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.770
let's try another app

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.580
Fruit ninja

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.190
quick swipe down and now we can
access to brightness control

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.200
or you can of course switch off the other
radio switch

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.170
it on

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.990
so i think this is great to have because
I always want this feature

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.960
let's just try
one more example

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.990
say dice player

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.039
dice player

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.450
full screen video of course this one has the
brightness suggestment there

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.979
but not all

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.079
not all video players have this brightness adjustment

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.069
so

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.119
let's try

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.149
quick swipe down

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.989
and there we go

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.959
we could adjust the brightness

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.779
from the status bar

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.150
so

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.559
there you go with that and then
another thing i want to share was the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:28.699
a tip when change the battery
so whenever I chang the battery

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.999
I would turn off the phone first

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.420
I love it how this phone turns off
very quickly

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.609
but say that

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.109
say that you took off the back cover

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.779
i always wonder

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:46.099
where's a good
place to put his

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.759
phone because

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.109
I need to have it down

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.889
i don't necessarily want to
scratch a glass

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.639
the glass

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.649
has very good scratched resistance but it
is

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.449
it will scratch when you have send

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.149
so you must be careful

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:10.209
i realized that the best place to put it
is if you have one of these

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.199
any cover

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.779
official samsung flip cover here

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:16.579
and then just

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.739
take your other battery

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.189
and let's

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.829
do a

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.419
quick swipe

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.629
and

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.029
that way

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:35.799
you never have to put your phone

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.909
face down on any kind of desk
even though the desk might be clean

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.559
the glasses are very scratchs for
resistance

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:49.609
it will scratch if you have

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.680
sand on your

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.959
desk for some reason maybe you go onto the
beach

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.039
that's all i want to share for today
