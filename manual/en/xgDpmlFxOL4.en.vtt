00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:08.809
Community card, shared card poker games are
a lot of fun and very popular. Your most popular

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.400
forms of poker right now are community card
games. Texas Hold em, two cards down and then

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.080
you share the board of five cards. Omaha,
similar, it's another kind of hold em and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.699
it's a community card game. There another
one that we look at, in another series on

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:40.120
Expert Village, called Crazy Pineapple. All
these games have some cards that are yours

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:49.030
and some cards that are community cards, so
everybody in the hand shares what's on the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.480
board and makes their own version of it. What's
nice about community card games is that they

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:06.079
give you clear information blended with unclear
information. It's clear to me when I look

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:13.719
at the board in Texas Hold em what's some
of my opponents cards are. For instance, if

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:19.951
the flop comes ace, king, ten, then I know
that he's playing an ace and a king and a

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:29.590
ten plus the unknown cards he holds in his
hand. So, it's very nice how the two are blended.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:37.049
Draw poker on the other hand, is mostly unclear
information. You get information from how

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.219
your opponents bet but it's unclear until
the showdown, exactly what they're betting

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:53.859
because they don't have any up cards showing.
You have to play by feel, play by your reads.

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.520
Right now we're going to look at a game called
spit in the ocean. Now, you'll be pleased

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.380
to know that you don't actually spit in the
ocean, or anywhere during this game, but it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.550
is, none-the-less a lot of fun as it blends
community card poker with draw poker. So without

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.920
further ado, let's spit in the ocean.
