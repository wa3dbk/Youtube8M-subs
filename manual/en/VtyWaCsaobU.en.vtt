00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.517
We want to find the distance

00:00:01.517 --> 00:00:03.530
along an arc on the surface of the earth

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.419
that subtends a central
angle of four minutes

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.020
where one minute equals 1/60 of a degree.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.961
The radius of the earth is 3,960 miles.

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.610
And we also round to the thousandths,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.758
or three decimal places.

00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:20.348
So we'll be using the arc
length formula given here,

00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:22.590
where the arc length s

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.391
is equal to the length of the radius r

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:28.649
times theta, where theta
is the central angle

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.809
measured in radians.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:31.642
So for the earth,

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:33.225
r is equal to 3,960

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.093
miles,

00:00:37.848 --> 00:00:38.699
and for this problem,

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.059
the central angle is four minutes.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.476
So theta equals four minutes,

00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:47.148
which must be converted to radians.

00:00:47.148 --> 00:00:49.569
Let's first convert to degrees.

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.168
Since one minute equals 1/60 of a degree,

00:00:53.168 --> 00:00:56.235
so four minutes would be equal to four

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.068
times 1/60 of a degree.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:01.835
Notice if we write four over one,

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:03.562
this will simplify

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.124
there's one four in four,

00:01:05.124 --> 00:01:06.707
and 15 fours in 60,

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:11.957
so our angle, theta, is equal to 1/15

00:01:11.957 --> 00:01:12.957
of a degree.

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:15.547
But now we need to convert the angle

00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:17.379
in degrees to radians.

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:21.927
So our angle theta would be
equal to 1/15 of a degree,

00:01:21.927 --> 00:01:25.129
times, to convert from degrees to radians,

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:28.546
we multiply by pi divided by 180 degrees.

00:01:30.937 --> 00:01:33.758
Notice how the units of
degrees would simplify out,

00:01:33.758 --> 00:01:35.258
leaving us with pi

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:37.765
divided by

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:39.626
15 times 180,

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:43.793
or pi divided by 2,700,
and this should be radians.

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:49.966
Which means your arc length, s,

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:50.883
is equal to

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:52.662
3,960 miles

00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:56.785
times

00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:58.598
pi divided by

00:01:58.598 --> 00:01:59.765
2,700 radians,

00:02:03.068 --> 00:02:06.661
and now we'll go to the calculator.

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:07.994
So we have 3,960

00:02:09.724 --> 00:02:10.557
times pi

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:14.385
divided by 2,700.

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:21.777
Three decimal places,

00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:25.940
the arc length will be
approximately 4.608,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.717
and because your radius is in miles,

00:02:28.717 --> 00:02:30.418
the arc length is in miles.

00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:34.335
So the arc length is
approximately 4.608 miles.

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.515
So looking at this picture of the earth

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:42.877
here on the right,

00:02:42.877 --> 00:02:46.150
if the central angle was 1/15 of a degree,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.119
then the arc length on
the surface of the earth,

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.649
this length here,

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.566
would be approximately 4.608 miles.

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.525
Of course, 1/15 of a degree
is a very small angle,

00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:01.692
it'd be much smaller than
this angle pictured here.

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.179
I hope you found this helpful.
