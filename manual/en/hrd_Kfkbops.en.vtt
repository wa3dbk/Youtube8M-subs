00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.240
When Motorola announced its revised Moto X,
I was pretty excited.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.090
I loved most everything about the first generation,
in fact I had used it as a daily driver for

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.750
quite some time.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.720
This year, Motorola has made a few big changes
with the second generation, but are they enough

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.920
to hold your attention?

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.040
Well, let's go ahead and find out...

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.100
Hey what's up everyone, this is Dom and I've
been living with the new Moto X for a while

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.100
now.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.230
First off, this is a better phone than its
predecessor in almost every way.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.780
Once again, Motorola proved that you don't
need the best specs or cluttered software

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.260
features in a phone to make it great.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.280
The build quality has been improved and the
software experience has remained largely untouched.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.640
If you've seen the first generation Moto X,
this revision will look familiar, but it does

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.460
fave a few notable changes to the hardware
and design.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.399
As far as specifications go, the Moto X features
a 5.2-inch AMOLED display with a resolution

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:07.450
of 1,920 x ,1080 (424 ppi), a 2.5GHz Snapdragon
801 processor, 2GB of RAM, and a 2,300 mAh

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.450
battery.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.350
The Moto X is a large device.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.800
With its 5.2-inch display, this is going to
be a big jump for anyone that was a fan of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.340
the previous model.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.000
However, we're also given a much-improved
design this time around.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.920
The new design screams premium.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.049
It has a perfectly balanced build.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.840
In a nutshell, Gorilla Glass 3 on the front
side, a sleek metal frame all around, and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.020
new customizable back plates tell most of
the story here.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.591
You still have the ability to create a custom
design with Motorola's Moto Maker, but there

00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:42.020
are some additional materials and color choices
including leather and the bamboo option I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.670
have with my Verizon Moto X. I'm a big fan
of Moto Maker and I wish more smartphone manufacturers

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.790
would offer this level of customization.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.509
The design is what really sets it apart from
its predecessors and other plastic-built smartphones

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.509
out there.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.229
The sleek metal frame feels great in the hand
and I'm a big fan of the bamboo back cover.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.329
Durability with the wood has been fine in
my use, but I think that most people will

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.360
opt for a plastic back.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.999
Id' stay away from the leather version though
as any I've seen in the wild have worn down

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.980
quite a bit in a short amount of time.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.379
As far as layout goes, on the right side we
have a volume rocker and the lock button.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.370
The top side is home to a 3.5mm headphone
jack and Nano SIM card tray, while the bottom

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.480
provides space for the Micro USB charging
port.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.040
The back of the device features a 13-megapixel
camera and dual LED flash that has been arranged

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.790
within a ring diffuser, but that last bit
doesn't really make a difference in the flash

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.790
quality.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.719
Around the front side we have a 2-megapixel
camera and a couple of notable changes.

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.340
The Moto X also features a single front facing
speaker, but the design gives the appearance

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.769
of two raised speaker grilles.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.480
One is actually just an earpiece, but it's
nice having sound coming from the front of

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.090
a device either way.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.480
It's not the best speaker, but it's far from
the worst one on a smartphone.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.889
Motorola has also included 4 Infrared sensors
that are dedicated to a very specific set

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.480
of software features.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.959
With a wave of the hand, you have the ability
to silence phone calls, alarms, or just simply

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.319
wake up the display by utilizing the built-in
infrared sensors.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.620
It's a handy feature, but as you can see with
the white model, it doesn't look too pretty

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.999
with all of those sensors on the front.

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:15.999
Though that may not be a big deal to everyone.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.749
If you're not a fan of this feature, it can
be disabled via software.

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:24.370
Speaking of software, you won't find any crazy
features here, but that's a big reason why

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.349
so many people love the Moto X.

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.180
It's very simple.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.659
Without many software specific features, you're
almost left with a Nexus-like device.

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.560
That's not a bad thing, but I tend to be a
fan of immersive software features that you

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.450
won't find with the Moto X.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.769
This is just plain and simple Android.

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.049
Motorola did carry over one great feature
from the first generation Moto X though.

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.389
Active Display found on the first generation
is still present, but it has been rebranded

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.930
as Moto Display.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.189
This feature allows you to quickly glance
at and interact with notifications on the

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.459
screen without consuming too much power or
unlocking the device.

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.790
It has also been improved to allow you to
view more than one notification at a time.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.650
This was one of my favorite features from
the first generation, so I'm glad Motorola

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.949
decided to keep it around.

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:12.430
Along with that we have the always-listening
Moto Voice, but unlike the first generation,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.030
you'll now have the ability to specify a custom
voice command.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.250
There's also Moto Assist which will help you
manage notifications while sleeping, driving,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.210
relaxing, or while in a meeting.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.259
It'll even go as far as reading notifications
to you while you're driving.

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:28.259
Pretty neat.

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.550
Any of these smart Moto features can be disabled
within the dedicated Moto app as well.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.379
Motorola's idea of a great user experience
stems from a Nexus-like perspective.

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:38.550
Less is more.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.669
You won't find a lot of fancy bells and whistles
in Motorola's software skin, but there's a

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.860
huge benefit to this choice.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.550
The Moto X is a very snappy device.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.330
Motorola's take on software may be a bit boring
for those who enjoy skinned features found

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.449
with Samsung's TouchWiz or Sense on HTC devices,
but most people will chose long-term performance

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.449
over features.

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:59.449
The Moto X lacks some of the high-end specs
when compared to its competition, but that

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:00.449
doesn't stop it from being a star performer.

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.669
Running a cleaned up near-stock version of
Android, the Moto X doesn't really need the

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.030
industry's latest and greatest to provide
a buttery smooth experience.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.000
As for camera performance, well it's just
decent.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.939
It's a 13-megapixel shooter with a dual-LED
flash that's capable of shooting up to UHD

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.199
quality video.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.290
You can still shake the device to launch the
camera as well.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.319
In my opinion, the camera capabilities are
a bit lacking, but I am a big fan of the simplistic

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.350
layout within the Camera app.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.039
It's not a horrible camera, but I've struggled
to get great photos from it.

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.889
The flash isn't that great and low-light performance
is poor overall.

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.710
I wasn't a fan of the first generation's camera
and the same thing applies here.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.580
UHD video performance is alright, but like
still quality, it's not the best.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.610
Maybe I've been spoiled by the optics on other
smartphones, but I feel like Motorola could

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.039
have stepped it up a bit.

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.340
Also, there's no optical image stabilization
here, so you'll need a steady hand when capturing

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.340
video.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.189
With a much larger display than its predecessor,
I definitely expected better battery life

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:59.550
on the new Moto X.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.969
Well, that's not exactly the case here.

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.789
Battery life is decent, but nothing I'd brag
about.

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.550
Most days, I got between 2 1/2 to 3 hours
of screen on time.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.440
Don't get me wrong, I wasn't rushing to a
charger at the end of a day, but there are

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.479
a lot of other options on the market if you
need a phone with solid battery life.

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.930
Overall, the Moto X has a superior build quality
and improvements have been made across the

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.930
board.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.900
I'm a big fan of the redesigned hardware and
thankfully, Motorola has kept everything I

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.189
loved about last year's design.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.939
Some may find the software lacking in features,
but that's also what makes this such a safe

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:33.939
and simple device.

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:38.060
At the end of the day, if you're looking for
an easy to use Android smartphone that's snappy

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.810
and built-to-last, the Moto X is the phone
for you.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.930
This is the closest thing you'll get to a
Nexus device and that's been Motorola's intentions

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.190
all along.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.599
That being said, there's not a lot that makes
this smartphone special.

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.969
It's just another solid Android device.

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:54.430
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.939
but that's alright with me.

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:59.550
So I hope you enjoyed my full review of the
2014 Moto X.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.520
And if you did, feel free to leave it a big
thumbs up as it does help out the channel

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.520
a lot.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.099
Also, if you're not already, feel free to
subscribe for more review videos like this

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:09.110
in the future.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.190
Thank you very much for watching everybody
I really appreciate it, this is Dom and have

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.730
a great day!
