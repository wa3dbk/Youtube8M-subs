00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.289
I'm going to show you a few techniques on how to make perfectly decorated fairy cakes

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:13.789
we all know cupcakes but we're going to bring back the good old British fairy cake

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.789
so what I'm going to show you is four different techniques

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.540
using butter cream icing

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.000
and some rolled out

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.909
fondant icing

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.570
if you're going to fill a piping bag 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.179
all you need to do is put the piping bag

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.070
with the nozzle into a jug

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.429
and then you can

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.739
open up the piping bag and you can fill it quite easily because your hands 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.230
will be free

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.359
so with your hand

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:38.559
at the bottom

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.160
using it to direct the piping back

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.749
and a hand at the top

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:44.440
is doing the pressure

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.110
to squeeze the icing out of the bag

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.630
so you want to make sure the icing

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.320
goes right up to the edge of the case

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.659
and make sure, as much as possible

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.169
that the icing bag

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:59.500
is vertical

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.800
so with even pressure

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.830
slowly

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.310
just move the icing bag

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.610
around the edge

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.100
you've got plenty of time so don't rush it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.380
and then

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.470
go over the top half

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.929
and when you finished, ease off on the
pressure

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.390
and just pull the bag up

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.320
and you should get a lovely little peak like that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.660
so you end up with a perfect little fairy cake

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.740
so that's the first technique

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.070
the second one

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.930
I'm going to use a chocolate icing, this is the same butter cream icing all I've done is added in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.010
some cocoa powder

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.160
so taking another fairy cake

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.860
what I'm going to do is a rosette 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.950
pattern

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.290
so again keeping the piping bag

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.509
quite upright

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.210
and again using this

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.369
lower hand

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.679
to direct the bag and again the upper
hand

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:52.630
to squeeze

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.690
so what you want to do

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.650
is

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.790
push down

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.650
and then ease off the pressure and pull
away

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.770
and just keep

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.180
doing that 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.250
around the fairy cake

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.869
move it slightly with your hand rather than moving the piping bag

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.339
and then pull away

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.599
as you do it and become more practiced it becomes easier and easier

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.839
and again just keep rotating round

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:20.959
you can do a double layer if you wanted to

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.489
but I am just gong to do a single layer

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.869
and what we're going to do it finish off the middle bit

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:29.460
is just do a big rosette in the middle so squeeze a bit harder

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.889
and then pull away

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:36.389
and you end up with a really cute little different idea to the swirl

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.519
then for the third technique using butter cream icing 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.099
take another fairy cake

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.929
I've just got some pink icing that I've made using red colouring

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:48.839
just add as much as you want to your desired colour

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.199
then get the little palette knife

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.590
and you want to use

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.450
the case to help you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.239
spread on the actual icing itself

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.509
so you just move that around, I might put a little bit more on there, good to be a little bit

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:02.290
generous

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.869
and again move the case around

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:07.359
not your palette knife

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.749
so you do that

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.889
this is when you rotate the case in your hand

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.819
and then use the palette knife

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.299
just to smooth it off

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.209
a little bit like so

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.889
and to cover it all

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.020
and then at the end you can just go back over it

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.139
until you are happy

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.419
so there you go, we've got three different ideas
using butter cream icing

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.659
the fourth technique is to use ready-made
icing

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.259
that you just roll out between two pieces of cling wrap

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.749
like I've done here

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:44.059
put the icing on top and then put another piece of cling wrap on top of that

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.290
and then what you do is you roll it out to your desired thickness 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.019
and then it saves any mess on the work surface

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.889
so I've chosen to use black and yellow, bit of a
bumblebee theme

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.349
and what you want to do is take the fairy cake you want to decorate

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.840
I'm going to use some cutters, I've got some round ones 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.789
and some star ones

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.039
you just want to make sure you get a
cutter

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.989
the right size to fit just inside the
case itself

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.250
so i think I'm going to do a black disc first of all

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.639
this is great, you can get kids to help you

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.169
get them to roll it out, they can use the cutters et cetera

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.989
and you can help them to put it on top

00:04:22.989 --> 00:04:26.610
now you don't need to have anything to
stick it on there

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.789
so position it on like that

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.940
and then this is where you can have lots of
fun

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.250
you can use maybe

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.569
the star cutter with the yellow

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.569
and again

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.399
we can just position that on the top

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.860
like so

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.560
and you can see how simple it is to make
a really striking design straight away

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.610
I'm just going to finish mine off

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.319
with a little round

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.209
black circle

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.649
so there's a whole host of ideas you can do

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:58.319
the ones I've done with butter cream icing

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.199
you can use any toppings

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.410
we've got little chocolate sprinkles here,
some coloured balls, mini marshmallows

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.500
I think I'm going to put a few chocolate sprinkles on there

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.810
just to jazz that up a bit

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.009
and maybe some pink and white little
marshmallows

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.580
on top of there

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.020
might just put them in the center

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.409
but again have as much fun as you like, kids love dipping into this

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.530
and sprinkling them over

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.160
you see, mess everywhere, that's what we love

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.159
and there you've got some pretty little ideas

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.640
you've even got some sweets here that you can buy

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.639
and you can pop those on as well

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.419
so over here we've just got a little selection of what we've done, and there you go, as easy as that!
