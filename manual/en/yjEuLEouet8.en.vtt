00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.452
Leopard print panels are an exciting addition to your hair wardrobe.

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:18.891
In order to make your leopard panels, you're first 
 going to need to prepare your wefted hair.

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:23.537
In order to prep your wefted hair, you'll need a clarifying shampoo.

00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:25.725
And if you're using a cuticle hair,

00:00:26.098 --> 00:00:27.980
which means that it has the cuticle intact,

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.701
you're going to want to add some hair color developer in with your clarifier.

00:00:33.527 --> 00:00:36.000
Once your hair has been clarified

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:37.200
and blow dried,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.135
you need to make sure that it's nice and 
 straight, so go ahead and flat iron it.

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:45.486
And that'll ensure that all of your strands are nice and tight together.

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.481
So that your print will come our really clean.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:51.822
We're just going to comb this into place.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.680
And then we're going to secure the weft down to our work surface.

00:00:56.513 --> 00:00:59.104
To secure the hair, we're using scotch tape.

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.438
And we're just going to put it right across the top.

00:01:06.373 --> 00:01:08.130
And then, we're going to take another piece

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.844
and we're going to do that across the bottom.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.316
Next, we're going to be painting in

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:29.529
our black spots

00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:30.898
as part of the print.

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:37.429
We're using small, artist paint brushes for this.

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.670
And we're just going to start by creating some spots.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.940
You want to be fairly generous with your color so 
 that you can put it where you want it.

00:01:47.202 --> 00:01:51.840
It's really important that you're making sure that you're painting in 
 the direction of the hair and not going backwards.

00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:55.750
You don't want to travel up or it's going 
 to actually pull that hair away from your

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.840
tape that's securing it.

00:02:02.528 --> 00:02:05.480
So, when you do leopard spots, a lot of them are done

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:08.740
as a semi-circle

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:13.680
with a spot adjacent to it, or a couple extra spots.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.130
But you want to leave a fairly generous portion in the middle

00:02:17.307 --> 00:02:19.260
so that you can add your secondary color.

00:02:26.582 --> 00:02:32.050
So for this one you can see I've left this kind of central area 
 open to put my other color in, and this one I've got

00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.330
this open to put my color in there.

00:02:34.992 --> 00:02:38.460
Sometimes there's some random spots that are just black spots

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:40.800
so we'll go ahead and add a couple of those in as well.

00:02:48.338 --> 00:02:54.940
And we're just going to keep painting until we 
 have made this entire area full of spots.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.610
The next step is to add in your secondary color.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.270
And this goes internal to the spots.

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:04.920
And we're just going to dab that into place.

00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:11.880
You don't want to paint it down too much because we 
 want your original color to stay where it is.

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:13.060
So we're just going to

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:16.100
blot that right on in there.

00:03:17.503 --> 00:03:22.200
For this panel, just so you know, we are using a blue-black

00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:25.260
and a 5RR color.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:31.630
So the reddish will come out to be kind of a darker red-brown

00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.880
and the spots should be close to a blue-black.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.280
And we're just going to continue blotting this red color into place

00:03:40.684 --> 00:03:43.960
until we have completed all of our spots.

00:03:44.738 --> 00:03:46.890
We're just going to let that set until it's dry.

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:49.560
And when it's dry, then we're ready to rinse.

00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:56.140
In order to rinse it, we're going to fill up a basin full 
 of water and we're going to add a bit of distilled vinegar.

00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:58.240
The vinegar is going to help so that

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:04.230
your cuticle on your extension hair stays nice and tight and 
 shuts so that your color doesn't bleed or move around.

00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:06.860
You're just going to blot that in the sink

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:08.830
rinse it, blow dry it

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:13.140
and then once it's dried, you'll have a nice, printed leopard panel.

00:04:14.304 --> 00:04:16.320
In order to wear your leopard print panels

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.850
you can add weaving clips to the top

00:04:18.987 --> 00:04:21.040
or you can simply pin them into place.
