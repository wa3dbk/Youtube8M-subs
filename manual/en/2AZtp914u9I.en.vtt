00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.935
1, 2, 3!
Good job! [whistle]

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:07.040
THESE CADETS ARE TRAINING TO
BECOME TEXAS STATE GAME WARDENS.

00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:10.075
Help! Somebody help!
[splash]

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:13.495
UNTIL RECENTLY, THE GAME
WARDEN ACADEMY WAS HEADQUARTERED

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:16.278
IN A CONVERTED WAREHOUSE IN
DOWNTOWN AUSTIN.

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:17.316
Fire!

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:21.543
CADETS HAD TO TRAVEL OFFSITE
FOR SPECIALIZED TRAINING.

00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:24.545
BUT NOW, THANKS TO A 
PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP,

00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:27.626
TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE HAS
BROKEN GROUND ON A NEW

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:31.531
STATE-OF-THE-ART TRAINING CENTER
IN RURAL HAMILTON COUNTY.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.901
1, 2, 3!
[applause]

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.425
THE 220 ACRE SITE WILL
FEATURE A FIRING RANGE,

00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:41.355
[shots]
Cease fire! Cease fire!

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:43.858
AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE 
OPERATIONS COURSE,

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:46.011
AND OTHER SPECIALIZED 
TRAINING FACILITIES,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.511
Go, go, go, go!

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.950
SAVING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
IN TRAVEL TIME.

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:54.386
We really are an off-the-
pavement law enforcement group

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:56.310
and so it makes sense to
be out in the country

00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:58.725
and to have everything on
one site.

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:01.995
We’ve had the support from 
many private philanthropists

00:01:02.063 --> 00:01:04.596
who understand just how 
important our game wardens are

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.633
with helping to conserve our 
rich natural heritage.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.033
They are out there literally 
every day and night

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:12.738
putting their lives on the line 
for our fish and wildlife

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:16.026
and our lands and waters, our 
property and sometimes our lives

00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:18.963
TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE HAS
BEGUN CONSTRUCTION

00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:21.380
ON THE FIRST PHASE OF
THE NEW ACADEMY.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.548
We have an ambitious goal.

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:25.551
We started with a $20 million 
vision so we're halfway there

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.755
thanks to the generosity of 
several major donors.

00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:31.558
And so now we’re going to
head into the second phase

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:34.023
and we’re doing all we can 
to raise that next $10 million.

00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:36.563
...working together with our 
constiuency, our supporters...

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.653
CADETS BEGAN TRAINING AT
THE NEW SITE LAST FALL.

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.568
Mind if I see your 
driver’s license

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:43.031
and fishing license, please?

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.373
It gives you first-hand 
experience as close as practical

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:47.973
to what we’re going to 
find out in the field.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.775
I mean, this is the bread and 
butter of our job.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.941
What we’re going to do is 
making contact with the public

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.111
while they’re 
hunting or fishing.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.115
…you know, make sure they 
know who you are.

00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:57.316
Nice country atmosphere. We've
got lots of room.

00:01:57.385 --> 00:01:59.651
We can move around to 
different spots.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.951
It’s a whole lot better than 
being in downtown Austin.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.223
It’s a lot more 
realistic out here.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.726
1, 2 and 3.
[camera clicks]

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:09.895
FOR TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE,
THIS IS LYDIA SALDANA.
