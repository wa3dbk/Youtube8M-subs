FIFA MANAGER 11

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
LEVEL SYSTEM

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
New Level System is a big improvement in FIFA Manager 11. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Up to now, player level depended only on

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
his skills’ level which entailed various problems with general evaluation.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The first thing that the player should had to be on high level

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
was having certain skills

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
on high level e.g strong player

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
despite having poor heading skill, should have been evaluated high 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to keep general evaluation on level 92,95. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The second thing such level system was leading to, was fact that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
all players were having similar form e.g. in Bundesliga 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we had a situation that players were on 70-85 level

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which was leading to a situation that in 3D mode these players were behaving similarly. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That’s why we decided to create the new level system

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
it caused that current level is more precisely worked out in 0-99 scale

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and now the differences between players can be more clearly noticed. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The system rule is that the position level counts 70% of the overall level

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and the ability level counts 30%. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
At this moment we can say that e.g. the player, despite having poor heading skills

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is strong enough to be able to play as a striker and achieve 95 level after all. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is a really big improvement, which leads to situation that every position can be 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
precisely evaluated e.g. left defender has the same level playing as right defender,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
however when we change his position on the pitch, a realistic change will follow

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in contrast to previous situation, when the player was loosing e.g. 50 points. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That was obviously too rapid and unrealistic, that’s why we have eliminated that. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The third thing we have changed is experience. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Up to now, the experience was playing the role of second importance

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and it wasn’t noticeable what was really evaluated. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, we can precisely evaluate player experience in the game editor 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which immediately impacts his level, 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is a big advantage for older players. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
When we have experienced player in our team, we gain 3 bonus points, 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
whereas young and inexperienced player gives us -4 penalty. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Then we realize that 7 points of difference is significant

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
thus it’s worth buying 2-3 older players,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
who are profitable for us despite they develops slowly 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and after a year or two we can replace them with younger players.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
