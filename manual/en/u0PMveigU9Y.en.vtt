00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.884
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.080
Games reach across generations,
cultures, and even civilizations,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.120
to give people a shared experience.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.140
Whether it's a challenging game of
chess, a friendly game of cards,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.720
or a simple game of peekaboo with
a baby, games are all around us.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.950
No matter where you find yourself, or
in what type of group, there's a game

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.370
you can play.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.020
Alone, there are a wide
variety of solitary games.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.230
For large groups, there are party games.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.260
There are board games to play
inside, ball games to play outside,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.410
and travel games to
play while in motion.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.280
There are games of
skill and games of luck.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.071
There are games that depend on
physical ability and mental ability,

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.640
and many that depend on both.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.130
There are games older than
recorded history and games

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.550
impossible to play without modern
devices such as computers, tablets,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.890
and mobile phones.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.380
Just as playing games is a common
activity, so is designing them.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.550
Ever altered rules for a round
of tag or a bit of hide and seek?

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.607
Introduced house rules
for a hand of poker?

00:00:56.607 --> 00:00:58.065
Then you've dabbled in game design.

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:02.712
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.580
I'm Eric Klopfer.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.580
I'm a professor of education at MIT,
where I run the Scheller Teacher

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.170
Education program and
the Education Arcade.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.190
I'm also a host for this
course, introduction

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.120
to Game Design Development, the
second in MIT's Ed Tech XSeries.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.940
This course aims to
give people with little

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.580
or no familiarity with
formal game design methods

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.166
an introduction to the skills game
designers use to create new games.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.290
Some familiarity with games
and an interest in them

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.850
is strongly recommended.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.020
We'll cover the basic elements of
games, demonstrate game analysis,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.450
and talk about
prototyping and iteration.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.770
Assignments will center around
using these methods to create games

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.940
and reporting back to your peers
on the experience of game creation.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.240
Learning game design is
a hands on experience.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.221
You have to do it to learn it,
then reflect on what you've done.

00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:52.970
The design assignments
in this course will

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.440
cover both physical and digital games.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.050
The digital assignments will use
game blocks, MIT's own blocks

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.452
based game building tool.

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:02.160
You don't need any
programming experience

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.890
to participate in this course.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.570
Whether you like to play games,
have a game project in mind,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.460
or have an interest
in how games are made,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.729
join us at "Introduction to
Game Design Development."

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.562
We look forward to
seeing you in the course.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.010
Oh.
