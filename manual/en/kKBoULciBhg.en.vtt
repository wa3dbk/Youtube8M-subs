Hey everyone, Welcome back! 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.740
Thanks for joining me for this week's new segment called,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.140
Get Out of My House!

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.040
So my hubby and I went out on a spring shopping spring, which was so much fun because we got to get all of our old clothes out of our closet, get our new ones in. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.620
All we needed to do is get them out of our home!

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.240
Uh-oh!

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.920
That's where I see a lot of breakdown habit of people.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.640
People are willing to eliminate their clothes and their items but they often get bug down in getting them out of the house

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.120
and taking them to a specific organization or a place or to a person.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.340
Nothing wrong with that,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.840
great intentions in fact!

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.340
I mean, wouldn't it be great to take all your old suits to a place that helps abused women to get back on their feet.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.780
Wouldn't it be great to bring your old toys to a place that helps single moms?

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.880
These are all great intentions, but if they don't really ever get anywhere, they usually just end up being clutter back into your house again.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.160
And my Grandma would say,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.040
Get Out of My House!

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.940
So what's the solution? 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360
First things first;

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.020
Get everything that you're willing to get rid of immediately into the trunk of your car

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.880
or put it by somewhere that's really not gonna disturb your routine like at your front door,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.240
something that you'd literally trip over, the spot would make you get it out of your home.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.380
Second,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.100
Give yourself a time limit.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.800
I suggest 1 week.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.180
And if your items haven't gotten into the specific places that you want them to go,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.100
 just donate everything to one place;

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.040
like a salvation army, or goodwill, a church, a school.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.800
Need to feel good about the fact that you're giving yourself a way even if isn't to exactly the place that you want to be.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.680
You're not only helping the person that will inherit or buy those items

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.740
but you're also helping the people that worth of that specific organization or place.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.680
So give yourself credit for generously helping anybody who's involve in this organizations. 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.240
Think about it this way: 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.100
In an effort to simplify your life by getting all those clutter out of your house,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.620
you can actually be over complicating it by trying to follow to all different locations all over town. 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.460
Okay so that wraps up todays segment! 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.660
Get Out of My House!

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.920
Let me know if these help motivate you, getting yourself out of your house and to the place it needs to go.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.140
I'd love to hear from you.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.380
Until next time,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.380
stay happy and organized!

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.240
BYE!
