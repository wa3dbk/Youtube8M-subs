00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.670
“Plastic Food” is an invitation to producers
and consumers to develop an eco-conscious

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.689
attitude regarding the production of waste,

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.910
There are already eco-friendly packaging that
could substantially reduce the use of plastic,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.309
with a consequent reduction in the use of
a valuable resource such as oil.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.870
The installation of the artwork “Plastic
Food” in the park are what we must avoid

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.259
at all costs to have a better future for us
and for our children.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.970
Living surrounded by waste is becoming more
and more natural,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.710
but what actually happens in nature is a life
cycle that is repeated endlessly without creating

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.960
waste.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.610
This is the objective that man should reach
in order to rediscover the true essence of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.950
everyday life.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.000
We need to change the style of living for
a better future.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.050
Plastic food is alive thanks to the continued
contamination of artists from around the world.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.320
Plastic Food
This is the last of a series of installations

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.809
that begins in 2000, and all characterized
from the using of plastic materials.

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:45.130
Potsy is convinced that people live an unpaid
love with the same plastic that has become

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.380
marvellous and irreplaceable.

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:05.309
This artwork is nothing more than an invitation
to make a walk trough a landscape that is

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.590
futuristic and present at the same time.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.740
This artwork come from a very easy consideration,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.220
we must reduce our production of rubbish.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.939
It is what we will live,

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.409
what we expect and that unfortunately is past
and present at the same time in other regions.

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.579
We survive in a society that cannibalizes
certainties and that is trying in anyway to

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.159
be a substitute against the natural evolution
of simple living things.

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.819
Our society has transformed plant- eater into
carnivores,

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.790
following a perverse profit logic,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.400
the same that at the and will rebound on us.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.999
Nature is frustrated and it is imploding,
we can see it everyday with new pandemic and

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:05.769
catastrophic events.

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:06.769
Walking through Potsy’s installation will
thrust you into a snapshot with which you

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.210
can understand how can be unnatural
walking through our daily waste.
