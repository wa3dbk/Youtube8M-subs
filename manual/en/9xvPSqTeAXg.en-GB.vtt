Hey guys!

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:13.380
I'm gonna show my weapons quickly today

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.940
Of course, this is my major weapon shocky RED

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.900
The third augment is biosynthesis, but some ppl prefer pierce or adaptive sometimes

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.340
Rate of Fire is 10 rps! so this freak fires 10 times in 1 sec, which also mean 1 fires every 0.1 sec

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.640
Then reload time is 0.1 sec either! So u may realize there is no reload time! thats cool!

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.200
I uploaded how get this sick wep

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.760
I haven't got full level for the last augment yet but still powerful!

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.540
every specs seems pretty awesome!

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.140
I got two mixmasters but pretty behind shocky and hornet, but still popular weapon

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.980
this one has pretty similar specs with Hornet. Useful to kill the boss

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.140
Very nice pierce even assault gun. Only bad thing is movement speed decrement

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.153
I have used when I got very low level, still remember was very good for killing a number of zombies.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.920
I have 3 strippers. You can compare this to another one. This is for major wep, the important thing is pierce !!

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.560
pierce gets much better performance than tenacious on the field.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.060
this is only for bosses. pretty awesome!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.680
I would try to upload comparison between those :)

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.800
pierce...:/

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:04.046
I used this until 70 level something!

00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:12.231
this is still sick relatively. The augments are not my chosen apparently :/

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.980
It can cover until 50 lvl or higher! I rekcon Hornet is second behind shocky

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.400
Oh... You guys may know the fact. HIKS is 2nd in terms of DPS

00:03:06.747 --> 00:03:14.660
But I extremely prefer hornet, not this!!!

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:24.600
because it is very hard to aiming! and only works well against boss due to low pierce

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.880
Rest of gears would be used for comparison or something.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.540
I really have no idea for this lol

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.175
Look at the ammo price!! That's too much!

00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:52.776
I wanna use this and compare with Hornet! I will try after hitting full upgrade my armors :)

00:04:02.164 --> 00:04:04.644
Rate of fire 15 without any augments!
