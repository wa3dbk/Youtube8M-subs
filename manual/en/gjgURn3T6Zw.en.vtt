00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.130
In 20 years, ASSA ABLOY

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.330
has gone through a remarkable
transformation. 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.369
From local, to global.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.810
From 4700, to 43,000 employees.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.540
From this... to this.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.170
As the world has changed, so have we.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.560
Evolving from a lock manufacturer in the
Nordics.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.989
To a world leader in total door opening
solutions.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.610
Today, ASSA ABLOY adds value and simplifies
the lives

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.840
of millions of people around the world.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.040
ASSA ABLOY was founded in 1994

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.600
when lock manufactures ASSA in Sweden
and Abloy in Finland

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.290
merged their operations.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.210
At that time, the product offering largely consisted
of mechanical locks.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.260
Twenty years and over 200 acquisitions
later

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.930
our portfolio is one of the most
comprehensive in the industry.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.050
Today we're offering intelligent
openings.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.030
Making people feel safe and secure in
simple and convenient ways.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.479
The way we open doors and identify
ourselves

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.479
is changing fast. 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.850
And innovation is the core of ASSA ABLOY. 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.950
And in 2013 ASSA ABLOY was ranked on Forbes'
list of the world's most innovative companies.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.110
And as the world evolves

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.930
and continues to transform, so do we.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.620
However, the mission stays the same: to bring
innovative solutions.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.630
Creating security, safety and convenience.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.090
By opening future doors.
