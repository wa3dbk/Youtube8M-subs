00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:11.160
There’s been a renaissance of sorts lately
in the large, luxurious body-on-frame SUV

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.240
segment with all-new or refreshed models debuting
from a number of manufacturers.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.850
But when it comes to the ultra-luxury faction,
this new Infiniti QX80 Limited raises the

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.380
bar – awash in fine leather and wood that’ll
have you seeing Bentley.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.189
2015-Infiniti-QX80-LimitedWhether it’s a
Lexus LX, Cadillac Escalade, or any other

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.020
luxo-utility of similar avoirdupois, not a
single one can match the styling grandeur

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.380
of the ornate QX80.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.469
Though it’s anything but reserved, I’ve
always appreciated Infiniti’s ability to

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.610
design a vehicle like this with a touch of
retro elegance, avoiding the boxy, butch look

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.610
of the others.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.710
And now for 2015, the QX80’s updated appearance
further harmonizes its brutish gracefulness

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.129
with a new front fascia, grille and LED lighting.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.030
But that’s not the headline, per se.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.329
Nope, that belongs to this new Limited Package
valued at $10,000.

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.130
When you check that box, every other one on
the order form automatically populates to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.570
generate one fully-loaded model with no options
other than color – of which 3 are exclusive

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.099
to the Limited, including this Mocha Almond.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:26.359
It’s only available with all-wheel drive,
and after a few nominal accessory add-ons

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.909
like the roof rail crossbars and illuminated
kick plates the sticker crosses $90 grand,

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.609
landing here at $91,245.

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:40.169
And when it says Limited it means it, with
this version virtually built to order with

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:43.020
dealers getting less than 1 per month.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.499
Any skepticism I had prior to taking delivery
immediately vanished as soon as I opened the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:49.499
door.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.189
This isn’t the typical mythomania propagated
by the auto industry – what you see here

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.770
is the real deal.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.979
The range of rich, earthy colors, silver accents
and real wood appointments is a feast for

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.639
the eyes and executed with a hand-crafted
level of quality.

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:11.409
This cabin truly is gorgeous with its Truffle
Brown semi-aniline leather and matte-finish

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:12.409
wood.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.580
And it feels and smells as authentic as it
looks.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.980
Sure, there are a few overlooked moments – such
as the lack of interior LED lighting, the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.980
absence of Blu-ray and the yesteryear central
gauge display – but all-in-all this is a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:04:44.120
QX80 worthy of the Limited badge.
