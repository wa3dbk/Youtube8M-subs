00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:36.800
Hi I'm Coach Collin Castellaw with Shot Mechanics.com
and today let's learn Steve Nash's signature

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.840
runner.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.180
So Steve Nash is by no means the most athletic
guard to ever enter the NBA I'm not even sure

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.399
he can dunk but what he does have is a series
of tricks and crafty moves that are awesome

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.250
especially when he gets around the basket
to finish.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.490
He is especially good at finishing off of
1 foot from around 15 feet before he gets

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.490
to the big men.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.199
The runner allows Steve Nash to keep him moving
away from the defender he just beat but also

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590
get up a shot before the bigs can block him.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.380
So here is the move.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.890
So this move is great for when you beat your
first defender but the second defender does

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.570
not fully commit to guarding you.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.900
This move works perfectly for undersized guards
who are looking to get the ball over a taller

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.900
help side defender.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.390
So to begin this move you need to somehow
beat your defender.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.640
In this case Steve Nash uses an awesome pump
fake to get his defender in the air.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.380
Next you want to read the help side defender.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.890
In this case the defender is kinda stuck in
no-mans land.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.790
Not fully committed to stopping Steve Nash
but you can tell he is thinking about it.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.450
The reason Steve Nash gets this shot so much
is because defenders are so worried about

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.650
his passing ability.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.580
So when the defender doesn't fully commit.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.220
Steve Nash plants off his left foot to begin
his runner.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.520
Like what you see so far?

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.240
S he's shooting notice how his elbow is perfectly
under the ball.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.830
Just like an normal jump shot this gives him
optimal control and makes it so he can't miss

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.830
left or right.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.220
A major reason most players miss the runner
is because their elbow points out causing

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.790
them to miss eith left or right.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.130
And the last key to the runner is the follow
through.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.370
Steve Nash always follows though just like
a normal jump shot.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.160
He finishes with his fingers to the floor
and his shooting hip, shoulder, and elbow

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.080
all perfectly align with the basket.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.540
Just like a normal jump shot pretend you are
putting your middle finger inside of the hoop.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.170
So remember the keys to the runner.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.069
Beat your man and continue your momentum forward,
keep your elbow underneath the ball on the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.180
shot and hold that follow though just like
a normal jump shot.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.599
