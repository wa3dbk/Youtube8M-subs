[MUSIC]

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:15.780
I'm Niraj Desai, I'm a transplant surgeon
here at Johns Hopkins, in the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.847
department of surgery, and I'm the
director

00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:20.079
of the kidney and pancreas transplant
program.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:24.144
[MUSIC]

00:00:24.144 --> 00:00:30.478
The pancreas transplant operation is done
through an abdominal mid-line incision.

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:34.370
And that is an up and down incision on the
abdomen.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.400
We connect the artery and the vein that
both supply the

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.300
blood to the pancreas and return the blood
back to the body.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.900
And then once we allow the blood flow into
the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.680
pancreas, we have to connect a small piece
of intestine

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.990
that comes with the pancreas organ to the
patient's intestine

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.580
to allow drainage of the excrement
material into the patients body.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.610
Previously, people would connect that to
the bladder, but we really don't do that

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.430
procedure anymore, because the patients
tolerate it

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.310
being connected to the intestines much
better.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.938
It, it's not associated with long-term

00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:17.165
complications like connecting it to the
bladders.

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.982
[MUSIC]

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:24.654
The combined kidney and pancreas
transplant operation

00:01:24.654 --> 00:01:27.462
is done through an abdominal mid line
incision

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:31.600
and we, and that is an incision that runs
up and down on the abdomen.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.844
And we place the kidney and the pancreas

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:37.950
in, almost like two different operations
in the abdomen.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.440
Typically, we'll put the kidney in first,
allow the blood

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.810
flow back into the kidney and let it start
working.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.540
And then in a separate location, but

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.470
through the same incision put the pancreas
in.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.280
So the patient wakes up having had two
operations done on the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.390
inside, but through one incision and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.000
both organs are hopefully functioning
immediately.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.260
They're making urine.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.824
The creatinine is coming down, reflecting
kidney function and

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:08.434
the pancreas is making insulin and the
glucoses become normal.

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:13.345
[MUSIC]

00:02:13.345 --> 00:02:16.545
Pancreas after kidney, transplant
operations, would

00:02:16.545 --> 00:02:19.041
be two separate operations, done through
two

00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:22.241
different incisions, two different
hospital stays and,

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:25.160
of course, two, independent recoveries as
well.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.729
[MUSIC]

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:33.117
With the pancreas transplant alone, the
quality of

00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:37.993
life is primarily focused upon normalizing
someone's glucose control.

00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:43.025
Patients who are typically undergoing a
pancreas-alone transplant have a very

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:45.467
difficult quality of life from extreme

00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:48.800
difficulties in controlling their blood
sugars.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.110
So they'll run from being very low and
having hypoglycemia, which can lead to,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.590
passing out, or seizures, having to call
for emergency help, problems like that.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.980
And then, alternatively, swings toward the
high end, where they end up with very

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.790
high glucoses, and have to end up

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.130
being hospitalized for control of their
diabetes.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.290
When the pancreas is successful, all of
their glucoses should become normal, and

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.190
they avoid both the lows and the highs and
have excellent glucose control.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.004
Long term the advantage of that is that
complications from diabetes, what

00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:34.615
we refer to as secondary complications are
either reversed or minimized.

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:38.846
[MUSIC]

00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:43.044
Quality of life after the combined
procedure is fantastic.

00:03:43.044 --> 00:03:46.599
These individuals come in with two
problems, kidney

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.364
failure or most of the time on dialysis
and

00:03:49.364 --> 00:03:51.971
a very long period of time of having been

00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:54.420
diabetic, taking insulin, having

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.810
difficulties with controlling their
glucoses.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.190
And after the single operation, both of

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.590
those problems are fixed, so they feel
fantastic.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.440
They're no longer on dialysis or impending
about to go on.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.660
They no longer have to take insulin and
having

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.690
swings in their blood sugars and having
normal control.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.666
So we fix the kidney problem, we fix their
diabetes, and

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:19.273
when this works well it is an outstanding
result for the individual.

00:04:19.273 --> 00:04:24.398
[MUSIC]

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:28.193
So individuals that receive a pancreas
transplant can expect the

00:04:28.193 --> 00:04:31.510
organ to often last for 10 years or more,
on average.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.477
It is a very durable therapy.

00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:37.767
It is able to function for many, many
years when the

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:42.709
patient is compliant and especially when
early rejection episodes are avoided.

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:47.551
[MUSIC]

00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:54.676
Even from a deceased donor, the combined
operation it is probably mostly a function

00:04:54.676 --> 00:05:01.453
of us being able to monitor the kidney, to
pick up on problems related to rejection.

00:05:01.453 --> 00:05:03.693
It's hard to track rejection of the
pancreas,

00:05:03.693 --> 00:05:06.860
whereas it's easier to track rejection of
the kidney.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.572
So if you have both organs in, you can
follow the kidney quite easily and know

00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:13.530
that there's a trouble and increase the
immunosuppression

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.503
if there's rejection, and treat both, in
both organs.

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:20.628
It tends to correlate, so if you're having
rejection in the kidney, you're typically

00:05:20.628 --> 00:05:22.828
having rejection in the pancreas, and
that's

00:05:22.828 --> 00:05:25.088
at least an 80% correlation for those two.

00:05:25.088 --> 00:05:29.982
[MUSIC]

00:05:29.982 --> 00:05:33.687
So initially after the operation is done,
patients spend at least a

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:37.208
week in the hospital and often a couple of
weeks in the hospital.

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:41.212
Once someone goes home, they are getting
labs drawn

00:05:41.212 --> 00:05:44.579
twice a week usually close to home and
coming

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:48.219
back for outpatient visits on a weekly
basis and

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.667
then every other week and then once a
month.

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:54.479
And for the first couple of months,
they're

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.822
back here for out patient visits fairly
frequently.

00:05:57.822 --> 00:06:03.218
But once times goes on, they're able to
just follow up every three months, but

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:05.954
still getting labs twice a week, then once

00:06:05.954 --> 00:06:08.984
a week, every other week, and then
monthly.

00:06:08.984 --> 00:06:12.355
[MUSIC]

00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:17.155
So long term follow up which I would say
is after the first year, patients are

00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:19.855
seen once every three months in a doctor's

00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:23.249
office appointment and get labs drawn once
a month.

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:29.418
[MUSIC]

00:06:29.418 --> 00:06:34.619
Patients come to Hopkins to look into a
pancreas transplant for several reasons.

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:36.599
One, there's a big team of people here

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:40.200
that are dedicated to taking care of
transplant patients.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.821
The expertise that these individuals bring
is fantastic for

00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.862
this patient population, and this includes
surgeons, medical physicians,

00:06:48.862 --> 00:06:53.264
nurse coordinators, nurse practitioners,
everyone together has had a

00:06:53.264 --> 00:06:57.199
lot of experience taking care of pancreas
transplant patients.

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.189
And as a result that collective experience
is great for

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:05.046
helping someone through the operative
procedure, and the post-operative recover.

00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:09.316
The second reason that patients come to
Hopkins, to look into a pancreas

00:07:09.316 --> 00:07:14.616
transplant is the experience that we have
with taking care of sensitized patients.

00:07:14.616 --> 00:07:17.388
These are individuals that have antibody
in their

00:07:17.388 --> 00:07:20.622
bloodstream, or often difficult to
transplant, and the

00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:22.998
experience that has been gained in both
the

00:07:22.998 --> 00:07:27.090
kidney and pancreas transplant populations
that have antibody that

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.380
makes transplantation difficult, draws
individuals here looking for

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.954
a chance at transplant when they haven't
been

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:36.858
able to get that opportunity elsewhere,
because of

00:07:36.858 --> 00:07:40.296
these sensitization events they have
undergone in the past.

00:07:40.296 --> 00:07:49.153
