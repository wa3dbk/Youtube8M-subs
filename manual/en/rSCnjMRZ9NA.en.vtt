My name is Jacqueline Bush and I'm an editorial
in celebrity hairstyles.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.270
My clientele has included Faith Hill, Mark
Ruffalo, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.370
Jane Krakowski.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.680
I want to be able to show you that hair isn't
as intimidating or as hard as you think it

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.529
is and I want you be able to have fun with
it and do what your vision is with your hair.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.500
Alright, so now I'm going to show you how
to do a messy ponytail.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.850
She already has enough texture, her hair is
not too soft, it's not too dry.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.920
I'm just messing with it right now just to
give it a little extra body.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.389
A little extra volume.

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:45.539
And then we're just going to take it, I'm
taking with my hands, because that's the difference

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.690
between something looking more undone and
something looking more done.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.749
Because we want to do it messy, we're just
going to use our fingers.

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:59.839
I'm going to leave out the front of her hair.

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.389
So right now what I'm doing is I'm just combing
out, smoothing out a little bit.

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:08.110
I'm going to take the bulk of her hair in
my hands, make sure the sides are where I

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.720
want it, and that the top is where I want
it.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.190
Once I have that in place, I'm going to take
something called a bungee cord.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.680
A bungee cord has two hooks on either end;
it's just exactly what it sounds like.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:29.530
We're going to hook one hook on one side of
her head, we're going to wrap it around, wrap

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.380
it around again, and I'm going to cross it
over.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.370
Now, for this one you don't necessarily have
to use a bungee.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.440
I like using them because it gives me more
control, but because it's a messy ponytail

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.480
it doesn't have to be super polished, it's
OK.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.300
So you have two options with this: you can
tease the bottom -giving it a little bit more

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.560
undone look- you can call it quits there,
or you can do our little hair wrap trick,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.560
which is taking a section of the hair from
the bottom, teasing it -It already has a lot

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.620
of spray so I'm not going to spray it- smoothing
out the top, still with a little teasing.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.400
We're going to wrap it around once, twice,
one more time because she's got a lot of hair.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.700
We're going to secure it with a pin.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.530
Now that we've got that in there, we have
two options: you can pull the bangs back,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.730
you can secure it with a pin here, or you
can leave them down, but we're going to secure

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.099
them with a pin because I've already shown
you a couple of different looks with her bangs

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.639
down.

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:54.621
And now, to get the rest of that messy texture,
it's all about just piecing it out, and I

00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:59.129
like to use a little hairspray on my fingertips.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:07.730
It gives my hands enough grip.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:18.639
I'm just spraying the parts that just need
a little extra security, not all over, because

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.139
remember you want it to be undone.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.849
And that's how you do a messy ponytail!
