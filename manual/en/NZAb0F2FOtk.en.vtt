00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.069
Just the end of proceedings now and Umar Akmal
has played well in the end.

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.189
Just gone quickly in these last two overs.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.050
Scores are levelled, Pakistan need 1 to win.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:28.240
Series 2-1, one to go. Well played Pakistan!

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.830
Umar Akmal, just knocks the ball into the
leg-side.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.920
It'll just be a single.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.051
They've done the job, they've done the business.

00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:43.500
They've come back strongly, Pakistan. England
tossing the first two games but Pakistan here

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.560
at The Oval with one to play,
it's 2-1, interesting!

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.770
Well, well done indeed to Pakistan and to
this pair whose just seen it through them.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.860
Two young men, Umar Akmal playing there, 20
year old and Mohammad Amir, the 18 year old.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.690
And they're very much part of Pakistan's future.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.350
And what was absolutely crucial to Pakistan
in this match was to come back and win the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.350
game.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.350
Because of the first two defeats, and big
defeats they were, in the opening two Test

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.350
matches of this series.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.110
Many people would've written them off.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.900
And it has been out of conjunction completely.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.851
But that makes it 2-1 in the series.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:31.090
That means that they have the target to go
to Lord's next week, win there as well and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.159
atleast square the series.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.230
They know they can't win the series.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.560
And but the challenge has been laid down to
England.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.630
Well done!Indeed, these two young men whose
seen it through.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.020
Well it's meant also that Mohammad Yousuf
coming back into the team has given them great

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.020
stability.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.780
Allowed young players to play and express
themselves, they've come back strongly.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.490
If our two bowlers who've taken 5 wickets
in this game, but it's been a splendid effort

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.490
by pakistan.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.390
Bit of a wobble there in the end, chasing
down 148 and losing 6 wickets.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.560
But they'll be happy they've got a week to
get themselves ready for England again at

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
Lord's.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.310
It'll be special.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.670
Good result too for Salman Butt,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.030
Pakistan's captain... he drew the series with
Australia.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.900
That was when all came back to square the
series in his first test match as captain.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.980
That was important to him, all credit to him.
