00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:03.728
Hi, I'm Ross Scott, the creator
of Freeman's Mind.

00:00:03.728 --> 00:00:08.332
For a long time now, I've seen requests
to increase the resolution of the show.

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.224
My attitude about this has always
been: it's friggin' Half-Life!

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:16.025
This game is old enough, it doesn't
even need a 3D card to run.

00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:19.841
You're not missing lots of fine
little details at low resolution.

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:23.947
But, I keep getting requests for this
so I've decided to do something about it.

00:00:23.947 --> 00:00:27.873
Now, some of my audience has a short
attention span, so I'll keep this simple:

00:00:27.873 --> 00:00:31.217
send me money and I'll increase
the resolution to the show.

00:00:31.217 --> 00:00:33.574
The link is below. Got that?

00:00:33.574 --> 00:00:35.399
Okay! See ya later!

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.400
Don't forget the "money" part!
Bye!

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.191
Okay, now that I've lost about
half my audience,

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:49.685
the rest of you may want to know WHY
I need money for a higher resolution.

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:54.132
Well, it comes down to two things:
motion blur and the Source engine.

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:56.528
Let's start with motion blur.
What is it?

00:00:56.528 --> 00:01:00.306
Well, it's how our eyes perceive
real life things when they move.

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:04.466
I love this effect; it makes everything
look more fluid and real to me.

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:08.508
Here's the problem: Half-Life
does not support motion blur.

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:11.928
Half-Life: Source USED to not
support motion blur,

00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:16.081
now, it supports it in a really
passive-aggressive way

00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:22.216
that only works in certain situations
and the game won't export it to video natively.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:26.942
In fact, as of 2014, I don't think
any Valve game supports motion blur

00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:28.836
that's always on.

00:01:28.836 --> 00:01:32.222
Yet, I've been adding motion blur
to Freeman's Mind since the beginning.

00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:33.754
How have I done this?

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:36.825
Well, motion blur works
kind of like antialiasing.

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:39.154
It smoothes out and averages your image,

00:01:39.154 --> 00:01:43.184
except it's in the
(echo) FOURTH DIMENSION-sion-sion-sion...

00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:47.606
The way I've been adding blur to
a video is to add more frames.

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:50.531
Freeman's Mind plays at
30 frames per second

00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:54.190
but I record it at
180 frames per second.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.133
Then, I run a script that averages
the input and predicts motion vectors

00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:59.787
so it looks slick as hell.

00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:03.623
That way I don't have any frame-blended
ghosting. Nobody wants that.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.611
Now, I do NOT record this in real-time.

00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:11.191
If I did that, I would have
dropped frames. I HATE dropped frames.

00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:16.309
If you ever see this on one of my
videos, it's not me. It's probably YouTube.

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.114
But, one nice thing about the
Source engine is, if I record a demo,

00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:24.967
it will record my video at any frame rate
I want and won't drop anything.

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:28.007
The problem is, that method is
pretty damned slow.

00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:30.934
This is what Freeman's Mind
looks like when recording.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.306
Iiiiiittttt'sssss...
sssslllloooowwwwwww...

00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:37.192
Now, where things get REALLY slow,

00:02:37.192 --> 00:02:42.536
is not only am I recording at 180 frames
per second, but it's all uncompressed,

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:45.118
thanks to our friend, the Source engine.

00:02:45.118 --> 00:02:49.000
Now, the old copy of Half-Life:
Source DOES support video compression

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.033
using the AVI format, but it has a BIG
limitation in how large the videos can be.

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:57.577
So much so that I can't even use it.

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:00.839
Valve has not yet updated
their code to fix this,

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.489
even though the fix came out in... 1996.

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.262
But, hey, the Source engine is
based off the GoldSrc engine

00:03:08.262 --> 00:03:11.415
which is modified from
the Quake 1 engine.

00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:14.690
I've heard it called
the Tower of Duct Tape.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.393
In fact, even Source Filmmaker,

00:03:17.393 --> 00:03:23.470
which came out in 2012, STILL
has this limitation with AVI files.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.489
But, y'know, we're talking about Valvetime.

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.196
Sometimes bugs take more
than 18-years to fix.

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:33.755
Or, I could use Valve's new
nasty default compression

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.472
before it gets recompressed after editing

00:03:36.472 --> 00:03:39.362
then uploaded to YouTube where
it gets compressed again.

00:03:39.362 --> 00:03:41.393
I'm not a fan of this option, though,

00:03:41.393 --> 00:03:45.911
since I don't want the videos to look like
the camera's been smeared with Vaseline.

00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:50.785
So, that means to keep the quality up,
recording Freeman's Mind at a low resolution

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:54.922
takes up more space than a
normal 1080 high definition video

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:57.678
AND takes hours
just to process it all.

00:03:57.678 --> 00:04:01.013
Plus, the game holds my computer
hostage while it's recording.

00:04:01.013 --> 00:04:03.922
If I do anything else with it,
the recording is ruined.

00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:09.180
So, if I increase the resolution on
the show, this all gets exponentially worse.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.599
That's where you come in.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.874
I'm normally pretty
happy with my computer

00:04:12.874 --> 00:04:19.335
but recording uncompressed video
at 180 frames per second KICKS MY ASS!

00:04:19.335 --> 00:04:22.736
But, I can solve this problem
with the purchase of one part:

00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:26.488
an SSD (Solid State Drive).

00:04:26.488 --> 00:04:30.793
Right now, I use hard drives which
work kind of like a really fast DJ

00:04:30.793 --> 00:04:32.472
doing a drums and bass mix.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:36.146
But an SSD operates closer to
the speed of light.

00:04:36.146 --> 00:04:38.546
They just go, "ZIP-A-DEE-DOO-DAH!"
and they're done.

00:04:38.546 --> 00:04:40.739
Unfortunately, I need a big one.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:46.279
In order to bump Freeman's Mind
to 720 resolution and not lose MY mind,

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:49.841
I need at least a 500 gigabyte SSD.

00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:53.252
And, honestly, I'm scared to
push the 1080 resolution,

00:04:53.252 --> 00:04:56.657
because at that size, I would
need about a gigabyte of space

00:04:56.657 --> 00:04:58.964
for every SECOND of footage.

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:01.205
And that's BEFORE processing.

00:05:01.205 --> 00:05:08.443
Again, uncompressed video at 180
frames per second KICKS MY ASS!

00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:10.900
Now, before people send me deals on Newegg,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.729
I want to say that I
currently live in Poland

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.918
and computer parts are simply
more expensive here and taxed heavily,

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:20.892
so I'm going to need more money
than you might think.

00:05:20.892 --> 00:05:23.816
But, on the flipside, I don't
upgrade very often,

00:05:23.816 --> 00:05:27.928
and I can get a can of beans
here for about 60 cents!

00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:30.136
So, that's a pretty good tradeoff.

00:05:30.136 --> 00:05:33.213
So, that's my offer: send me
enough money for an SSD

00:05:33.213 --> 00:05:36.133
and I'll increase the
resolution of Freeman's Mind.

00:05:36.133 --> 00:05:41.790
If you send me MORE than that,
I'll use it for... more beans and rent,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.992
unless you guys have a better idea.

00:05:43.992 --> 00:05:48.202
Surviving in reality is a little
different than surviving in Half-Life.

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:50.711
But, hey, maybe you don't like giving to beggars

00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:54.377
because you're afraid they'll just
spend it on Mad Dog and lotto tickets.

00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:56.219
Not a problem!

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.438
If you want to just send me
parts directly, I'll take them!

00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:01.739
I can always use more disk space.

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:03.169
Send me anything.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.059
And, if I don't get the money, well,
guess what? I'll keep making videos.

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:10.945
But you're going to watch them
at 480p and YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT!

00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:14.804
Or, you can help me follow a
time-honored tradition

00:06:14.804 --> 00:06:18.234
of throwing computer hardware at
a software problem.

00:06:20.754 --> 00:06:24.200
