00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:09.610
So now it is a matter of putting my crank
arm on. So I've still got grease on the spindle.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:17.230
Otherwise, I'd just want to make sure that
it had grease on it. Make sure that things

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.640
are securely seated. I have all my plastics
loose. If you buy one of these chain guides,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.339
they come assembled like this. You just need
to loosen then. Not quite lined up. There

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:38.690
we go, I'm lined up. Pull the plastic so I'm
out of the way, and now torque on a crank

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:58.430
bolt. And as the cranks start to get more
seated, I'll be able to see if the spacing

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.989
is correct for the chain line on my bike.
What we'll want to look for is, now that this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:13.700
is tight, we're going to want to look to see
if the roller here lines up with the chain

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.600
ring. And lo and behold, it looks like they
are in the same plane. That's good. Got my

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.930
roller, got my chain ring lined up together.
My chain ring is also centered in the middle

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.080
of the plastics here. So that means that I
got my spacing correct. So now I'm just going

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:47.800
to finish by running the chain through the
chain guide and in no time flat, I will have

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.600
installed a little bit of piece of mind onto
my downhill bike because I can pedal this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.810
thing instead of just coast it down the hill.
