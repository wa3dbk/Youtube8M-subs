Hi, I'm Debrah DeMirza at Deluxe. It's a retail
clothing boutique in Eugene, Oregon. And today,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.260
I'm going to show you how to stretch out a
shrunken sweater, and usually that happens

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:20.440
with wool. So, what you need to do first is
dampen your wool sweater, and not get it sopping

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.400
wet. You want to dampen it and then, what
you want to do is stretch it. Now, sometimes

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.940
you'll have a sweater that fits great everywhere
else, but maybe it's too tight in certain

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.379
areas so you can spot stretch those areas.
And what I usually do, and what you want to

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.469
have is one free hand for your iron. You want
to set your iron on a high enough heat, but

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.190
not to burn your fabric. And so what you can
do; say you want to stretch out the bottom,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.480
and what I usually do is I use my body to
hold against it, and then I pull the fabric

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.149
with one hand, and while it's damp you can
just gently stretch the sweater, and gently

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:09.210
lay your iron on the sweater. And what it
does is it keeps your fabric stretched out

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.350
the way you have it. Now, if that's too difficult
what you can usually do too is you can use

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.960
some pins, straight pins, and you can just
adhere the side of the sweater to your ironing

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:31.680
board cover, and you can just do that in several
different places. And then you're using that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.730
so you still have a free hand. And then, when
you're using your iron you can pull, and then

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.350
you can iron it gently by just laying it on
top. Now, obviously some fabrics are going

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.130
to not look very nice if you don't use a pressing
cloth, or you might burn some of the fibers,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.600
so what you want to do is you can use a pressing
cloth if you have to keep your iron on for

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.190
any length of time. And usually you just do
it a few seconds, but that could be enough

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.590
to mess up your fabric, so I usually use a
a pressing cloth for almost everything. And

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.349
then, what you can do is keep checking it,
and again, like I said; now if you've stretched

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.730
it out too much you can re-dampen, or usually
it's still damp, so what you can do is just

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:28.510
kind of scrunch it back up, and then you can
pat it down while it's wet, and you can even

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.010
iron that back in by gently pressing down
on your iron, again, using a pressing cloth,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.760
and you'll notice that that goes back together
with wool. And that's how you can stretch

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.310
out a shrunken sweater.
