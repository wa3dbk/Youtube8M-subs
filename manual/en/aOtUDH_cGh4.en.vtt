00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.969
A typical day at Gorman Chairback Camps for
our guests could start of, of course, with

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.590
breakfast at the dining hall, after that packing
a trail lunch, and then heading out to a number

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.990
of different adventures that they could go
on.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.829
We have a lot of paddling opportunities right
here from our shore.

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.730
Long Pond has kind of a varied shore line,
and so there's a lot of coves and small beaches

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.399
and things like that to go explore.

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.860
There are also day hikes right in the area,
down toward Gulf Hagas or up to the Chairback

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.050
Range ridge.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900
And that's just to mention a few.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.940
We have some other trail networks where people
could go out for shorter adventures or there

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.499
are some long loops where they could take
all day if they choose.

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.449
The feature of the Gorman Chairback Camps
is obviously being located right on the water

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:53.640
here.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.460
It's a beautiful spot, it's a beautiful, clear,
cold-water lake.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.499
Great fishing and paddling opportunities right
here at your doorstep.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.100
The location of Gorman Chairback is perfect
either as a jumping-off point or as an ending

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.910
point to a lodge-to-lodge ski trip.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.719
We can arrange for different ways to run a
shuttle to do up to a four-night stay in different

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:17.719
camps.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.550
So it could be a great place to kick off your
trip, stay here at our facility, have a hot

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.799
meal, stay in the camp, then ski a short day
up to Little Lyford Lodge which is about 7

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.000
miles away, via ski trail.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.420
And depending on how long you want your trip
to go, there are another two camps that you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.920
can also link up, to bring you all the way
up to our north edge of the range, on the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.180
Roach Pond Tract, to our camp at Medawisla.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.119
It's a great place to come and get away from
it all.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.430
We're outside the touches of modern society.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.810
We're really out there and remote, and it's
a great place to come get back in touch with

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.469
nature, and also yourself.
