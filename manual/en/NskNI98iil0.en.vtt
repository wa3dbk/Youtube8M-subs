00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.600
 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.210
You might not think video games belong in a museum, but as time passes, it becomes totally clear that

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.639
these are not just a passing fad. Rather,

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.980
video games have become ubiquitous in our lives, and have as much potential to tell us about

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.480
our history and culture

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.710
as any other artifact, like Benjamin
Franklin's walking stick or Abraham

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.939
Lincoln's pocket watch.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.579
But the question is, what exactly are they telling us? What do video games say about American

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.149
 history?

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.940
(video game music)

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.940
 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.570
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.440
To help us answer this question, we're here
today with Drew Robarge, who is a museum

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.769
specialist in the Division of Medicine and
Science.

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.539
We're actually going to be taking a look at a game you've probably played before.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.780
I know I was doing it when I was in middle school: it's Tetris.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.239
The game Tetris comes from the Greek word for "four,"

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.710
and all seven shapes in the game

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.909
have four blocks. It was created in the Soviet Union in 1984

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.369
by Alexey Pajitnov.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.590
He created this game where he works, and distributed it to his other coworkers. They started playing it and obviously it's a huge time-waster for them.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.500
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.539
One person in the office sends the game 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.100
to his friend who programs in Hungary, and by happenstance,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.500
a person from England came and saw the game

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.710
and said, "We need to have it." And so this begins the long,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.799
difficult process of negotiating the rights to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.000
sell the game outside the Soviet Union.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.140
This was the first electronic software to be exported from the U.S.S.R.,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.250
so this is all new territory for the U.S.S.R.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.179
and so people didn't know who they had to negotiate with,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.369
who actually had the rights. Eventually

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.170
one person got the licensing rights to the Game Boy version, Henk Rogers.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.080
He saw the game at a consumer electronics show in 1988 and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.920
he thought, "Wow. This will be perfect to be played on the go."

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.349
You know, if you have five minutes, you have an hour, you can play it.

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.440
Tory: So this is a very early version of cell phone apps?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.209
Drew: Yes, this is before Angry Birds,

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.690
before Candy Crush. This is Tetris. And it's still very relevant today.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.090
You can still download it on any mobile phone.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.540
Tory: So this is really interesting, because obviously the culture that it's coming out of is clearly

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.980
still playing a really big role in

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.129
even as it comes to North America. So the story stays the same.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.659
Drew: Basically, they put a lot of the Russian &amp; Soviet elements into the game

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.540
to kind of set up this motion of 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.859
uniqueness and foreignness of the game. This comes from the Cold War.

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.650
Like, you're playing the first game that came out of Russia.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.329
Look how unique it is. But the thing is, you could package it 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.260
a different way and nobody would know the difference. But they really wanted to latch onto the Soviet story.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.689
This was a time when the Cold War

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.540
was not quite over yet. There were a lot of changes going on, but the Berlin Wall hadn't fallen

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.950
yet when this was all marketed. Tory: So it's really part of their advertising, it's really

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.400
capitalizing--for lack of a better word--on this

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.749
foreign policy tension/issue?

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.549
Drew: When you finish with enough points, you launch a

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.019
rocket. It's a reference to the space

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.329
competition. Depending on how many points you get,

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.969
if you meet the minimum then you launch a really small rocket.

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:47.969
If you get higher, then you launch the space shuttle.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.530
In the Game Boy version, the game had three types of music you could pick from.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.689
The most popular one was Type A,

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.030
that is an instrumental arrangement of a Russian folk song.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.450
That is so familiar to so many people. Now when people it, it's called "The Tetris Song."

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.980
I sometimes hum it in my head.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.209
For a lot games, 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.099
if it's still around a year after or still being talked about a year after,

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.479
that's a huge success--much less 30 years.

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.479
This was a game, first and foremost, so

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.229
it's just a vehicle for culture. People play it not because it's Russian or Soviet, but

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.610
because it's a fun game.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.880
Tory: Well cool, this is fascinating. I had absolutely no idea that I was engaging in some sort of long-term generational

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.970
cultural experiment by playing on my TI-83 [calculator].

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.030
Thank you so much for sharing these stories. This is really cool. 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.289
Thank you all for joining us again
today and we hope to see you next time.

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.289
 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.509
 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:50.790
 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.890
