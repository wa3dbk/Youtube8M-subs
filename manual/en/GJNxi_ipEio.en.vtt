00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.660
The Wood Chop With A Medicine Ball is just
a variation of the Wood Chop move. If your

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.290
curious about what else I've done with it,
just feel free to browse around and look for

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.230
the Wood Chop where there's sitting on the
ball, there's standing and how different,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.770
ah the different variations of the move so
that you can get, you don't get bored like

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.840
that, you know. So now I have a four-pound
ball. And I like to start lower and then work

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.990
my way up because sometimes with the heavier
ball, if you drop it, you can get hurt. Now,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.870
the idea here with the move is must start
from the feet up. Your feet are shoulder width

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.210
apart, toes slightly out, knees are slightly
bent and the hips are the most important.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.700
You want to make sure that you tuck those
hips, meaning hip bones are coming towards

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.130
your ribs. So it's like shortening the distance
here and abdominal area. Or like somebody's

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.390
pulling the front of your pants, you want
to take a look at your zipper, see if everything

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.309
is okay there, so that's the move right here.
Keep your abs tucked in, so sucking in that

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.920
abdominal wall or the belly button towards
the spine. Shoulders down and the chest is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.420
up and open. So make sure that when you're
doing this move, the shoulders don't want

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.850
to do this, especially if you have postural
issues that may want to happen. So be aware

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.630
of that. Now, when you're doing the twist,
just like you have an ax and you're chopping

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
wood, you're going to do the same thing with
the ball and you're going to come across the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.170
body. As I'm doing that, notice that my hips
are staying in front, my hips are not moving.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:40.240
I'm moving the upper body in going down across
like an ax. Going over and up and down. If

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.870
this bothers your shoulders, that's a sign
that something's going on, you can keep it

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.340
right here and not go so far low. What the
idea is to get that twist in there to work

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.020
in the middle of the body. Then you can go
ahead and take it to the other side, keeping

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.210
the belly button always steady facing front,
keeping that tucked. Before you know it, you'll

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.460
be very strong and hopefully you'll be coming
back for more. So see you soon.
