00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.909
Hello, this is Ron Paul with your weekly update
for May 16th.

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:10.700
On April 20th, after a year-long undercover
sting operation, armed federal agents acting

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.139
on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) raided the business of Pennsylvanian

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.640
Amish farmer Dan Allgyer to prevent him from
selling his unpasteurized milk to willing,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.749
fully-informed customers in Maryland. Federal
agents wasted a whole year and who knows how

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:37.190
many of our tax dollars posing as customers
in order to catch Allgyer committing the "crime"

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.899
of selling his milk. He was not tricking people
into buying it, he was not forcing people

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.699
to purchase it, and there had been no complaints
about his product. These were completely voluntary

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.809
transactions, but ones that our nanny-state
federal government did not approve of, and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.660
so they shut down his business. The arrogance
of the FDA and so many other federal agencies

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.820
is simply appalling. These types of police
state raids on peaceful businessmen, so reminiscent

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.490
of our tyrannical federal drug war, have no
place in a free society.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.490
The FDA claims its regulatory powers over
food safety give it the authority to ban the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.079
interstate sales of raw milk, but this is
an unconstitutional misapplication of the

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:34.259
commerce clause for legislative ends. As we
have seen, if the executive branch feels hamstrung

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.090
by the fact that our framers placed lawmaking
authority in the Legislative Branch, they

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.600
simply make their own laws and call them "regulations."
We all know how the Environmental Protection

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.790
Agency (EPA) uses such bogus regulation authority
to harass, hinder, and shut down countless

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.740
other legitimate businesses. Sadly, Congress
has been far too lax for far too long as the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.320
executive branch continues to encroach on
its areas of responsibility and thereby undermines

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.640
our system of government.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.910
Most Americans understand that if you don't
want to drink unpasteurized milk you simply

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.600
do not buy it. But the federal government
solution is pre-dawn raids which destroy the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.550
livelihoods of honest, hardworking families
in this time of continued economic hardship.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.830
I am outraged by this raid and the many others
like it, and that is why last week I introduced

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:40.400
HR 1830, a bill to allow the shipment and
distribution of unpasteurized milk and milk

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.350
products for human consumption across state
lines. This legislation removes the unconstitutional

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.730
restraint on farmers who wish to sell or otherwise
distribute, and people who wish to consume,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.030
unpasteurized milk and milk products.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.260
Many Americans have done their own research
and come to the conclusion that unpasteurized

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.300
milk is healthier than pasteurized milk. These
Americans have the right to consume these

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.110
products without having the federal government
second-guess their judgment or thwart their

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.700
wishes. If there are legitimate concerns about
the safety of unpasteurized milk, those concerns

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.200
should be addressed at the state and local
level.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.000
I am hoping my colleagues in the House will
join me in promoting individual rights, the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.720
original intent of the Constitution, and federalism
by cosponsoring this legislation to allow

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.940
the interstate shipment of unpasteurized milk
and milk products for human consumption.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.450
If we are not even free anymore to decide
something as basic as what we wish to eat

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.700
or drink, how much freedom do we really have
left?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.680
Thanks for calling this update. A new update
is placed on this number, 888-322-1414, every

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.960
Monday, the written text of which can be found
on my website www.house.gov/paul under the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.090
heading "Texas Straight Talk". Thanks for
calling.
