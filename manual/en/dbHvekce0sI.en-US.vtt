00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Hi everybody and welcome to our first tutorial

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.500
Today we will teach you how to shoot a perfect knuckleball

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.500
It won't take much time to find such tutorial on youtube

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.860
But today we're going to show you our technique

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.540
So, Let's GO!

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.000
First thing of any kick is run-up

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
To perform a knuckleball you need to stand in 3-5 steps

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.700
And you should stand in 35-45 degrees angle

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.740
Also a run-up is not so important as a kick itself

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.620
And its technique may differ

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.820
In our case we do all our steps on toes (or last 2 steps)

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.540
Next part of the run-up is the place of supporting foot

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.960
It must be placed in 15-20 cm from the ball

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.920
A little bit bended in ankle

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.300
Your toe must follow the direction of the kick

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.160
Now let's talk about the kick itself

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.080
The thing is to have less spin of the ball

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.300
In this case you have knuckleball effect

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.360
You have to hit a little bit lower the center of the ball

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.700
But not too much

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.200
If you kick too low the ball would go surely high

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.720
Or it would have backspin

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.040
In our opinion it is better to use the spot

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.440
between your instep and middle of ankle-joint

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.060
It is the most solid part of the foot

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.680
Also you should strain your foot as much as possible

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.660
For excluding relaxed foot

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.380
Try not to lean back while hitting the ball 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.720
Keep your body straight 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.520
Or slightly lean forward

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.820
It will help you to reduce ball spinning

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.160
Also it will help you to have more direction control of the ball

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.240
Now we will talk about very important part of the tutorial 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.620
It is the follow-through

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.920
Our goal is to have less spinning of the ball

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.180
Before hitting the ball you should slightly rotate your foot outwards

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.780
And to make it move distinctly to the direction of your strike

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.400
Nieghter left nor right

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.600
But the point is to make a max-quick move

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.040
And after that stop your leg immediately

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.080
You just have to feel this moment

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.540
At first you move your hip and shin

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.500
Then the hip stops, while your shin continues to move

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.080
Afterwards you stop the shin and make something like a slap

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.780
Sometimes it is easier to do it with a little hop

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.220
Try to work-out this movement without a ball

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.100
or in small distance to the goal

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.360
Finally we would like to tell some words about balls and football boots

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.320
There is no difference what cleats you choose

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.940
They only should be comefortable

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.720
We prefer to use original footballs (Adidas, Nike)

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.780
Like Adidas Speedcell, Europass, Teamgeist or Brazuca

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.440
These all are official match balls
