00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:01.769
In these examples, we want to identify

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:04.546
the fractions plotted on the number line.

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:05.779
Looking at the first number line,

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.299
you'll notice we have
zero here and one here,

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.537
and from zero to one is divided into,

00:00:10.537 --> 00:00:13.370
one, two, three, four equal pieces

00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:19.827
which means each tick mark represents 1/4.

00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:24.457
So starting at zero, this would be 1/4.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:28.624
This would be 2/4, which
does simplify to 1/2.

00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:32.314
This red point would be 3/4, the fraction

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:34.227
we're looking four, then here we have

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:37.913
4/4 which is equal to one.

00:00:37.913 --> 00:00:40.624
So for this problem, this red point

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.791
represents 3/4.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.895
Looking at the second
example, again notice

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:49.803
how we have zero here and one here,

00:00:49.803 --> 00:00:52.543
and then from zero to one is divided into

00:00:52.543 --> 00:00:55.876
one, two, three, four, five equal pieces

00:00:56.943 --> 00:01:01.737
which means each tick mark represents 1/5.

00:01:01.737 --> 00:01:06.559
So this would be 1/5,
2/5, so this red point

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:11.091
represents 3/5, and then we'd have 4/5,

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:15.258
and then this would be
5/5 which is equal to one.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:20.376
And then we'd have 6/5, 7/5 and so on.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.020
So the two fractions
plotted on this number line

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.187
are 3/5 and 7/5.

00:01:32.146 --> 00:01:34.757
Now it is true that 7/5
is an improper fraction.

00:01:34.757 --> 00:01:37.970
We could have written this as one and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.137
this would be 1/5 and 2/5, so one and 2/5.

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:44.931
But normally when we're
identifying fractions

00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:46.711
on the number line, we
haven't learned about

00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:49.079
mixed numbers yet, so 7/5 would be

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.262
the fraction part of the number line

00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:53.843
with this blue point,
and 1 and 2/5 would be

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:55.764
the mixed number part of the number line

00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:57.514
with this blue point.
