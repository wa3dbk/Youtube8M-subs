00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:07.875
It's not deep at all so...

00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:10.388
Hold on for a minute, guys.

00:00:10.388 --> 00:00:13.884
We're trying to make a call on how deep 
the waterfall is at the bottom.

00:00:21.612 --> 00:00:23.597
This place is too much!

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:28.368
Oh, my god!

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:34.504
Holy fucking shit!

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:37.141
Jesus!

00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:39.792
Dude, I'm scared to look, dude!

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:48.502
It's six in the morning.
Today is the big day.

00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:51.387
We're going to run Keyhole.
I hope nothing happens to me,

00:00:51.387 --> 00:00:54.872
that everybody's well 
and we get out of here alive and perfect.

00:01:02.657 --> 00:01:05.466
Once you get into that canyon,
the only way out

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.522
is this 40 meter waterfall,

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:11.234
with lots of water
and an unbelievable pool down below.

00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:14.887
I saw Gerd rowing on the waterfall,

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:19.334
he drove his oar
and the waterfall was bottomless.

00:01:19.334 --> 00:01:22.199
My oar sank under a meter in the water.

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:25.265
It didn't matter what route you took
because there was no bottom.

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:26.657
There was no way to do it.

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:30.657
It's not deep at all,
so... I don't know.

00:01:31.483 --> 00:01:36.143
Is it deep enough or not, though?
Hold on for a minute, guys.

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:40.143
We're trying to make a call out here
on how deep the water is at the bottom.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.020
The communication wasn't good.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.350
Some people, for some reason,
didn't answer or get the messages.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.930
My radio is dying...

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:50.909
Fuck!

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.989
I don't want Aniol to get hurt.

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.789
This can't be happening.

00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:58.789
It was almost like witnessing
my friend's suicide.

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:03.852
I just hope it's good, if not,
family, I love you guys!

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:05.939
My radio died
and all I heard

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.762
was Aniol saying:
"I'm running it anyway."
