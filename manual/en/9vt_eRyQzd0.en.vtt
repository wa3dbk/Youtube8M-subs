Hi, I'm Holly Heidemann on behalf of Expert
Village and today I'm going to show you the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.290
proper way to complete a barrel pattern. We're
going to go both to the left first and then

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.099
to the right first so you have a vision of
each of those. We're also going to talk about

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.700
the proper way to approach each barrel, to
slow down for the barrel, and then to accelerate.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.800
We are going to talk about some terms that,
that we're going to use the rest of these

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.160
videos also. One of them is approach, that's
the way that you come into the barrel. In

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.730
that approach you need to make sure that you
leave what's called a pocket and that's some

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.660
room around the barrel that will allow your
horse to turn it. So we're going to be talking

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.770
about pocket a lot and that just means the
space between the horse and the barrel. And

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.520
then we're going to be talking about inside
and outside reins and feet. So you need to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.510
know that an inside rein is when you are turning
to the right, the inside rein would be the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.500
right rein - your inside foot would be your
right foot. The outside, conversely, would

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.660
be your left hand, left foot. So we'll be
talking about that, you'll need to know that

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.220
term. And then we're going to talk about the
acceleration point, the point after you get

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.310
finished with your turn that you're going
to turn your horse loose and allow them to

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.100
accelerate and head to the next barrel. So
those are some terms you're going to need

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.100
to know as we complete this next segment.
We're going to start this barrel pattern out

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.230
right between the first and the second barrel.
You need to envision a straight line between

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.660
those first two barrels so that you can head
up like it were an imaginary alley until you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.110
get close enough that you're going to make
sort of an arc to go around that first barrel.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.140
You don't want to head into it straight. Make
sure you head into it with some bend and then

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.370
you're going to see the point at which I'm
going to sit down and I'm going to ask my

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.409
horse to slow down. A horse can not turn a
barrel as fast as they can run to one. So

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.479
at a slow speed, at a trot, we're going to
be teaching this horse to slow down for that

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.369
barrel so that when I sit down during a run,
he's going to gather up so he can run around

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.450
that barrel with speed but not as fast as
he ran to it. Then you're going to see me

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.530
continue holding in that turn. I'm going to
keep my hand down and back and I'm going to

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.009
keep that horse held in that turn, I'm going
to use my inside leg to keep the bend in his

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.049
body and then when I reach the back side of
the barrel, you're going to see me raise both

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.039
of my hands forward so my horse can run off
of that barrel, in this case trot off because

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.349
we're working, working him from a trot to
a walk, and then you're going to see me use

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.239
my inside leg. Preparing for the next turn
as I go across between the first and second

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.160
barrel, you're going to be using, if you're
going to the right barrel first - going to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.760
the second barrel will be a left turn so you're
going to be using your left leg between the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.280
first and the second barrel, all the way across
to get that horse pushed over and be in the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.669
proper pocket position to turn that second
barrel to the left.
