Hi I'm Holly Bell. Carving a roast chicken

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.240
can look a bit daunting but it's easy when
you know how. If you follow my simple tips

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.120
you'll impress everybody with your carving
skills and more importantly, all that lovely

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.310
chicken will end up off the bone and on the
plate.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.000
00:24
First things first, check your roast chicken

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.040
is fully cooked. Follow the instructions on
the packet and also pop a skewer into the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.629
thickest part of the thigh. By doing that
if the juices run clear you'll know it's cooked.

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.210
If they're pink in any way pop it back into
the oven. Then, cover it in foil and then

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.040
a tea towel to keep it warm and rest it for
15 minutes. This makes sure all those lovely

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.609
juices go back into the meat making it really
tender and juicy. Then untie the string that's

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.590
holding those legs together, cut through the
skin that holds the body of the chicken and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.920
the leg together and then use the edge of
the knife to gently push the leg away and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.930
you'll feel it give and then if you turn it
over so its's skin side down, you'll see there

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.360
is a line where the bone is through the leg.
If you cut just next to there here, you'll

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.210
pull the drumstick away from the thigh so
you've got two joints of meat within that

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.930
leg there. And then I'm going to do the other
leg so if I just turn the chicken around.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.190
01:27
So now we're going to turn the bird over because

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.000
there are two little bits of meat on the underside
of the bird called the oysters. You don't

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.869
want to miss out on them because as the bird's
been roasting all the juices have been running

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.120
to the bottom of the bird and making these
two bits of meat really succulent and delicious.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.299
You can use your thumb to get underneath that
there and it pops the oyster out and again

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.479
with the other one. Now turn the bird so that
the legs are closest to you and then get the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.460
fork into the bird and make sure you've got
a really firm grip. Because this is a really

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.590
sharp knife and you're going to be carving
away from yourself you don't want the bird

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.770
running away. Starting at the top you're going
to carve away from yourself and do long strokes.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.750
Keep going and you'll see nice, long strokes
and eventually you'll get down to where the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.950
bone is. Now I'm going to show you another
way to carve the breast meat, move the chicken

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.630
so that the breast bone is facing you and
then take the knife and you need to score

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.870
down the breast bone as close as you can get
to that bone and then you push it away and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.620
we're going all the way through and we're
going to take the whole breast off in one

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.410
go and then cut this into lovely slices and
last but not least we need to cut the wings

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.340
off. They kind of act as stabilizers so if
you get rid of them at the start then your

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.270
chicken is more likely to fall over.
02:45

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.100
There you have it, that's all of that gorgeous
meat onto the serving platter ready for the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.980
family to enjoy. With the bones that are left
you could boil them up, make some stock, some

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.980
soup, whatever you fancy.
Key tips

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.980
• Rest the chicken before carving
• Use a sharp carving knife

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.987
• Steady the bird with a carving fork
