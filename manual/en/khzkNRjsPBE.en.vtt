00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:01.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And so,
how are you going

00:00:01.976 --> 00:00:06.946
to get from there to there?

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:09.926
&gt;&gt;Student: I think
it's south and west.

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.986
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, try it,
like take your finger

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:15.956
and now follow my
finger with me, west.

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:17.416
Do we get to our destination?

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:18.046
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:21.196
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, high five.

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:24.256
&gt;&gt;Lynda: It's a real challenge
to educators today to figure

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:26.886
out how do you use your
available resources

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:29.206
so that every child succeeds.

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:33.796
&gt;&gt;Lynda: Before we
started our work,

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:35.296
we had what other schools had.

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:37.216
There would be a
teacher in a classroom.

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:38.266
They would teach a curriculum.

00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:41.626
And if a student needed extra
help, out the door they went,

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:44.526
down the hallway they went
and somebody else pulled

00:00:44.526 --> 00:00:46.066
out all the tricks
that they knew

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.426
and tried to teach that child.

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:51.816
So for us, it was really
flipping that whole model upside

00:00:51.816 --> 00:00:54.826
down and saying, "These are
the resources we have available

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:55.106
to us.

00:00:55.256 --> 00:00:59.136
How do we get everybody working
together to design a system

00:00:59.136 --> 00:01:00.776
that is more seamless
for students?"

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:06.286
&gt;&gt;Holly: The system
would not work

00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:07.646
without teacher collaboration.

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:10.656
&gt;&gt;Mindi: Every decision we
make, we have to make as a team.

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:12.446
&gt;&gt;Ashley: And we problem
solve together and look

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:17.136
at data together and make
decisions about what kids need.

00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:18.916
&gt;&gt;Lynda: If we're going
to work collectively

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:22.136
to ensure the success of every
child, then we had to get

00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:24.646
on the same page about
what we were teaching.

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:27.896
So for us, it was
an early lesson

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:31.906
in identifying a core
curriculum in math and reading

00:01:32.246 --> 00:01:34.496
that was the same no
matter who the teacher was.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.356
&gt;&gt;Ashley: So every single
student will receive, you know,

00:01:38.436 --> 00:01:39.626
universal instruction,

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:42.496
core instruction,
also known as Tier 1.

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:46.876
Some kids will need
supplemental instruction.

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:48.476
They'll need a little
bit more than core.

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:51.146
So you'll hear that
referred to as Tier 2.

00:01:53.086 --> 00:01:57.086
And then, some kids may need
more intensive intervention

00:01:57.396 --> 00:02:00.056
and so, you'll hear that
referred to as Tier 3.

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:01.796
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So what
did it tell you to do?

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:06.756
How are you going
to figure it out?

00:02:06.756 --> 00:02:07.676
&gt;&gt;Ashley: Teachers
at the very beginning

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:09.666
of the block are
teaching core instruction

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.446
to their core 22 students.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.896
And then they would
move into a time

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:15.416
that we call autonomous time

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:21.566
where the students will be more
self-directed in their learning.

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:26.196
&gt;&gt;Students: Columbians are--

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:29.396
&gt;&gt;Ashley: So some teachers
may pull Tier 2 at that time.

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:32.616
You also may see Tier 3
being pulled at that time

00:02:32.976 --> 00:02:36.576
in a very small room where
kids can really focus.

00:02:37.396 --> 00:02:38.446
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So this book is

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:41.036
about the Constitution
and the reason...

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:42.316
&gt;&gt;Dejuan: It's pretty
awesome here.

00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:47.916
My three favorite things are
math, writing and reading.

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:50.496
&gt;&gt;Sophia: It's kind of
cool so if you don't just--

00:02:50.586 --> 00:02:53.786
aren't just with one
teacher and you get to kind

00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:55.236
of move rooms and move teachers.

00:02:55.236 --> 00:02:57.256
&gt;&gt;Jhett: When you
go down into the--

00:02:57.256 --> 00:02:59.286
with Mr. Kirby in
your small group,

00:02:59.576 --> 00:03:02.776
then it really stretches your
brain in a really good way.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:07.576
&gt;&gt;Ashley: The teachers
organize themselves in a variety

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:09.156
of different ways and it depends

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:12.296
on teacher strengths
and students needs.

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:15.766
&gt;&gt;Student: Brushing
away the old vine.

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:19.256
&gt;&gt;Ashley: We may need a specific
group just on predicting.

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:23.886
And you don't have five kids
who need predicting in your 22.

00:03:24.356 --> 00:03:26.806
You have a whole bunch of them
across the learning community.

00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:30.716
So it's really important
that the tiers are connected.

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:33.466
Your core instruction
could be inferring.

00:03:34.116 --> 00:03:36.996
If they're receiving Tier 1
with me and Tier 2 with you

00:03:37.276 --> 00:03:38.546
and Tier 3 with someone else,

00:03:38.836 --> 00:03:41.646
we all are really
teaching inferring.

00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:44.016
We just may be teaching it
with different materials.

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:49.086
That requires a lot of
trust amongst teachers

00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:51.896
and that also requires
teachers to communicate.

00:03:52.526 --> 00:03:56.116
They meet every Wednesday
in a learning community

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:57.466
and they definitely check

00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:59.296
in with each other
about instruction.

00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:02.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Like had almost all
of their packet already filled

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:03.906
out and then there's
some groups of kids

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:05.796
that don't have anything
filled out.

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.536
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We have the same
problems with when they come

00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:09.496
to us, they have to
finish up the packet.

00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:12.356
So if we try to stick to
what that core part is...

00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:15.626
&gt;&gt;Ashley: And then we meet
as a Student Success Team.

00:04:15.626 --> 00:04:20.506
That team is made up of myself,
the learning community leader,

00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:23.986
all of the core teachers,
administrators,

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:27.276
guidance counselors, speech
and language pathologists.

00:04:27.686 --> 00:04:29.136
&gt;&gt;Lynda: All of those
stakeholders will sit

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:31.856
around the table together,
take a look at all of the data,

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:34.626
have deep conversations
about the effectiveness

00:04:34.626 --> 00:04:38.286
of the core instruction and
also monitor the progress

00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:41.056
of the Tier 2 groups
and the Tier 3

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:43.856
and then problem solve
together to figure out the ways

00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:45.416
in which they might
make adjustments.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.696
And then once they make
those major adjustments,

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:49.576
then they'll come back
together once a month

00:04:49.576 --> 00:04:51.286
to make sure progress
is being made.

00:04:52.556 --> 00:04:53.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And then reading,

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:56.306
which was mini lessons
45 percent of the time

00:04:56.306 --> 00:04:57.886
and then 83 percent of the time.

00:04:57.886 --> 00:04:59.746
And then you also had some
really other good details.

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:04.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Maybe her goal sheet
is almost like twice as long

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:06.626
so she has more space
like on Monday.

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:08.536
And right before you
go into Tier 2, okay,

00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:11.186
what are the specific
things you're going to do.

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:13.456
&gt;&gt;Mindi: I think that
we're meeting the student's

00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:14.396
needs better.

00:05:14.906 --> 00:05:18.396
&gt;&gt;Holly: The growth that we see
in our students is phenomenal.

00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:24.596
We've had kids go from
eighth percentile to thirty,

00:05:24.726 --> 00:05:26.876
fortieth percentile
and sometimes higher.

00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:31.046
&gt;&gt;Ashley: My work
is to make sure

00:05:31.046 --> 00:05:33.366
that all kids get
what they need.

00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:36.796
We have lots of different
types of learners

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:40.076
and everybody deserves
to have instruction

00:05:40.336 --> 00:05:41.206
that meets their needs.

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:43.826
&gt;&gt;Holly: That was
beautiful, high five.
