00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.179
In an earlier video we talked about putting deep joists

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.059
in for your

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.520
for the floor for a second story and

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.510
I briefly talked about using herringbone strutting to stop the joists from twisting or rolling over

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.099
So in this video, I just want to show you how you can quickly

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.969
work out what lengths they need to be and work out the angle

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.550
That you actually need to cut them so

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.470
That it's a little bit quicker than just trying to measure it and sort of guess

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.350
so obviously

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.630
hopefully when you set your joists out

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:48.009
you've got them on the majority of them the same spacing apart, but inevitably you'll end up with some different

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.829
spacings for your joists so this process

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.350
would need to be repeated for every

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.809
spacing that you have

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.849
So what you do is take a piece of your joist material our you can just measure it,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.550
mark that onto joists

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.799
like that's such and then we need to deduct

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.729
Generally about 12mm on each edge

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.369
Just so we don't have any chance of the struts sticking up above our

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.458
Joists, so we'll put a reduction in

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.519
12mm on each edge 24mm overall

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.119
so that becomes the new width of our

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.449
or the width of our herringbone strutting you for life

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:39.038
Once we know that then it's a really simple process all we do is just sit the piece of herringbone strutting

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.949
so that this side is on the bottom and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.549
the other side is just touching

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:52.539
the top of the other sides just touching the line there, and then we can just draw two lines up underneath

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.209
line their line there

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.179
Take that down

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.279
So get our two marks

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.770
cut those

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.959
And that will give us our

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.380
bevel and their length

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.619
For our herringbone strut, and then obviously

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.789
we repeat that or cut the same length again

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.690
and that'll give us a one the opposite way as I said that exercise needs to be repeated

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.840
Wherever you have a different width or spacing, but that will be a lot quicker than trying to measure it in and guess

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.129
what the actual bevel and the length is so that'll make cutting your

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.949
herringbone struts in a little bit quicker
