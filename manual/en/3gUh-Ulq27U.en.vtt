00:00:00.314 --> 00:00:02.981
(upbeat music)

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.170
- Hi everyone, welcome
to Aromahead Institute.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.810
Today I want to show you how to make

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.650
a sports massage oil blend.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.900
And this blend comes right
from Aromahead Institute's

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.170
free Introduction to Essential Oils class.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.310
In the class we teach you how
to make this in four ounces.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.610
Today I'm gonna show it
to you in two ounces,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.939
just so you can make a little
smaller amount to try it.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:39.770
And it's a fabulous blend
for using after a workout,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.990
or for sore muscles with massage clients,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.910
or even for yourself if
you're just simply working out

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.050
and you're feeling sore after a work out.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.620
So I've got a two ounce flip top bottle

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.710
and that's really nice
because you just flip the top

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.870
and then you can get small amounts out.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.480
So I'm just gonna fill this bottle

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.980
with two ounces of Jojoba oil.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.000
Jojoba oil is actually a wax.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.030
And it is really nice on your skin

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.960
and it never goes rancid
because it's a wax.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.070
It's a wonderful thing to make a blend in

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.700
because the blend will
last for a long time.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.620
And I'm gonna use four
essential oils today,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.360
Roman Chamomile,

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.310
Peppermint,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.820
Orange, and lastly, Ravintsara.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.730
And so the Roman Chamomile
we're gonna add eight drops

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.150
into the two ounces of Jojoba wax.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.320
The Roman Chamomile is
phenomenal for muscle spasms.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.770
It's really my favorite oil for spasms.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.370
That was one, two, three.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.890
Okay, and it smells incredible.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.270
It's a beautiful, light, fruity aroma

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.750
and it's going to really calm down

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.520
tight and spastic muscles.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.890
And then we're gonna add in
four drops of Peppermint.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.000
Peppermint is just a great pain killer.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.730
It's cooling for muscles or
joints that are inflamed.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.720
And it brings a lot of
circulation to the area.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.450
It's just a great post-workout oil.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.770
And then we have Orange.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.010
Orange is very emotionally uplifting,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.900
and also really nice for inflammation,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.500
really cooling.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.330
We're gonna put in four drops.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.318
There we go.

00:02:40.318 --> 00:02:42.110
And then lastly, Ravintsara.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.670
Ravintsara might not be
familiar to all of you.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.900
It's sort of like a Eucalyptus,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.930
and it smells really
opening for your sinuses,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.890
and it adds a really nice pain-reducing,

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.920
antiinflammatory action into this blend.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.920
So we're gonna do four
drops of Ravintsara.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.020
And then you just put on the cap.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.010
Give it a little mix, a little shake.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.870
And then you're ready to go.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.730
And it's so nice because you can really

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.530
get it out a drop at a time.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.690
And you can use plenty and
put it right onto a sore area.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.330
It smells amazing.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.820
Very invigorating, very uplifting
and very calming for pain.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.960
Hope you enjoy it.
