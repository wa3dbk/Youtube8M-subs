00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.270
For dads with a daughter, if you'd like to
figure out what is a good father, here's a

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.090
book that could be really interestingâ€”whether
you're a new dad and even if you are an experienced

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.190
one, as I was.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.090
Hi, I'm James I. Bond, founder of The Father-Daughter
Project.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.690
I'm also father of a son and three daughters.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.259
And let me tell you, when it comes to knowing
what is a good father, few people understand

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.789
it better than dads who've gone through the
experience themselves.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.700
The question of what is a good father is more
complicated than many people realize, especially

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.820
for a man raising a daughter.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.590
Most people don't realize that raising a daughter
is different from anything a man will ever

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.590
experience.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.340
I know because, even though I ran a training
and behavior management company, I discovered

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.440
first hand how difficult it could be to understand
what is a good father.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.410
And when I searched for help and advice, all
I got was a bunch of so-called experts.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.160
Their help was nice, but I needed something
fast and simple, that dealt with the real

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.740
issues involved in understanding what is a
good father and what is not.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.499
So, to learn about what a good father was
really like, I went right to the source, real

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:12.600
fathers of daughters.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.590
And what they told me was amazing.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.479
In the end, more than 101 fathers of daughters
agreed to be interviewed.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.479
More than 200 hours of recorded interviews
from real dads talking about their own experience

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.719
with learning what is a good father.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.219
The good, the bad and everything in between.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.899
They talked about every phase of raising a
daughter, from their first experience of her

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.490
birth, through the twos, the school years,
the teens, her getting a driver's license,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.340
and up through adulthood.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.420
All the stuff that only a dad would know.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.780
But because no book covered what is a good
father without laying a ton of judgment on

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.340
dads, I've made this available in a new book,
called THE SECRET LIFE OF FATHERS.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.479
In it you get to learn all those little things,
not just about being a good father, but about

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.880
being a good father to a daughter.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.290
Some of the complicated things, and plenty
of the really fun ones.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.640
The kinds of stuff only a real father of a
daughter would be able to tell you.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.519
And the best part is, it's in bite-size pieces,
so it's really easy to read and scan.

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.750
When it comes to learning and understanding
what is a good father, people are telling

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.220
us, this is like the first-ever real, training
manual for fathers of daughters.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.200
If you're a father to at least one daughter,
regardless of her age, you owe it to yourself

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.670
to check this out.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.689
THE SECRET LIFE OF FATHERS, one of the best
books you'll find on leaning what is a good

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.680
father, cause it's from real dads!

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.910
Check it out at bookstores everywhere, or
online at Amazon or B&amp;N.
