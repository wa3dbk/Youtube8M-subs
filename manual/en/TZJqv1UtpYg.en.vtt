00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:09.920
Hi! I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now, we'll
stuff the body. Just small clumps at a time

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.750
makes it a lot easier to manage it. If you
try to take too large an amount at once, it's

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:24.730
too difficult and bunches up and gets in the
way. You can push extra stuffing into this

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:34.820
area here. The idea is to end stuffing just
the immediate area around the hole. That's

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:44.531
a little too much, so I'm going to take some
out. We're pushing that in. The way you stuff

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:53.450
it is important because if you just start
jamming the stuffing into the stuffed animal

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.430
without doing the legs and the head and the
tail first, you'll end up with really flat

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:09.539
floppy legs, tail and head and a tight body.
This way if we do the head first and the legs

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:18.509
and the tail, then we end up with nice firm
extremities and a nice firm middle. Now we're

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:27.619
all stuffed. He's so cute. We're going to
sew up the side. Now I'm going to sew up the

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.399
side of the doggy. You want to just push in
that stuffing so it's no in you way. I have

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:44.139
a threaded needle with a good size knot and
I'm going to put my needle in through the

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:49.880
hole and coming out to the front and pull
that knot inside so we're not going to see

00:01:49.880 --> 00:02:06.380
it. Then just do the same whip stitch to finish
off. It might be a little bit harder but not

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.879
really. If the stuffing is hanging out and
you want, then you can just push it, push

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:21.599
it in there tight. Then after you finish stitching,
you can squeeze and shift the stuffing around

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:39.650
a little bit in the body section, but clear
it away from the opening so you can work easily.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.560
We're pretty tight to the end here and we're
not going to knot it on the inside because

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:56.530
we can't do it on the inside this time so
we're just going to put one more thread through.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:13.980
There's our loop. Pull that loop. There's
another loop.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.459
We'll just cut that off fairly close. That's
pretty neat. It's okay to have a knot on the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.400
outside. Next, we're going to sew our nose
and our eyes.
