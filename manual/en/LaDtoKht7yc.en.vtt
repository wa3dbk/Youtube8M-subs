DAVID CLEMEN: Hi. I'm David Clemen on behalf
of Expert Village, and today, we're going

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.940
to do an abstract painting on a larger scale
on a piece of birch wood. Alright, take your

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.440
squeegee and get ready to have some fun. You
probably going to get some your hands but

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.410
that's alright. I usually just come in here
and squeegee. And I'm not trying to cover

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.660
it uniformly like I was painting a wall in
a house. I'm just trying to cover and move

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.850
the red paint around, and you see I'm moving
around the table and just trying to spread

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:46.079
this paint and get a really vibrant image.
And, so once I get the bulk of it, squeegeed

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.070
it around, then I can start playing it. And
with this birch wood, it's really cool if

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.880
you press hard. You can almost get right back
down to the wood color. And so, I'm come in

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.020
here. And then, once you squeegee a lot, you'll
see, you get a lot of extra paint on there.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.490
So, you've got paint to play with and you
can do smaller strokes with the squeegee and

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:15.609
fill in, and then this is basically my background.
And so, once I do this, you see how quickly

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:21.789
I'm covering such a huge area of paint. It's
awesome. And it's much different that using

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:29.740
a brush for me. And so, this is squeegeeing
the first color and I'm gonna--see, there

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.770
are a couple of spaces there, with negative
space, I might come and fill those in. And

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.719
I might also leave some areas where I get
to see the wood through the areas I've squeegeed.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.779
But I have a feeling by the time I get done
with this painting; I pretty much have covered

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:53.590
every square inch of this. But you notice
in less than two minutes, I've been able to

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.509
spread this red paint all the way across just
by squeegeeing the first color.
