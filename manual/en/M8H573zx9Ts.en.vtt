Pottery Barn Party Planner Olive Oil Tasting McEvoy Ranch

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.100
Hi I'm Jill at McEvoy Ranch with pottery barn and we're
going to be talking about ways to entertain

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.969
at home with olive oil

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.340
Here at McEvoy Ranch we're producers of the
state ground certified organic olive oil in

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.539
northern California. Our Ranch is located just north
of San francisco. We have eighteen thousand

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.710
trees on our property we have a five hundred
fifty acre ranch

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.789
organic olive oil has a great taste flavor
profile but you can also feel good about
swerving 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.730
it to your friends and family because we put a lot
of effort into being as sustainable us possible

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.690
in our farming methods

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.610
Our soils, our water, our windmill producing energy 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.960
All that is part of our passion here at McEvoy Ranch.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.750
So if you wanted to taste olive oils you can take some olive oil
and put it into a clean clear glass 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.260
it's an official olive oil tasting glass
but at home if you had

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.480
just a clean nice the glass ideally with
a narrow shape at the top so you can smell

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.900
the aromas from the olive oil

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.810
first take a whiff of the aroma

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.540
I'm picking up a lot of green grass

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.320
little bit artichoke maybe a hint of lemon in there
and after you smell the olive oil

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.790
then you can take a little taste and sip it

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.150
Pull a little a little air back across your tongue
and you'll taste all those flavor profiles that are 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.700
very dominant

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.850
similar to tasting wines red wine goes really
nicely with olive oil

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.899
but just how you would taste your wines and 
look for flavor profiles you can do that with your olive oils

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.910
and the compare the different olive oils that you have available to you
you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.370
There are many wonderful ways to enjoy olive oil

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.049
You can dip it with bread, with cheeses

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.569
here we have a triple cream cheese and a fromage
blanc. You can take a little bit of

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.159
the cheese

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.110
this is a real easy hors d'oeuvre

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.700
we also use olive oil a lot for finishing
foods like grilled vegetables here we have

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.170
some grilled carrots and any seasonal vegetable
is nice to use finished with the olive oil

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.000
in the fall, the end of summer, tomatoes, eggplant, squash, 
 and finally and it's somewhere it's made as
a plants lives

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.069
winter squash, sweet potatoes really nice

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.449
for grilling and preparing

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:17.449
What I love about this table is how it combines
pottery barn and mcevoy very simple elegant

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:18.819
ingredients

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.819
and products together in a very beautiful display 
where it can be very rustic, very old world 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:27.769
European style

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:28.129
and very elegant at the same time

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
