[Simon Winston]
Sun coming up through here, through the trees,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.740
it makes a different shadow. Everything is
beautiful. I mean I like the whole place.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.119
The trees are real pretty and the native grasses
we've got. Well, I like all of it, the whole

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:32.119
place. I like the hills, the trees, the wildlife,
and riding around with Puppy just up in the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.780
front seat with me. We're just looking to
see what we've done, what we're doing and

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.780
what we need to do next. Because there's always
something to do.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.540
For Winston 8 Ranch, most of it we do try
to harvest timber. It's just an ongoing thing

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.390
that's been going on since my great grandfather
had the place.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.059
[turkey gobble]

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.309
We try to manage for wildlife, the turkeys
and the deer, the songbirds and all the other

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.079
kind of birds.

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:07.270

[Robert Allen]
When you drive in the gate there's a sign

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.530
that says tree farm. This is not your typical
tree farm. When you drive around through here

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.850
and woods are open, there's a lot of prescribed
burning going on, there's invasive and exotic

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.409
species removal. He's doing the hard things
on this property that most people don't want

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.990
to get involved with.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.600

This good looking long leaf stand, it was

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.299
planted in 2005. Mister Winston had clear
cut the previous timber off the area and then

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.009
did a reforestation job using the long leaf
seedlings to establish this stand here. And

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.880
this is a really nice stand. These trees are
thriving and a lot of that is credited to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.530
Mister Winston's management.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.110

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.840
[Alan Shadow]
He contacted us to aid in helping to establish

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.930
some of these perennial warm season grasses
on his property to improve turkey habitat.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.849
And it allows turkey poults and bobwhite and
other game birds and small animals to forage

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.269
on the ground in between the plant stools.
With the site prep that Simon has done on

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:22.529
this area we were able to accomplish basically
a complete stand in a single growing season.

Not a lot of fuel.

[Frank Wofford]
One thing about the Winstons they're real

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.349
hands on. And the Winstons have been doing
prescribed burning now for several years,

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.349
for 15, 20 years and the reason for that is
two fold, one is to reduce the fuel reduction

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:49.799
for fuel reduction purposes, and the other
is for wildlife habitat enhancement and development.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.419
[Virginia Winston]
We keep it burned out, but now they do it

00:02:54.419 --> 00:03:01.419
in blocks. Simon has it all on a computer.
But we used to burn whatever needed burning.

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.680
And so he started doing it more organized.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.969
[Simon Winston]
This is one of the main management tools we

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.029
do all of the time to help the land to were
everything doesn't grow up and where it won't

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:20.999
have a forest fire in it. It's good for the
turkeys and the deer and food for them.

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:27.999
Come on Puppy dog, let's go. Get out, let's
go.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.859
This is one of our spring food plots. If you
just take a little time and do some research

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.819
there's some kind of program or project that
you'll get assistance on that you can do.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.389
[music]

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:47.629
We have Jakes events out here which are young
kids, they'll come out. And we do Wheelin'

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:54.629
Sportsmens for handicapped people. I enjoy
doing it.

00:03:55.749 --> 00:04:00.719
You've got to love what you're doing. To me
it's not work. If it was work I wouldn't be

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.489
doing it.

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.839
[Robert Allen]
You can tell he has a deep seated care about

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:09.979
this property and he seems almost willing
to do almost anything to get it the way he

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:11.159
wants it.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.159
[Simon Winston]
We're never finished. You can always improve

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.260
on what you've got.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.220
[Robert Allen]
This property is an example and serves as

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.139
a good role model to other properties in East
Texas on how to manage timber and wildlife

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:25.750
simultaneously.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.400
[Simon Winston]
I just have lots of good people that help,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.919
and family, and I'm God blessed to be here.
