00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.600
We didn't hop into bed on the first date.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.420
We've gotten to know each other really well. We're not drinking.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.240
It's all so new to me.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.780
That's what makes it special.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.160
Uh-oh.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.040
Why don't you put some music on?

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.240
Okay.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.580
Should I ask?

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.980
I wish you wouldn't.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.700
Are you ready for me?

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.840
Mia...

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.080
If I were any more ready, I'd be done.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.160
Oh jeez, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.920
I think so.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.900
Are you sure?

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.120
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.180
Are you okay?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.900
Are you okay?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.660
Yeah.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.140
But I think that's enough foreplay.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.580
Oh, cheer up.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.200
It wasn't that bad.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.240
There were... parts of it that I liked.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.340
Can we please not go over the game film now?

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.280
What's the big deal?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.620
What's the big deal?!

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.140
This is supposed to be the part of the relationship that I'm good at.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.400
You are.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.040
It was...

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.120
fine.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.720
I don't want to hear fine.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.660
I want to see your eyes roll back and the top of your head blow off.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.460
I'm not a carnival game. The object is not just to swing your mallet and ring my bell.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.820
Well, we disagree.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.360
Charlie, listen to me.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.320
I love you. Not your money or your car or your house or your skills in bed.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.680
What's left?!

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.500
Charlie.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.400
Oh, come on.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.800
Come on. You're saying that, if I was some pencil-weenie guy, living in a shack and

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.160
taking the bus to my job selling oranges on the freeway off-ramp, you'd still love me?

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.260
Yes, I would still love you.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.020
Okay, I understand now.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.920
Good.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.360
You're insane.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.940
I guess we're just gonna have to try again.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.720
Hang on. Hang on.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.940
How am I gonna know you're not faking it just to make me feel better?

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.240
Honey, if I was gonna fake it, don't you think I would have done it the first time?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.720
Fair enough.
