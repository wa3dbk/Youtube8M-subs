00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:08.146
[ Music ]

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:10.956
&gt;&gt; The play is called "The
Incredible Book Eating Boy."

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:12.216
It's a story about Henry.

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:15.606
&gt;&gt; He happens to lick a
book by accident one day

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.396
and discovers that
it's delicious.

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:20.036
&gt;&gt; And then realises that the
more books he eats the smarter

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:20.386
he gets.

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:22.376
The guy is saying look
how many wonderful things

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:24.296
that are around there.

00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:27.456
Let's discover them.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:31.266
&gt;&gt; I started by really
immersing myself in the book.

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:33.956
&gt;&gt; Because Oliver Jeffers
is also the painter

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:35.976
so it was really
important that that side

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:37.266
of things be really strong.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.976
&gt;&gt; Oliver Jeffers'
drawings are so layered

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:41.306
and beautiful and rich.

00:00:41.306 --> 00:00:43.746
&gt;&gt; We'd bring a picture up and
say how can we get the idea

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:45.596
and that image of that
illustration of the boy?

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.556
&gt;&gt; A lot of our props
open and close

00:00:48.556 --> 00:00:50.316
and they move and they shift.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.396
&gt;&gt; You are inside a book.

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:53.706
Everything unfolds
or opens like a book.

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:54.896
Everything should transform.

00:00:54.896 --> 00:00:56.316
Everything should
have three uses.

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.056
&gt;&gt; We have an amazing cast.

00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:01.066
We play multiple roles.

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.026
&gt;&gt; I play Mr. Book.

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:03.566
&gt;&gt; Henry's sister.

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.256
&gt;&gt; Henry's dad.

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:04.896
&gt;&gt; His teacher.

00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:05.496
&gt;&gt; And a writer.

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:06.536
&gt;&gt; The librarian.

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:07.666
&gt;&gt; A cheeky school boy.

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:12.036
&gt;&gt; Fred the cat.

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:12.466
Meow.

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:15.836
&gt;&gt; There's so much colour
and movement and music.

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:17.566
&gt;&gt; The visual jokes will
appeal to the younger kids

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:19.616
and there's lots of
really, really silly jokes

00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:22.146
that will appeal to
slightly older kids as well.

00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:24.166
&gt;&gt; I think it's very funny.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.676
&gt;&gt; It's a show for everybody
and it will [inaudible] perhaps.

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:30.126
&gt;&gt; It's so exciting to have a
show at the Sydney Opera House.

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:31.466
It's like a dream.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.856
&gt;&gt; You get a real sense of pride

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:34.366
over this thing that
you've created.

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.146
&gt;&gt; It's not your everyday
theatre experience.

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:40.026
&gt;&gt; If you like to laugh
then you'll like this show.

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:42.706
If you like to feel and
sort of see something

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:45.216
which is quite moving on stage
then you'll like this show.

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:47.736
If you like something that's
beautiful then you'll definitely

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:48.256
like this show.

00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:50.616
And if you like a full
rounded experience

00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:52.406
in the theatre then
come and see this show.
