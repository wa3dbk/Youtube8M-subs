00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.500
Hi, I'm Sylvain.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.500
And I'm Jon.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.300
We want to tell you about an exciting project

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.600
we're working on at Exogen

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.000
to give individuals like you

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.900
the ability to monitor the health of your DNA.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.600
You might be surprised to learn that

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.500
your DNA is constantly being damaged.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.500
Every single cell in your body

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.000
Experiences 1-10 DNA breaks per day,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.700
depending on your lifestyle

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.500
and your genetics.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.500
Scientists developed the technology to measure

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.500
DNA damage in cells over 15 years ago.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.800
They have used this technology in the laboratory

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.400
to link DNA damage and poor repair of DNA

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.700
to cancer, premature aging, neurological disorders,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.000
and many other serious medical conditions.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.400
Unfortunately, this technology is not yet accessible to the public

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.500
and it may take decades before it's available to you and your doctor.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.300
Our campaign wants to accelerate this timeline

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.500
by recruiting an army of citizen scientists

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000
to generate the big data needed to correlate DNA damage

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.800
to specific diseases,

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.900
and environmental and lifestyle factors.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.500
Our society has been focused for many years

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.500
on reducing the amount of DNA damage

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.300
by minimizing medical x-rays,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.300
avoiding environmental toxins,limiting UV rays from the sun,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.000
taking vitamin supplements,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.800
and eating antioxidant rich foods.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
But in the end, how do you know

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.900
any of these lifestyle choices are reducing the amount of DNA damage.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.500
That's where Exogen comes in.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.400
Exogen has assembled a kit to measure DNA damage

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.000
in your own cells using only a few drops of blood.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.800
The kit consists of commercially available tools

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.700
to let you collect your blood samples in the privacy of your own home,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.100
before they get shipped back to us for analysis.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.500
So it's completely safe.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.000
Here's how it works:

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.800
Step 1:

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.700
You receive your kit in the mail,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.900
allowing you to collect up to three samples within three days.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.100
Step 2:

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.700
You collect your blood with a sterile lancet and a mini capillary.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.400
Immediately combine your blood with the fixative solution provided,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.700
so that we get a precise snapshot

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.600
of your DNA damage

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.600
at the moment of collection.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.300
Step 3:

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.100
Log in to our secure web app,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.300
register your samples,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.000
and fill out a short questionnaire.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.900
Step 4:

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.500
When you're done, mail them back to us for analysis.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.500
After we receive your samples, state of the art microscopes,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.400
which we will purchase with the funds we raise,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.400
will be used to evaluate how much DNA damage is in your white blood cells.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500
When we're finished, we format your information

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.000
and make it available to only you via secure login.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.500
Imagine what we could discover together if you become a citizen scientist

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.500
and help us bring this technology out of the lab and into the public.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.000
For example, by sharing your location,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.100
we can geographically map DNA damage levels

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.500
to identify regional hotspots.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.000
And over time, we can see

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.000
if there are seasonal patterns.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.500
With a one-time kit, you will know

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.500
how your DNA damage levels compare to others.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.800
With a conscientious scientist kit, you get 6 samples

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.700
to create your own customized before and after experiment.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.800
At Exogen, we believe regular monitoring has added value

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.300
in better understanding how your lifestyle choices

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.200
impact your health.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.700
By ordering monthly, or quarterly kits,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.800
you can start tuning your lifestyle for a healthier DNA

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.500
So who are we?

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
Sylvain has a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.600
and I received my PhD from UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.600
Together we are working at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.800
studying breast cancer and radiation carcinogenesis

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.900
We also have a team of highly talented scientists, doctors, and engineers

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
on our scientific advisory board

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.000
with profiles listed on our website.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.300
We have the science and the team

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.000
to make this a revolutionary weapon against many diseases,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.500
but we need your help to get started

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.400
Together, let's promote healthier DNA and a healthier living for all of us.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.000
So, please join us.
