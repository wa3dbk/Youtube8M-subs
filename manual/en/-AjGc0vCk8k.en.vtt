00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.010
So everybody wants to know why Stanford is
now the most sought after University in America,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.010
arguably the world.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.360
You guys have all seen the record low acceptance
rate for this year’s class of 2018.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.600
But nobody is really asking the students themselves
whether they find what they are actually looking

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600
for.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.250
Yes we find the perfect weather, the beautiful
campus, amazing football team-- all those

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.250
things.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.300
But in reality, we don’t necessarily find
a perfect education waiting for us at the

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.309
farm.

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.170
Maybe that’s a little provocative to say
in this audience, and honestly, I was a little

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.800
bit disappointed until that magical moment
when I think each of us realized, in our own

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.540
way, that the point was not to receive a great
education but to create our own.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.240
And to shape it for the unique challenges
that await our generation in a world that’s

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.989
more complex, uncertain, and connected than
ever before.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.051
So now when I think about why Stanford is
the most sought after higher education, I

00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:58.289
think it’s because Stanford students have
thought out, with the guidance and support

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.280
of the University, to redefine higher education
for the 21st century, to make it more interdisciplinary,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.950
hands on in the real world and the real world
is noticing those results.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.630
So there are all kinds of examples all around
campus but I am just going to show three examples

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.220
of project-based learning from my own experience
studying civil engineering and architectural

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.220
design.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.750
So my magical moment came in sophomore year,
when I took the class AEC Global Teamwork

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.940
Project, in which students from all around
the world formed interdisciplinary teams to

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.950
tackle hypothetical but comprehensive building
designs.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.229
This is my team from 2011 representing two
continents and four time zones, what did we

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.229
learn?

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.340
None of us could do it alone.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.580
But most importantly, not even in our professions
could we do it alone, and yet the industry

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.560
is full of silos, islands of knowledge, fragmented
processes from architect to engineer to contractor.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.030
The new paradigm is integrated project delivery,
in which all disciplines are represented at

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.720
the very beginning of the conceptual design
phase, so that together, we can work out the

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.119
kinks way before they become a cost to the
client or the environment.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.110
So this is exactly the kind of learning experience
that we were immersed in, which will also

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.369
be the work experience in industry.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.259
Which lead to the real reason I think we were
so successful as a team is because we didn’t

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.070
see it as a classroom assignment, we saw it
as training for our futures.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.370
Then that also meant that we could shape what
that future was, and will be, through experimentation

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.410
and innovations such as building information
modeling, cloud-based computational tools,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.360
and even, virtual reality environments in
which we can collaborate in real time from

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.430
thousands of miles apart, and even experience
our building design as it’s being conceived.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.051
There was a magical moment for me because
I realized for the first time that I was no

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:39.020
longer a student, I was my own teacher.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.470
And it meant that I could also not have to
get into industry to begin to change it.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.140
So I had the interdisciplinary experience
but I was craving the hands-on which led to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.890
my next project: Stanford’s first ever entry
into the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.890
competition.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.100
It was a student initiated project, and over
the span of two years, about a team of over

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.041
100 students, many of whom have never held
a hammer in their lives, to design, engineer

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:07.540
and build a 1,000 square foot, net zero solar
paneled solar powered home—right on campus

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.000
by where the old Terman building used to be.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.620
After which point, we took it apart, put it
on trucks, shipped it down to Southern California

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.310
in five 50 foot trailer beds.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.090
At which point we put it back together over
8 days and competed against 19 other teams

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.650
on contests ranging from architecture to affordability.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.610
We ended up actually winning first place in
affordability and fifth place overall.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.230
(audience applause) Thank you.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.200
But I don’t even really care about that...
because we didn’t stop there.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.320
The real world impact is that we brought the
house back to Stanford campus, Jasper Ridge

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.430
Biological Preserve, where right now (this
picture was taken about a week ago) the park

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.730
ranger and his family are happily living inside
and where the house will remain a visiting

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.000
research and scholar residence for decades
to come—can’t get any more hands-on than

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.890
that.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.209
So next, inevitably for me, was the real world,
because I was burnt out at this point.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.340
So I actually took a gap year, for the past
8 months, I’ve been traveling 23 countries

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.590
in Europe and actually reconnecting with a
lot of these European colleagues of mine from

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.489
the AEC Global Teamwork Project.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.459
Ironically, in what was supposed to be a vacation,
I started a company…

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.140
It was a design practice in which many of
us are applying our global interdisciplinary

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.530
approach to real client projects from London
to Los Angeles.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.590
But before I go, to deep dive into my career,
I’m back at Stanford, getting my master’s

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.270
and in a full circle; my practice is now organizing
our own project-based learning experience

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.840
it is called GUDP.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.310
And it is a lot like the class we have taken
together except we’re focusing on the political

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.780
aspects, economic and social factors that
affect urban developments, long before the

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.740
shovel hits the dirt.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.240
Most importantly, we wanted our students to
have a real client and a real challenge.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.060
For that, I enlisted the help of my good friend
and colleague, Michael Tubbs, class of 2012,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.970
youngest council member at the city of Stockton,
California.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.180
And he wanted our students to have strategic
solutions to fix his district 6-- which is

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.010
a neighborhood of long standing urban blight,
drugs, violence, crime, you name it.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.070
It’s a problem there and it’s a kind of
place that even professionals don’t like

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.690
to get involved with.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.490
But knowing Stanford students and our peers
around the world, seeing the way that we think

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.540
outside the bubble-- the way to paraphrase
one of my favorite quotes: “We don’t let

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.230
the classroom get in the way of our education.”

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.230
I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the best
ideas from this project, end up becoming real

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.740
world solutions, like those of many GUDP projects
to come, because like I said, to each her

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.370
or his own education and mine has only just
begun.
