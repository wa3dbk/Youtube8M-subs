00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.040
So growing up as a kid, two of my favorite
things was to build Lego

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.440
and to play Megaman on the NES
This video is gonna comprise

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.750
both of them so

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.290
this is my version of

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:21.039
Megaman built in Lego

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.370
So essentially what I did for this
video was that I built Megaman

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.909
in all these different poses

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.060
depending on if he jumps, if he shoots
or if he jumps and shoots.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.960
and animated him in stop-motion 
frame by frame on the timeline so every

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.390
movement he does is controlled frame by
frame. The cats are obviously filmed on

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.460
location here and all of the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.280
the enemies and the background, the
weird stuff that aren't the cats but

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.450
graphical they've been done in photoshop so
there's been no screenshots of the game itself.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.750
It's all been recreated in photoshop
and final cut afterwards

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.880
The music in the boss
presentation as well as when he gets the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.420
weapon at the very end are all loops
created in Garageband. Music in the stage

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.110
and the boss are music made by Nathan
Wills, a youtuber: paradigma is his

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.659
youtube name and he has something called free
track friday where he lets you use

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.560
some of his music if you credit him
so if you want to use some of the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.750
music he's doing, then head on to his page
thanks so much for watching my

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.289
Lego Megaman video

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.219
There will be a new video on sunday, a
very special video for that day

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:20.549
until then and until next time
I'll see you there. Bye
