00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.550
Hills.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.340
Mountains.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.460
Even bigger mountains.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.140
Lovely, smooth roads.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.140
Colour.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.140
Music.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.140
A Tour champion.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.150
A Vuelta champion.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.590
Another Tour champion.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.250
A Tour, Giro, and Vuelta champion.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.039
A defending champion.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.280
A running champion.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.650
A world champion.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.869
A local champion.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.449
And a boxing champion.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.739
Okay, maybe not but he does look a lot like
Ivan Drago in Rocky IV!

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.010
These are some of the cast for the Tour of
Oman.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.920
Let’s check out day one.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.519
162 kilometres lay before the peloton from
Al Musannah to Sultan Qaboos University - on

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.469
paper it looked like some dramatic climbing
in comparison with Qatar last week.

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.839
In practice, it would be a walk in the park
even for the chubbiest sprinters.

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.960
Almost from the off two representatives from
the Asian teams made their intentions clear

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.610
- Japan’s Kohei Uchima and Champion System’s
Bobby Traksel sticking their noses in the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.220
wind... what little of it there was.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.080
The peloton was happy to amble along behind
- even up to nine minutes in arrears as the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.970
front duo crested the day’s categorised
climb, a three hundred and forty metre pimple

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.870
compared with Thursday’s brute of a finishing
climb.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.730
As well as topping the climb first, Traksel
grabbed the both intermediate sprints &nbsp;- knowing

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.610
full well this would lead to a trip to the
podium later for the Most Aggressive Rider

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.720
Jersey.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.950
The crème de la crème of world cycling,
including world champ Philippe Gilbert and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.909
Tour champ Bradley Wiggins were content to
drift around the rear of the pack.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.420
While Marcel Kittel’s Argos Shimano drove
the front, eventually catching the escape

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.980
with around 20k to go.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.420
Quite handy really, as their man bossed the
sprint, comfortably holding off AG2R’s Davide

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.420
Appolonio and FDJ’s Nacer Bouhanni.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.420
“It was not a very difficult sprint because
the team did a great job.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.420
They brought me in a &nbsp;really good position.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.420
I’m especially very proud because we stayed
calm and we followed our plan that we had

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.420
before.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.420
It’s always a nice feeling if we can give
a win back to the team.”

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.880
A busy end to the day for Kittel as he collected
the overall leader’s red jersey, the green

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:18.540
points jersey and the white jersey of best
young rider.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:29.870
A 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.579
small kick upwards near the 1K to go flag
at the end of Tuesday’s stage 2 could prove

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.969
interesting - but early on Kittel’s form
certainly looks good.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.199
