00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.900
Do you know how to make a good first impression
with your father in law?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.200
Very easy.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.200
Never arrive empty handed.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
You have to show him that you are a good catch.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.100
Really blow his hair back. Leave him with
his eyelashes stuck to his forehead.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.200
I think 
I sound great.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I hope I recognize him- I have only seen him
in pictures. Stacey showed to 
me once.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
He looks nice. He's got Lionel Richie hair.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You know- curly hair, cool guy.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.800
It's weird, the names people get here sometimes.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300
It's like if I was named "little weiner" in
Chile.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.600
Can I say weiner?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.200
I didn't understand a thing he said.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.300
We're screwed.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.400
I wanted us to 
get along, but I think his tie was tied too
tight.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.400
I 
didn't know what to do. I felt exposed.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.900
Like
a naked bird.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.300
I got there late.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.300
He started telling me about
his shoes.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.400
And I forgot everything about the hotdog cart.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.000
We are going to kill it.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.500
We are going to kill it.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.000
The meeting wasn't the best, but what can
we do about it?

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600
We have no money, no hotdog cart, no apartment.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.200
No way, Jose.
