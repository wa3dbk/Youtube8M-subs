Mrs. Jackson:
I talk about Science
Park being organic.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.633
It is bigger than any of us.

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:09.133
It is a living organism.

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:14.066
It is a beacon in
sometimes a baron planes.

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:18.266
Nora Pinero:
My car was broken into and
all I kept thinking was:

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.800
My daughter is going to Science.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.100
My house got broken
into and I kept saying:

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.100
My daughter is going to Science.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.734
Omaru Washington:
As a boy who survived from
a civil war in Liberia,

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:31.233
I came to Science Park High
School not knowing much English.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.400
I was scared and frightened.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.100
On my first day of school,
when I walked into the atrium,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.000
I saw all these different
students with different

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.233
languages and culture.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:42.533
From that moment, I
knew that I belong here.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.600
I knew that I have found a
second place to call my home.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.000
Katherine Fernandez:
The student came up to me and she said, "You're beautiful".

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.333
And I smiled really widely.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:01:05.033
And that phrase translated as
you're accepted; your safe.

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:12.633
I was so happy. I felt at home.

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:14.767
Narrator:
Science Park High School
students have made this school

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:16.500
the number one in the district.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.800
(school bell)

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.667
Student:
Our school class, to broaden
its already rigorous curriculum,

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.834
with an incorporation
of 23 new AP courses.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.266
Student:
Currently it is the only
school in the district to

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.133
offer organic chemistry.

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.066
Student:
Members maintain exceptional
GPAs while participating in

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.667
frequent service projects such
as donating clothes to Japan in

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:39.133
an effort to benefit the school,
community and our world.

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:43.233
Beaira Thomas:
When I look at the reward for
coming to Science High School,

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:44.367
I feel that it's all worth it.

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:47.333
Like I have to wake up earlier
just to get on those two buses

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.033
to get here.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.066
But at the end of the day,
it's worth it because of the

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.266
education, because of the
academics that I've been

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.867
introduced to and the people --

00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:57.133
Mr. Alston:
Our kids come from
all over the city.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:00.467
They come from many different
struggling background just like

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:01.867
I did when I was a kid here.

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:06.567
And they work so incredibly
hard at being excellent,

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:08.333
at working hard,
staying up late,

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:11.567
going through all sorts of
obstacles that many students

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.767
never even have to think about.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:27.967
(piano playing)

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:45.333
(chorus singing)

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.533
Student:
I got accepted to
Cornell University,

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:48.600
Georgetown University --

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.600
Student:
-- and Boston University
with a scholarship.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.734
Ms. Jackson:
This school continues to
grow and continues to live.

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:58.000
So tell me that it's
not a living organism.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.900
Students:
