00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
"Are Organic Foods Safer?"

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.030
The stated principles
of organic agriculture

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.490
are “health, ecology,
fairness, and care,”

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.519
but if you ask people
why they buy organic,

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.189
the strongest predictor
was concern

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.040
for their own health
or their family’s.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.310
People may spend
more for organic

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.849
more for selfish, rather
than altruistic motives.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.169
Although organic foods may not
have more nutrients per dollar,

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.460
consumption of organic foods
may reduce exposure

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.160
to pesticide residues and
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.110
Food safety-wise, they found
no difference in the risk

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.480
of contamination with food
poisoning bacteria, in general.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.870
Both organic and conventional animal
products were commonly contaminated

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.660
with Salmonella and
Campylobacter, for example.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.030
Most chicken samples were
found to be contaminated,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.350
either way, with Campylobacter,
about a third with Salmonella.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.160
But the risk of exposure to
multi-drug resistant bacteria,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.180
resistant to multiple
classes of antibiotics,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.579
was lower with
the organic meat.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.009
So they both may carry the
same risk of making us sick,

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.049
but food poisoning
from organic meat

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.030
may be easier for
doctors to treat.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.299
What about the pesticides?

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.420
There's a large body of
evidence on the relation

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.109
between exposure to pesticides and
elevated rate of chronic diseases,

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.299
such as different types
of cancer, diabetes,

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.659
neurodegenerative disorders like
Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and ALS,

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.259
as well as birth defects
and reproductive disorders,

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.439
but they’re talking about people
who live or work around pesticides.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.049
Take Salinas Valley,
California, for example,

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.139
where they spread a half
million pounds of the stuff.

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.319
Daring to be pregnant in an
agricultural community like that

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.340
may impair childhood
brain development

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.389
such that pregnant women
with the highest levels

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:56.889
running through their bodies,
as measured in their urine,

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:02.729
gave birth to children with an average
deficit of about 7 IQ points.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.789
26 out of 27 studies showed
negative effects of pesticides

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.660
on brain development in children.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.360
These included attention problems,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.159
developmental disorders, and
short-term memory difficulties.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.260
If you compare kids
born with higher levels

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.129
of a common insecticide
in their umbilical cord blood,

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.560
those who were exposed
to higher levels are

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.610
born with brain anomalies.
And these were city kids,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.829
so presumably this was from
residential pesticide use.

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.280
Residential exposure
to pesticides,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.349
like using insecticides
inside your house,

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.280
may be a contributing factor for
cancers like childhood leukemia,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.439
suggesting that awareness be
increased among populations

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.159
occupationally exposed
to pesticides about

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.310
their potential negative influence
on the health of their children,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.489
though I don't imagine most
farm workers have much of a choice.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.250
Pregnant farm workers may
be doubling the odds

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.879
of their child getting leukemia

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.290
and increase their risk
of getting a brain tumor.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.189
So conventional produce
may be bad

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.000
for the pregnant women
who picks them,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.469
but what about our own
family when we eat them?

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.549
Well, first of all, just because we spray
pesticides on foods in the fields

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.150
doesn’t mean it ends up in
our bodies when we eat it,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.079
or at least we didn’t know that until
this study was published in 2006.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.849
Researchers measured the
levels of two pesticides

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.370
running through children’s
bodies by measuring

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.629
specific pesticide breakdown
products in their urine.

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.180
Here's the level of pesticides
flowing through the bodies

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.870
of 3 to 11-year olds during a
few days on a conventional diet.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.530
Then they went on an
organic diet for 5 days

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.530
and then back to the
conventional diet.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.620
It’s clear that eating organic
provides a dramatic and immediate

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.319
protective effect against
exposures to pesticides

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.219
commonly used in
agricultural production.

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.889
The study was subsequently extended.

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.120
Can you guess when the
kids were eating organic?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.760
You don't even need the
labels on the graph to tell.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.239
What about adults though?

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.739
We didn’t know... until now.

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.650
13 men and women consume a diet

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.160
of at least 80% organic
or conventional food

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.310
for 7 days and then switched.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.170
And no surprise. During
the mostly organic week

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.000
pesticide exposure was
significantly reduced,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.600
and not just by a little,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.970
a nearly 90% drop in exposure.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.190
So it could be concluded that
consumption of organic foods

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.440
does provide protection
against pesticides,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.710
but does that mean protection
against disease?

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.750
We don’t know — the studies
just have not been done.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.340
Nevertheless, in the meantime,
the consumption of organic food

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.540
provides a logical
precautionary approach.
