<c.yellow><i>He checks that everything is in place</i></c>

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.800
This is nerve-racking.

<c.yellow><i>Hidden camera

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:21.300
- Yeah.
- How tell you how to download it.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.000
- This is all Bug.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.200
- This is the police.
- The police?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.133
- That's right.
- What's the matter, officer?

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.700
- Is this Hong In-gyu's residence?
- Yes.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.233
The cyber police detected
your connection to the Bug site.

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:51.600
- Bug site?
- We are here to investigate.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.466
- Yes.
- So your address is Nam-gu, Incheon...

The police.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.933
Yes?

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.466
Sir!

Tae-gyeong!

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:22.033
We didn't mean to.
We were only connected for a second.

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:23.433
Let's sit down.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.000
Were you the one who connected
to the site, Tae-gyeong?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.866
- We just tried it and...
- Yes.

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.900
- And then switched it off.
- But you were connected?

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.733
So you admit it, right?
What were you doing, sir?

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.833
He told us to...

00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:41.000
It wasn't me.
Tae-gyeong was the one who told us to.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.333
Hong Tae-gyeong and Hong Ha-min.
Sit over here, please.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.033
<c.yellow><i>The fake police officer is summoning
the boys for questioning</i></c>

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:48.700
Sit over there.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.700
- Is your name Hong Tae-gyeong?
- Yes.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.833
- How old are you?
- Eight.

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:54.933
Eight.
What about you, Mr. Hong Ha-min?

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:56.800
- Six.
- Six years old.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.400
So you, Tae-gyeong was the one
who led the act.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.533
- Yes.
- Why did you do it?

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.866
- Because it looked fun...
- Louder.

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:09.866
- Because it looked fun...
- You did it because it looked fun?

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:12.200
- Yes.
- Why? What did you do?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.433
<c.yellow><i>Suddenly Ha-min starts eating
some bread</i></c>

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.666
What...
Stop eating.

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.733
Put the bread on the table.

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:20.566
Stop crying. Don't cry.

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:22.766
Okay.
Finish what you are eating.

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:27.466
If you cry, it'll be added to your crime.
Go on and eat.

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.166
Yum, yum, chew, chew.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.866
I would like to ask you now,
Mr. Hone Tae-gyeong.

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:37.733
You father, Hong In-gyu,
what is his job?

00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:38.233
<c.yellow><i>30 minutes ago</i></c>

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:39.366
- Tae-gyeong?
- Yes?

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:41.766
- I have a favor to ask.
- Okay.

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:46.933
I'm a celebrity so I get arrested
then I can't be on TV.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.300
So don't let others know that
I'm a comedian.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.366
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:52.933
You father, Hong In-gyu,
what is his job?

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:54.266
<c.yellow><i>Hong Tae-gyeong thinks for a second</i></c>

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:55.100
Comedian.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.333
- A comedian?
- But he doesn't do that anymore.

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:02.233
- What?
- He hardly does it.

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:04.200
- But he hardly does it?
- That's right.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.133
It's like a golf program or something.

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:10.800
- A golf program?
- So he plays golf there...

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.666
- He plays golf and...
- And then he goes to meetings.

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:14.533
<c.yellow><i>A fake lie detector!</i></c>

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:16.900
- Are you sure? I'm going to test you.
- Yes.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.733
He's a comedian but he doesn't do 
funny stuff, correct?

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.600
- Yes, a little bit.
- A little bit?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.266
<c.yellow><i>Suddenly the lie detector goes off!</i></c>

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:25.066
<c.yellow><i>Oh, no!</i></c>

00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:27.066
It's the truth.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:28.966
You were right.

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:31.500
- So I heard that...
- Yes?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.400
You take your pants off
and your willy to people.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.033
- I don't do that anymore...
- Not anymore?

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:40.333
- But Ha-min...
- Mr. Hong Ha-min shows his willy?

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:47.333
We were at pork and potato stew place,
and he stuck out his willy
and his bellybutton.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.566
Mr. Hong Ha-min, did you do that?
It's okay.

00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:53.766
We went to one of the show script writers
and he stuck it out to her, too.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.266
- Who did? Ha-min?
- Yes.

00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.200
- But you didn't?
- No.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.400
So Mr. Hong Ha-min showed
his willy to her?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.600
<c.yellow><i>Ha-min is worried
and starts crying again</i></c>

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.300
It's okay.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.166
- Is it okay to show your willy to others?
- No.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:08.266
That's right.
Are you going to do it again, Ha-min?

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:09.800
Promise. Like a man.

00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:12.733
No more crying.

00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:18.633
It says here that
Ha-min is good at B-boying.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:19.866
Can you do it, Ha-min?

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.900
Wow! A head stand!
Great job.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.066
You don't have your pants on again.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.966
<c.yellow><i>Oh, no!</i></c>

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:32.033
It's okay. We came suddenly.

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:35.366
Put them on later.
Now for a science investigation.

00:04:35.366 --> 00:04:36.666
<c.yellow><i>Science Investigation:
Splitting a Double Bar</i></c>

00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:40.600
It's Science Investigation.
Hold one stick each.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.433
If you split it straight then I will reduce 
your 20-year sentence.

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:46.700
- Got it?
- Yes.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.166
Do it like a man. One, two, three!

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:51.666
<c.yellow><i>Can they do it?</i></c>

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.000
<c.yellow><i>Unfortunately they failed</i></c>

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.600
You've used one of your three chances.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.333
- One, two, three!
- Slowly.

00:04:59.333 --> 00:04:59.833
<c.yellow><i>They are trying with
such serious concentration</i></c>

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.233
Slowly.

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.600
Do it quickly. Put some power into it.
Just pull!

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.700
Just pull!

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.233
It was close.
Throw away the ones that didn't work.

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:10.066
- Now...
- But it's such a waste.

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:10.866
Ready!

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.633
Go!
Slolwy. Slowly.

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:17.033
Slolwy. Slowly.
Pull slowly.

00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:19.200
Carefully...

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:22.866

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:39.833
Just a little more...
You can use both hands.

00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:41.800
Two hands allowed.

00:05:43.766 --> 00:05:45.700

Please forgive us. 
You beg too, Tae-gyeong.

We won't play games anymore.

00:06:15.766 --> 00:06:19.533
I played games everyday. 
But I won't anymore.

That's why the kids play, too!

You don't want it?

00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:37.433
I won't play as much.
Don't know if I can stop but I'll play less.

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:42.100
You said you won't play anymore,

Yes, we really will.
You have to believe us.

- Just one more chance.
- One more chance.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.266
We really have to try hard.
Tae-gyeong, you won't play anymore, huh?

00:06:56.266 --> 00:06:58.033
Put your hands together.

00:06:58.033 --> 00:06:58.933
