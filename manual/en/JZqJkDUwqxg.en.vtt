Hi everybody, it's Melissa from CloudMom.com.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.970
So, when you're a busy mom and you have to
be like on fire all day long, busting your

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.700
kids around, knowing what's happening and
being on top of things, it's a really good

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.680
thing to master the art of learning how to
pretend that you don't drink and here's how

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.179
you can do it.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.480
When you walk into a party or you're having
people over, someone offers you a glass of

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.900
wine, you say, "Oh, you know what?

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.330
I don't really drink that much.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.440
I'll just have like a little bit.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.280
Just give me like half a glass of wine."

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.700
Did you ever see a guy say like, "Oh.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.700
Just give me a little bit.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.269
I'll just have half a beer."

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.269
No.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.239
Here's a second way you can pretend that you
don't drink, the white wine spritzer.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.820
The white wine spritzer has seltzer, lemon,
white wine and the idea is that rather than

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.140
having a glass of wine, you can have two white
wine spritzers.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.780
But, guess what?

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.939
Often times, in that first white wine spritzer,
you've got a whole glass of wine because the

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.820
official glass of wine is like this big.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.820
Okay.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.659
Checking my notes here.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.380
Third way you could pretend that you don't
drink, you're out to dinner, you're over at

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.009
a friend's house, you have a glass of wine.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.740
Someone comes out to pour you a little more.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.520
You hold your hand over your glass you're
like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.700
I'm good.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.850
I'm not gonna have anymore.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.850
That's okay.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.850
I've got a busy day tomorrow.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.850
Okay.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.280
Then, the next time the guy comes over, you
suddenly just don't really notice when he

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.680
puts wine in your glass.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.090
I'm a master of this one.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.219
The fourth way, the low tolerant self-description.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.340
"You know?

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.759
I really don't have a high tolerance for alcohol.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.119
I can have like one drink and then I'm good.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.969
That's all I need and if I have like two drinks
its way too much."

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:57.249
Okay and number five, the next day afterthought,
"Oh my God.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.889
I should not have had that second glass of
wine."

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:01.889
Okay, well.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:05.689
Was it the second or was it the third or was
it the fourth?

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.990
Who knows because who was keeping track?

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.069
Certainly not you because you were busy pretending
that you don't drink.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.069
I've done it.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.209
I know a lot of my friends have done it.

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.209
'Fess up.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.290
Do you pretend that you don't drink?

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.510
I want an honest confession on my site over
at CloudMom.com.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.281
Thanks so much for watching and treat yourselves
to a glass of wine tonight as long as you're

00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:29.340
not getting out of control, I think it's fine.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.000
Thanks for watching.
