Hello everybody,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.100
today we are going to discuss
YAMAHA THR5 guitar amp.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.930
This is not just a 10W guitar amp,
this is also a sound blaster.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.170
Though this amp is rather small,
it has a lot of different functions.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.620
So, from left to right:

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.710
tuner + tap, tap/delay,
different sounds emulation,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.620
gain, master, tone, two
"effects" handles and volume.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.610
There is a USB-port at the rear panel, so
that you could connect it to your computer,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.640
as well as battery unit for 8 AA batteries,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.100
so that you could take this amp
to a beach and play metal there.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.090
It also looks great in the darkness.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.060
And it sounds really awesome.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.150
We'll use SE Electronics SE X1
microphone to hear that.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.350
Clean.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.100
Crunch

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.140
Lead

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.490
Brit

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.830
Modern

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.430
Let's listen to some
effects - phaser and delay.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.650
Tremolo and spring reverb

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.360
Chorus and hall reverb

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.210
Let's see, how it works
as a sound interface.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.810
You can record your music
at home, using YAMAHA THR5,

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.610
without caring about any microphones
or emulation, everything is already here.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.130
YAMAHA THR5 set includes
a disk with Cubase 6,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.090
but we use Logis, because
we have already installed it.
