00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.560
Determine where the roller straps will be
located on the door.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.220
On the back of the roller strap,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.460
measure down ¾” from the outside
diameter of the roller.

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.629
Measure from this line to the center of  the bottom fastener hole.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.320
Transfer this measurement onto the door.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.920
Align the roller strap to the
mark on the door.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.600
Using a Vix bit, pre-drill the hole  for the
fastener.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.040
Align the roller strap and fasten to the door.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.530
Proper location of the roller
strap will allow the rail

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.930
to pass between the roller and the top of
the door

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.210
with a 3/32” gap in between.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.600
Align the handle on the door in the desired location.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.240
Using a Vix bit pre-drill the hole for the fastener.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.080
Secure the handle using the fasteners provided.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.160
Mark the location on the door for the flush mount pull,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.920
be sure to make room for the door overlap

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.000
in the opened and closed positions.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.120
Router out the door to the depth of the pull.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.800
Install the pull with the provided nails.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.960
Measure for the rail bracket installation.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.600
Location for the top of the bracket is:

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.840
desired gap between door and floor (typically about ¼”)

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.200
plus door height,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.880
plus 1-1/2”.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.360
Mark this location on the door frame or wall.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.000
Using a ¼ - 20 tap in a hand drill,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.800
tap the ends of the rail for the end caps.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.200
Install one of the end caps.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.560
Slide the brackets onto the rail.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.760
Lift the rail into place,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.240
align the top of the brackets to the desired mark

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.880
and pre-drill holes for the bracket fasteners.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.920
Fasten one end bracket, then using a level,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.760
align the rail and fasten the rest of the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.520
brackets to the header.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.320
Slide the door onto the rail from the open end

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.200
and install the end cap.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.240
Center the door in the opening,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.400
and mark on the door trim the location of the door.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.680
Apply the door bumper onto the Door Stop.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.880
set the door in the closed position and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.640
align the door bumper to stop the door in this position.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.000
Mark the location of the Door Stop on the trim,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.280
pre-drill the holes and fasten the Door Stop

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.840
using the fasteners included in the Door Stop Kit.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.160
Secure the Center Guide to the trim,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.960
using the fasteners included in the Center Guide kit.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.960
This guide should capture the door in the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.680
fully opened and fully closed position.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.200
Align the other Door Stop and fasten to the trim,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.680
using the same method as the other Door Stop.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.000
This completes the installation of the Quiet Glide Rolling Barn Door Hardware.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.160
