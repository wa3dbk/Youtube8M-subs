00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.780
If you ask me, the once maligned minivan is
at the precipice of a comeback.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.599
Several new or updated models are coming to
market over the next couple of years.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.649
And for 2015, Toyota is keeping their popular
Sienna fresh by adding to its comfort, capabilities

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:22.649
and safety.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:27.290
2015_Toyota_Sienna_XLE_01It was 2010 the last
time Toyota debuted an all-new Sienna and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.350
it could be 3 more years before it happens
again.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.829
So this 2015 primping serves to bridge that
gap.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.790
Sorry, but if you were expecting something
less frumpy looking you’ll be disappointed.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.100
Toyota says this Sienna sports a revised front
grille and new slimmer headlight units but

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.650
if you can tell the difference than you have
a keener eye than me.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.500
Underneath its bulbous skin is a stiffened
chassis thanks to over 140 additional spot

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.500
welds.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.160
And because minivans are ostensibly big boxes
on wheels, that’s an important and welcome

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.829
upgrade to the driver and passengers alike,
improving overall comfort and quietness.

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:10.570
Luckily for Toyota, minivan shoppers put attractiveness
pretty far down their priority list and so

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.460
it’s the Sienna’s interior than sees the
bulk of the changes.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.000
Surface materials are of higher quality now
with stitched surfaces and additional soft

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.740
touch points replace harder plastics.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.720
An emphasis on safety is huge in this segment
and the Sienna now gets a 4th LATCH point

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.190
in the 3rd row, a new airbag in the front-passenger
seat cushion and larger side curtain airbags.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.490
But the most visible changes are seen on the
center stack featuring a more intuitive layout

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.799
and the addition of the fresh Entune Premium
Audio system with navigation and App Suite

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.850
– optional on this higher level XLE trim
for $775.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.630
This touch screen system can also be voice
activated, possesses the right amount of redundant

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.960
knobs and works simply.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.939
A backup cam is now standard on all grades.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.060
Are you tired of shouting to the kids in the
3rd row?

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.390
Well, the little ones no longer have the “I
can't hear you excuse.”

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.970
With Driver Easy Speak enabled your voice
is carried through the Sienna’s speaker

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.910
system all the way to the rear.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.670
A new steering wheel and color Multi-information
display packed with useful information round

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.099
out the changes.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.200
And having a blind spot monitor and rear cross
traffic alert are perfect minivan accoutrements.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.751
If you’re the person driving, the Sienna’s
3.5-liter V6 pleasantly surprises with its

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:39.220
lusty acceleration stemming from 266 horses
and a 6-speed auto.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.590
Sienna is the only AWD minivan currently on
the market though this tester is a front-driver.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.540
Gas mileage is rated at 18mpg city/25mpg which
is highly competitive.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.960
As for the kids, the Sienna offers up huge
amounts of space.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.950
This 8-passenger Sienna provides the option
of stowing the 2nd rows middle seat in the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.300
back for times when you'd rather have a center
console that slides with the seat on the left.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.989
It’s a little cumbersome to switch out but
the idea is a good one.

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.030
Even with the third row seat upright, there's
still oodles of room to store your stuff as

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.690
well as convenient grocery bag hooks to keep
your goods in place.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.530
Getting the 3rd row to disappear is an easy
3 step process but the 2nd row seats are they

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.840
to stay; there’s no clever Stow ‘N Go
feature so the best you can do is fold them

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.230
down or remove them from the Sienna altogether.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.400
The 150 cubic feet of cargo room is especially
impressive.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.260
When sitting in the 2nd row, the seats slide
an amazing 23” rearward and also recline

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.550
so even the tallest folks will find comfort
here.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.970
Ditto for the 3rd row which is accessed from
either side with an easy tip and slide feature.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.050
The airiness and comfort levels are top notch.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.220
Yet despite the 2015 updates the Sienna still
feels like it’s lost some of the swagger

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.940
it touted after its last redesign.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.599
On paper it’s solid and it has the resume
to deliver the premium minivan experience,

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.109
but its intangibles leave me feeling somewhat
ambivalent about its overall appeal, especially

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.410
when looking at the stylish new Kia Sedona.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:27.989
Competitively priced, this model stickers
for $37,090.
