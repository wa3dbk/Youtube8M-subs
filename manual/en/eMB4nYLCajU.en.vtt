00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
one, two, three, four!

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.380
Rev up your engines!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.760
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.600
it would certainly be handy if you could
have a mechanic in the trunk of your car

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.970
for emergencies, but since the odds
against that happening are pretty high

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
here's the next best thing, I'm going to
show you things that you should have in

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.230
your trunk to keep you safe while
driving and the first thing is a

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.460
flashlight,
but not just any flashlight this is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.879
called blue line and not only does it
have a bright light, but if you're

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.559
stranded at night, it's also a warning
device, people will see that for miles

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
you don't have to worry about people
running into you, now the next thing you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.140
should have in your trunk is a good set
of jumper cables, now you don't want a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.559
cheap set, these are made out of copper
and they're thick, if you get the cheap

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.360
aluminum ones, heck they'll melt when you
jump a dead battery and make sure you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.740
get ones that are long enough, these are
15 feet long, so you can reach around

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.110
stuff and the next thing to have is a can
of brake fluid, because if your brakes get a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.640
leak, hey you can pour it in and at least
make it to a safe place, rather than be

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.350
stranded and speaking or not getting
stranded, there's the handyman's helper

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.340
duct tape, don't be without it, so you get
a hole in a radiator hose, hey you can

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.210
duct tape it closed, it'll seal it for a
while, so at least you can get to a safe

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.799
place, but of course that won't do you
any good unless you have some antifreeze

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.960
so keep a jug antifreeze in the trunk too,
now another thing I always put my car's

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.789
is a decent jack, I can't stand those
cheap little Jack's and cars come with I

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.289
go out buy a good jack that'll Jack the
car up in the air safely and this one only

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.270
costs 39 bucks,
I'd much rather rely on a solid metal

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.640
four-wheel Jack than those flimsy little
cranks they give you, now everyone hates

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.140
being stranded with a flat tire, so I put
one of these little husky pumps in every

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.810
car I own, they just plug into the
cigarette lighter and they have a cord

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.930
long enough to reach any of your tires,
they even have a built-in pressure gauge

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.400
so you don't even need a tire gauge and
even a tiny little pump like this it'll

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.000
fill an empty tire up in as little as
four minutes and of course don't forget

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.680
to have a fire extinguisher in case the
unmentionable happens, if either your car

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.719
or somebody else's car starts on fire,
you can save a life with one of these

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.019
just make sure you get the right
extinguisher, one that's rated for B and

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.840
C for both liquids and electrical fires
and the last thing I'm talking about

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.290
today are gloves,
keep a good pair all gloves in the trunk

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.189
because if you're going somewhere but
you got to mess with your car, hey

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.389
nothing's worse than having filthy hands
when you arrive, so have some gloves

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.530
ready and I like these safe grip gloves,
because they got long collars on them, so

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.980
the dirt can't get on you and they're
nice and thick you can use them over

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.669
many times and best of all they have
these little crenulations on the

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:22.700
fingertips, so you can pick up small
objects and they don't slip, so if you

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.329
can't get a mechanic to live in the
trunk of your car, at least you know what

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:33.859
to put there instead and remember if
your car has any problems just visit the

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:41.390
Scotty Kilmer channel, before it's too
late!
