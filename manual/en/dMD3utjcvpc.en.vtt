Okay, we're back to show you the final procedure
for the Queso Dip and we've got a container's

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.420
worth. It was one block of extra melt and
we used 2 parts of half and half cream and

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.450
1 part of heavy whipping cream. We melted
this down in the microwave on high power.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.971
It took a total of about 8 to 9 minutes and
periodically we would pull out the container

00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:29.360
and stir with a rubber spatula just to mix
all that nice cream and cheese together. Earlier

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.970
on we had poured off some of the cream, the
residual cream that was left over but we ended

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.310
up pouring that back in and just slowly folding
it. So this is the consistency that we want

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.260
and it is a nice color as well. Here are our
vegetables which have just been sitting and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.870
cooling at room temperature so we are going
to go ahead and fold these in and I wasn't

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.970
sure if I was going to use all of them. So
I am just going to spatula off half and fold

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.830
those in and I'm thinking we are probably
going to use the whole batch to be honest

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.630
with you. Again, the recipe and the ratios
for this run a gamut but this is just a real

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.070
good starter recipe so that you can see what
kind of feel you are going for and you really

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.540
get to see what kind of a difference the fresh
vegetables make and again at the very end,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.800
we folded in some fresh cilantro and we seasoned
those vegetables with chili powder as well

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.690
as a pinto bean seasoning which was mostly
Camino with some other seasonings in there

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.570
as well. So this is the finished deal and
this is about the color that I want and the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.670
consistency that I want so that as you dip
into it, you get a nice flavor and you get

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.720
a nice sample of all the vegetables that we've
gone through the trouble of throwing in there

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.950
so it's nice and chunky. This will hold in
the refrigerator in between servings and you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.320
can just heat it up as you need it and that's
our finished Queso there. You can put that

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.259
in a serving bowl for your guests or keep
it in a crock pot at very, very low heat and

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.439
that way they can serve and eat along with
it. So that's the finished queso.
