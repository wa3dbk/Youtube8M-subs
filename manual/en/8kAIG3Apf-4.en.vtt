00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.600
How to Clean with Baking Soda.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.290
When it comes to household versatility, baking
soda is king.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.210
Here are just some of the many cleaning uses
for sodium bicarbonate.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.329
You will need Baking soda Water A sponge A
vacuum Salt White vinegar Laundry detergent

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.519
A cotton swab A toothbrush and a bowl.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.519
Step 1.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.890
Get rid of stains on countertops, sinks, bathtubs,
and any nonporous surface you can think of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.570
with a paste of three parts baking soda to
one part water.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.120
Apply the paste to a damp sponge, scrub away,
and rinse.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.030
Baking soda works well on metallic surfaces,
like chrome or stainless steel.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.070
It won’t scratch the surface, but it’s
abrasive enough to remove residue and leave

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.620
the metal shining.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.620
Step 2.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.240
An open box of baking soda in the refrigerator
or a cupboard will absorb odors and excess

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.240
moisture.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.690
A sprinkle in shoes and socks helps reduce
foot odor.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.510
To combat a stinky carpet, drizzle with dry
baking soda and vacuum it up after 15 minutes.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.280
Using a bowl instead of an open container
is more effective because more baking soda

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.750
is exposed.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.750
Step 3.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.200
Ant infestation?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.390
Sprinkling equal parts baking soda and salt
near high-traffic ant areas will keep them

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.579
in their place.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.590
Step 4.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.670
Pour half a cup of baking soda into a clogged
drain, followed by a cup of white vinegar.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.590
Let the solution bubble for a few minutes,
and then flush it down with plenty of hot

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.590
water.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.150
This method won’t clear heavy-duty clogs,
but it works well for minor ones.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.150
Step 5.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.009
Add a half-cup of baking soda to a load of
wash along with your regular detergent.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.640
It helps keep clothes brighter, longer.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.640
Step 6.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.740
To remove oil and dirt from hairbrushes and
combs, first remove excess hair; then soak

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.569
in a tall container of warm water with a teaspoon
of baking soda.

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:48.630
Step 7.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.139
To reduce itching, mix baking soda with just
enough water to make a paste, and apply it

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:55.009
with a cotton swab to the bug bite.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.029
The paste can also help relieve a painful
sunburn.

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:59.369
Step 8.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.729
Sprinkle a small amount of baking soda onto
a wet toothbrush to clean and whiten your

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.729
teeth naturally.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.039
Practice this method sparingly, as it will
wear down your enamel if used too often.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.420
Did you know In 2007, a company unveiled a
process that converts harmful carbon dioxide

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.530
emissions from smokestacks into consumer-grade
baking soda.
