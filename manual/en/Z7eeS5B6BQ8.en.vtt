00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.940
Really what you need to know about ISO is
it's measuring the film sensitivity to light.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.530
There's a couple phrases that are used around
this. You'll hear somebody say, "Oh, that's

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.310
a slow film". Well a slow film has a low ISO
rating, which may be as low as 50 or 100.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.670
Those are typically the slowest. Those are
for portraits or for still lifes, where your

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.600
image really isn't moving and it's extremely
well lit, because that film is not as sensitive

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.850
to light, so it needs to be exposed to the
light longer. On the other end, there are

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.199
fast films. Fast films have a very high ISO
rating, maybe 800, 1600, some can even go

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:53.250
as high as 3200. Those are used when you don't
have a lot of light and you need the exposure

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.860
to be quick so you can't leave the shutter
open for long periods of time, so you use

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.210
this higher speed film. Or, if you're shooting
a sporting event and you want to stop someone

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.840
in action a high speed film, again since the
shutter doesn't need to be open as long, can

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.750
open and close and freeze that person in the
frame. With that, though, you have to make

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.899
some choices. With a low ISO...On an actual
piece of film there's these silver halide

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:33.369
crystals. On a lower rated ISO, like 50 or
100 speed, there's virtually no sign of these

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.299
crystals on the printed image. Where in a
higher ISO there tends to be very visible

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.930
what they call "grain". The way this translates
to digital is pretty similar. You have to

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.670
make a sacrifice. If you're shooting a portrait,
you want to make sure your camera is set at

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.119
a low ISO, and if you're shooting sports you
want to change the ISO setting on your camera

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.320
to a higher ISO. But the same kinds of things
happen, you'll get a clearer, sharper image

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.659
at the low ISO under the right lighting conditions,
and at the higher ISO you may start to get

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.599
what's called "noise". It's not exactly the
same thing as "grain", because the grain was

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:19.110
actually the little silver halide crystals.
Where now it's more a disruption with the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.239
way that the sensor absorbs the light. So
it can give you something similar to grain,

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.250
but it's not exactly the same thing. But there's
trade-offs, so you have to decide what's best

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.320
for the type of image that you're shooting.
