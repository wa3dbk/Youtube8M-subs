00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.460
Simi Atal: Art itself is a visual language.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.139
Mark Tucker: Our society needs a lens with
which to reflect upon themselves and art does

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.139
that for you.

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.799
It's the fabric that holds many communities
together.

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.030
Jesus Hinojosa: This class has given me a
lot more self-confidence.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.260
David Disney: We are very interested in commissioning
this piece for Palmer Commons, because we

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.510
are always looking for opportunities to build
vibrancy and a sense of community through

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.400
the arts, and we are very familiar with Mark
Tuckerâ€™s work with the Lloyd Scholars Program,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.730
and we are very excited to able to collaborate
with him on this.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.330
Mark Tucker: Of course, this might be the
only art course they ever take, the question

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.400
is, what's the takeaway from a course like
this?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.900
And my hope is that even though they may not
go out to become Art Majors, that they will

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.680
at least figure out how to access creativity.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.040
Jesus Hinojosa: When I was young I used to
really like art, then as I grew older I lost

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.439
my interest, and now that I am in college
I just wanted to regain that interest.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.189
Mark Tucker: Collaboration is a huge part
of this course.

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.499
To take 11 really bright students and to sit
them down and say, hey, you are all going

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.729
to design one design, that's really tough
to do.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.080
Simi Atal: Being in a group was -- it was
difficult at times, I am not going to lie

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.890
about that, just because there are so many
clashing like ideas.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.520
Mark Tucker: And the design normally takes
place towards the beginning of the course

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.590
where you don't necessarily know each other
that well.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.170
So that's tricky territory.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.840
Simi Atal: Learning to paint together and
have them like still mash and look like they

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.109
belong together, that's been a growing experience
for me.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.000
I was kind of opposed to the idea.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.180
I was, oh, I would rather have it like the
old mural and have my own little piece to

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.109
work on altogether.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.119
As we have progressed through this, I mean,
I think it looks really good and that kind

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.420
of surprised me.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.592
Mark Tucker: I think what's really incredible
about these students is the fact that they

00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:15.500
know at the very beginning that they are going
to be making art that they are going to be

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.049
giving away to the public.

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.049
It's part of the public good.

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.810
It isnâ€™t something that they are going to
hold on to and keep.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.959
And when you think about that, especially
in this case where it's a major work they

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.341
are making, they are really putting their
hearts and souls into it, and they are being

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:36.290
asked to give it away, that really takes an
enormous amount of kind of self-reflection,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.709
why am I in this course, what does this mean?

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.780
Jesus Hinojosa: Creating art has really helped
me come out of that shell and taking more

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:52.329
risk in just general ways; take harder classes,
look for challenges, not be scared about stuff,

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.910
just go out there, putting yourself out there.
