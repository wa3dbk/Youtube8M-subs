00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.080
Hey everyone welcome back to my channel this is Dori I'm a teacher of

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.110
English and today I'm going to show you the strategy and plan

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.110
you should follow in order to write an informal

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.150
letter in the IELTS general writing
task 1

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.390
okay keep in mind that the majority of times they're going to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.699
ask you to write a formal letter in the exam

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.130
and if you want to watch the video about how to write

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.180
a formal letter you can watch this video over here in this link

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.230
but today let's go and see how an

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.250
informal task would look like okay this is your
task let's read it

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.180
okay it is obviously an
informal letter

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.610
since you write to a friend you have to
begin your letter with dear

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.579
and since this is your friend you
can come up with any name you like in

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:23.130
this case

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.509
so let's just say that your friend's
name is John

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.630
so you have Dear John after that things are
simple you don't have to worry about

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.180
this it is a letter to a friend
however do not get

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.119
too carried away because it is a
friendly letter and start writing

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.509
the story of your life

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.759
no you should still be organized so

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.530
you will use one

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.729
paragraph for each of these points

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.759
over here let's read

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.840
the first point again 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.340
so in the
first paragraph you're going to do

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.240
exactly that in an informal tone

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.690
this means that your tone can be friendly
and conversational

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.990
as you would speak to him you can use

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.110
informal expressions phrasal verbs

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.370
thanks for example instead of

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.300
thank you and you can also use
contractions

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.040
of verbs for example 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.880
you can
use all these

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.940
in a formal letter you can't alright

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.720
So, let's see our first paragraph

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.700
as you can see in order to

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.400
to develop each of these three points
over here you need

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.459
to invent some things but just use
your imagination and it will be fun

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.160
also notice that my tone in the first
paragraph

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.870
over here

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.360
is very friendly and warm

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.989
and I use humour since this is a very
close friend of mine

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.530
we went on holiday together right I use

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.050
informal language phrasal verbs and
contractions

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.310
of verbs of course don't overdo
it 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.239
this is a close friend but still the
letter is going to be read

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.290
by an examiner so be decent and polite

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.970
no rude phrases or swearing or anything
like that ok

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.660
now accordingly  you'll write one
paragraph for this second point

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.260
let's read it 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.030
and your last paragraph is going to be about the third point

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.660
again despite being informal you
should still be organized

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.540
and coherent so you can explain why you
didn't write sooner

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.100
and then remember your holidays again
and consequently

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.100
invite him

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.940
to spend time some time together again
do you see how smoothly this goes from paragraph

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.259
to paragraph one thought leads you to
the next one

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.389
even if you come up with your own ideas

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:35.180
you see? Now let's see how you can close
your letter

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.370
of course no "yours faithfully" or "yours
sincerely" here

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.870
these are only for formal letters here

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.009
in an informal letter you will close
your letter with one of the following

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.669
Let's see 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.360
before that though you can still

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.780
choose to write 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.000
you can use this

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.960
Both in a formal and an informal letter
so we will close our

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.800
letter with

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.389
I'm looking forward to hearing from you
and we will choose

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.030
the phrase all the best and our name for
example in this case

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.599
Patrick okay that's it

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.060
if you like to see or read the rest
of the letter you can do it here

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.650
in this link now you just need to
improve your grammar syntax vocabulary

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.530
and please

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.830
your spelling as always good luck with
your exam
