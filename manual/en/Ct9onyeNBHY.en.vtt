In this video we will be running some of these plugs down through the hammer mill.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.600
These are just ones I clipped off the end of extension cords

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.200
romacs and stuff that i found at my local scrap yard

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.740
They all have a little bit of copper and brass in them

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.740
I talked to my scrap yard and they just cut them off and throw them in the the tin pile, they don't even save them

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.820
they just put them in with the other light scrap they get

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.460
I'm going to run this stuff down the hammer mill at 3/8

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.280
of an inch gap spacing

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.620
Here are all the plugs and ends after we ran them through the 3/8 hammer mill.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.340
You can see a lot of plastic and copper wire in there

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.560
Here is a little bit of brass I pulled out.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.340
Than I spread it out on the floor and ran a magnet across it and here is the steel we got out of it

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.060
Screws, plates of a few little transformers that went down.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.740
That's all the steel we pulled out.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.860
There are your two cuts

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.340
