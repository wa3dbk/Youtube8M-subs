00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.369
My name is Katie, I was born in Kenya
and when I was young I moved to El Salvador

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.910
and for the last twelve years I've lived in
Hampshire

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.120
so you could say I'm a real cultural mix.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.920
I am a student here at University of Winchester

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.250
and I'm studying Childhood, Youth and Community
Studies and Sociology

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.660
One of the projects that I was set was on
identity, which got me thinking.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.320
What is Cultural Identity?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.680
And how does it add to my community here at University of Winchester?

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.160
Diversity? Well that is a big question!

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.000
Diversity means... for instance, having staff
from different origins or language.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.289
It's about embracing I would say different
cultures, people from different backgrounds.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.590
Seeing people in a different way by their
ethnicity background

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.710
Religion and ethnicities, also abilities,
sexual orientation.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.810
That no one has been discriminated

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.850
Everyone has been included in the community regardless of their race

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.140
I've been here nearly ten years and it's great

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.189
to see not just the number of Asian people
increasing

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.020
but people from other walks of life and other
nationalities increasing too, which is great!

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.070
You're allowed to be different as well, that's
the important thing.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.189
You don't have to conform to expectations
of what should a professor be?

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.080
Or what should be a tutor be? Or what should a lecturer be?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.280
Or what should a student be?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.080
They can be themselves!

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.430
I think the word I would sum that up with
would be

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.690
"Acceptance"

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.940
No one wants to be discriminated against,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.170
no one wants to be looked upon in a negative
way

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.049
because of their sexuality, race or whatever and I think it's easier for people to get

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.060
along if we accept each other and our differences
as well,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.020
that's the difficult thing.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.400
I was in my teens when the troubles and the conflict of Northern Island broke out

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.340
and grew up with hatred,
segregation

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.510
which resulted in violence, and diversity
was just not accepted, it wasn't understood,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.680
it wasn't tolerated
and, in a sense, growing up in that divided

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.450
society for me, personally,
when I entered into a professional career,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.450
my main focus has been to reduce prejudice,
to accept difference, to respect difference,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.190
and that still continues here at the university

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.660
Just a normal black lady on campus, that's how I wanted to be identified.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.620
Different from everyone, being unique in my own way.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.080
My passport may be part of my identity, but

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.840
who I really am is half British and half Filipino.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.140
Actually by my name because I got married to an Indian.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.780
I see myself as English, if I may say so

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.600
and obviously Sierra Leonean as well.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.060
What nationality I am?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.960
I would say I am Scottish, I think.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.510
International non-native Lecturer

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.660
I always say Jedi!

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.660
When you come in and feel being included in

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.080
all the activities, I think you don't feel
being out, you don't feel out. Yeah

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.510
It's the diversity, the student diversity,
really kind of makes it buzz.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.840
The students say it reflects on all the students
and the students start to feel it themselves

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.460
and they're not suddenly coming from this
very small enclosed community where they grew up

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.820
and then went to school and they come to University

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.400
and they think WOW!
The world just opens up and that's great

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.810
I found out that it doesn't even matter where
you were born

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.360
or where you come from
that the University values those differences

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.680
and it's those differences that create a harmonious
and an amazing learning experience for the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.560
students as well as the staff
It is also an indication of Britain's growing

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.530
demographic, which I for one am very proud
to be part of.
