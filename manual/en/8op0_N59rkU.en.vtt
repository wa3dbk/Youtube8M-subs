00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Stranger lights were seen over Greifswald.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.840
Now you might say yes, "All nonsense", but researchers do not take it lightly and try to find out what it could be:

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.440
A case for Karin Rubolt.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.790
What is that? On 24.08.1990

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.550
Tourists filmed these strange lights over the Bay of Greifswald.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:32.980
Now, 22 years after the event, UFO researcher Marius Alexander and Knörr Kettmann want to solve the mystery.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.770
This is actually the biggest UFO case in Germany.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.380
To date, we haven't been able to clearly identify what it is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.470
and thus we are dealing with a real UFO case here, that is, an unidentified flying object.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.900
A military exercise? Marius Kettmann has investigated.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.960
Officially, there was no military exercise.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.680
If you imagine that it really was military, then it gets interesting because you can ask,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.680
Why has this not been solved to date, what kind of weapons systems are these, which army is it?

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.680
UFO skeptics still believe in military exercises

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.680
perhaps a secret operation? For example

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.280
signal ammunition. Which does not come into question, as it burns up within seven minutes.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.280
As short-lived, the so-called flares, which are used by the Navy.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.280
But the Greifswald lights were much longer in the sky.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.280
Then it is still unidentified

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.600
and what it was, then? It beats me!

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040
As UFO researcher one needs to approach this in a rational way.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.040
The UFO researchers set out to travel from Xanten to Usedom and meet eyewitnesses

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.040
Jens Hollatz sat with his girlfriend in the beer garden in Ahlbeck back then.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.040
Hollatz: And then I have, back there,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.940
between the two trees - perhaps you can show it -

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.620
above them were these luminous objects.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.140
Have you noticed anything at that time, heard aircrafts? Seen any Aircraft?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.560
Nothing, silence. And there, these moving pictures up and down.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.560
The native Usedom citizen has never seen such a thing before.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.990
The encounter with the inexplicable gives him no peace.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.570
This is nothing out of the ordinary, as simple as that. I'm not a UFO fanatic or so,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.570
but it would have been interesting to know: What's really been there?

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.570
Also, the next witness remembers exactly the day when

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.570
suddenly the sky began to glow.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.110
It was a phenomenon, the whole stage was full of people

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.480
were the lights that hung in the sky like flares

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.810
Kettmann: Can you remember how long you have seen this about?

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.660
Witness: An hour, for certain.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.030
Kettmann knows: No ammunition glows that long

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.960
This is very interesting and goes against the military even more.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.330
The Greifswald phenomenon remains a mystery, but the UFO researchers stay on the ball.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.560
Maybe they find him, the ultimate proof.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.660
The hope is, of course, in all cases that are not resolved there, that at some point perhaps is the note or evidence

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.030
will come that perhaps there is something intelligent, which is not from this world.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.030
[Hans Tanz, Ariane Fuchs]

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.240
 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.600
 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.200
 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.750
Däniken was a former waiter. Yeah, this is no joke.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.750
I found it so remarkable ...
