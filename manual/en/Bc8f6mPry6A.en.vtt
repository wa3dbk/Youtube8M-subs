00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.759
Mills Mess, this is name after Steve Mills
and it's a pattern that everybody wants to

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.450
learn as soon as they see it because it looks
so cool. What Mills Mess is broken to its

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:22.939
simplest form is it's the full shower in both
directions alternating like this. So I'm doing

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.880
the full shower in this direction and then
in this direction and I'm doing it for two

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.290
throws in each direction and it snakes back
and forth. This pattern is broken down into

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.660
two parts. One is the U ball, which is represented
by the white ball. If you follow the white

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.160
ball, you'll notice that all it does is travel
in a U pattern, back and forth underneath

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.610
and it never does anything other than that.
So where most people run into a problem is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:06.560
what's going on with the top balls, the two
red ones. So when you're doing this, you have

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.590
to remember that the trick consists of your
arms going back and forth crossing over top

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.740
of each other. So, what you're doing is just
like in regular cascade, you're throwing the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.530
two balls up and they're switching hands.
You're starting with your hands crossed and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:35.170
you're going to throw with your top hand first,
this way. Okay. Your hands will then uncrossed

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:43.899
and you'll throw the other ball from the same
direction and catch it on the other side with

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.570
your hands crossed the other direction. First
ball goes up and you catch it with the other

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:00.499
hand. So, I'm just doing it one ball, I'm
doing this. It's going up, I'm catching it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:07.090
and catching the second ball underneath the
other hand. Once you can get that down back

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.920
and forth smoothly, just like that, you'll
kind of start to see where the third ball

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:27.500
fits in.
And that is Mills Mess.
