00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(sweet piano music)

00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:11.389
- Would you like to dance?

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:20.446
- I mean, you might have to
just imagine it a little bit.

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:28.485
- This is so random, when
did this light come on?

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.152
- This feels so right.

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:31.533
- It does.
- It does.

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:36.375
- Holy cow, this is intense, man.

00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:39.085
Lights and stuff, bro?

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:41.739
Dang, all this for me?

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:42.925
- Just for you.

00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:44.937
- So kind of you, man.

00:00:44.937 --> 00:00:46.214
- What are doing with our hands?

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:50.516
Dum, dum, dum, we just ended
up doing that one instead.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.833
One, two, uh, uh, perfect, okay.

00:00:56.838 --> 00:00:58.118
What's your favorite color.
- Pink.

00:00:58.118 --> 00:00:58.930
Let's start there.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.645
- Pink? Can we make all the lights pink?

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:01.948
We're almost pink.

00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:03.718
We're a little yellow-ish.

00:01:03.718 --> 00:01:04.891
- Who's doing this?

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:05.947
- Magic, I don't know.

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:06.858
- Why you doing this?

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:07.913
- Why? Because I can.

00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:08.993
That's really it.

00:01:08.993 --> 00:01:10.659
I mean, "Why not?" is the real question.

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.045
I feel like I'm taking
such wide steps here.

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:41.315
So, one, two, three, one,
two, three, one, two, three.

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.272
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- That's it.

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:46.075
- We've been married 47 years

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:48.612
and we've been dancing for ever.

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:51.520
- I need to know in great
detail how this happened.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.368
- Okay, so it was night time

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:56.195
and there was like a black
cow and okay, funny story--

00:01:58.045 --> 00:01:59.752
- About me is that I'm very nervous,

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.748
and I walked past three times.

00:02:01.748 --> 00:02:03.502
- You walked back and
forth trying to do this.

00:02:03.502 --> 00:02:05.423
- Yes, I had to work up the nerve.

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:27.765
- Thank you so much.
- I appreciate it, thank you.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.088
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- Thank you.

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:44.212
- Have a good day.
