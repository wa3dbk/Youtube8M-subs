00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.600
[theme music]

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.320
Ever wonder why we like...do things for each other?

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.920
Like why we help our friends move even though we hate doing it?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.400
And, for that matter, why a bee will sacrifice its life by stinging an intruder to protect the hive?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.780
Why would a vampire bat regurgitate blood into the mouth of another bat that hasn't eaten that day?

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.360
Why?! That's a very nice vampire bat...I guess.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.860
Eugh!

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.440
That's gross in like so many ways.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.740
It turns out that this is actually a pretty big question.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.840
Things like this have been stumping scientists for years.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.900
Charles Darwin thought that altruistic behavior

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.380
was a potentially deal-breaking flaw for his theory of natural selection.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.340
If the game was survival of the fittest,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.780
natural selection couldn't possibly favor a behavior that made us less likely to survive.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.580
Or could it?

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.640
Darwin studied beehives and realized that since sterile worker bees were helping their blood relatives,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.160
especially the queen,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.820
natural selection might favor altruism within related groups.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.740
A hundred years later, in 1964, a British scientist named William Hamilton

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.380
actually came up with an equation to explain this.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.260
He figured altruism could evolve as a trait if:

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.600
genetic relatedness, times the benefit of the action, was greater than the cost of the individual.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.360
In other words:

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.740
since some behavior is hereditary

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.880
the genes responsible for altruistic behavior

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.460
could evolve if it's benefit exceeded whatever cost it had for the individual

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.060
because it helped the individual's relatives enough to make it worthwhile.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.360
Hamilton called this idea "Inclusive Fitness"

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.320
expanding Darwin's definition of fitness

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.320
basically how many babies someone is making

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.420
to include offspring of other relatives.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.560
Hamilton's ideas were a humongous hit with other scientists

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.640
because for starters it explains stuff like ant colonies.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.320
Ants have virtually no personal lives,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.500
everything they do, they do for the good of the colony.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980
And worker ants share three quarters of their genes.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.220
They're actually more closely related to their sister ants

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.820
than they would be to their offspring.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.440
So, according to Hamilton's equation, each individual ant has an exceptionally large genetic stake

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.640
in the survival of the colony

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.380
But Hamilton's ideas do not explain why some animals help others that they're not even related to.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.120
Take humans, for example. We are deeply social animals, also exceptionally altruistic.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.680
In fact, a lot of scientists think that humans evolved our huge, super smart brains in response to the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.820
overwhelming benefits of engaging in selfless behavior.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.260
Because it turns out sharing and cooperating are very mentally taxing.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.680
Seriously, ask any three-year-old.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.600
But if you think about it, you can see how we evolved to be altruistic for really self-serving reasons.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.600
Like helping a friend move totally sucks, but you do it because you can conceive of a time in the future when that friend will help you move.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.220
Or when that friend will drive out into the country to help you change a flat tire, or whatever.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.500
Same with the bats, barfing some blood into your neighbour insures that someday, if you don't get something to eat,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.660
somebody will come and vomit blood into your mouth,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.960
and they'll expect the same from you in return, and so on, and so on.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.540
Hamilton's equation does not explain that behavior, which complicates things, because equations are nice and comforting to have,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.040
if you're a scientist. But if you can cooperate with others and resist the urge to horde resources,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.920
knowing you'll be rewarded later, you'll be acting a lot like ants, bees and vampire bats.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.540
Which makes me just feel all warm and snuggly all over.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.220
Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow. I hope you have friends good enough to vomit blood in your mouth when you need it.
