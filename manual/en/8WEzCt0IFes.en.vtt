00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"The Good Judge"

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.200
Court is summoned by the Crown attorney, Mrs. Rienlà.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.100
Hello, your honour. I would like to talk to you about this trial... 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.800
where the people are accused of having made obscene pornographic material...

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.300
that is against the law.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.300
The material features the perverts who are sitting on the dock.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.300
I would like to know where we are with the trial.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.300
Thank you for your question.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.500
I’m analyzing the video’s content...

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.400
in order to determine if the material is legal or not in the country. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.500
Thanks, but it’s now been five months that we’re at this stage.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.500
I must watch all the scenes in all angles,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.550
in slow motion, very slow motion and extremely extremely slow motion.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.000
Yes, but it has been five months now.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.000
I understand your impatience,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.050
but the video lasts over five minutes you see.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.000
I must analyze Sarah’s, Paul’s and Erica’s performances...

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.550
in order to determine if they are legal or not.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.500
It’s a very unfavourable duty.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Your honour...

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.850
Talk to me, but I cannot look at you.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.400
I would risk losing control.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.000
When do you think you’ll finish watching it all?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.000
All is the exact word, we really see it all!

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.000
Will you deliver the judgment soon?

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.400
Be quiet you. In the video, you hid all the nice things.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.800
If you weren’t in the story, I would be happier.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.300
When will you render the verdict?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.700
Well, in fact, the problem is the following.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.500
If ever I judge that the material is offensive, well it will have to be destroyed!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.300
Yes and?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.800
Well idiot, it means that I could no longer watch it.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.200
But you can judge the material as being legal also!

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.250
Yes, but I also have to determine if...

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.500
it’s a danger to good people because it can cause heart attacks.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
What?

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.000
Yes, I had three while watching the video.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.750
Three in five minutes?

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.100
No, only three in the 308 times that I watched the video,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.300
but I have not yet been able to get to the end.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.000
A lot of different things happen.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.500
What?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.100
My room is splattered with white stuff.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.500
I don’t know where it comes from.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Um...do you watch the movie naked?

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.700
No choice, or else it dirties my clothes!

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.300
And after I must do laundry...

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.300
it doesn’t give me a lot of time to continue to watch the video!

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.500
Why don’t you take the weekend to do it?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.200
I watch it every weekend, but,

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.000
my vision suddenly deteriorated, another perverted effect from the video.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.500
Uh huh, yet another argument to ban everything.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.000
In fact, we have an argument to ban vialis, 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.200
a product rendered obsolete by the video.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.350
We’ve been waiting for the judgment for a while,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.500
our patience has limits, I’ll explode...

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.500
Well I don’t know how you were able...

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.300
to wait so long!

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.300
Well then by this weekend,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.600
would it be enough time for you?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.600
Are you crazy?

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.300
When we find a trick that always works, we keep it!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.600
But is a judgment going to be made or no?

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.400
10 out of 10 for your chest, 10 out of 10 for...

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.000
What is that? An advance judgment?

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.500
You judge without having heard me?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.500
It’s not a question of listening, it’s a question of looking.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.700
If you don’t render the right decision, I will make an appeal.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.500
There won’t be an appeal made on my 10 out of 10, that’s for sure.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.300
The question to ask is if the video is in accordance with the law.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.300
The question to ask is if...

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.400
someone can watch the video without going crazy.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.500
How’s that?

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.300
Have you seen the video?

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.000
No, and that’s the injustice,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.200
I’m in it, but I’ve never seen the final product.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.200
I would have liked to since we’ve been talking about it for so long.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.300
Me too, I’d like to see the proof.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.200
I didn’t see the video, but it’s against the law.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.500
How is it that the producer doesn’t face charges?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.700
Yes, where is he?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.400
Um, I’m not quite sure. No, no!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.400
He filmed it with a mask so he wouldn’t be recognized, but he’ll be found.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.000
He wasn’t able to hold still during filming.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.700
No, he could.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.000
He wanted to go out with me.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.700
In fact, it was more to enter you.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
He wanted to do me.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.500
Oh that, he still wants to do it...

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Oh!

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.200
Is he dead?

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.000
The floor is so hard!

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.200
It’s not only the floor that is hard!

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.100
Due to illness, I will have to push back the hearing to a much later date.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.500
What do you want, my heart attack comes at the right time!

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.500
But, I will continue to study the video during my recovery.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Moral of the story: There is no rush to judge a movie unlawful if it turns you on!
