00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.540
I won't lie, I like months like this - the
burden of sifting through the games you've

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.260
played and trying to judge each one on an
individual merit to see whether it JUST pips

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.449
out one game out for another can be at best
tiresome, and at worst a frustrating chore

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.670
as you struggle with some hair-splitting decisions.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.680
So when I get a month like this past October
with its huge highlights, the only problem

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.710
I have left is stopping myself from gushing
too much about these titles.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.160
So, if you've got a budget or if you're just
looking for the best of the best, here's the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.960
Top 3 iPhone Games for October 2011.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.690
3.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.350
Mage Gauntlet (Rocketcat Games)

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.910
To be sure, any developer worth their salt
should be able to make more than one sort

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.160
of game - with that said there are plenty
of studios that have made their mark for being

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.190
good at one particular genre and making their
name off the back of those games.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.370
Rocketcat Games looked set to be the premier
ninja-rope swinging, time-trial racing developers

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.360
of the App Store, but instead of staying the
course they throw out Mage Gauntlet - a top-down

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.830
Action-RPG with a unique magic combat system
perfectly designed for the iOS platform.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.880
Carrying their signature pixel-art style,
tongue-in-cheek writing and collectable hats,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.840
this game screams 'Rocketcat' while being
something refreshingly unique, not just for

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.730
the developer, but for the App Store as a
whole.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.730
2.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.360
Bike Baron (Mountain Sheep)

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.450
The sign of a truly great time-trial game
is how willing you are to stab the 'retry'

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.020
button even after lengthy periods of crashing
over and over and over and over.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.880
This is in part driven by how far you feel
the game is being with its physics and controls,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.210
and whether or not there's something actually
exciting happening.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.689
Bike Baron by Mountain Sheep scores almost
perfectly on all three accounts and with so

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.560
many levels, with so many challenges to overcome,
it's hard to run out of content to explore.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.150
Despite the high difficulty of later levels,
players aren't barred from checking them out

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.060
thanks to the simple unlock system that uses
the wackiness of these levels as the carrot

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.630
that motivates you instead of leaving you
with a grayed-out menu option.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.140
Add in the eye-popping 3D presentation on
top of all of this and you're guaranteed to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.140
lose an entire afternoon, if not a week to
this title.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.140
1.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.849
Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation (Gameloft)

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.849
I hate to be so horribly predictable, but
when you're presented with something as solid

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.900
as Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation, it's hard
not to give it the praises it deserves.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.060
Despite previous iterations providing some
guidance, developing a FPS for iOS and in

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.690
particular its smaller devices the iPhone
and iPod Touch is no easy task as gamers demand

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.900
more fidelity in their controls without sacrificing
screen space - an especially important point

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.549
for online play.

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.510
Fallen Nation not only nails the feel of a
FPS by mimicking larger console titles, it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.419
refines it to suit the platform.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.241
Shortcomings in the form of simple AI are
offset by the range of tasks you'll have to

00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:04.659
perform in the singleplayer campaign, but
more importantly nothing can replace the magic

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.249
of taking out a real player mano-a-mano.

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:11.230
With up to 12 players simultaneously playing
online you're guaranteed a real challenge

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.260
whether you're simply scrimmaging for points
in a Deathmatch or vying for supremacy in

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.579
team games such as Capture the Flag.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.719
Fallen Nation is a gorgeous and polished title
that distills the experience of titles on

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.540
other platforms while allowing you to take
the game on the road.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.379
I hope these titles give you as much fun as
they did for me this month.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.579
The year isn't even out and I feel like I've
had a mini-Christmas, so I can only imagine

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.599
what the rest of the year has in store thanks
to iOS 5 and the release of the iPhone 4S

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.609
with its A5 processor.

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.499
