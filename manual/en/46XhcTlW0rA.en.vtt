00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.900
Today I’ll make Freddy’s hair bright &amp; have a high tone.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.400
And also overlap it with vivid colors to make it crazier.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:08.000
First, I will cut his hair to shorten one side because it was a little long.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.800
I purposely varied the balance of the right and left side to create an “Asymmetry” style.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.700
It’s been 4 years since I became a hair stylist.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.100
I wanted to become a stylist so I can make a creation of my own.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.200
I get my inspiration from the trends of website blogs and magazines.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.300
I want to touch many people with the haircuts I give.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.000
I was intending on dyeing his hair to a vivid color.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I bleached his hair 3 times to decolorize the yellow and whiten the edge completely.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:21.200
Then I divided the hair into sections and dyed it yellow &amp; blue.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.000
On the edge, I left the white color to make use of its original hair color.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.400
Generally stylists dye the edge and leave the base.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:48.200
So this time I was challenged to make a new style.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.900
CLEO has a reputation for choosing the right products &amp; chemicals

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.000
that always keep your hair looking beautiful.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:12.800
2 years ago, our first branch abroad was launched in Singapore.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.800
We are planning to expand throughout Southeast Asia.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.900
We will work hard to make CLEO a brand that is appreciated abroad as well.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.800
I used a lot of colors to give a shocking impression.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.200
Thank you very much. It was really fun today.
