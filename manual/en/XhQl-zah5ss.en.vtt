00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.210
It’s gonna be very difficult and I believe
it’s gonna be a very tight race. But I have

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.590
the confidence to win today.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.470
A world rally car will be faster, I can tell
you straight away. Sebastian with the world

00:00:28.470 --> 00:02:03.340
rally car last year lost. I think for me it
will be difficult.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.290
I think we tried hard. Any way he gave me
a very good advantage in the start.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.290
I did one or two small mistakes. I lost a
bit of speed. Especially in one turn we have

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.210
the difficult. But we’ll see.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:27.989
The best time for Stefan 2:32:99 and the best
time for Carlos 02:32:13. The winner is Carlos

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.480
Sainz.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.599
For me it is really pleasure to be here and
meet Stefan.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.239
Stefan, that means that you have to wash the
car now.

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.489
Yeah, I mean (smile) that’s the way it goes.
I’ve done my best. It was quiet tricky,

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.739
but it’s been a nice challenge and I’m
very happy that Carlos was coming all the

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.790
way from Spain to see us here. It was also
for me a big pleasure to meet him. I watched

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.340
him before in his career. It’s great to
have this kind of fun together. Well, I have

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.239
to clean the car now, so
