Hello there my friends, John here, and when
I'm out and about, whether for a quick day

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.179
hike or even a multi-day backpacking excursion,
one item that I always have with me is my

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.209
trusty old smartphone.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.689
And no, it's not for sitting around playing
on Facebook or making calls from the top of

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.789
a mountain when I'm supposed to be enjoying
the wilderness.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.529
It's actually for the use of the camera.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.609
I love taking those uh shots that we get to
see when we're out in these beautiful locations...those

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.390
once-in-a-lifetime shots, just to preserve
the memories.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.140
Now, one of the problems that I've run into
is that I'll take said shot, get it home only

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.260
to find that it's all blurry or out of focus
and it's just really disappointing because

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.239
there's not getting that moment back.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.580
So, how do we remedy this without bringing
a lot of bulky camera equipment along such

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:59.219
as a dedicated camera, a tripod, accessories...Those
things can all get rather heavy.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.390
Now we can actually use items that we already
have with us to do this.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.720
Of course we'll need our cell phone along
with our trekking pole.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.500
Now the problem comes in, how do we mount
the phone which has absolutely no mounting

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.300
capabilities to a trekking pole which also
has no mounting capabilities.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.010
Well, the answer is really simple and it's
on my wrist right here.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.970
That is a rubber band.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.580
Now, this weighs practically nothing.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.970
I'm sure it weighs something, but for all
intents and purposes, it weighs nothing.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.130
Now we'll just take this rubber band and we'll
put it on one side of our cell phone like

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.130
so.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.501
We'll take our trekking pole and on the back
side center that phone, wrap the rubber band

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:51.870
around and attach that in place, just like
so.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.240
We'll go ahead and center that up.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.950
We'll want to make sure that our lens is completely
unobstructed and that the rubber bands do

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.821
not interfere with the touch screen and thus
the controls on the phone itself when you

00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:06.510
want to take that picture.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.880
Next we'll go ahead and firmly slide in place
our trekking pole into the ground.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.530
As you can see we have a nice level surface.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.330
The only thing we have left to do is to set
the timer on the camera itself, press the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.700
go button, sit back and wait to get that killer
crisp shot.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.040
Well, I hope you found this video useful,
and if so please feel free to give us a big

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040
thumbs up.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.060
It lets us know you enjoyed it, and we really
appreciate it besides.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.430
And for more related videos, we've included
some links right here for you to enjoy.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.560
Until next time, take the best of care and
we'll be seeing you soon.
