00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.020
We're dying to watch your first show! Okay, okay! Don't show the tape till Uncle Jesse gets here!

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.929
No, I have it! It's in my bag

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.760
What a team! I forget, you remember!

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.049
-singing-

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.689
It's a groovy-

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.059
Have mercy!

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:26.419
(Hi!) Hi! You must be Jesse Danny's brother in law. Danny told me about you.

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.189
Oh yeah? What'd he say?

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.210
He said he had a brother in law named Jesse.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.050
Thanks for the buildup, pal!

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.600
So, you must be a Rebecca? No, please please call me Becky!

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.910
Becky, I like that.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.150
Becky, becky, becky!

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.110
So, Becky I was going to get something to drink would you like something?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.280
Sure what do you got? (What do you like?) Whatever you have.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.290
Why don't we get it together?

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.560
That's fascinating.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.930
I can see why you have your own talk
show.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.690
DJ, is everything okay?

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.580
Yeah, fine Dad. I can't wait to watch your show.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.880
So have you, uh..

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.970
Found an apartment yet? Oh, I found plenty of them.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.730
problem is they all have people living
inside.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.580
-laughs- People.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.650
See, I find a sense of humor very attractive in a woman.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.270
You know this is gonna sound weird.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.369
But, you remind me of someone.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.270
Oh, yeah? Who's that?

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.970
It's silly you don't wanna hear it.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.930
C'mon pretty mama lay it on me.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.790
You remind me of Korky.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.050
My little baby brother.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.120
He used to do that same cute Elvis voice.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.180
I remind of your little baby brother?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.950
Yeah, it's uncanny.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.050
Korky and I would go to Sumners pond to catch frogs.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.150
And he would always say.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.820
C'mon little froggie mama.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.130
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.280
Elvis never said that.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.949
You really are cute

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.009
We are so far

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.489
from where I wanna be.
