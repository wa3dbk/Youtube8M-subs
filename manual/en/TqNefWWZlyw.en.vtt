00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:13.570
So tools is a topic you could debate for hours
that I am sure folks will have a lot of different

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.350
opinions as to which tools to buy first.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.080
But I am just going over what my favorite
picks are for tools probably the things I

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.000
would recommend to buy first if you are looking
to start a brand new shop.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.560
So how I determine what things I recommend
to get, is get the tools that let you build

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.730
the widest variety of furniture projects.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.350
So that is kind of my explanation for my picks
again this is a hotly debated topic.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.079
With luck with the tools I show you today
you probably already have a few of these already.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.129
Let me just dive right in.

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.159
Hopefully you can see at home the #1 thing
you will need is a table saw.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.550
This one is from the home center up the street
brand new.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.829
This one would run you about $500.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.239
You can get one like this for about half that
on Craig’s list.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.959
It’s been a long time since I bought a table
saw so Craig’s list wasn’t around back

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:06.390
in a day you had to get the Want Ad and try
to figure out how you get a decent used one.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.500
But so take a look on Craig’s list if you
are on a budget you can get one for a couple

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.450
hundred bucks and next step is a router.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.310
It is probably the second most used tool in
the shop.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.140
I recommend you get a plunge router which
allows you to vary the depth of the cut that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.030
the router will do.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.740
Entire books have been devoted to this tool
because it is just such a versatile thing

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.540
to have.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.540
For me in the furniture that I build I do
a lot of edgings with the router, table top

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.939
edges things like that.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.619
It just adds flair to your design and livens
things up a little bit.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.820
So I don’t use it nearly as wide a range
of things it can do, but still it is definitely

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.619
my second pick for tools.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.479
You can see hopefully you can get look at
that at home has a bunch of different types

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.759
of bits you can get this thing for like I
said decorative edges.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.890
You can do dado cuts on this thing.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.689
Lots of really neat things you can do here.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.350
Next up on our list, where is my sander, there
it is the random orbital sander.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.600
This little guy 5” circular sanding pad,
hook and loop variety.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.340
Very versatile because if you needed to with
the right grit sandpaper.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.710
It will take away a lot of stock.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.910
You can really smooth things up very quickly
here that are in pretty bad shape, but at

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.250
the same time the same tool can be used to
do some really fine finesse work with the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.740
fine grit sandpaper in a lighter touch.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.940
Next up on my list of tools to get is the
skill saw and how I use the skill saw as a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.300
furniture builder if I am building some stock.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.240
Building a piece of furniture lots of stuff
I make it pretty small.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.990
My stock comes from the lumber yard in pretty
large pieces so it makes things less awkward

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.390
for the table saw.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.120
I cut do my rough cutting with the skill saw.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.570
It is faster a little less awkward.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.020
I can actually do it outside if I want to.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.320
First is kind of carting this thing outside
to do it.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.020
This is great, great addition to the shop.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.370
A decent skill saw you can get for about 75
bucks.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.090
This is a fancy one I think I paid about 150
for it has lasted forever.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.280
The only thing I need to do with this thing
is swap up the blade now and again, I get

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.730
a lot of use out of this thing.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.270
Biscuit jointer is another versatile tool.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.060
This one I use for joints on table tops.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.700
You can get a good look at that it plunges
into the wood like that and allows you to

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.070
use these biscuits to make your joint.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.120
When you add a little glue to these biscuits
they plump up pretty good and make a fairly

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.900
strong mechanical joint.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.710
And the jig saw.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.450
The jig saw is a good one in that it allows
you to cut curves very easily.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.640
The expensive route you can take you can see
that at home.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.330
Band saw would do the same thing.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.320
A little more for lot finesse and lets you
do more types of cuts with bigger stock.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.010
The jig saw though is a lot cheaper.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.780
So this is another tool you can get for 75
bucks for a decent model.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.600
Again as a furniture builder I am doing a
lot of curved pieces and this allows me to

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.610
cut those curves up pretty easily.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.250
So now we have gotten the big power tools
out of way.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.570
I want to spend a minute and just talk about
some of the smaller items you will need for

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.540
your workshop and I want to start off with
the item for the table saw the stacked dado

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.540
set.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:34.520
What this allows you to do is basically cut
through your wood in a wider thickness in

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.920
your typical wood with standard 10 inch table
saw blade.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.570
Table saw blade it comes with your saw will
cut about an eighth of an inch depending on

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.860
which type of blade you have about an eighth
of an inch thick.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.010
What this stack dado has what allows you to
do is kind of stack up one on top of the other

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.700
to make a wider cut and the next thing on
the list is clamps.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.190
Probably it numbers the most popular thing
in a workshop.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.500
These half inch ones are really great.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.440
They are the most versatile these are the
ones they always use for small furniture projects.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.680
So get six of those and slowly build your
collection.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.750
Next up on something you already have around
the house is a corded drill.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.950
Just a couple of features you want to make
sure you get keyless chuck so you don’t

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.540
have to lose your chuck and hunt for it this
allows you to swap out on the fly.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.530
I use this thing for a screw driver and much
as I do drill.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.920
It is reversible and very inexpensive.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.790
You probably already have one but if you don’t
just make sure keyless chuck and reversible

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.530
two big features you want to have.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.920
Okay next up on the list is a framing square
friend to carpenters everywhere.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.129
Us woodworkers use them as well.

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.140
Great to make sure everything basically keep
your projects honest and make sure they are

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.480
squared up nice, very inexpensive they have
in aluminum and steel.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.210
Now just pick your favorite that will come
in handy when you are measuring things out.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.650
Glue scrapers it is always good to have these
one of the things that you will discover as

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.760
a new woodworker is glue does not take stain
very well.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.590
So if you have finished a project and then
you are applying the stain you didn’t know

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.090
there is a glue mark there before you put
the stain on it.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.200
You sure will once you put the stain over
glue mark because the stain doesn’t go through

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.210
glue.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.050
So this is how you counteract that it is a
great way to scrape off all the excess glue

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.500
that will come out of a joint inevitably.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.690
You can let it dry off a little bit.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.270
Scrape some of the glue out then go over with
a wet rag.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.000
So definitely have a couple of those around.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.320
I have got one dull one that is useless and
one new sharp one that I use all the time.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.910
This is great just for marking your stock
does a perfect angle for you this way also

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.770
does 45s, has a level in the middle that I
have never used in my life.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.830
But, again it is something a carpenter would
find handy.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.510
Now there are a few more small odds and ends.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.310
I am sure you already have they’re probably
hidden around your garage all over your house

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.310
somewhere.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.040
These are things you will definitely be grabbing
for all the time as a woodworker.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.680
What I recommend you to do is just find them
all and put them in one spot either on one

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.840
of your new shelving units which you bought
or get some peg board and put it all in one

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.200
spot because when you are building a project
it can really get you going.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.580
It can be very frustrating if you need one
of these items and it is not real handy and

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.890
you got to hunt around for it is real pain.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.950
So some of the stuff obvious stuff you are
going to need, but like I said round it all

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.950
up.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.240
Get to make sure you got your hammer handy,
extension cords of all different shapes and

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.370
sizes are always a must.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:30.660
Utility knife with a fresh blade that is one
you are reaching for quite a bit and I recommend

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.370
for tape measures definitely get yourself
a couple of them two or three.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.580
I have got like eight of them all over the
place because I lose stuff and with the tape

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.900
measures a lot of the carpenters use these
25 foot ones and they are great if you are

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.370
out on big job sites and you are making large
projects.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.330
For most of the stuff that I build I don’t
need one that big and it is kind of inconvenient

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.010
to have one this size kind of clipped on your
pant.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.010
So I like this 16 foot ones they are a little
cheaper and just easier to manage when you

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.570
are building occasional tables, entertainment
centers kind of things wood workers build

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.640
all the time.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.940
So just like the safety glasses treat yourself
to a few of these if one goes missing no big

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.080
deal.
