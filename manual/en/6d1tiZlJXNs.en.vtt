00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.139
My name is Keith Warren.

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.209
I'm a hunter, I'm a fisherman, and I'm an outdoors-men.

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.179
And like most outdoors-men, I am tough on my equipment

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.719
and I expect a lot from it.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.000
An Ice chest happens to be one of those pieces of equipment

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880
that I expect the most from.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.000
That's why I'm so excited to tell you about a brand new

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.550
ice chest that's made by the folks at Igloo.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.279
It's actually not an ice chest...

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.249
It's a Cold Locker

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.970
and it's called the Yukon.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.020
It's better than an ice chest and here's why.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.150
The Yukon Outhauls

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.060
Where the other leading brand only
holds forty five quarts

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.920
Well, the Yukon has a true capacity of 50 quarts.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.150
When you buy an ice chest, don't you
think you ought to get the capacity

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.770
that you're paying for

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.510
the Yukon is equipped with rock-solid
theft resistant handles

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.400
wide enough

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.860
for two hands

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.730
with an oversized tethered drain plug

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.940
you get a fast flow with easy clean up

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.000
anything worth doing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.740
is worth doing big.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.580
And with a stainless steel chain

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.340
you won't lose your plug off the back of your truck or boat.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.160
The Yukon Outlasts

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.720
The Yukon latches are durable, flexible, 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.250
impact and corrosion resistance

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.250
and can be locked for tamper-resistant security

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.110
some competitors use hinge-rods that are, well...

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.479
that are made out of aluminum.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.479
Look how soft that is, and wimpy. [laugh]

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.870
Yukon, made out of stainless steel

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.790
1/4 inch stainless steel.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.710
The Yukon is guaranteed to last

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.349
and with a five-year warranty

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.660
it's the best in the industry.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.670
And here's something really special

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.540
every Yukon comes with

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.240
its own serial number on it.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.690
What you need to do is go to Yukon Cold Lockers dot com

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.430
and register that serial number as being yours.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.300
The Yukon Outchills

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.980
With a three hundred and sixty degrees
freeze-style gasket, these Cold Lockers

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.900
keep cold for seven to fourteen days

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.820
It's dry ice compatible and has a thicker
insulation foam

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.100
than the other brand.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.999
This has three inches

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.739
of insulation.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:12.719
Look how thin that is

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.719
at the bottom of each of these units. This is real important.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.969
Look how thick it is on the Yukon

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.349
and thin it is

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.539
on the competitor model. I didn't believe it when I first saw it,

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.669
but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
figure out which one is going to keep ice longer

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:27.680
And on the lid,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.089
it has a ruler, so you can measure your fish.

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:34.099
And of course, you have a flat workstation.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.529
Thanks to cool-riser technology

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.339
the Yukon elevates off hot surfaces,

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:44.999
allowing airflow to maximize cooling and
has reversible skid / anti-skid feet

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.749
to keep the locker in place.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.779
The only thing that touches the floor

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:50.579
are the four corners. That's it.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.789
The Yukon Cold Locker will Outhaul, Outlast, and Outchill, Anyone!
