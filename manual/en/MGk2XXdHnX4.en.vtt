00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.630
Ana &gt;&gt; My name’s Ana McCabe I’m a human
resources business partner in Skills Development

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.340
Scotland and I’m involved in interviews
from a support point of view. When recruiting

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.010
for SDS or any public sector organisation
you look for the right candidate for the job

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.750
and the right fit for the organisation, so
you want to find that individual who can transfer

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.050
their knowledge, skills and experience in
their past experience into the role in SDS

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.260
and to have the natural ability to connect
with the company as well. The final decision

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.540
in making a choice of your candidates is very
pragmatic, it’s looking at the scores of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.530
a competency-based interview, what they’ve
scored in each competency, and you come up

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.180
with a total at the end and the best total
has the job. At the same time you’re testing

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.020
other competencies through the interview which
might not be scored for example rapport-building,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.950
communication skills, they come across through
the interview so they might be influencing

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.890
the final scores as well, but you base it
on your scores. When preparing for an interview,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.110
I would encourage a candidate to think of
the competencies which are being tested. Make

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.890
sure that they prepare a variety of examples
for each competency. These examples can be

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.350
from their professional life as well as their
own personal life if they don’t have extensive

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.890
professional life. Also make sure that the
examples are genuine, they come across as

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.119
the individual, the candidate took a big part
in resolving that situation, and the most

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.619
important part is that it comes across as
honest and as yourself. The most difficult

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.130
part in an interview I find is when candidates
are asked about their own personal qualities.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.250
We don’t like to boast about our own personal
qualities but it’s important that you have

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.590
a think about what makes you special or what
makes you different to the rest. It could

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.770
be the smallest thing, like a personal quality
that is clear because your all friends always

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.590
rely on you to organise or prepare events
because you’re good at planning, you’re

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.580
good at organising, you’re good at prioritising,
you’re good at communicating, you’re reliable.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.069
So it’s good for you to think about these
things before you come to the interview because

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.660
they are a bit more personal. At the interview
itself I would recommend candidates to always

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.290
turn up in smart business wear. Always remain
professional. Always engage with the interview

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.890
panel, make sure you make good eye contact,
make sure that you smile and are relaxed,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.870
make sure you get there in plenty of time
to be relaxed. Make sure that you are yourself.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.350
You’ve got to the interview which is the
hardest stage, because you’ve put on paper

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.599
who you are, you just have to demonstrate
that in person now.
