00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.300
Hello, this is XboxAhoy and this is the twenty-eighth
episode of my Black Ops weapon guide.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.000
Like a bolt from the blue.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.969
In this episode we're covering the Crossbow.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.410
It's a single shot weapon, unlocked at level
33.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.580
The Crossbow is an ancient weapon, originating
in its most basic form in South East Asia,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.960
today part of China.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.620
The earliest examples date to around 600 BC.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.579
The Chinese crossbows, or 'nu', were an important
part of early warfare - with advanced designs

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.829
such as the repeating crossbow, or 'chu-ko-nu'
providing the ability to fire multiple bolts

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.329
in quick succession.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.700
The crossbow's history in Europe can be traced
to ancient Greece: the 'Gastraphetes', translating

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.560
as 'belly-releaser' first appeared in the
5th century BC.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.350
Perhaps the most prolific use of crossbows
in combat was during the Medieval era - while

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.180
longbows were the ranged mainstay of many
armies, the ease of use and devastating power

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.729
of the crossbow earned quite a reputation.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.909
The introduction of the firearm saw the crossbow's
demise: ultimately easier to use, faster to

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.270
reload, and providing a higher degree of lethality
at longer ranges.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.700
Crossbows do retain some usefulness in modern
warfare, however - the near-silent twang of

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.979
a launched bolt useful for covert roles and
assassinations.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.179
Their ability to carry unusual payloads also
makes them valuable - whether zip-lines or

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.359
poison tips, the humble crossbow can do many
things a conventional weapon cannot.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.670
The Crossbow in Black Ops fires explosive
bolts, with the weapon holding only a single

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.859
bolt before requiring a reload.

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.649
By default, you'll spawn with 2 bolts - one
ready to fire, and one in reserve.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.649
Scavenger Pro will extend your initial supply
to the maximum of 5 bolts total.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.009
The crossbow can deal damage in two ways - upon
impact, or through its explosive blast radius.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.130
Impact damage is insufficient to kill outright
in Core - you would need to strike your opponent

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.410
with 2 bolts in order to kill them.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.970
However, thanks to the explosive element,
a single successful stick will inevitably

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.150
kill your victim - as they'll have no way
to escape the blast radius.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.390
Explosive damage is high, meaning those caught
in the blast will usually be killed outright,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.410
unless they're using Flak Jacket.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.510
The explosion's range of effect is very small,
however - only dealing damage within a 4 metre

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.510
radius.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.700
Rate of fire is very slow too, as you'll need
to reload for every shot fired.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.460
This equates to about 20 rounds per minute,
or 40 if you're using Sleight of Hand to speed

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.700
up the process.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.790
Recoil is simply not a factor with the crossbow's
rate of fire - instead, it's the parabolic

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.590
arc the bolt follows that affects your aim
the most.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.790
At longer distances, you'll need to aim above
your target to hit - the bolt travels faster

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.960
and straighter than the Ballistic Knife, but
the drop will need to be accounted for, else

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.910
your payload will fall short.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.180
The crossbow takes 250 milliseconds to aim
- as quick as an assault rifle, and nimble

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.850
enough for most needs.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.300
Reloads are frequent and quite slow - 2.75
seconds between shots will leave you very

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.750
vulnerable in a close-quarters battle.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.440
Like the Ballistic Knife, and the Launchers
- the Crossbow has no attachments available.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.930
For a class using the crossbow, it's your
perks that have the greatest effect on the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.310
weapon - and there are two that you should
definitely consider using when employing the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.470
Crossbow as your secondary.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.150
The first is Scavenger - especially Scavenger
Pro.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.260
With the base perk you will be able to resupply
your explosive bolts: a very useful trait

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.400
for sustained use of the crossbow - and the
pro benefit will increase your starting supply.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.830
Instead of a meagre 2 bolts, you'll start
with 5 instead - more than double the amount

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.569
of potential explosive action.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.260
To make the best use of these extra bolts,
I'd recommend employing Sleight of Hand as

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.420
well - this will halve your reload time, allowing
you to follow up your first bolt with another

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.510
quickly, should your first miss.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.600
The more bolts you're able to fire - the more
kills you will net overall.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.400
Don't be afraid of firing multiple bolts in
succession if you suspect an enemy is lurking

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.940
in a building or around a corner.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.500
Aiming with the crossbow requires equal measures
of both practice and luck - with the arced

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.779
trajectory and non-instant travel time, targeting
distant or moving targets will require shifting

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:34.479
your point of aim.

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.300
While the projectile follows a relatively
straight path, when shooting over long distances

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.879
you will need to aim a couple of metres above
your target - precision will come with practice.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:51.009
Moving targets are more challenging - to strike
an opponent moving across your field of view,

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:57.210
you will need to aim ahead of them, by a degree
relative to their speed and distance away.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.099
Even should you gauge a shot correctly, there's
always the risk your opponent will change

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.410
direction, or stop entirely - resulting in
a miss.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.419
Given the difficulty of sticking mobile opponents,
then - it may be best to target nearby surfaces,

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.210
and let the explosive damage secure the kill.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.169
The blast radius is small, so shots still
need to be precise - but bolts will prove

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.270
deadly against enemies without flak jacket.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.470
Walls, floors and ceilings all make suitable
impact points - as long as you can ensure

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.499
the explosion is close to the enemy.

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:35.860
One way to enhance explosive performance is
to deliberately target explosive scenery - cars,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.699
jeeps and barrels can all be detonated with
a bolt, and will massively expand your potential

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.960
kill radius.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.259
This is much safer than attempting to land
a stick on a moving target - all too often,

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.969
your bolt will sail harmlessly past them,
giving them the time to take you out whilst

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.120
you reload.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.280
As far as tackling air support with the crossbow
is concerned: don't bother.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.749
While you can inflict a little damage by sticking
a helicopter, you're unlikely to destroy it

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:07.249
- even with multiple bolts.

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:11.830
The Crossbow is a challenging but rewarding
weapon to use, and one that fulfils a niche

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.029
role unlike any other.

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:18.159
Once you've mastered the arc of the projectile,
it's possible to stick even distant foes who

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.870
aren't on the move - and every stick is a
reliable kill.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.419
It works well as a support weapon, and can
help extend the reach of close-range weapons

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.080
such as SMGs and shotguns.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.730
Up close, however, the weapon becomes a liability
- a painfully slow rate of fire and a long

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.879
fuse will often leave you vulnerable.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.349
The fact that you must also account for the
arc of the projectile and its slow travel

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:46.580
time also complicates things, and moving targets
will become difficult to hit at any sort of

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.229
distance.

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.820
The weapon falls into a very specific role,
then - ideal for tackling static enemies,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.280
or for use as an area denial weapon with its
explosive potential.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.289
While it might not be as versatile as an assault
rifle, the crossbow is very satisfying to

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:03.289
use.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.759
A well placed shot is its own reward, and
the moment of panic when a bolt successfully

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:15.729
lands - will certainly stick with your opponent.

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:18.000
Thanks for watching, this has been XboxAhoy.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.719
Join me for the next Black Ops Guide, when
I'll be covering the FN FAL.

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:24.440
Until then, farewell.
