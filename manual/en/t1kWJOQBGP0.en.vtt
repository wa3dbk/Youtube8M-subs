Shoes are really important for skateboarding.
Picking out the right one is pretty crucial.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.961
This is an authentic Van. This is a, Van has
been around forever. This isn't the greatest

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:14.440
support for skating, but it has a lot of board
feel, a waffle sole. It's pretty good for

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.530
skating. This is a Mike Carroll, Lakai Shoe.
It's an upper mid shoe, so it may be better

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.780
for ankle protecting, and it's on a vulcanized
sole. This is a leather material. This is

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.190
good for skating. It's a cost and select,
which is also vulcanized. This is the Manchester

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.540
Select, which is suede material, which is
what I prefer for skateboarding, and it's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.579
also vulcanized. This is an Emerica AR Slim,
and it's a cup sole. The sole is actually

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.120
sewn on to the shoe, rather than vulcanized,
and this is probably the most advanced shoe

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.960
in skateboarding. It's a Zoom Tre. There's
a hard rubber on the toe, so which prevents

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.710
ripping, and in the sole of the shoe, there's
active titanium, so if you land primo, you

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.360
won't get bruised heels, or bruised arch of
your foot, so this is pretty much as advanced

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.719
as it gets right now. Yeah, I'm the Active
Shoe guy. I'm here to tell you about differences

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:14.640
in between vulcanized shoe, and a cup sole
shoe. On a vulcanized shoe, it's a glued on

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.140
sole. As you can see, the difference between
these two, this one has actual stitches, and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.789
it's a thicker rubber. This one is a vulcanized
rubber, so it's a lot softer and flexible,

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.719
as compared to this cup sole, which is, it
has flex in the toe, but not really in the

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.579
arch. The difference between the two, is the
vulcanized shoe, is going to have a lot better

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.389
board feel, and you're going to have more,
it's a going to feel a little bit comfortable.

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:42.450
It's going to wear down quicker because it's
such a thinner sole, along with a suede shoe.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.520
Suede skates the best, but it wears down the
quickest, and in a cup sole shoe, the rubber

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.420
on this is a lot thicker, than the vulcanized
shoe. It's going to last longer, but it's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.259
not going to have the board feel, that a vulcanized
shoe will. These are not the greatest shoes

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.660
for skateboarding. This thing, not that great,
not that good sole, no grip. This shoe is

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.030
no real shape, and kind of bulky. This shoe
weighs like five pounds, not the greatest.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.860
Maybe for going out, but not really for skating.
Depends on the type of guy you are, but not

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.230
for me.
