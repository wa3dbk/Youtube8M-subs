00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:09.929
Welcome to the Brussels Motor Show.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.914
We'll be visiting IVA in Driebergen.
I see someone react to the name.

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:20.454
I think you've been to IVA.
-Yes, I have.

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:22.471
Why did you choose it?

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:28.111
I was looking for good automotive
education, which we didn't have in Belgium.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.753
We've found it in the Netherlands.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.230
Frank, on the IVA stand.
Good morning.

00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.528
Why are you guys at
the Brussels Motor Show?

00:00:42.737 --> 00:00:50.430
Why? We've been coming here for years,
because we have a lot of Belgian students.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.245
That's why we want to introduce
us to new students here.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:57.473
This includes everything involving
the automotive world.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.850
IVA is THE business school
for the automotive world.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.201
It's chosen as the best academy
of the Netherlands.

00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:07.087
There's a new student over here.
Let's ask him.

00:01:07.628 --> 00:01:10.247
How did you get here and
shouldn't you be at school?

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:14.670
No, there's an IVA project
for Belgian students.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.964
They can get practical training
at the Brussels Motor Show.

00:01:18.357 --> 00:01:23.726
Here we get some experience in
putting theory into practice.

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.796
Does this suit me?
I'm seeing wood everywhere.

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:34.761
Yes, I think so. Your nice trousers
and shirt remind me of Saint-Tropez.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.344
That means beach, sun, nice weather,
and of course, a convertible.

00:01:41.737 --> 00:01:44.475
I'm sure this is
the perfect car for you.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.100
So do I.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.900
It's not going well in the automotive
world, so why should people go to IVA?

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.645
Aren't you teaching unemployment? 

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:57.800
Fortunately, no. It's true
these are hard times,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.429
but businesses have to switch now.
They have to change things.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.119
Sales methods are changing,
as is customer care.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.672
We help the students in this process.
Check our employment level:

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:14.722
even now, all students
leave with a job.

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:19.915
There's a very nice Donkervoort
at the stand. Why?

00:02:19.915 --> 00:02:23.639
John Donkervoort, who founded
the brand, was a student at IVA.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:29.384
His son, Denis, races the cars.
We could show the car at the Show.

00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:35.032
Students who enter the contest
can co-drive it at Spa Francorchamps.

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:36.784
That's a fantastic experience.

00:02:36.784 --> 00:02:40.194
So come to the Brussels Motor Show
and the open day at IVA.

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:44.000
I think I'll write down my name,
because I want to do a lap as well.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.500
You're very welcome to.
