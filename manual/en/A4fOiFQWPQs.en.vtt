00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.340
There’s always hope, there’s always more
that’s out there and you just have to look

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.180
for it and go for it, you know it’s, it’s
not easy picking up and going to another country,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.780
but if you don’t do it you’ll never know!

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.260
The first time we did stem cells, we didn’t

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.829
know if it would do anything at all. We didn’t
know if we were throwing money into the wind,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.880
but we knew that we had to take a chance and
it paid off.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.220
Hi, my name is Eddie Streck, this is Kaden,
he is 11 years old and he has Cerebral Palsy

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.949
and he has Optic Nerve Hypoplasia and Apraxia
of Speech.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.400
He’s had it since birth, his birth mother
was an addict and he was born very premature, so...

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.940
right from the beginning.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.780
Cerebral palsy is very different, depending
on every person is different.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.280
With him it mostly affected his lower body and his
left arm,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.219
so he couldn't sit up, he

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.530
couldn’t walk on his own, he couldn’t you know do things like go to the bathroom

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.969
and feed himself and he because he was blind
there was obviously a lot of limitations with

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.229
being blind and being unable to walk

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.060
I can tell you a lot about the changes we
experienced through stem cells, this is our

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.270
second course of treatment, Kaden was not
able to see before.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.609
The most probably significant moment after
the treatment was only 48 hours after our

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:55.139
first treatment. We were on Skype in China
and I was on Skype with my husband and normally

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:59.979
he would be in our room listening to what
was going on and he crawled up to

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.469
the computer screen and put his hand on the
screen and said daddy and we realized that

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.049
he was already starting to see him and that
was 48 hours after the first treatment.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.140
His vision was about 20/800 and 20/600 in
another, he’s at about 20/40 now, he

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.210
can see very well for about five feet.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.210
And everything has changed because he can
see things now. He’s starting to read words,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.770
he’s, you know he’s talking about all
these things he sees, but the other really

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.630
big thing we gained was speech.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.220
He said about ten words, three years ago,
he said ten words. So now I've stopped counting

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.080
at about 2,000. He says four or five words
together, he’s talking all the time about

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.430
his favorite things. So the speech was
a really unexpected bonus, we weren't expecting

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.190
to get it and it’s been amazing, so what
comes first the vision or the communication?

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.280
We don’t know but that changed everything,
he can stand himself up when he’s walking,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.140
he can go into the bathroom and go to the
bathroom on his own, he can feed himself now.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.630
He cab drink out of a straw. Major, major
changes, it’s been astounding.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.250
It’s amazing how far we've come in just
a short amount of time.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.680
My thoughts on one of the things that Beike does very well is combine a lot of programs.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.710
One of the things we looked at when we’re
looking at stem cells is there’s a lot of

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.310
places that don’t do combined therapy, they
don’t give a Functional Medicine approach,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.180
I believe that the extensive amount of therapy that they give is just helping those cells

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.660
to do what they need to do,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.660
and the approach to therapy and getting everything
the PT and OT, and the aquatic. I feel from

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.820
the first time that we went that part of what
really helped the cells to be successful was

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.760
the combined approach.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.540
There’s hope, we didn't get our results
immediately, most of our results immediately,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.650
they came much later and they kept going and going and going and he does more everyday

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.160
It’s it’s exciting and just to,
just to keep up that hope and keep up the

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.900
possibilities that are there, there are other
choices out there than just accepting what,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.640
that that their condition can’t change.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.790
Kaden: Better Being, Better Kaden

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.930
Mom: That’s right, better being, better Kaden, that’s right.
