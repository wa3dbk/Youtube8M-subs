00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.000
&gt;&gt; Dean Scott Angle: Agriculture
is the largest industry in

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the State of Georgia.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.340
It generates about $80 billion
of economic value;

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.510
that’s almost 10% of the
total economy of the state.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.600
It also produces nearly 400,000
jobs for the state.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.860
It’s also the fastest growing
industry in Georgia.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.140
And that’s why UGA’s

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.820
College of Agricultural and
Environmental Sciences

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.490
is so important
to our future.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.339
That’s because over
the past several decades,

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.220
it’s become clear that business
follows innovation.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.340
And that’s especially
true with agribusiness.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.500
The innovative work we’re
doing here is paving the way

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.740
for the future.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.880
And at the forefront are world-
renowned UGA faculty members,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.960
leading our research and
teaching our students

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.020
- very impressive students,
I might add.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.700
This year’s freshman class set
new records in terms of academic

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.120
standards for both
GPA and SAT scores.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.160
So they’re truly poised to
become a stellar workforce

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.420
of leaders and innovators for
Georgia, ready to tackle

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.250
the complex challenges
of the future.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.080
To that end, these scientists
and students are performing

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.320
cutting edge work
across a wide array of

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.220
agricultural disciplines,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.580
from plant breeding
to animal cloning,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.260
food safety and packaging to
environmental impact technologies

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.220
that help conserve and
protect our soil and water.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.020
And our UGA Extension Agents
are a key part of the process,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.030
literally taking this
innovative work from

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.550
our labs to the
farmers in the fields.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.120
You can see this,
for example,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.390
in the work we’re doing with
variable rate irrigation in

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.620
Georgia’s Lower
Flint River Basin,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.660
where we’ve increased
agricultural water efficiency

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.360
by up to 20%.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.600
This is a huge benefit not only
in terms of conserving water,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.230
but we’re simultaneously
increasing crop yields.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.880
And of course this is related
to the growing field of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.240
Precision Farming,
where we’re developing

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.229
technology such as drones to
help detect crop stand issues

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.169
earlier in the planting
season than ever before.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160
Additionally, we’re
working with

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.000
the Trans-Atlantic Precision
Agriculture Consortium,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.240
an organization that not only
invites student exchange with

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.840
other agricultural colleges
across the Southeast,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.480
but also with universities
throughout Europe,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.260
so that we can take advantage
of technology being developed

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.629
around the world and bring it
back to the people of Georgia.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.900
That’s why it’s so important
to me, personally,

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.769
to get out across the state, to
talk to our agricultural leaders,

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.909
our farmers, our students;

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.939
ensuring that the technology and
solutions we’re developing will

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.459
meet our ever-increasing
agricultural demands.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.319
&gt;&gt; Crowd: Gooooo Dawgs!
Sic ‘em!

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.780
Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.120
&gt;&gt; Dean Angle: And I’m proud to
say that we’re able to do that,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.349
thanks in large part
to our legislators,

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.090
our amazing alumni who continue
to do so much for the college,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.930
Georgia’s business community,
and everyone who supports

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.770
UGA’s College of Agriculture.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.980
I don’t hesitate for
a second to say that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.720
the University of Georgia’s
College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.170
is one of the very
best in the country

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.680
but the amazing things is
it’s only getting better.
