00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.180
Hello and welcome to the last ever science
in 90 seconds.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.280
Yes, As I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I take a look at 90 second science

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.150
and realize there's nothin' left.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.870
The science will continue but the bulletin
is dead and buried.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.160
Find out why by clicking the annotation here,
or the link in the description.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.020
Anyway, the best way to send this crusty old
ship down is in a blaze of glory, so on with

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.120
some awesome science.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.130
And to Siberia, where we may be on the brink
of being able to clone a wooly mammoth.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.660
Last year an incredibly complete, 40,000 year
old mammoth carcass was discovered in the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.030
Lyakhovsky Islands - it even had liquid blood.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.680
According to scientists at the North-Eastern
Federal University in Yakutsk,The cells gathered

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.540
were the least damaged ever found, and may
be complete enough to clone the mammoth.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.030
Any baby will be a mammoth-elephant hybrid
born through a surrogate mother - probably

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.940
the most difficult part of the process as
elephant husbandry is notoriously difficult.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.800
Next and to the Kennedy space centre, where
Nasa's Morpheus lander has completed it's

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.950
highest and fastest ascent, to nearly 200
metres and back in 83 seconds, far more successful

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.280
than this August 2012 attempt.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.229
Morpheus is designed to lift 500kg off the
surface of the moon, using a methane-oxygen

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.830
propellant that's cheap, relatively eco-friendly
and could be produced chemically on the surface

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.409
of the moon or mars.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.230
And finally a team at the University of Twente
have created an engine just 0.1mm wide, but

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.009
exactly how it works is a bit of a mystery.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.520
The engine charges water to release oxygen
and hydrogen, expanding the end of the engine

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.709
wall like a cylinder.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.340
But when the engine is turned off the bubbles
vanish back into water, freeing the chamber

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.139
up for another cycle.

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:56.180
No one knows exactly why cutting the power
leads to the gas vanishing, at any rate, the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.930
power generated relative to its size is phenomenal.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.020
That's it for this week and for this bulletin,
thanks to everyone who's watched, I know a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.789
few of you have been here since the very start
so thank you, and we'll be back with more

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.100
science as it happens throughout next week.
