00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.580
Looking at the image of the Clint Eastwood-esque
character with his bandanna, poncho, and cowboy

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.520
hat on the app store, and seeing the game
titled Way Out West, the last thing we were

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.470
expecting was a resource management city building
simulator.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.669
Told in flashback, this game is about building
a town in the new frontier to harvest enough

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.079
gold to pay off your husband's prison debt,
with each level adding new elements to the

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.940
gameplay, and having missions and time quotas
to fill as well.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.280
It's been a while since we've played a management
game of this type, so let's dive right in

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.190
and see what it has to offer.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.010
Usually the goals of a level will be harvesting
a certain amount of material or building a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.960
certain amount of a building type.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.730
The main resources are gold, lumber, money,
and population, although workers are an important

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.360
resource as well.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.749
Workers create buildings, collect resources,
and repair damages.

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.809
They cost money to create.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.020
Money is created by taxing your population
which live in wagons or houses (which can

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.750
be upgraded and need constant repairs), or
by building general stores or other places

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.560
for your population to spend their weekly
wealth.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.460
All your buildings need lumber to build, and
some need gold (or at least you need gold

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.630
to upgrade).

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.640
These are collected in sawmills and gold mines,
which create pick-ups on a regular basis for

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.480
your workers, or you can spend resources to
create a larger haul.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.070
Finally residential buildings have to have
access to a water tower near-by, so placing

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.079
your buildings has a strategic edge to it
too.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.329
This kind of inter-connected approach to the
game design makes sure that the player is

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.560
always keeping an eye on every facet of the
town as they are headed towards the level's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.140
goals, and it keeps the pace moving as well
as making for a very addictive experience.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.549
On top of this, there are rewards connected
to completing a level with-in a certain amount

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.710
of time, so not only do you have to watch
all your resources, you're constantly thinking

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.219
of the most efficient strategy to reach the
end goal quickly.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.270
All is not perfect however.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.469
While the gameplay is top notch, the presentation
does drag it down somewhat.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.539
The buildings and workers are on quite a small
scale, as they obviously wanted the levels

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.670
to be viewable on one screen.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.899
This can mean mis-taps when you're trying
to pick up resources, and for those with bad

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.160
eyesight, it's frustrating.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.510
Also the voice acting can be quite atrocious,
especially the delivery of the tutorial, which

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.000
is quite a downgrade after the decent delivery
of the intro.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.220
For lovers of simple touch management sims,
Way Out West is a great entry in the genre.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.110
Presentation issues not-withstanding, the
way the game is designed to make the quantity

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.910
of each resource important lends itself to
highly addictive play for genre veterans and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.050
newcomers.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:41.750
A strategy experience that is easy to recommend.
