00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:25.480
We’re just a few weeks away from the launch
of Wii U which means it’s finally time to

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.109
say goodbye to the Nintendo Wii.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.420
It’s been an awesome ride, filled with great
ideas, great controls and great games...like

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.420
this one.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:51.109
Part two of our countdown of the 25 greatest
Wii games is officially under the knife.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.850
Trauma Center got its start as a great Nintendo
DS game, so when the series was announced

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.309
for Wii, a lot of people were skeptical.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.390
They thought direct touch would be necessary
for a surgery simulator...thing.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.430
It turns out the game plays even better with
the Wii Remote.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.990
New Blood is the second—and best—Trauma
Center game for the Wii...a stunning display

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.880
of the speed and accuracy offered by its remote.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:33.049
Where Trauma Center was a great example of
what the Wii could offer from a control standpoint,

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.030
these games are more of a metaphor for what
Wii could offer conceptually.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.780
In an industry defined by varying shades of
grey, the Wii provided a splash of color...a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.079
splash that was embodied by de Blob.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:52.210
A unique series that kinda mixes Mario 64
with Mario Paint, the de Blob series found

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.810
a way to turn a traditional gaming concept
like platforming into a coloring book.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:10.300
There’s nothing more Wii than that.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.830
Some may argue this game is too low on the
list.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.340
I say its placement is a testament to the
quality of the system’s library.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.050
And to the evils of rubberbanding.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.120
Nonetheless, in a multiplayer setting, very
few Wii games—or video games, for that matter—can

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.420
match what Mario Kart has to offer.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.980
The series again carried that torch on Wii,
and it also became Nintendo’s most ambitious

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.260
attempt at online gaming to date.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.849
Plus, I can put myself in it.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:51.931
Oh my God, I am the winner.

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:57.849
In the past, if a massive spiked ball were
rolling down a hill straight for Mario...if

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.900
he couldn’t jump over it, he was pretty
much screwed.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.860
On the Wii, well...just switch the dimension
and sidestep it.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.140
Spicing up the Paper Mario recipe with a dash
of classic side-scrolling, Super Paper Mario

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.319
is an RPG for platforming fans.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.959
It’s funny, addictive...ingenious.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:33.219
And Peach can float.

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:38.489
With only one North American home console
release prior, this game was like a first

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.049
impression for its series for some gamers...an
impression that was something like, “Holy

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.299
crap, Monster Hunter is freaking huge.”

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.440
A massive action game packed with even bigger
enemies, tons of gameplay and spectacular

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.940
graphics, Monster Hunter Tri is the kind of
game developers made too rarely on Wii.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.630
One with genuine effort.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.569
Well done, Capcom.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.060
And well done, you.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.349
Thanks for watching part two of our countdown,
and be sure to come back for part three of

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.379
our feature on the top 25 Wii games of all-time.
