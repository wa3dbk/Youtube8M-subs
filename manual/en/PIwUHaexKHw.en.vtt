00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.790
a seventeen year old standby name of
angela's gang in california one a one

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.200
hundred thousand dollars scholarship
after she created a particle it's a

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.250
nanoparticle that targets in kills
cancer cells she describes it as a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.960
pocket knife is swiss pocket knife uh...
that focuses on cancer cells kills and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.970
and does not attack other healthy cells
in your body now when you r_t_c_ go

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.830
through chemotherapy it has the ability
to kill the cancer cells but it also has

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.420
a lot of negative impacts on the body
according to a angela this new creation

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.530
will basically just kill the cancer
cells and keep the rest of your body

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.449
healthy which i think it's fascinating
now i she participated in the siemens

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.059
competition in maps and technology and
she won the one hundred thousand dollar

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.670
a scholarship as a result i'd bring us
up because i just want to give you that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.170
some hope see all you have to do is find
a cure for cancer and you'll get a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.159
scholarship and then you can afford
college so stop whining we all she owes

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.490
a hundred thousand right

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.120
highly-touted dies but

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.820
very curious to see what happens because
look in this creation will have to go

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.630
through about twenty five years of
clinical trials testing the f_d_a_ will

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.370
have to approve any type of medication
that results from it uh... but i'm

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.810
curious to see in twenty-five years
whether or not she will profit from this

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.870
adderall uh... but for the time being
she did win a one hundred thousand

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.940
dollars scholarship she started working
on this project back in two thousand

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.900
nine and she says she is she had
dedicated at least one thousand hours of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.550
work into this project so if she is an
incredible student seventeen years old i

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.200
mean obviously very driven very
motivated a definitely made me feel like

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.440
a huge anders cheaper i was that i was a
notary cheaper but you read about

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.310
angela's an emailing

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.829
the unit showed her and that i don't i
don't think anyone has she got her

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.380
original researchers right now can't
find a good cure for cancer and she says

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.990
and she's found something so

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.620
i think that's incredible and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.760
i really love that uh... it's a woman
are at at this point she's a girl and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.540
the reason why i say that is because
allot of girls are not interested in

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.670
science it's a very male dominated
afield and i think that it's great

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.270
because maybe other young women out
there will look at the story in saying

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.250
you know what made it something that i
should look into the so i think it's a

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.689
great story all around good feel-good
story what's her name

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.950
angel's name and losing in trip to the
week

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.659

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.689
underscores

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:26.269
