00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.960
Hey...! Hey, let her go!

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.820
[Jeering]

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.820
Who the hell are you?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.660
I'm Batman.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.580
[Uproarious laughter]

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.000
Hey, so I forgot my suit, alright?!

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.820
(Growling)

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.100
C'mon! Run!

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.020
Wait... doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.560
Go.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.680
[Girl] Thanks! You saved my life!

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.100
I could definitely get into this superhero gig.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.720
(Whistles)

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.980
Batman!

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.940
Batman!

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.980
Bastard!

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.540
It should've been you! It's your fault!

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.360
If you had told Two-Face who you were
at the circus... they'd... still be alive!

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.140
If Bruce Wayne could've given
his life for your family, he would have.
