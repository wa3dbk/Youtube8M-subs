[Alton Jones, Professional Angler]

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:09.730
I’m Alton Jones, 2008 Bassmaster Classic
champion, and I make my living fishing America’s

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.730
reservoirs.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.100
Every state has reservoirs, and more than
70 percent of all freshwater fishing takes

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.170
place there.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.359
But reservoirs are important to everyone,
not just professional anglers.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.510
Millions of Americans fish at reservoirs,
making this activity an economic powerhouse

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.510
for our country that supports hundreds of
thousands of businesses and jobs.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.170
Our generation has never known an America
without reservoirs.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.500
Reservoirs may look like natural lakes, but
they were created by people, and they must

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500
be cared for by people.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.950
We’re not building many new reservoirs,
and as they age, the quality of fish habitat

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.940
declines, and so does the quality of fishing.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.969
Good fish habitat matters to all of us.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.680
Fish habitat is the foundation for healthy
aquatic life and clean water supplies.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.520
The water fish live in is the same water you
drink.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.680
What’s good for the fish is good for you.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.720
America’s reservoirs need your help to stay
healthy and continue to provide the fishing,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.549
recreation and water we all treasure.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.860
It will take people from all walks of life
working together to improve the habitat in

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.560
our reservoirs.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.119
Your state and national fish and wildlife
agencies alone do not have the resources to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.740
correct all the problems.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.740
The Friends of Reservoirs Foundation allows
local businesses, fishing clubs, conservation

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.770
organizations and individuals to work together
with their state fish and wildlife agency

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.360
to improve their home waters without having
to set up their own non-profit organization.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.829
Money raised at the local level is spent at
the local level on projects the local Friends

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.450
of Reservoirs group chooses.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.579
With your help, we can have healthy reservoirs
and a better quality of life now and in the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.880
future.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.590
Whether you are an angler, a member of a fishing
club or conservation organization or a concerned

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.660
citizen, it’s really easy to join the growing
list of people who share a passion for keeping

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.110
America’s reservoirs healthy.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.300
Joining Friends of Reservoirs is your chance
to get involved and make a difference.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.420
In Friends of Reservoirs you can network with
like-minded people who share the same passion

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.050
for fishing and clean water that you do, and
you can spend money on local projects to make

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.800
the fishing in your local lake better.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.540
So please, help out.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.440
