00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.912
Today we're changing Instrument Cluster Lights
on a 96 Ford Explorer. In this step I'm going

00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:12.970
to demonstrate the proper service procedure
for installing your knee blocker cover plate.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.970
Now your knee blocker cover plate also serves
as the mounting point for your hood release

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.099
cable. You have these two holes that are going,
bolts are going to go through here and hold

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.610
your hood release lever. You also have these
alignment pins that the hood release lever

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.480
bracket is going to sit on. So we go ahead
and begin the installation process. You have

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.890
two clips and alignment pins we need to line
up first. Now it's almost an industry standard

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.920
on knee blocker cover plates, I've never seen
one go on differently than this, it'll have

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.560
clips on the top and bolts on the bottom.
So you want to go ahead and line up your clips

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.570
first and push them home, just like so. As
you can see it pretty much holds itself there.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.190
From here you can go ahead and begin the mounting
procedure, so we have four bolts to deal with.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:16.620
They're going to be a 7 mm on this particular
vehicle and we got one here.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.760
Now we're going to start them all before tightening
any of them down. We've got one just like

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:31.940
it over here on this side. From here we're
going to take and install our hood release

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.220
cable, right here, as you can see we have
a dent circle, that's for an alignment pin.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.500
We have a slotted circle for an alignment
pin and two holes, those are for your last

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.200
remaining bolts. We're going to take and line
that guy up on there. These are the alignment

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.841
pins for your hood release cable. The hood
release bracket's going to take and sit on

00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:57.820
these dowels, little plastic dowels, and the
mounting bolts are going to go through here

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:30.590
and here into your knee blocker plate and
start our bolt and for the fourth and final

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:44.430
bolt right out over here,
right there. That is the proper service procedure

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.970
for reinstalling your knee blocker cover plate
and reattaching your hood release cable.
