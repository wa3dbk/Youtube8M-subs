00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.459
ULINE's latex coated gription gloves
are great all-purpose gloves that work

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.600
well at most job sites in a dry,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.680
non-oily environment. From manufacturing
to construction,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.580
landscaping to warehouse, maintenance to
shipping and receiving,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.920
ULINE's gription gloves are right for
you. Gription gloves allow workers to apply

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.020
less force to maintain a secure grip,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.570
reducing worker fatigue. The improved
gription helps increase comfort,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.329
reduce repetitive motion injuries and
maximize worker performance and productivity.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.810
ULINE's latex coated gription gloves are
available with

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.890
two liner options, nylon or poly/cotton,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.650
and two grips, standard crinkle

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.130
or superior microfinish. 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.550
In order to choose which gription glove will work best for you, first determine which liner is

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.950
right for your application.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.250
The sheer fitting, lightweight nylon liner
is flexible and breathable

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.610
and is ideal for use with hand tools and
small packages.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.090
The heavy-duty poly/cotton liner is best
used for handling more industrial

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.700
products,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.220
such as bricks and lumber because it is
thicker and more durable.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.479
Once you've chosen your liner style,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.790
then pick the coating, or grip, that is
best for you.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.460
The standard crinkle grip is comfortable
and allows for increased dexterity.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.210
The superior grip has two layers of
latex coating

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.590
increasing the durability and life of
the glove. The second coating is microfinish grip

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.790
which acts like millions of tiny suction
cups across the glove's coated surface,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.360
delivering maximum gripping power. Let's
take a look at each of ULINE's

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.740
gription glove options.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.420

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.019
making it ideal for continuous use
throughout the day.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.020
The patented microfinish grip reduces the
effort required to grab and lift objects. 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.629

for a short period of time

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.430
or to complete a quick task. The S-15332
super gription glove features the

reduces hand fatigue

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.739
but is ideal for working on long-term
projects with more rugged products,

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.070
such as bricks or lumber.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.420
Whether you choose the breathable nylon
liner

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.740
