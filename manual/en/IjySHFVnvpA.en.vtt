00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:10.100
Tools for adjusting composition are located
in the Composition Tool tab.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.966
These include, Crop, Roatation &amp; Flip, Keystone and Overlay.

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.833
In this tutorial we will look at Cropping and Rotation.

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:24.333
To crop freehand, leave the 'Ratio' menu set to 'Unconstrained'

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.200
Select the crop tool by clicking here or hitting 'c' on the keyboard.

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.866
Move to the viewer and click drag a crop frame.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.766
A semi transparent mask will hide the area that has been cropped.

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:40.433
This can be adjusted in the preferences if necessary.

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:45.000
The orange numbers on the edge of the frame indicate
the size of the cropped image.

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.733
Change the units in the pull down menu here.

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:57.333
When you select another cursor tool, the crop is applied
so you can work on the cropped image
without the distraction of the uncropped area.

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:05.200
To crop to a certain aspect ratio, select one from the available
list or create one by choosing 'Add aspect ratio'

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:09.133
The crop area will now be constrained to the selected ratio.

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:22.166
If a keystone correction has been applied, it is sometimes
useful to crop outside of the image area.

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:26.300
If necessary, tick the 'Crop Outside Image' checkbox.

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:34.700
To remove a crop, click anywhere outside of the crop frame
or click the 'Reset Crop' adjustments button in the crop tool itself.

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:41.533
To rotate an image, drag the angle slider to the left and right.

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:55.033
If a horizontal or vertical reference point is available,
draw along it using the 'Straighten' tool.
Select it here or simply hit 'r' on the keyboard.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:02:00.133
This will automatically rotate the image about the reference
point to be leveled.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.133
To rotate an image by 90 degrees, left or right,
use the left and right buttons.

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:13.500
Alternatively, use the rotate cursor tool directly on images
in the browser.

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:27.100
Use Shift 'r' to move through the different straighten cursor option.

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:31.566
To flip an image, choose an option in the 'Flip' pull down menu.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:38.933
To apply a Crop or Rotation setting to multiple variants,
select them in the browser.

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:44.900
Then shift click on the copy apply button in the crop or rotation tool.
