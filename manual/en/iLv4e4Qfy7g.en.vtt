00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:08.930
Today we're going to show you how to rig bait
fish for bass. Generally for bass, bass fishing

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:17.990
is done with generally shiners, golden shiners,
or even perch or goldfish where it's legal.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.710
Now the first thing you want to do is when
you hook up your rig is generally use one

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.570
ought or two ought hook. These are small hooks
just for example. You're going to tie that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:52.250
hook on with a clinch knot, or what ever knot
you feel comfortable tying. We're going to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:08.020
trim the tag end off, if I don't hook myself.
Here we go, and now what we do is we place

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:29.340
the split shot about eight to ten inches above
the hook. I bite it down to clamp it down,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.680
it's a small split shot. Just for example.
And then there's all kinds of different bobbers

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:46.280
you can use. Corks, bobbers, whatever you
feel comfortable using. You definitely want

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:57.560
one that's going to be able to keep the fish
somewhat stable. And you want to put the bobber

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:10.319
up generally about two and a half feet from
the hook. And now you're going to hook up

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:18.670
your shiner, your golden shiner right behind
the dorsal fin, and there you go. There's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.740
your rig. You've got your bobber, your split
and you've got your minnow on your one ought

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.319
or two ought hook. And then then there's another
right that you can use if you hook it through

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:42.910
the lip, with a weedless hook. Hook the minnow
through the lip, put the weed guy on it, and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.170
that's just another option of hooking it on.
And that's how you set up for bass with a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.370
minnow.
