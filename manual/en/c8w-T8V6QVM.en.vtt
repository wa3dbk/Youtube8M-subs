00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.930
Today we&amp;#39;ll be reviewing the Whispbar
Fork Mounted Roof Mount Bike Rack, part number

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.730
wb-200.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.830
The main feature for this bike rack is that
it is the only bike rack on the market that

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.160
fits a 9mm and a 15mm thru-axle without an
adapter.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.090
It also fits the standard 5mm quick release
skewer as well.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:34.989
We can switch between the 9mm and the 15mm
mount by using the switch inside the head.This

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.859
bike carrier holds road bikes, mountain bikes
and bikes with quick release 15mm thru-axle

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.800
skewers and disc brakes.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.609
Another great feature of the Whispbar Fork
Mounted Bike Rack is the quick dock technology

00:00:50.609 --> 00:02:03.319
for easy mounting into our crossbar channels.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:19.349
We 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:50.040
open the arms, press 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:04:27.070
the plates firmly into the channel 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:40.570
and 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:05:00.880
then 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:24.940
turn 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:39.980
the arms 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:06:16.840
to 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:43.780
secure it.
