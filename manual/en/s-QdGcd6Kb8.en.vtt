Hi! I'm Steve Chubin at Steve's Sewing and
Vacuum Center at King of Prussia, PA and today

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.889
we are here to discuss how to buy a vacuum
cleaner. Talking about vacuum bags; we want

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.660
to get away from that for a minute to talk
about bagless vacuums. Bagless vacuums have

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.810
become very popular in the last few years.
Here is a very popular brand right here. With

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.580
a bagless vacuum what you have is a dust cup
where all the dirt and dust is held in this

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.550
dust cup. This dust cup builds up very quickly
and generally if you do have carpeting, pets

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.829
and kids, you may have to empty this from
going from one room to the next. If you do

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.829
have to empty this, we do recommend that you
empty this outside due to the fact that when

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.100
you do empty these and you push this button
and the dirt drops out of the bottom here,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.360
the dirt and dust will go all over your house
so we do recommend that you do go outside.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.950
So the convenience for inconvenience with
a vacuum without bags would be that if you

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.880
had to empty this out every room and it is
raining or snowing and it is winter time,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.280
you are going to have to run downstairs, outside
and empty the vacuum and go back upstairs

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.520
and continue to the next room. So the bagless
vacuums that are on the market out of the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.430
most of the bagless vacuums that are on the
market, Dyson is one of the better bagless

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.180
vacuums but it is not one that we recommend.
We do not recommend too many bagless vacuums

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.900
due to the fact that you are not really getting
all of the dirt and dust out of your home.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.390
You are just taking it from the carpet and
putting it into this container and from this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.520
container, it is going back into your room,
into your air and back onto your carpet again.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.470
That is my opinion about bagless vacuums and
because we do not sell many in our store,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.610
they have been very popular. Most of the bagless
vacuums that are on the market today you have

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.880
to buy filters. Even for the Dyson vacuum
you do need to buy filters. So you buy bags

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.500
for a vacuum that takes bags or you buy filters
for a vacuum that does not take bags. So either

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.200
way, you do have to have some out of pocket
expense on operating any product in your home.
