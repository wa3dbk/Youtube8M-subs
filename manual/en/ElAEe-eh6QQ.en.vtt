00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.600
Holland America has been cruising Alaska for over sixty years

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.100
so they, they own it. They know Alaska.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.700
They are the number one cruise line to look at.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.500
They offers Glacier Bay National Park 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.300
on every cruise itinerary that they're offering.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.800
They have the most rights to places in Alaska

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.300
that other cruise lines cannot get to.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.700
So Holland America’s cabins onboard,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.700
they’re more spacious then the other cruise lines.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.000
You have an average of a hundred and ninety square feet

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.600
so you’re walking in you have a small sofa or seating area

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.100
and then you have your beds that will convert to, to one queen bed

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.200
and those cabins will accommodate up to four as well.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.000
So you can have one in a bunk and one on the sofa bed.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.000
Balconies are a great option for cruising Alaska and you have your

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.300
private space to view those glaciers when you’re entering,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.900
you know, Glacier Bay National Park or Hubbard Glacier.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.700
That is such an awe inspiring thing you can

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.000
you can take a helicopter and land on Mendenhall Glacier

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.500
and you can go dog sledding on top of a glacier

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.800
something you cannot do anywhere else in the world.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.800
You can hike through the rainforest, you can go whale watching,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.100
orca whales and humpback whales. The sea lions are everywhere

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.000
and the, the salmon fishing is a big thing in Alaska so bear sightings

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.300
so it’s all nature and just the, the scenery is incredible.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.200
You can board the Yukon White Pass railway

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.700
and it’s an amazing, it’s one of the top train rides in the world

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.300
from Skagway up to Summit.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.100
You have your glacier route which is going either North bound or South bound

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.900
from Seward cruising down to Vancouver or vice versa.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.700
They have an inside passage which is cruising from

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.800
Vancouver round trip back down to Vancouver as well as when they’re offering

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.300
round trip from Seattle. Shore excursions are at additional costs

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.100
so whether you’re choosing to do a helicopter ride

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.400
which might run you three, four hundred dollars or whether you’re doing

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.200
a city tour for thirty dollars of Sitka. It’s all depending on

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.300
personal choice and what you’re looking to experience in Alaska.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.600
It’s a once in a life time thing and I always recommend to clients to, to do

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.700
if, if that’s what you want to do just do it.
