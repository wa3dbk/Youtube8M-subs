JAISAL NOOR: Welcome to The Real News Network.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.589
I'm Jaisal Noor in Baltimore.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.090
In Japan, the operator of the crippled Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant acknowledged that

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.710
highly radioactive rainwater runoff has contaminated
the surrounding areas.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.650
Now joining us to discuss this is Arjun Makhijani,
who is a nuclear engineer with 37 years of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.450
experience in energy and nuclear issues.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.010
He's the president of the Institute for Energy
and Environmental Research.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.759
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.460
ARJUN MAKHIJANI: You're welcome.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.960
NOOR: So can we get your reaction to this
latest troubling news from the operator of

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.450
the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant,
saying that this highly radioactive rainwater,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.870
which they weren't able to clean up and pump,
has again contaminated the surrounding areas?

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.239
MAKHIJANI: Yes.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:06.430
So Fukushima has had a problem of contaminated
water since the time of the accident in 2011,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.619
and not only the water that's needed to cool
the molten fuel in the reactors, but also

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.909
all of the rainwater and storm water and so
on that has been getting into the reactors

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.920
and contacting the fuel and so on.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.130
They've got about 1,000 tanks with contaminated
water on site.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.689
Some of these tanks are leaking.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.799
And, of course, the site is contaminated from
fallout and leaking water and so on.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.950
The latest problem that you're asking me about
arose when there was a typhoon last week,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.960
which is a very, very severe storm and dumped
an enormous amount of rain.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.540
And what that has done is in the areas that
are highly contaminated with leaking water

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.020
that was contained by berms and barriers,
that containment basically got overtopped,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.179
and now we have quite contaminated water that's
flowing onto other parts of the site and into

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.370
the ocean, contaminated water that's flowing
into the ocean every day apart from these

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.790
severe weather events.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.900
So this adds to the contamination.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.299
NOOR: Has this raised further questions about
the management of the cleanup and the way

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.269
that TEPCO was approaching it?

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.189
MAKHIJANI: Well, I think the management of
contaminated water has been deficient from

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.200
the beginning.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.379
For some of us it was apparent back then,
in 2011, that it was not such a good idea

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:48.439
to accumulate millions of gallons of contaminated
water on-site.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:55.150
I had suggested back then that they should
buy a supertanker and put the water in the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.299
supertanker and have it sent elsewhere for
filtration rather than storing so much contaminated

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:10.169
water on-site, risking leaks and worker radiation,
because all of this makes it very difficult

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.699
for workers to work.

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:17.610
It's not just a question of abstract, you
know, there's some soil that's contaminated.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.989
Workers actually have a lot of work to do
there.

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.670
They're building buildings to replace the
damaged structures from the explosions.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.349
They have to put up new cranes.

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.019
They have to put up equipment to be able to
extract the fuel, used fuel that's in the

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.169
spent fuel pools.

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.459
So there are thousands of people working on
the site, and when you have events like this

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.819
it makes it very difficult to manage the accident,
much more difficult than if you did not have

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.000
the problem with contaminated water.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.159
NOOR: On the topic of working conditions at
the facility, CNN recently spoke to a worker

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.339
who claims that conditions there are very
unsafe for those that are working there.

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:02.339
What's your response?

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.449
MAKHIJANI: As I understand, you know, there
are thousands of subcontractors.

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:12.069
There are not as many employees of the company
itself.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.830
As the workers get worn out, tired, reach
the maximum limits of radiation, they have

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.500
to be replaced by other workers who are not
as experienced and not as trained.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.290
Morale is a problem.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.801
I understand drinking is also a problem, depression,
and so on.

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:29.909
And you can understand.

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:36.509
When an accident is that severe and conditions
are so problematic, and on top of it the accident

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:42.090
has been mismanaged, the situation of workers
is going to be very difficult.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.629
Many of these workers have also lost their
homes to the accident, you know, because they

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:53.550
are from around the area, many of them, and
they can't go back to their houses, so they

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.370
are in temporary housing and so on.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.039
So conditions for workers are extremely difficult,
and many of them don't appear to be even very

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.530
well paid, as they should be for the kind
of work they're doing.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:13.430
NOOR: And finally, there's a typhoon that
may make landfall this this week in Japan.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.259
Does this raise further concerns?

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.469
And what does the future look like for the
cleanup of this massive radioactive site?

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:26.090
MAKHIJANI: Well, one just hopes that the structures
will hold up, because the structures that

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.520
have been built to protect the reactor and
the spent fuel, especially with reactor number

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.220
four, are very critical to prevent the accident
from becoming much worse.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.000
So there is a current severe problem, of course,
with all the contaminated water and leaks

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.050
and so on, but there's much more radioactivity
inside the reactors in the spent fuel pools,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:58.940
and so what happens with all these storms,
severe storms, typhoons and so on, is that--typhoon

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:07.880
is the same thing, essentially, as a hurricane--is
that there is a risk that there will be much,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.050
much more severe spread of contamination.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.210
Thankfully, that does not seem to have happened
so far.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.090
But the longer it goes on, of course, the
greater the risk.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.370
NOOR: Thank you so much for joining us.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.509
MAKHIJANI: Thank you very much for asking.

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.500
NOOR: Thank you for joining us on The Real
News Network.
