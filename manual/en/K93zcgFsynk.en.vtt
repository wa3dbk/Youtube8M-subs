00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.905
Hey, Vsauce Michael here coming to you from my hotel room in London

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:08.877
with a little camera that I taped to a bunch of
furniture I stacked up.

00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:13.214
Which is better than nothing, and as you
can tell from the title of this video,

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:15.185
it's also what we're going to discuss.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:17.319
Nothing.

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:22.459
Can there ever be nothing?
I mean, we're surrounded by matter all the time.

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:24.830
Even this glass is not empty.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.400
I know you might think there's nothing in it,
but it's full of air.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.838
And air is packed.

00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:33.200
One cubic centimeter of air contains almost

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.339
30 quintillion molecules.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.611
But if I remove the air from this glass,

00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:42.079
I can create what is known as a vacuum,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.783
an awesome word that uses a double u, but not a w.

00:00:46.783 --> 00:00:51.679
The challenge, however, is removing
all of the air.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.960
To this day, the best scientists have been able to do

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.232
is to create what they call an ultra-high vacuum.

00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:00.353
At this point, one cubic centimeter

00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:04.030
of space contains not 30 quintillion molecules,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.606
but a mere and amazing 100.

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:10.745
To put that in perspective, a vacuum cleaner

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:14.372
like you use at home hardly changes
the thinness of the air at all.

00:01:14.372 --> 00:01:17.948
In fact, if you use a vacuum cleaner at sea level,

00:01:17.948 --> 00:01:22.021
the vacuum created inside the operational part of the machine

00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:26.420
only has the thinness of air found
in Denver, Colorado.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.767
If you want thinner air, if you want even
fewer particles per cubic centimeter,

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:34.094
you're going to have to leave earth.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:37.934
But before we go too far, let's talk about
high altitude flying.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:41.042
When you're in an airplane 30,000 feet high,

00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:44.070
the outside air is very thin and dangerous.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.413
So by law, the airplane must keep the inside of that commercial aircraft pressurized

00:01:49.413 --> 00:01:53.883
so that it only feels like you're no more than 8,000 feet high.

00:01:53.883 --> 00:01:57.286
The reason it's dangerous is that
when air gets that thin,

00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:59.754
there's not enough oxygen for your brain.

00:01:59.754 --> 00:02:04.763
This man is about to remove his mask
temporarily and with supervision

00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:07.801
in the actual thinness of the air around him.

00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:10.828
Within less than a minute,  he suffers from hypoxia,

00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:12.437
a lack of oxygen.

00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:14.773
Even though he appears to be awake and alert,

00:02:14.773 --> 00:02:18.573
when told to put his mask back on or else he will die,

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:20.716
he does nothing.

00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:30.987
But a lack of oxygen, a lack of air, a lack of matter

00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:35.060
can get even more dangerous when
you go above 60,000 feet,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.668
about 19,000 meters above the surface of the earth.

00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:42.335
This limit is known as Armstrong's Limit.

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:44.733
We all know that the boiling point of water

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:47.872
decreases as your altitude increases,

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:52.179
and at Armstrong's limit, the boiling point for your own blood

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:56.516
drops all the way down to the temperature of your own body.

00:02:56.516 --> 00:03:00.021
If you reach that altitude without wearing a special suit,

00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:03.252
bubbles will form inside your blood, and your body

00:03:03.252 --> 00:03:05.791
will inflate to twice its normal size.

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:10.759
But because your internal organs and
your skin are flexible, you won't explode.

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:12.993
So let's talk about out gassing.

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:17.240
Out gassing is why it's so difficult
for us to reach an ultra high vacuum.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.140
If you remove so much air from this glass,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.544
there's fewer than 100 particles per cubic centimeter.

00:03:23.544 --> 00:03:27.140
The glass itself or whatever material
your chamber is made out of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.553
will start to lose its own trapped gasses.

00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:35.082
But materials don't need to be inside
partial vacuums to out gas.

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:39.552
It happens all the time, and is
especially noticeable in confined spaces.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.523
For instance, a car.

00:03:41.523 --> 00:03:44.053
All of the adhesives and chemicals used to make that car

00:03:44.053 --> 00:03:46.267
will out gas and collect inside,

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:49.303
creating what we know as the new car smell.

00:03:49.303 --> 00:03:51.802
All right, time to leave earth for good.

00:03:51.802 --> 00:03:54.463
Let's go into the space between planets.

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:58.242
Now remember that in a laboratory, the best vacuum we've been able to create

00:03:58.242 --> 00:04:01.747
is about 100 particles per cubic centimeter.

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:04.419
Well, between the planets and our solar system,

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:09.823
there is space that only contains ten particles per cubic centimeter.

00:04:09.823 --> 00:04:13.196
And if you leave our solar system in the innerstellar space,

00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:17.462
you're only going to find about one particle per cubic centimeter.

00:04:17.462 --> 00:04:20.937
The real winner though is intergalactic space.

00:04:20.937 --> 00:04:23.695
Leave the Milky Way altogether and you can find regions

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:28.307
where there's only one or two particles
per cubic meter.

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:31.446
Okay, that's cool and all, but would it be possible

00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:34.443
to find a region of space where there is absolutely

00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:37.653
and literally nothing, no matter at all?

00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:40.889
Well, according to quantum mechanics, no.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.678
First of all, you've got gravitational and electromagnetic fields

00:04:44.678 --> 00:04:48.295
that extend forever, because the particles that cause

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:51.362
those fields to happen have no mass whatsoever.

00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:54.136
And this is what's really mind blowing:

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:58.458
there's a thing known as virtual particles
that's happening all the time,

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:01.435
even around us right now where there's no vacuum.

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:05.275
These virtual particles come into
existence and then disappear.

00:05:05.275 --> 00:05:08.079
And we believe they exist for a couple of reasons.

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:10.679
One big reason is the fact that our universe

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:14.616
continues to expand, even though that
shouldn't necessarily happen.

00:05:14.616 --> 00:05:18.953
Where are we getting that extra force that pushes it, that causes it to keep expanding?

00:05:18.953 --> 00:05:24.093
Well, these particles that pop into
existence and disappear may be the answer.

00:05:24.093 --> 00:05:29.095
Even crazier is an effect we've observed
known as the Casimir Force.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:32.869
If you put two pieces of metal nanometers
apart inside a vacuum,

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.704
they will be pushed together.

00:05:35.704 --> 00:05:38.680
One of the most popular theories for why this happens

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.652
is that these virtual particles popping
into space and then disappearing

00:05:42.652 --> 00:05:45.385
are actually reflecting off of the metal.

00:05:45.385 --> 00:05:47.955
But because the plates are so close together,

00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:51.053
particles with wavelengths longer than that gap

00:05:51.053 --> 00:05:56.498
don't get reflected, so there's more virtual particles pushing on the outside than the inside,

00:05:56.498 --> 00:05:58.698
and the metal plates contact.

00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:01.562
I know these concepts have gotten pretty crazy,

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:06.733
but rest assured that really all it means is that whenever you feel down and feel like nothing matters,

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.110
you're scientifically incorrect.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.741
Nothing matters, there can't be nothing.

00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:14.911
There's always matter, there's always something.

00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:17.379
And as always, thanks for watching.
