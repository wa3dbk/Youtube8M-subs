Hi! My name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
expertvillage.com. In this clip we are going

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.379
to talk about the proper way to reinstall
the vehicle's alternator to its mounting brackets.

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.760
As you can see we have two mounting holes
to deal with. What we will do is take and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.220
drop our alternator down in the approximate
location to where it goes, grab one of the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.059
bolts we've got here and we are going to line
it up. What I like to do is to get both bolts

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.929
started before I tighten either one. That
way I secure a nice good fit. If you were

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:46.050
just to roll one bolt in and run it down tight,
the alternator more than likely isn't lined

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.249
up with the other bolts corresponding hole.
Then you are going to have to loosen it back

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.249
up and install the other bolt. Once we've
got the first one started, go ahead and get

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:04.159
the second one in there and run them down
While the bolts are loose, it is going to

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.829
be best to run them down your fingers as far
as you can. That will save you ratchet time.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:18.350
Your fingers will operate faster than a ratchet
as long as there is not a whole bunch of resistance

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:39.560
in the threads. It's a good idea to take and
just kind of wiggle the alternator around

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.219
as you are snugging the bolts up. That will
help it make nice and flat, this bolt here

00:01:45.219 --> 00:02:15.110
ran down finger tight. You are going to take
a run down its partner.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.790
You can use the socket and extension as a
kind of screwdriver and that will give you

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.459
a little bit more grip on the bolt and allow
you to run it down just a little farther without

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:53.470
having to stick your ratchet in there. These
bolts are not a hard and steel bolt and do

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.190
not have to be extremely tight. The specification
on this bolt is going to be some where in

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.260
the neighborhood of 15 and 20 foot pounds.
As about as tight you want to put in a spark

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:14.030
plug, once its bottomed out it is going to
be a quarter turn, possibly a half turn, past

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:28.459
tight. As you can see I'm using a relatively
small ratchet so not to put too much lever

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.450
on them and there you go. Go ahead and give
it a wiggle. Don;t have any slop in your alternator.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.420
That is properly installed our far as bolts
go.
