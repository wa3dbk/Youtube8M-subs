ERIKA STORM WASSER: Hi, I'm
Erika, comedian and

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.350
host of Spaces TV.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.400
I just moved into
a Tribeca loft.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.950
But the only reason I was able
to afford it is because it's

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.770
falling apart.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.800
But the place has great bones.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.953
It has so much potential.

00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:13.890
And luckily, I'm always
down for a

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.946
renovation makeover project.

00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:18.460
Which is why we are going room
by room with the help of my

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.710
friends from Spaces TV, and
the design savvy that I've

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.777
picked up along the way, and
turning this space from a hot

00:00:23.777 --> 00:00:25.914
mess, into a place
I can call home.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.790
This is our kitchen, which as
you know from other episodes,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.840
we have the world's worst
countertops ever.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.820
They're red.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.480
They're brassy.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.980
They're Formica.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.580
They go with absolutely
nothing.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.590
They are terrible and I thought
that we were going to

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.870
be stuck with them.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.640
But not for long, because I
found this amazing product

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.775
called iCoat.

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:55.640
And it will take Formica, or any
other countertop surface,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.620
and make it really amazing.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.240
So I can't wait to show you
guys so you can do this in

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.920
your own home.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.730
If you live in a rental or
just want to do a cheap

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.060
renovation, this is honestly one
of the coolest things I've

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.620
discovered in a long time.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.430
I can't wait to get started.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.780
Let's do this.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.620
Owner, founder, amazing
man, Tim Phelps.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.060
He came all the way from
Arizona to show

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.670
us how to do it.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.530
I'm psyched about it.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.670
Because essentially, if you want
to do a renovation but

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.540
you don't have a ton of money,
or you live in a place that's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.880
a rental but you hate the
countertop, like I do,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.250
basically you can
take anything--

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.120
Formica, is there anything
that you can't treat?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.100
TIM PHELPS: No.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980
ERIKA STORM WASSER: You can
literally take anything and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.650
make it look incredible.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.120
So tell me about iCoat.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.550
TIM PHELPS: Well, what we're
doing is it's a concrete-based

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.840
product, and we go in
three thin steps of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.970
concrete over the top.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.246
And then we color it and put
an epoxy top coat on it.

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:43.740
ERIKA STORM WASSER:
I'm excited.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.800
We're going to go get
our hands dirty.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.075
Stay tuned.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:49.330
TIM PHELPS: This is the concrete
product that we use

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.640
to resurface the countertops.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.167
It's a just add water only mix,
and we're getting ready

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:53.806
to do the edges.

00:01:53.806 --> 00:01:55.480
We're going to use
one cup of water.

00:02:02.353 --> 00:02:06.772
The first step is we're going
to take that corner that's

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:07.754
round right now.

00:02:07.754 --> 00:02:10.454
We're going to square
that off to hide the

00:02:10.454 --> 00:02:12.173
fact that it's round.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.690
Once that starts to dry up,
we're going to come in and

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.412
we're going to add some
more material to

00:02:16.412 --> 00:02:18.096
the edge like this.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.982
And then we're going to
trowel it all out.

00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:22.425
That becomes our base
to color on.

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:26.760
And then we'll come back and add
two more coats to the top

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.156
as things dry.

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:31.355
OK, after the material dries up
a little bit, we're going

00:02:31.355 --> 00:02:34.947
to come in and just clean it up
a little bit so that it's

00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:35.660
nice and smooth.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.130
ERIKA STORM WASSER: So now our
two layers have dried and our

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.410
ends have dried.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.878
TIM PHELPS: Right.

00:02:39.878 --> 00:02:42.218
And now you're just going to
take this stone, and really

00:02:42.218 --> 00:02:45.480
lightly knock off the loose
pieces and then we'll brush

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.210
all the dust off.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.802
But really lightly just go
ahead and do that on the

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:49.270
countertop.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.050
ERIKA STORM WASSER: And this,
for those of you who don't

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.476
have this at home, it's an
acrylic rubbing stone.

00:02:54.476 --> 00:02:57.332
But honestly, who doesn't have
one of those in their kitchen?

00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:03.320
I'm just standing here.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.382
I'm really actually offering
no value whatsoever.

00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:09.414
I'm just standing
here and nodding

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:10.664
like I'm doing something.

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:17.849
TIM PHELPS: The next step is
we're putting on a primer on

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.720
the concrete to prevent any
outgassing, or any dimpling,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.170
or anything else in the epoxy.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.980
There are some materials in
this that prevent water

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.860
intrusion into it.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.210
It can also cause the surface
tension in the epoxy to break.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.320
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Now,
is there such a

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.460
thing as too much?

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.840
TIM PHELPS: Yeah.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.180
You want it on pretty thin.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.988
Like everything else, it can
take a long time to dry.

00:03:38.988 --> 00:03:39.460
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Oops.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.250
TIM PHELPS: So what we're going
to do now is we're going

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.380
to mix the epoxy in this
container for the top coat.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.280
And because it's a metal
illusion epoxy, we're going to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.195
mix in the metal effect product

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:53.630
which is a white powder.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.750
And we're going to mix in the
colorant, which today we're

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.920
going to go with a stainless
steel effect, so it's a

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.170
Mistress Mercy product.

00:04:06.498 --> 00:04:11.950
And this should be--

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.340
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Before you
do any of this, you have to

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.690
warm the epoxy up.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.794
And if you're really gangster
like us, you'll

00:04:16.794 --> 00:04:18.729
just put it in a bathtub.

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:19.959
TIM PHELPS: That's if
you're in New York.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.434
If you're in Arizona,
just put it outside.

00:04:25.404 --> 00:04:27.879
I'll put this down here, because
we do not need to make

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:28.374
a bigger mess.

00:04:28.374 --> 00:04:29.364
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Than
we already have.

00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:31.344
Oh, wow.

00:04:31.344 --> 00:04:32.829
That's so cool!

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:35.799
It literally looks
like silver.

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:38.100
TIM PHELPS: And then I put this
on with an applicator.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.293
You can use a brush, but this
is a notched squeegee, so it

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:44.567
makes it real easy to get
the correct depth.

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:48.986
Let me just pour
some on there.

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:52.670
ERIKA STORM WASSER: So after you
lay the first coat of the

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.165
epoxy on, why are you smashing
it with a brush?

00:04:55.165 --> 00:04:57.480
TIM PHELPS: Well, what I'm doing
is adding some texture.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.150
As the epoxy starts to sink,
it's a suspension of color and

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.780
the metal effect powder.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.260
So what happens is it sinks down
to the bottom, and what

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.975
we're doing here is we're
just pulling it up so

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:10.080
you get that 3D effect.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.144
And because it's drying now,
it'll stay suspended in there

00:05:13.144 --> 00:05:14.635
and look awesome.

00:05:14.635 --> 00:05:19.605
ERIKA STORM WASSER: It's already
coming together so

00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:23.170
stunningly, I'm dying.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.160
Now for the most exciting part
ever, we are now going to

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.410
light it on fire.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.480
TIM PHELPS: What we're doing is
using the heat and the CO2

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.520
in this flame to take the
bubbles away from the epoxy

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.060
and make it lay perfectly
flat.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.280
ERIKA STORM WASSER: Boom.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.530
Hello, gorgeous.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.930
TIM PHELPS: So anyway, in the
last 24 hours, we've managed

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.990
to turn what was an old Formica
countertop into a

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.740
stunning, beautiful
iCoat countertop.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.920
And we're all done.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.730
It's just a matter of cleaning
up tomorrow.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.570
But we want you to know that
our products are available.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.705
You could get us online at

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.060
And we've also got a
distribution network that if

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.050
you're looking to get trained
yourself, that my distributors

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.860
can train you.
