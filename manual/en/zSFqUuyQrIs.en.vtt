00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:07.874
笑ってた　狂っていた
I was laughing. I was insane.

00:01:07.873 --> 00:01:11.245
絶えず泣きじゃくった
I was crying uncontrollably

00:01:11.364 --> 00:01:17.430
忘れてた感情が不安から魔が刺した
The feelings I'd forgotten about stabbed me from anxiety.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.016
歪んでく視界　瞑想
My vision becomes distorted, so I meditate.

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:23.516
動揺は冷め切った
My agitation calms down

00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:30.322
忘れてた感情はよくて妄想で埋葬
My forgotton feelings were buried in my imagination

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:45.905
笑ってた　狂っていた
I was laughing. I was crazy.

00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:49.025
ただ怯えきっていた
I was terrified.

00:01:49.107 --> 00:01:54.631
忘れてた感情はよくて妄想を埋葬
So I buried my forgotten feelings in my imagination.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.059
この眼で
With these eyes

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:57.601
この眼で
With these eyes

00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:00.549
見える映像全て
all of the images I see

00:02:00.574 --> 00:02:01.957

00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:07.022
すれ違い始めてく
everything begins to separate

00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:08.412
奏でて
A song plays

00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:09.887
奏でて
A song plays

00:02:09.907 --> 00:02:13.326
言葉だけ泳いで
only the words swim around

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:14.681
壊れて
Broken

00:02:14.852 --> 00:02:16.201
壊れて
Broken

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:19.581
想いが零れ出す
my thoughts spill over

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:23.319
「いつだって会いたい」って
"I've always wanted to see you"

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.658
君からそう言われたら
If I heard you say that...

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.518
もう何も言えない
I can't say anything

00:02:29.723 --> 00:02:32.817
もう何も言えない
I can't say anything

00:02:45.482 --> 00:02:49.251
笑ってた　狂っていた
I was laughing. I was insane.

00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:52.132
誰と触れ合ったんだ
Who did I come into contact with?

00:02:52.217 --> 00:02:58.864
忘れてた感情が不安から魔が刺した
The feelings I'd forgotten about stabbed me from anxiety.

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:02.003
歪んだ儚い幻想
My hallucinations fill me with emptyness

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.922
衝動は冷め切った
the urges subside

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:10.554
忘れてた感情はよくて妄想で埋葬
My forgotton feelings were buried in my imagination

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.679

一滴涙だって
One tear.

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.814
君が笑ってくれたんだ
Because you smiled for me.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.673
僕は強くなれる
I can become strong.

00:05:02.893 --> 00:05:06.087
そんな気がするんだ
I can feel it.
