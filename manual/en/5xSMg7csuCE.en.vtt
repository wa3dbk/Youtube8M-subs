00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.380
So the next step that we're doing, we're adding
our roasted corn, our asparagus tips, our

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.010
cherry tomatoes. It's going to be our next
step. I hear my grits over there bubbling,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.199
so they're just about almost done. Now, a
standard recipe, you can do them with just

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.670
regular tap water or bottled water, and you
can also do them creamy as well. For some,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.230
you can start off with water and add your
grits in. And then at the very end, put maybe

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.250
just 1/3 of a teaspoon of -- I'm sorry, 1/3
of a cup of heavy cream and that will actually

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.600
get them really creamy. So we hear those popping
away. Our sauce is going. Everything is perfect

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.870
so far. So now, with the asparagus tips, you
can buy fresh asparagus, lightly blanche them,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.350
and then put them in shock bath that gives
them that vibrant green color. And a shock

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:07.529
bath is just basically a bowl of ice with
water. And immediately after the asparagus

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:12.299
have reached the halfway point of cooking,
we're going to take them and put them right

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.340
into that ice bath. So in this case, we did
the store-bought, canned asparagus tips, so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:41.859
this is our first step. And right here, I
have added a cup of asparagus. I'm going to

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:50.460
give this a nice whisk. Now, we can turn our
heat down really low on this because our cream

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:01.569
is already reduced down. At the same time,
we're going to shut our grits off as well.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:15.390
Next, we're going to be adding our cherry
tomatoes.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.180
With the corn, the corn is for, definitely,
a visual. But I'm a corn fanatic, so we're

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:36.010
going to add three tablespoons of corn.
