00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.230
well uh somewhere underneath all them
carrots potatoes and onions is a huge

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:16.320
roast I'm fixing to put this in my solar
oven all right we're in there this thing

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.210
heated up to about a hundred and there's
no way I can hear I put my shadow on

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.170
about 165 degrees before I put this in
here and that's with the whole about

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.399
9:00 a.m. 9:30 Sun I'm gonna come out
about every hour and REM this and I'm

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.149
thinking five or six hours and I should
have cooked roast I figured out a way to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.530
aim this and aiming it is the most
important thing besides having

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.480
insulation and reflectors aiming it
directly at the Sun is really important

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.420
so I added this right here and this
shadow look at my shadow where I'm

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.060
pointing right there tells me when I've
got it aimed at the Sun correctly and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.650
this I just got a board here and I'm
holding it up sort of beside this and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:31.920
then look at my shadow there see the Sun
adds 10 pounds you know so when this is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.159
uh you know at its smallest watch see so
I compared that angle to the angle that

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:49.820
I have the oven and that's how I get the
the angle right I'm up to 200 degrees in

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:00.000
one hour don't know if you can see this
because there's so much reflection so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.130
trust me you can trust me it's 200
degrees and it's just now 10 o'clock so

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.760
for the next 4 hours the Sun is gonna be
at its highest and hottest so I just

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:22.090
keep an eye on it and it's working good
it's 11 a.m. and it's at 2:25 I'll check

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.450
it in one more hour I just can't wait
anymore

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:38.200
it's been there for hours hovering
between 225 and 250 and I'm gonna go

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.550
ahead and take it out bring it in the
kitchen open it up and let's have a look

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.989
see it's been a cloudy day the clouds
have been coming and going all day long

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.150
I really expected this thing to get up a
little higher than that but when I get

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.230
the corners in and the mylar for
reflectors I have no doubt in my mind

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.360
this thing will get a well into the 300s
so I'm gonna take this out and bring it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.560
in well I may not be the smartest guy in
the world but you can count on me being

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:19.239
honest what we're looking at is the
roast in the oven I only got that thing

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.670
up to 250 at its highest and you know
the clouds

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.760
it was scattered clouds today it was or
partly cloudy sorry I'm not a weatherman

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.480
anyway I'm disappointed really
disappointed I know I can get this thing

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.930
up into the 300s I'm a hundred percent
positive IKEA but not today too many

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.440
clouds and I don't have the proper
reflective material I did boil water

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.829
yesterday that was pretty awesome and
today I got it up to 250 with more

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:03.130
careful aiming but when I replace those
reflectors with mylar I'll do another

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.690
video I'm going to put this video up
just in case anybody's been waiting to

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.150
see you know how I can cook on it but
the roast wasn't done I've got it in I'm

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.970
going to
get in here for an hour at 400 degrees

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:23.770
just finish it off if I had another
couple hours of Sun this would have been

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.260
done the onions were done the taters
were done

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.060
carrots were done but the meat which is
a little too rare for my wife so there

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.370
you have it and thanks for following
this and it's probably going to be Oh

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.660
beginning of summer before I get around
to getting another solar cooking video

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.220
up take care go
