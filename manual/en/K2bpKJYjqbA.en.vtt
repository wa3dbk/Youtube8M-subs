00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
in this video I'm going to be sharing
with you one of my most magical stones

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.370
and when I mean magical I mean magical
this stone this blue stone is

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.820
kyanite kyanite is a stone that has
taken me to different dimensions it has

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.119
totally allowed me to travel to places
that I've never been it has surprised me

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.640
it's magic and its energy has availed
itself to me and I'm very very thankful

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.809
for it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.020
I mean I this is something that I never
expected when i first bought this stone I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.440
thought that well it's just beautiful
it glows it has a lot of energy and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.670
I did try to use the other different
colors of stones and the green kyanite

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.050
and the black kyanite but there's
nothing as powerful as this particular

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.719
blue kyanite stone this stone has been
really really really good to me

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.340
look at how beautiful it is this stone
is...when you just hold it in your hands

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.770
and just use it for meditation the
pulsation the energy the light that

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
just flows and comes into your body is
beyond this...I mean it's something that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.049
cannot be described you have to
experience it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.140
I know people say different things about
different stones and every stone has a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.240
different quality and a different kind
of magic depending on what the person is

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.970
using it for or what the person needs
in their lives and what kind of energy

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.790
is attracted...or what kind of energy
you have attracted a stone will come into

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.340
your life to allow you to either heal or
to overcome something or to be more

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.149
empowered or as a tool for whatever
purpose

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.830
Kyanite came into my life for magic
I mean you could use it for anything but

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.910
for me kyanite has come into my life for
magic and trust me when you combine blue

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.420
kyanite if you are into making crystal
grids and things like that when you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.430
want light energy when you want to
attract the presence of angelic beings

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.190
and your spirit guides and to travel
astrally into other dimensions trust me

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.140
when you combine kyanite and selenite
you have a winner

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.260
I mean...maybe this is for me but this
is just some of the magical things that

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.360
kyanite has taught me if you want to
attract angelic presence into your life

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.140
if you want to contact your guides if
you want them to contact you this baby right

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.319
here blue kyanite is the go-to stone

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.709
I mean it could be different for you but
this has been my experience and all my

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.030
videos are based on my own experience
and how I bond with the stones and how

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.850
they speak to me i'm going to show you
another kyanite that I have this is one

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.549
that was one of the first maybe it was
the second kyanite that i ever bought

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:32.709
but it is magical this kyanite stone
actually was one of the first stones to

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.850
speak to me I mean it feels weird when
you tell someone that a stone can speak to

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.389
you

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:44.139
I mean it's some kind of telepathic
conversation...I mean I didn't

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.519
ask for it the stone revealed itself to
me this particular stone is called

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:56.560
