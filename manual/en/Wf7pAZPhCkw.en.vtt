00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:15.499
Hi everyone. So here we are today with the Samsung Galaxy S3 running Android 4.2.2.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:17.960
Why is that important?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.680
Well, as you may know, the Samsung Galaxy S4 launched with Android 4.2.2

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.359
the latest version of Google Android's Jelly Bean.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.379
So, what we have now is the Galaxy S3

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.000
that is quite a bit closer in

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.219
kind of functionality to the Galaxy S4.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.810
They haven't ported across a lot of the apps yet,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.809
no idea if they will at this point

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.870
but what they have done is incorporated quite a lot of the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.690
Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2 features. I'm going to stop saying that now!

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.170
But here's basically what we've got.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.640
The notification area has been given a redesign including all of the quick settings

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.610
widgets at the top.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.990
You also now have

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.269
the notification area drop down for the settings widget there

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.720
which makes it really quick and easy to rearrange them or turn all of them on and off.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.450
There's a notification panel.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.360
They've also completely overhauled

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.500
the settings area which now works exactly like the Galaxy S4

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.659
so everything is now split down

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.730
into these four core areas across the top

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.540
and then more information underneath.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.680
so if you go into connections you've got your
access to your wifi, Blutooth, data usage, networks

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.340
You can now turn NFC and the S Beam features on and off

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.350
directly from the connections area, it's not in a sub menu any longer.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.710
Nearby devices, Screen Mirroring  and Kies is
also in there,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.790
basically anything connections related.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.030
In My Device, this very much deals with personalisation

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.460
so you've got your lock screen area which we'll come onto in a moment which also now includes

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.240
the lock screen widgets. Yes!

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.390
Absolutely fantastic to finally have that because there's so much extra functionality

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.540
we can add to our phones when we can add

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.840
widgets directly onto the lock screen but we'll take a look at that in a minute.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.760
So you've now got all of those options in there, the multi window and notification

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.830
panel you can turn on and off, we saw that a moment ago you can also do multi window support as well

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.420
which is the slideouts. That's from a previous version. That actually came out on the Note 2

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.040
but it's still there

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.749
if you enjoy using it.

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.209
You've got the screen mode

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.859
which now has adapt display

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.099
technology built-in.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.320
So with the Galaxy S4 they launched a new software tweak as it were,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.990
which allowed the display

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.859
or the device to sense the content that you were looking at

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.709
and then adapt the display brightness and colours accordingly.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.539
You can turn that on or off  or put it back onto dynamic.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.339
if you like, leave it on there.

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.379
Daydream is included

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.829
I haven't had a good chance to play with that yet but it looks pretty cool

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.329
and also a few other bits and pieces, your fonts are in there as well.

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.639
LED indicator, sound,

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.680
home screen mode if you want to switch it into

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.499
easy mode for those people that want to or do,

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.009
call your blocking,

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.649
driving mode is included

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.419
power saving, accessories

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.570
wow, there's plenty in here!

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.329
Motions, smart screen and voice control. Let's have a quick look at smart screen.

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.480
Yes, they've not incorporated all of the functionality from the S4 here

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.460
it's still just the same items we had previously.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.709
motion controls likewise I think the same.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.689
In accounts this is really probably the best change that Samsung have made here.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.489
They've moved accounts rather than having it jammed

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.260
somewhere else, it's now out on its own and you can quickly and easily see what all your

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.499
accounts are and interact with them if you need to.

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.620
In more, this is where they've kind of put all the useful tools really.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.269
You've got your application manager

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.529
for uninstalling applications and seeing what's taking up the space,

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.839
battery for seeing what's chewing up your battery the most,

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:52.529
my screen usually.

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:56.439
Storage space, date and time and about device.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.829
And if you need to

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.109
pop it into developer mode. Just like that.

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.459
There's your developer options

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.919
should you need them.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.949
So that's the settings. OK,

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.439
so let's take a look at the widgets on the lock screen because this is probably the

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.059
coolest feature they've added.

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.609
So all you need to do, where it says the life companion if you drag there

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:16.710
you can flick

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.540
over to the various widgets.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.520
Now if you keep going you'll find the one with the plus symbol

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.070
and you can then

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.619
add one of your widgets.

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:32.119
And you can see there I've now got

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:33.800
widgets on my lock screen

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.620
and working beautifully.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.879
Gives you a lot more control of your Galaxy S3

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.910
without having to go all the way into the device.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.739
You can see there I can fire up my camera if I want to.

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.860
Back out and drops into my home screen.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.059
Very very nice. Overall it's nice to see Samsung  keeping pace with the Galaxy S4

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.250
and at least back porting some of the features and

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.250
more important, improving the S3's usability

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.340
as well. Certainly these changes to the settings area are absolutely fantastic.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.590
They were great on the S4

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.139
to now have them ported across to the S3 as well is great.

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.889
Obviously we can expect to see these on the Note 2 as well. I doubt very much

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.699
Samsung will leave the Note 2 out of these changes, it makes sense.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:17.840
Absolutely fantastic.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.229
If you want to try this update out, it's not final software, it hasn't got any warranty,

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.600
you can get it from sammobile.com

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.650
do a Google search

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.810
download it, run Odin

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.529
flash away

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:36.839
and you can be running it as well. Like I say, forget your warranty if you do this or anything

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:41.939
like that it is incrementing behind the counter as well so do it at your own risk

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.629
basically but from what I can see so far

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.060
there's a few little strange bugs here or there

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.400
but it's looking pretty good.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.350
Some great new features absolutely fantastic.
