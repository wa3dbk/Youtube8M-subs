00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.397
Hello again Clean My Space nation.
This week we're tackling a

00:00:03.397 --> 00:00:07.007
cleaning job that rarely
if ever gets done

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:12.076
and it gets the kitchen
and the bathroom working in concert.

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:16.017
We don't see that too often, now do we?
Let me explain.

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:19.484
Your oven racks are quite a
pain point when it comes to cleaning.

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:22.364
You see, you can't leave them
in a self-cleaning oven cycle,

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:25.327
and they're nearly impossible
to scrub effectively.

00:00:25.327 --> 00:00:30.273
But they do look awful after
a few thrills and spills and can lead

00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:34.162
to bad smells and burning,
charred gunk over time.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:36.716
So I'm going to show you
how to clean your oven racks

00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:40.869
with next to no effort at all.
I assure you when this video is over,

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:47.041
within 24 hours 80% of you will have
cleaned your oven racks, and the other 20%

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:50.758
will do it within 48 hours.
It's that easy.

00:00:50.758 --> 00:00:52.788
Okay, enough is enough.
Let's get going.

00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:57.479
Oh, but first I want to tell you if you
notice I am congested, it is true.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.228
I have a cold, but that will not stop
me from filming a video.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:04.231
♪ [music] ♪

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:10.082
Here's what you'll need --
an old towel, either a soft sponge

00:01:10.082 --> 00:01:14.285
or a cleaning toothbrush or both,
about a cup of laundry detergent.

00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:16.874
Now you can use the
powdered kind or the liquid kind.

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:19.576
I prefer the powdered kind
for this job.

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:21.643
But if you can't find that,
liquid is okay.

00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:25.090
You can also use dishwashing detergent,
which will work just as well.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.784
Again, powdered or liquid
will work either way.

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:32.623
And finally, a bathtub or at least some
other kind of tub, which is big enough

00:01:32.623 --> 00:01:36.839
to fit your entire oven rack into.
Pretty easy so far.

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:41.505
I am officially standing in my tub.
I have all of the supplies that we need.

00:01:41.505 --> 00:01:43.595
So let's get cleaning.

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:46.277
♪ [music] ♪

00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:48.576
Lay the towel down on the
bottom of your bathtub.

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:52.001
This is going to protect the surface
of your tub from being scratched

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.264
by the oven racks
or the powdered detergent.

00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:57.376
It's an important step,
so do not skip this one.

00:01:57.376 --> 00:02:00.244
Next, we'll take
our dirty oven racks

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:05.631
and just place
them on top of the towel.

00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:10.205
Then plug the drain and start filling
the tub with the hottest water possible.

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:14.314
We're going to let the tub fill until
the water completely covers the racks.

00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:17.205
Hot water is really important
here, my friends.

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:19.898
It helps break down the grease
and activate the detergent.

00:02:19.898 --> 00:02:25.273
It will cool over time, but the
initial blast should be muy caliente.

00:02:25.273 --> 00:02:29.406
Finally we'll take a cup of the
laundry detergent or the dish detergent,

00:02:29.406 --> 00:02:32.888
and as you can see I've dissolved
it in some hot water and then

00:02:32.888 --> 00:02:36.859
added it to the tub to ensure
the product is broken down well.

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.842
But because I also like the powder
because you get that abrasion,

00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:42.269
I've sprinkled a little bit
of extra powder on the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.495
bottom of the towel so that way
you get a little bit of column A

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:48.270
and a little bit of column B.
And that's it.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.649
Now we'll let the detergent do
its thing for the next 6 to 10 hours.

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:55.572
It's probably just best to leave it be
overnight and give it enough time

00:02:55.572 --> 00:02:58.673
to really loosen that
caked-on grease and grime.

00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:02.015
So we'll see you in six hours.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:33.993
♪ [music] ♪

00:03:33.993 --> 00:03:37.842
At this point, all we need to do
is wipe off any remaining residue,

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:39.931
and it should come
off fairly easily.

00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:43.922
You can use a cleaning toothbrush
or a soft sponge or cloth to get into

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:47.251
those spaces
and voila a clean oven rack.

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:50.719
♪ [music] ♪

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.155
Well, I didn't quite time myself,
but I'll say I was scrubbing anywhere

00:03:54.155 --> 00:03:58.113
between 5 and 10 minutes, and I
was just using this soft sponge

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:01.771
and I used a little bit of the
detergent for some added abrasion.

00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:07.982
Now, the results are pretty excellent.
They didn't come with me just pulling

00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:11.754
the racks out of the
soupy situation going on over here.

00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:13.914
Of course, there was a little
bit of elbow grease involved,

00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:18.244
but it was nowhere near the amount
of scrubbing that I would have to do

00:04:18.244 --> 00:04:22.633
had I not done this overnight
bubble bath for the oven racks first.

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:26.846
Now, I will tell you dish detergent
is designed to work specifically

00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:31.966
on this type of mess, this grease.
So if you can find powdered

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:35.217
dish detergent, go for it.
I didn't have any, so we used

00:04:35.217 --> 00:04:37.840
laundry detergent,
and it works just fine.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.428
But I wonder if you used dish detergent
if it would work any better.

00:04:41.428 --> 00:04:44.979
It's important to note that you
should never leave your oven racks

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.754
in the oven during the
self-clean cycle because it

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:50.842
can strip the chrome off the rack
and permanently damage it.

00:04:50.842 --> 00:04:54.627
The oven self-cleaning feature
is not designed to clean the racks,

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:58.701
and besides this method is so easy
it's like they clean themselves anyway.

00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:03.252
Also, if you have an oven with those
coil burners, you can throw in the

00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:07.094
drip pans overnight in the tub as well.
I mean, why not?

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:10.240
The comment question
this week is: What should you

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.573
be cleaning more often
than you actually do?

we'll do a video on it.

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:20.092
Or just say hi or tell me
how you clean your oven racks.

00:05:20.092 --> 00:05:22.031
I just like hearing from you.
