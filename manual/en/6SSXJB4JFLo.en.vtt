00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.080
Jesus Christ HIMSELF IS Wonderful, He is the
Counselor MIGHTY GOD!

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.630
EVERLASTING FATHER!

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.589
HE is the Prince of Peace!

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:18.620
Of HIS reign there is NO END and HE is IMMANUEL,
GOD WITH US!

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:26.980
He left HIS place on High and He came down
here to earth in the form of a MAN.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.369
He was born of a woman,
of Mary, and one of His favorite names for

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.420
Himself was SON OF MAN because He became a
MAN!

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.929
He dwelt in the FLESH, GOD dwelt IN THE FLESH!

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:49.399
People will say "Well Jesus cannot possibly
be God because He prayed to His Father."

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.739
Well of course He prayed to His Father; JESUS
IS Immanuel GOD WITH US and we don't pray

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.699
to a man,
when Jesus was in the FLESH He could not hear

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.780
prayers of people all around the world.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.350
JESUS PRAYED TO HIS FATHER, He LEFT HIS PLACE
ON HIGH, and He came down here to earth to

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.960
show us the way.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.730
HE BECAME A MAN!

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.970
He is GOD WITH US!

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.510
Do YOU worship Jesus?

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.280
Do you obey HIM?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.450
When Jesus died on the cross He then resurrected
in 3 days,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:37.460
and then He was caught up to heaven and Jesus
said that ALL POWER AND ALL AUTHORITY WAS/IS

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.310
GIVEN TO HIM!

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.360
ALL POWER and all AUTHORITY has been given
to JESUS and what is written of HIM is that

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:54.090
He is KING of kings and LORD of lords,
there is NO NAME higher than HIS name.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.409
There is no name higher than the name of God,
because JESUS CHRIST IS GOD, He is Immanuel,

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.370
GOD WITH US!

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.890
Do YOU truly know Jesus?

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.520
Do you worship Him as God?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.289
Is He YOUR personal Lord and Savior?

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.360
Is He your personal God?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.330
Do you truly know Him?

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.110
May the grace of Jesus be with you.
