Hi, this is Laura Turner and today we're going
to talk about how to write a good plot. A

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.929
good plot as oppose to just a plot is applied
for that in which every incident happens for

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.860
a reason. And in fact, the incidents will
stack up against one another to reach a climactic

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.600
moment of "aha" at the end. After you see
a good movie or a good mystery or a good play,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.920
you usually say, "oh I see", how everything
added up to meet that end. So a plot can make

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.350
your play or your story, something that is
very entertaining to the reader and met the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.229
reader wants to go back and read it again.
So make sure first of all that your incidents

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:53.329
follow each other in a trigger-heap fashion.
What I mean by trigger-heap is, if I hold

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.539
a gun and I shoot the gun, someone's going
to fall over and heap. So an action creates

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.520
a reaction. If someone falls over in a heap,
that becomes the trigger for the next action,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.470
which is someone comes to pick that person
up and carry them to the hospital, we hope.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.040
So you have triggers lead to heaps, lead to
new triggers and then your plot has this sort

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.670
of fall on itself in that fashion. Okay. So
do that and you will be able to keep your

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.720
audience hook, just my second point about
making a good plot. You want to end your scenes

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.830
and your chapters leaving the audience or
reader wanting more. It's the commercial break

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.610
at the end of "Deal or No Deal" and the end
of "Who Is Smarter Than A Fifth Grader". Right?

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.950
We want to see the next question and so you
have to keep your plot moving in that fashion.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.710
So if you think of that very basic simple
game show kind of way. That's what I mean

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.960
by hooking. Finally, in a good plot, you're
going to tie together all the aspects of your

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.369
plot into the climax and the climax is going
to be a result of everything that you've laid

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.050
down before. A good way to figure out how
to make your incidents adapt like this is

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.050
to actually take your ending, if you especially,
if you think your ending isn't working. Take

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.020
your ending and then work your way back through
the story in a descending order. So take your

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.030
very final action and see how the incidents
that you wrote before are leading up to that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.810
end. So for example by looking at the play
or the story backwards, you can see what is

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.260
needed to propel it forward. So give that
a try and see if that doesn't work for you

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.610
and hopefully you can make a very good plot.
