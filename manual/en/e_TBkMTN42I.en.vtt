00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.429
hi everyone

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.169
welcome to this addition of ProTech

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.239
Today we're going to go over the proper
way to calibrate the crank arm on the

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:28.869
93 to 05 GM hidden park wiper
motors during installation

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.490
if the crank arm isn't calibrated correctly

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.149
the wiper blades can end up parking in
the middle of the windshield rather than

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.850
in the hidden position

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.080
So, once you have the old motor removed and
the bracket hardware transferred over

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.100
you'll need to connect the new motor to
the harness and turn the ignition to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.890
the accessory position

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.720
but don't start the vehicle

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.590
Next, turn the wiper control switch to the
maximum pulse or delay position

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.690
causing the motor to run

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.520
wait for the wiper motor to cycle once
and then stop

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.380
after the wiper motor has stopped

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.790
use the vehicle key to turned the ignition off

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.250
the motor will now be in inner wipe
position

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.630
when the crank arm was removed from the
old unit it was in the park position

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.840
before reinstalling it on the new motor
and must be in the locked position

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.350
to do this you'll need to rotate the top
cam on the crank arm until it's in the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.659
locked position

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.479
now gently placed the crank arm assembly
on the wiper motor shaft

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.630
making sure not to apply to any downward
pressure

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.090
this is essential for the next step of
the process

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.460
rotate the crank arm assembly on the
stationary wiper motor shaft

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.980
until the depressed

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.420
park actuator arm

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.030
is four to eight millimeters away from
either the metal tab on the wiper motor

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.620
bracket or the casting pad if there is
no motor bracket

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.740
make sure to hold the motor shaft firmly
in position and don't allow it to rotate

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.780
during installation of the crank arm

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.750
Next, install the wiper motor crank arm screw
and tighten to fourteen seventeen newton

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.780
meters

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.949
or a hundred and twenty four two hundred
and fifty inch pounds

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.749
then check the gap between the wiper
arm

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:16.430
and tab to make sure it's within the
four to eight millimeter tolerance

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.389
when the gap is correct cycle the switch

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.079
from low to high to park

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.579
the crank arm should rotate just pass
the tab then reverse rotation catch it's

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.549
tab

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.409
then pop the pin out of the latch and
come to rest roughly 180

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.539
degrees from the parking paw

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:38.379
following these steps should insure the
blades park in the proper position on

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.149
the windshield

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.689
i hope this information has been
insightful and informative

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.459
thanks for your time and i'll see you on
our next edition a ProTech
