00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.070
 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.980
 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.639
So one of the things I've been asked quite a bit is all about the new

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.040
home searching with your voice and it's sort of similar to what Motorola have done on the Motorola X

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.780
I think it is.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.360
Now effectively, what Google have done is
taken their Google Now

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.480
search system and integrated it right
across the home screen

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.760
so effectively your launcher now is 
Google Now.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.220
The old launcher that used to be available

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.330
has  effectively been gutted and all of the
code has been moved across into the

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.130
search system

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.900
so effectively search and the launcher are now one integrated piece.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.070
Effectively, this is Google Now that we're surfing across on here.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.240
Even this app drawer, everything there

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.650
it's all being handled via Google Search.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.079
So it allows you to do this: " OK Google, what's the weather like today?"

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.649
A forecast for Harrogate is 52 degrees with rain.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.170
So you can see, I didn't even have to
touch the device, I didn't have to pull up a

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.840
widget,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.340
I didn't have to do anything other than say
OK Google

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.470
and there we go. It just works.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.670
The whole idea of just being able to speak a
command to your

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.340
phone and off it goes is fantastic and with Google Now having

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.510
expanded in the way it has with so many new ways of interacting

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.080
and also the data it can pull up as well
on request it just makes a wonderful

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.970
experience.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.590
If you want this functionality all you
need to do is set your Android 4.4

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.170
device

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.390
to US English or English US. If you're in any other part of the world, unfortunately this

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.159
instant feature does not work where you
can simply speak to the launcher

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.180
to your Android home screen and off Google
Mail will go.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.390
What you'd need to do, like I say, is switch over to

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.490
English US and it will just work for you
straight away.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.790
Obviously it does mean you get the American
voice and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.770
presumably it will have some issues with
certain words that the Brits love to speak

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.320
differently to the Americans and you know as
everyone else does around the world

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.359
but it does allow you to get that functionality now if you want to have a play with it and it

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.819
does work pretty well, I have to say.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.109
 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.510
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.780
