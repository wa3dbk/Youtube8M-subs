00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:08.808
Hey gamers, as you can see right now I'm outside at the Gamescom.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:13.909
Its saturday and sadly enough only two days to go.

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:18.513
And its visitors day and it's pretty crowded already,

00:00:18.513 --> 00:00:20.696
but it's weekend too ofcourse.

00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:24.271
And I'm going to the FIFA 11 presentation, I'm going to look that game very

00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:27.236
good and I will be right back with the impressions.

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:31.203
Hey gamers, I just came back from the FIFA 11 presentation and at this

00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:36.731
moment I am behind closed doors and as you can see behind me are all FIFA fans and players.

00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:39.664
I'm going to talk with them what they think about the game.

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:53.142
I'm here right now with some gamers and first off all,

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:54.338
what did you think of the presentation?

00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:58.681
It was very informative. David Rutter told us some new things of the game.

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:01.367
FIFA 11 has some gameplay improvements.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:04.490
There was some news about be a goalkeeper.

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:09.661
We have played some and we have a hands-on session now,

00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:16.653
so we can judge if this will be the best sportgame.

00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:22.411
Yes, indeed. Because that be a goalkeeper mode is just announced,

00:01:22.628 --> 00:01:24.939
but for the people home: what is this be a goalkeeper mode?

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.044
For the first time you can be the goalkeeper. Last year it was only

00:01:29.044 --> 00:01:29.994
10 vs 10

00:01:29.994 --> 00:01:35.629
and this year it is 11 vs 11. During the match you really can be

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.826
the goalkeeper and show your skills.

00:01:38.826 --> 00:01:45.787
Next to that you can be the goalkeeper there are also 50 accomplishments.

00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:50.423
And with those accomplisments you can unlock some nice things,

00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:55.342
for example some new goalkeepergloves or boots.

00:01:55.342 --> 00:02:00.218
Okey, now we already heard there are some improvements in the gameplay,

00:02:00.218 --> 00:02:02.189
can you call some improvements?

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.348
There are new animations added and this makes the gameplay smoother and

00:02:08.348 --> 00:02:14.517
there is now Personality + and that takes care for the realism on the field.

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:21.668
And all those things like Pro passing, etc.is only an advantage for the game

00:02:21.668 --> 00:02:23.808
and it plays so much better.

00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:28.395
And the advantage of Personality + is that every football player,

00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:31.706
like Cristiano Ronaldo, he really plays like Ronaldo.

00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:35.886
He really has his own dribbling style for example.

00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:45.149
On the last FIFA you had on the ball 360 movement and you could decide

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.050
where the ball needs to go. But now is it that you have on the ball

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.080
and off the ball 360 movement and when you are defending

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.702
you have also 360 movement, so you can get the ball better from your opponent.

00:02:59.702 --> 00:03:05.146
Okey, now, next to me is Absalom which you may know as

00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:07.413
the Dutch champion of FIFA 10.

00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:11.627
Absalom, how do you think FIFA 11 will do on gaming events?

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:15.250
I think FIFA 11 will do great on game events,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.278
because this game is really aweseome.

00:03:18.278 --> 00:03:23.338
I just played it and it's awesome. I also played the PC version and its awesome.

00:03:23.338 --> 00:03:29.881
They have a really next-gen experience ofcourse.

00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:36.394
Next to the fact the game is really envolved from FIFA 10.

00:03:36.627 --> 00:03:45.270
And with FIFA 10 we had like 60 participants per event,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.409
but I think with FIFA 11, we will have the double amount ofparticipants

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.734
Okey guys, thank you very much and gamers

00:03:52.734 --> 00:03:57.527
do you want to try the game for yourself? At September 16 the demo wil be

00:03:57.527 --> 00:04:03.677
released for Xbox360 en PC and the for the PS3 owners a day earlier.

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:06.987
The game wil be released at September 30.

00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:10.032
GOOOOOOAAAAAAAL!
