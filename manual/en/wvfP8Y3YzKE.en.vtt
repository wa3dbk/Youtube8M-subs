AH! LET GO OF MY SHOE.

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.293
LUCKY: LIKE MOST KIDS,
ZACH BONNER LOVES

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.428
LITTLE PUPPIES, ESPECIALLY
THOSE THAT CAN BE TRAINED

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:31.797
TO ASSIST THE SEEING-IMPAIRED.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:34.633
IT'S ONE OF THE DO-GOODER
PROJECTS HE'S TAKEN ON

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:38.537
WITH HIS MOM, LAURIE, HELPING
TO TRAIN SEEING-EYE DOGS.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:39.939
TELL ME WHY YOU DO IT.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.475
ZACH: IT MAKES ME
FEEL REALLY GOOD TO KNOW

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.977
THAT I COULD HELP SOMEBODY.

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:46.779
LAURIE: HE'S JUST A GOOD KID.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:48.147
HE'S ALWAYS CARED
ABOUT OTHERS

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:50.316
AND ALWAYS SEEMED
TO HAVE CONCERN.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.818
HE'S A REAL ORDERLY CHILD.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:55.221
HE LIKES THINGS
TO BE IN ORDER.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.423
[WHISTLES]
ZACH: PEBBLES!

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.425
LUCKY: ZACH MAY SEEM
LIKE THE LITTLE BOY NEXT DOOR,

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.827
BUT HE'S NOT QUITE.

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:03.363
LAURIE: HE WROTE A LETTER
TO THE POPE.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:06.499
AND HE'LL CALL
THE SENATOR.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.502
OR HE CALLED
THE WHITE HOUSE

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.170
AND TOLD THEM, "PRESIDENT BUSH

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.671
WAS SUPPOSED TO SEND ME
SOMETHING

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.140
AND I DIDN'T GET IT YET."

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:19.679
LUCKY: HIS MOM SAYS
SHE DISCOVERED K12

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.513
AND THE FLORIDA
VIRTUAL ACADEMY

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:23.850
WHILE SHE WAS SEARCHING
FOR A PRIVATE SCHOOL.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.519
ORIGINALLY, SHE WANTED
SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW ZACH

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:31.357
TO LEARN AT HIS OWN SPEED, WHICH
IS PRETTY FAST IN MOST SUBJECTS.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.392
LAURIE: HE WOULD SIT DOWN
AND DO A HISTORY LESSON.

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.861
AND, BECAUSE OF THE STORY,
HE DIDN'T WANT TO JUST DO ONE.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.030
HE WANTED TO SIT THERE
AND DO 10 OR 15.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.232
[CHUCKLES]

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.300
WOMAN: ALL RIGHT. TAKE IT OUT
FOR THE DAY.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.536
LUCKY: THE ICING ON THE CAKE WAS
THE FLEXIBILITY K12 OFFERS ZACH

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:47.907
TO CARRY ON HIS EXTRACURRICULAR
CHARITY PROJECTS,

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.909
LIKE THE SCHOOL SUPPLIES
HE COLLECTS

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.045
TO HELP TEACHERS WHO DON'T
HAVE A BUDGET TO BUY THEIR OWN.

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.513
WOMAN: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.349
LUCKY: HE HAS SO MANY PROJECTS,

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.151
HE STARTED HIS OWN FOUNDATION,

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.885
WHICH HAS AN IMPRESSIVE
TRACK RECORD

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:02.055
OF HELPING PEOPLE IN NEED.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.958
THERE ARE A THOUSAND
REASONS WHY PARENTS AND KIDS

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.061
LIKE THE FLEXIBILITY OF K12.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.562
FOR ZACHARY BONNER,
THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR

00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:13.065
TURNED OUT TO BE
A POINT OF LIGHT--

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:15.901
THAT WAS AN AWARD HE
RECEIVED FROM PRESIDENT BUSH--

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.571
AS WELL AS A COMMENDATION
FROM FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.140
FOR HIS COMMUNITY SERVICE.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.076
IF ZACH HAD BEEN ENROLLED
IN A TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:26.245
WITH A RIGID SCHEDULE,

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.349
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE TIME
FOR ALL HIS GOOD WORKS.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.850
SO IS THAT YOU AND THE PRESIDENT

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.420
STANDING RIGHT NEXT
TO "AIR FORCE ONE"?

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.923
ZACH: YES.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.691
LUCKY: WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:42.094
ZACH: HE SAID
HE WAS PROUD OF ME.

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:44.030
LUCKY: DID HE ENCOURAGE
YOU TO KEEP DOING IT?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.598
ZACH: YEAH.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.400
LAURIE: PRESIDENT CLINTON
HE MET IN MAY.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.269
HE WROTE HIM A LETTER AND
HE SAID, "I GOT A FOUNDATION.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.770
"YOU GOT A FOUNDATION.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.039
NEXT TIME YOU'RE
IN FLORIDA, LET'S GET TOGETHER."

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.508
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.913
LUCKY: LAURIE SAYS
AT FIRST, SHE HAD MISGIVINGS

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:03.783
ABOUT ENROLLING ZACH
IN A VIRTUAL ACADEMY.

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:07.119
THEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT
THE LESSONS ARE PRE-PREPARED.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.789
AND K12 EVEN PROVIDES
A STATE-CERTIFIED TEACHER

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.457
TO HELP OUT.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:14.460
LAURIE: SOMEONE ELSE
IS DOING ALL THE HARD STUFF.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.429
YOU JUST FOLLOW
ALONG THE LESSON PLAN.

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.632
KELLEY: THINKING OF KIND OF
IN THE FUTURE...

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.967
LUCKY: IT'S STILL WORK.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:23.669
BUT AT LEAST
THE SCHEDULE IS FLEXIBLE.

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.972
LAURIE: REALLY, I HAVE MORE
FREEDOM WITH HIM DOING K12

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:29.108
THAN I WOULD IF HE
WAS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL,

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.644
BECAUSE LET'S SAY
SOMETHING INTERESTING COMES UP

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.380
THAT I WANT TO GO DO
ON TUESDAY.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.814
WELL, WE JUST DON'T
DO SCHOOL TUESDAY

00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:37.349
AND WE'LL DO IT SATURDAY.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.653
LUCKY: THE K12 PROGRAM
COMES WITH A FULL YEAR'S WORTH

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.990
OF ONLINE LESSONS,
MATCHING BOOKS, AND MATERIALS.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.158
ZACH DOES NEED TO STUDY HARD.

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:48.227
REVIEWS ARE BUILT
INTO THE LESSONS,

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.196
AND LIKE ALL K12 STUDENTS,

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:53.566
HE NEEDS TO GET AT LEAST
80% BEFORE MOVING ON.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:58.270
SOMETIMES HE GETS A LITTLE
QUIZZING FROM HIS SISTER KELLEY.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.173
KELLEY: DON'T YOU HAVE TO
UNDERLINE THE SUBJECT?

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:04.176
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY
MADE HIM A LITTLE BIT BETTER

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:05.711
AS FAR AS HIS SCHOOLING GOES.

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.182
HE LIKES TO TRAVEL, AND HE DOES
ALL OF HIS PROJECTS THAT HE HAS,

00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:11.517
SO IT GIVES HIM A LITTLE
BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.319
FOR DOING ALL THAT.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.521
LUCKY: SO YOU FIND
YOURSELF LEARNING RIGHT ALONG?

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.022
LAURIE: I LEARN RIGHT ALONG.

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:18.491
SOMETIMES HE LEARNS MORE
THAN I DO,

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.992
AND HE LIKES TO PUT ME TO SHAME.

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:21.628
[LAUGHS]

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.101
LUCKY: ZACH WAS ALL OF
SIX YEARS OLD

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:31.037
WHEN HE GOT INTO CHARITY WORK,

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.538
RIGHT AFTER HURRICANE CHARLEY

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:35.875
SMACKED INTO FLORIDA'S
SOUTHWEST COAST.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.210
LAURIE: WHEN THE RADIO SAID
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY WATER,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.380
HE JUST NATURALLY SAID,
"WELL, WE GOT WATER.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.747
LET'S GIVE THEM OUR WATER."

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:46.886
I MADE UP LITTLE FLYERS
AND PUT THEM IN THE MAILBOXES.

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:49.889
LUCKY: THE FLYERS LISTED WHAT
RELIEF SUPPLIES WERE NEEDED.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.391
THEN HE AND KELLEY TOOK
HIS LITTLE WAGON

00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:55.027
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD
TO PICK UP DONATIONS.

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:57.896
WE MADE--MAYBE
A HUNDRED FEET DOWN THE ROAD

00:04:57.896 --> 00:05:00.867
AND THE WAGON WAS FULL, SO THEN
WE REALIZED WE NEEDED A TRUCK.

00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:08.741
ZACH: WE GOT 27
OF THE TRUCKFULS.

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:11.310
LUCKY: 27 TRUCKFULS?

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.745
WOW!

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.680
LAURIE: IT JUST KIND
OF BLOSSOMED FROM THERE.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.916
AND HE KEPT IT GOING
FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:19.218
WE WENT THROUGH FIVE HURRICANES.

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:21.087
LUCKY: AND THAT WAS
ONLY THE BEGINNING.

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:24.857
AMONG OTHER PROJECTS, HE'S PUT
TOGETHER HUNDREDS OF BACKPACKS

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:28.560
FOR HOMELESS KIDS, AN ISSUE
HE WORRIES ABOUT ALL THE TIME.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.929
DEFINITELY CONCERNED.

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.931
I MEAN, THERE'S 1.6 MILLION
HOMELESS STREET KIDS,

00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:35.601
KIDS THAT ALL NEED HELP...

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.938
LUCKY: HELPING OTHERS
CAN BE HARD WORK,

00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:43.108
AND THE FAMILY HAS PLANNED
A EUROPEAN VACATION.

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:46.279
ZACH WILL DO A COUPLE OF
HOURS OF K12 HOMEWORK EACH DAY

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.780
WHILE HE'S AWAY.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.949
AND THEN HE HOPES THE POPE
WILL AGREE TO HIS REQUEST

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.787
FOR AN AUDIENCE SO THEY CAN
DISCUSS THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS.

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:56.622
FOR "K12 SPOTLIGHT,"

00:05:56.622 --> 00:06:00.493
I'M LUCKY SEVERSON
IN VALRICO, FLORIDA.
