Alsalamu allekum

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:06.714
Today we make a hidden pocket

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.820
We need it sometimes

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:19.422
Useful when shopping

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:28.233
So we do not open the bag every time

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:43.573
We make a sign where we will put it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.900
We have to be able to put our hand easily

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.960
So it is the size of the hand, but not bigger

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:02.534
We sew it with hand or machine

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:03.034
In the beginning and end

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.533
then we open it

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.033
We keep the sides

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.860
Then make an opening

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 

00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:34.053
Then cut the pocket

00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:54.853
About 2/3 cm

00:01:58.114 --> 00:02:00.114
We cut it because it will go down wider

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:09.154
From here

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.760
Like this

00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:19.354
Here I make a small curve

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.473
From here I fix it with sewing

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.960
This will be it

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:39.136
 

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:39.860
We put it on the cloth

00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:45.974
It is made of two pieces

00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:53.998
The color is the same as the original cloth

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:00.817
 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.380
 

00:03:15.213 --> 00:03:17.213
We sew it

00:03:21.893 --> 00:03:23.893
We put in inside out

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.881
We sew it on the cloth

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.380
Like this

00:03:54.895 --> 00:03:56.895
Look, this is make from wool

00:03:58.536 --> 00:04:00.536
I open it on two sides

00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:03.673
I fold it and sew it

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:14.813
I make one side of wool and one of soft cloth

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.480
If two layers of wool it will be too thick

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.137
So make one layer (the front) from wool 

00:04:27.373 --> 00:04:29.373
Because it will be seen

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.600
Like this

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
From above fix it on the clothes

00:04:43.713 --> 00:04:45.713
And it will be a very comfortable pocket

00:04:45.713 --> 00:04:47.299
to put things 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500
and to make the hand warm
