00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.149
Laci: It's been a week of cuteness, Trace
absolute cuteness.

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.149
Are you ready for this?

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:07.010
Trace: I think I'm ready, but can we add just
a bit of awesome.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.130
Laci: Yeah, cuteness and awesome.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.769
Trace: Awesome.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.840
Laci: Hi folks, I'm Laci.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.440
Trace: And I'm Trace, and this is Buttercup.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.770
He lives at the Feathered Angels Waterfall
Sanctuary, and Buttercup was born with his

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.990
left foot turned backwards.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.960
And specialists tried to fix it, but it never
really worked right.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.410
Laci: Yea and so now, we have this amazing
thing called technology and 3D printers.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.890
And Buttercup has a foot.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.890
So at first he puts this on and he's like,
not really sure how he feels about it, but

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.580
then he's going at it.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.380
He's just so adorable.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.550
It's really really precious what 3D printing
can do for a duck's life.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.489
Trace: It looks pretty good too.

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:50.489
It's bright red.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.510
He's got like a sweet little racer foot there.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.570
And he can move with that thing.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.120
Laci: It's a little bit of a weird hobble
but super adorable.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.690
Trace: I wonder what this means for like prosthetics
for the future for us too.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.400
They've got casts that you could 3D print
now.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.090
And we've got all sorts of cool hands maybe.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.270
Laci: Yeah I feel like I hear some new 3D
printed thing, that's really awesome, everyday.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.539
So what about elephants?

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.349
Elephants are cute, right?

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:17.840
And this one is seeing the ocean for the very
first time.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.159
Trace: That's so great!

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.159
He looks so happy.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.319
How does he look that happy.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.430
This is an Asian Elephant.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.029
And you can tell by his little ears.

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:28.950
And he's playing in the water near Phuket,
Thailand.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.380
And you know, that's actually not far off
from what I did the first time I saw the ocean.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.840
Laci: Right, and you were probably like, what?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.840
20?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.599
So I'm watching this and I can't help thinking
about how other animals may be experiencing

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:43.599
emotion.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.389
I mean he really does look so happy.

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:46.669
Do animals feel hapiness?

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:47.950
Trace: I don't know.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.249
It sorta seem like they do.

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.509
But I don't know if that's us personofying
happiness upon them.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.289
Like, this dog looks happy.

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.789
It must feel happy.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.210
But we have done some things on Discoverynews.com
about like, not to bring us down a little

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.509
bit, but chimps and they actually grieve for
their dead fellows, if you will.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.459
So I'm sure that there's some rudimentary
animal emotion.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.360
Laci: I mean look at it.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.360
It's so happy.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360
It's like dunking in the water.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360
Trace: You know what, it's happy.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.400
I'm gonna say it's happy.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.360
Laci: The answer is yes, animals feel emotion.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.400
Trace: And finally just so we can compose
ourselves before we go back out into the world

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.840
from all that cuteness, an awesome shark.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.019
Laci: Yes, this video was just released showing
the thresher shark.

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.430
It's totally crazy.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.079
The shark swims up to a school of fish, snaps
its extra long tail, and creates a shockwave

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.870
which paralyzes the fish, so it can eat it.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.090
Trace: Aw that is so cool.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.430
It reminds me a little bit of the pistol shrimp,
which does that with a claw with like a loud

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.430
noise and whatever.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.430
Laci: It's also paralyzing.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.280
Trace: Yeah, but this is the first time we've
seen this kind of behavior in sharks right?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.719
Cause before, it was like

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:50.940
we've seen it in dolphins.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.010
We've seen it in like, killer whales, but
never in a shark.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.110
So maybe they're actually more intelligent
than we give them credit for.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.819
Laci: Maybe there is something going on up
there.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.769
I mean, it's pretty smart off the bat, cause
they're conserving a lot of energy while they're

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:04.769
hunting this way.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.890
Trace: Sharks are so cool man.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.890
Laci: Go sharks.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.579
We're gonna be talking a lot about sharks,
actually.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.269
August 4th is Shark Week!

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.269
So make sure you stay tuned.

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.480
We're gonna be doing so much shark stuff.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.920
So that's it for this round guys.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.659
We're always on the lookout for more awesome
videos.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.390
So if you find any, you should totally share
them with us on Facebook, or Google+, or the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.390
Tweet machine.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.390
Trace: For sure.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.290
And as always, keep tuning to Dnews twice
a day, everyday.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.290
See you later everybody.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.293
Laci: Bye bye!
