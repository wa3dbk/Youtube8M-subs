00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.155
The sun rises in Cacabelos and we start our route through vineyards.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:31.329
This is El Bierzo’s landscape. We are close to Cacabelos, close to Villafranca del Bierzo and close to Pieros.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.788
We are in the province of León.

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:47.689
This region has traditionally relied on minery and industry, but its microclimate is mild...

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:58.547
... allowing for a good production of fruits like grapes. It’s not affected by the harshness of the plateau or by the Galician’s moisture.

00:01:00.357 --> 00:01:09.733
A large wine industry has developed, which led in 1989 to create the Bierzo Wine Region.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.688
Stand out as the main grape variety for red wines the Mencia, and for white wines the Doña Blanca and Godello.

00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:25.644
Soils are moist and fertile and its altitude ranges between 500 and 1,000 meters above sea level.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:34.649
And within vineyards we arrive to Villafranca del Bierzo, declared Historical Artistic Site.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:42.510
The Church of Santiago welcomes us, a romanic temple from the twelfth century.

00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:51.916
The Puerta del Perdón (Door of Forgiveness) grants the jubilee to those pilgrims who cannot reach Santiago. It’s only open in the Jacobean year.

00:01:53.818 --> 00:02:02.544
Soon we see the Castle-Palace of the Peña-Ramiro earls, an example of military architecture from the sixteenth century.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:20.400
Villafranca del Bierzo

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:29.901
The church of Santa Maria del Cluniaco, from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, is a mixture of Gothic and Herrera styles.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:37.483
It had its origin in a Benedictine monastery of the twelfth century, with two inns for French pilgrims.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:45.206
The pilgrim continues its tour through Villafranca del Bierzo by the Calle del Agua.

00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:56.859
The coats of arms and ironwork balconies abound on the Calle del Agua. It’s a real museum.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:26.967
We reach river Burbia and cross the roman bridge to leave Villafranca del Bierzo.

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:55.124
We say goodbye to Villafranca and begin a hard climb up the calle Pradela. We soon reach a nice height.

00:03:57.407 --> 00:04:05.972
This path avoids the noise and cars from the road. But a signal indicates "experts only". It’s 3 very tough kilometers.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:15.004
We are in springtime. We are going up from Cerro Real towards Pradela.

00:04:33.116 --> 00:04:42.684
The ascent is worthwhile. General views of Villafranca and of the entire Bierzo’s valley until we get to Ponferrada.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:57.968
Hazel, conifers, oaks, ferns and all kinds of vegetation. It's sunny and the temperature is nice.

00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:08.138
Before starting the descent we get into an oak forest. It’s time to relax in the shade and take some pictures.

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:22.989
We are close to Pradela. We see some horses and donkeys enjoying the day and we begin the descent to Trabadelo.

00:05:25.297 --> 00:05:34.116
It is a very steep descent. In half an hour we are on the streets of Trabadelo and we see the church of San Nicolás.

00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:43.643
Trabadelo.

00:05:45.563 --> 00:05:56.374
We finish our walk in the river Valcarce. A good swim in the cold water will relax our legs. Tomorrow it’s O Cebreiro’s turn.
