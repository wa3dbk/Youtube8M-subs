00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300
Hi everyone this is Scott Eklund with My Tech Made Simple, and today I’m going to review the Kindle Touch. 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.933
Currently there are over 10 different variations of the Kindle so I’m going to make your choice easy by focusing on why the Kindle Touch 

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:18.733
may be the best variation for you.
The first thing you’ll notice is that there is only one button on the Kindle Touch. 

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:22.366
Everything is done by touching the screen which is actually very intuitive. 

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:28.599
If you’ve ever used a smartphone with a touchscreen, an iPad or a Kindle Fire you’ll be familiar with all the touch gestures of the 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.666
Kindle Touch.
The Touch is smaller than the previous generation Kindle keyboard. 

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:40.132
It’s roughly a half an inch smaller in length, which actually makes a noticeable difference when holding the Kindle. 

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:44.799
Let me set the Kindle Touch on top so you can get a better idea of the difference. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.400
As you can see here, its nearly an inch smaller in length, and a small amount smaller in width as 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.366
well.
The Kindle Touch has a great feel to it. It has what feels like a metal finish on the front 

00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:02.566
and the back and it feels light enough to where it doesn’t tire out your hand if you’re holding it for hours 

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.832
but it’s heavy enough to where it doesn’t feel cheap or easy to break.

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:10.199
The Kindle keyboard has roughly the same weight, but because it is a little longer, and is made of a more 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.700
plastic like material it doesn’t feel as good in the hand.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.100
There are two variations of the Kindle Touch one, with ads and one without. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.233
The Kindle Touch on my left has ads while the one on the right doesn’t. 

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:29.566
There are two places that ads show up. Here when the unit is turned off and once the unit is turned on. 

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:41.166
Let me turn on the Kindle Touch and I can show you. As you see on the bottom there is the second ad that comes up 

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:45.932
when the unit is turned on.  I recommend getting the Kindle with ads. 

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:49.899
A lot of the ads are for discounts and coupons for things you might actually want to buy. 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.066
And if you don’t like the ads you can always login at amazon.com and pay $40 dollars to turn the ads off. 

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.599
And I’ll have more information for that down below.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.933
Now let me show you how to navigate around your Kindle 

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:08.433
Touch.If you want to read a book you tap it and it will load the book. Once it’s loaded the touchscreen is split into three distinct 

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:13.099
areas, one for going forward a page in your book, one for going back a page, and one for the menu. 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:21.066
If you tap in this area here, the majority of the right side of the screen, you’ll be able to go forward a page. 

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:27.066
If you tap on the left side of the screen you’ll be able to go back a page. 

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:33.032
And finally if you tap on the top of the screen you’ll be able to open the menu. 

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:38.299
In this menu can change the size of the font, go to a bookmark you made, or any chapter in the book. 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.533
At the top you can go to the Amazon store to buy books or search, and if you want to exit the menu just tap anywhere on the 

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:50.466
screen.
 Now if you don’t like turning pages by tapping the screen you can use a 

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:56.566
turning motion like reading a physical book. Simply swipe from right to left which will forward one page, 

00:02:56.566 --> 00:03:02.132
like turning a page in a physical book, or you can swipe from left to right like turning a page 

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:08.399
backward.
Highlighting and writing notes has been made easier in the Kindle Touch as well. 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.333
Simply tap and hold over where you want to highlight, and then let go. 

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:16.933
And now you’ll get a message asking you if you want to highlight that or add a note. 

00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:21.066
If you click add a note an onscreen keyboard will show up for you to be able to write. 

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:25.432
And I actually find the onscreen keyboard easier to use then when I would type on the Kindle 

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:31.366
Keyboard.
As you can see the Kindle Touch is easier to use, smaller and feels better in the 

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:34.832
hand than the Kindle Keyboard, but what about the $79 Kindle? 

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.699
The $79 Kindles is pretty hard to use. 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.900
You have to use a button like this in the bottom right hand corner of the Kindle Keyboard. 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.333
So it makes it a little harder to get around and to do certain things. 

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:49.666
The Kindle Touch also has the ability to play audio books and music, 

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:54.899
but the $79 dollar Kindle does not. So for twenty dollars extra you get an easier to use 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.733
Kindle that can also play audiobooks and music. So overall I recommend the Kindle Touch with Special Offers, 

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:09.933
I find it to be the best Kindle that’s available at this moment. Thank you for listening to my review and have a nice day.
