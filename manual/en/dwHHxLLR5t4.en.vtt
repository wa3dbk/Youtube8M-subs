BETH HOYT: We're taking on
the baby food challenge.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.476
[BABY BABBLING]

00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:07.980
BETH HOYT: OK, you all know how
this works, but for those

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.260
of you who don't-- maybe Dan--

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.610
we've got three flavors
of baby food each.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.780
We're going to take turns being
blindfolded and trying

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.980
to guess what the flavor
of the baby food

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.210
is that we are tasting.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.140
DAN ST. GERMAIN: All right,
let's do this.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.640
BETH HOYT: I mean, I think it's
going to be delicious.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.320
DAN ST. GERMAIN: It's
going to be g--

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.800
I've eaten comb--

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.240
I've eaten those dog
begging strips--

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.580
BETH HOYT: Oh no.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.310
DAN ST. GERMAIN: --before, so.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.530
BETH HOYT: I was wondering
where that-- this

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.140
was going to go.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.095
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Yeah, I was
gonna go Combos, then I'm

00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:27.290
like, that's definitely
not as disgusting.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.475
BETH HOYT: It's delicious.

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:30.460
All right, well, you're
up first.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.980
We have some--

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.739
I don't even know what's
under these at all.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:32.811
DAN ST. GERMAIN: All right.

00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:33.470
BETH HOYT: Let's put that on--

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.290
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Here we go.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.620
BETH HOYT: All right.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.290
Oh no, it's not that one.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.080
I didn't look, don't worry.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.245
DAN ST. GERMAIN: OK.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:37.780
BETH HOYT: I didn't look.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.150
I didn't look.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.360
I opened up the wrong one.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.570
Duh, it's mine.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.480
OK, here we go.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.520
Let's do this one first.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.080
No, let's do this one first.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.545
Yeah, got it?

00:00:50.545 --> 00:00:50.980
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Ahhhhhh.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.415
BETH HOYT: Sorry.

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:51.850
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Ahhhhhh.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.400
BETH HOYT: Oh no, I'm sorry, I
didn't even get it in--near

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.870
your mouth.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.110
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Yeah, I feel
like this is how every Cinemax

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.260
soft core porn starts.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.366
BETH HOYT: OK, there we go.

00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.030
It's in.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.330
Close up.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.990
So you want it in--

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.210
I got a little bit in
your beard there.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.220
DAN ST. GERMAIN: A
little bit more.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.940
BETH HOYT: OK.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.140
DAN ST. GERMAIN: OK.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.210
BETH HOYT: Uh, so you're doing
No Shave November, huh?

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.820
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Let's do it.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.270
BETH HOYT: What are
you thinking?

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.100
DAN ST. GERMAIN: A little
bit more, if that's OK.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.930
BETH HOYT: What are
you tasting?

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.210
DAN ST. GERMAIN: A
little bit more.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.450
BETH HOYT: All right,
here we go.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.700
DAN ST. GERMAIN: A
little bit more.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.990
I just--

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.200
BETH HOYT: Really get in--

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.530
this thing.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.310
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Mmmmm.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.280
BETH HOYT: I got more
hair on it.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.540
This is really just too good.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.320
DAN ST. GERMAIN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.800
BETH HOYT: All right.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.890
We'll just-- this is
how I-- this is

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.990
like feeding my nephews.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.120
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Oh, god.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.190
BETH HOYT: Except they
don't have the beard.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.514
That would be weird.

00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:28.510
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Um,
by the-- think--

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.910
this is disgusting.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.190
BETH HOYT: So can you-- can
you guess what it is?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.140
DAN ST. GERMAIN: This is like,
uh, my grandfather at the end.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.465
Uh--

00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:35.140
BETH HOYT: Oooooh,
close, close.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.980
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Um,
is it applesauce?

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.540
BETH HOYT: Close.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.840
It is--

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.980
DAN ST. GERMAIN:
It's apple pie?

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.420
Apples?

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.650
BETH HOYT: It's apples
and apricots.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.436
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Yeah.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:42.830
BETH HOYT: Apples
and apricots.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.000
DAN ST. GERMAIN:Ahhh--all
right.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.665
I was close.

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:44.395
BETH HOYT: All right.

00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:46.200
Up next is--

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.360
here we go.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.320
DAN ST. GERMAIN: I get more?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.480
BETH HOYT: You have three.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.470
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Oh wow, I
shouldn't be eating that much

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.050
apples and apricots.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.210
BETH HOYT: Hang in there.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.480
No, it's all right.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.250
It's going to get
more delicious.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.070
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Damn
you comedy bit.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.800
BETH HOYT: Well, it's fine.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.940
This is all very nutritious.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.070
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Ahhhhh.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.230
BETH HOYT: Oh my god, this
one is a big chunk.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.610
We're going to give you
the chunk first.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.753
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Ahhhh.

00:01:58.753 --> 00:02:01.764
BETH HOYT: So this one you
can chew on a little bit.

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:02.680
All right-- so that--

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.040
I'm sorry if that chunk
is because--

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.530
old--

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.480
DAN ST. GERMAIN: KFC
Double Down.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.700
BETH HOYT: KFC Double Down.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.350
DAN ST. GERMAIN: No, that's
like potato, right?

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.610
BETH HOYT: Incorrect.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.054
Mmm, it is--

00:02:11.054 --> 00:02:11.380
DAN ST. GERMAIN: No.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.820
BETH HOYT: --corn and
butternut squash.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.400
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Corn,
corn, that's it.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.576
Corn.

00:02:15.576 --> 00:02:16.860
I almost said the C word.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.001
BETH HOYT: Are you OK?

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:19.960
This is taking a toll.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.780
DAN ST. GERMAIN:
This is a lot.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.000
BETH HOYT: I'm getting
nervous now.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.830
DAN ST. GERMAIN: This is not--
this is not helping my

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.570
diabetes medication.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.980
BETH HOYT: This one
is really good.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.600
All right.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.266
This is going to be delicious.

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.190
Um, I hope you've saved
up some sp--

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.692
space in your belly.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:32.257
I don't want to be mean and give
you a huge bite because

00:02:32.257 --> 00:02:33.280
then you might do
it to me, too.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.570
All right.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.470
This is a big bite.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.750
I'm sorry.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.142
Do you guys see what this is?

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:44.640
Yeah.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.616
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Squash?

00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:47.430
BETH HOYT: Ooh, um,
that's part of it.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.310
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Squash,
butternut squash?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.900
No, that's not butter--

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.620
BETH HOYT: It's-- keep going.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.180
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Squash?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.200
BETH HOYT: This is for six
months and up so is for you.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.770
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Squash and
a gourd-- like a gourd.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.990
BETH HOYT: Close.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.190
Yeah, you're close.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.410
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Squash.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.260
BETH HOYT: You want to
try a little more?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.100
DAN ST. GERMAIN:
Pumpkin squash?

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.370
BETH HOYT: We need a
little bit more.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.590
DAN ST. GERMAIN: No, I'm OK.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.166
I think I'm good.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.010
Pumpkin squash?

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.620
BETH HOYT: Oh, it's close.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.950
I'll tell you what it is.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.690
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Ugh.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.385
BETH HOYT: Actually,
you can take off--

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:08.980
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Can I take
this-- this is so disgusting.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.120
BETH HOYT: You can take
the blindfold off.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.580
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Right now--
how does my face--

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.190
where's my face?

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.130
BETH HOYT: Like this being
the first part of the--

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.490
DAN ST. GERMAIN: How's
my face look?

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.200
BETH HOYT: --first part
of the segment.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.215
This is what it is.

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:16.880
DAN ST. GERMAIN: What's that?

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.080
Vegetable turkey dinner?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.290
BETH HOYT: So you were
really close.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.770
DAN ST. GERMAIN: That
was really gross.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.330
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.450
Here I got some of this beard.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.980
DAN ST. GERMAIN: I'm so glad--

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.295
How much did I eat
of that one?

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:24.520
BETH HOYT: How do you handle
having this beard?

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.010
How often does this happen
that you, like,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.745
oh there was lunch.

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:27.280
DAN ST. GERMAIN: All the time.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.050
I just take it out and a
dove flies through it.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.440
BETH HOYT: That would
be amazing.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.530
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Yeah.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.790
BETH HOYT: Has that happened?

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.290
That's incredible.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.062
DAN ST. GERMAIN: It's happened
before, that's

00:03:33.062 --> 00:03:34.060
how I impress women.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.740
BETH HOYT: Wow.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.040
So, um, sorry.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.340
All right.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.060
I'm ready to go now.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.470
DAN ST. GERMAIN:
OK, you ready?

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.960
BETH HOYT: Don't--

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.880
don't give me huge bites.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.008
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Do I--

00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:39.750
I have to take a new one.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.170
I was--

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.200

when you're an adult.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.220
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Uh-huh.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.390

they have memories of this

doing this blindfolded.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.770
DAN ST. GERMAIN: --and it's
an American baby.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.320
I've gotta say if it's a Chinese

laws, you know,--

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.660
DAN ST. GERMAIN: but that's why
we should get fair trade.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.330
I'm not saying that that's a
cool thing to have Chinese--

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.015
I'm not saying that--

00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:29.290
as I point to the one Asian
guy in the room right now.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.620

a weird experience being

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.510

DAN ST. GERMAIN: All
right, last one.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.500
Do we have a third spoon, or
should I just wipe it off?

BETH HOYT: I feel like I'm
floating right now.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.900
Is there drugs in these?

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.910

DAN ST. GERMAIN: But why would
the girl be eating baby food

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.420
in the first place?

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.190

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.650
or do you give up?

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.056
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:07:27.056 --> 00:07:27.870
I give up.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.840
DAN ST. GERMAIN: Brown rice,
everybody, the healthiest of

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.612
the baby foods.

00:07:30.612 --> 00:07:31.270
BETH HOYT: Ugh.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.270
That is healthy because you
never want to eat again.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.020
DAN ST. GERMAIN: This segment
