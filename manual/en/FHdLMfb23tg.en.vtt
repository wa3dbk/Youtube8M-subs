00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.580
Speaker 1: Viewing this presentation is your
first step toward unprecedented vehicle safety,

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.289
strength and stability as well as enormous
savings and maintenance and repair.

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.029
Speaker 2: Since I install the roadmaster
is been a phenomenal piece of equipment.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.000
The swaying the vehicle virtually eliminated
when under load it doesn't squat anymore.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.010
Speaker 3: With roadmaster, it takes the bounce
away, I'm in control and it makes me feels

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.010
safely.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.180
Speaker 4: With the roadmaster system, it
gives my van the stability it needs to haul

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.180
these heavy loads.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.940
Speaker 1: Join the hundreds of thousands
of satisfied owners worldwide that have discovered

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.290
why roadmaster is rapidly becoming the driving
force behind better vehicle control with maximum

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.230
load capacity.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.489
This revolutionary product works by holding
your rear leaf springs and their original

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.630
bow precision so the system will absorb the
load rather than resist it, giving you a smooth

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.579
unhardened ride with or without a load, its
simple physics and sound automotive technology.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.450
Here is roadmaster in action, both trucks
are loaded with 2200 lbs. and their travelling

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.259
at 35 mph.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.649
On the left, the truck is clearly out of control
and on the right the truck with the roadmaster

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.380
active suspension smoothly maneuvers safely
through the cones.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.549
This means less wear and tear on the tires
and the entire suspension system and that

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.049
saves you money.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.560
Drivers of all kinds are discovering the value
and importance of the roadmaster active suspension

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.759
including the pros like NASCAR truck series
driver Dennis Setzer.

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:38.779
Speaker 5: Hi!

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:42.319
The roadmaster active suspension system is
definitely a positive on this truck.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.479
It is much more stable through the slopes.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.209
I think the safety is a great improvement.

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.219
Speaker 1: Lloyd Stevenson of Cornelius had
a few things to say, he's on his second truck

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.409
and second kit for towing his fifth wheel
large camping trailer.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.679
Speaker 6: This is the second truck that I
put the roadmaster on I previously had a Ford

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.049
s250 and I liked the way it handle with that
vehicle, so when I got my new Chevy I started

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.180
to want one on it as well.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.819
Roadmaster makes all the differences in the
world when it comes on towing my fifth wheel,

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.790
I think the greatest thing it gives me is
the safety factor.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.569
The roadmaster greatly improves when my vehicle
handles at high speeds on the highway.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.860
I've come to depend on the road master on
my vehicle it puts the fun back in towing

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.040
my RV.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.980
The best part about the roadmaster is the
way my truck handles when its empty it does

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.890
not harden the ride at all when I go on the
large bumps, railroad tracks there is no bounce

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.430
on spring in the back it's an easy installation
and it's well worth it.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.590
Speaker 1: The television program by classic
cars was so impress with the roadmaster active

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.130
suspension kit that they featured it on their
show.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.040
Speaker 7: Now, Dennis this is a great little
display to show off the suspension system.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.180
Speaker 8: Oh I love this; this is a wonderful
set up.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.180
Speaker 7: Absolutely.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.351
Now you guys and gals out there you buying
a pickup truck you need a truck that work

00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:58.351
with during the week.

00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:02.670
On the weekend you play, you go to swap meets,
you go to car shows you haul your car trailer

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.320
well it's a half ton truck short wheel base,
flare side, short bed you look good in it.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.370
It's suspended to drive nice and cushy like
a car, it's a half ton truck but what happens

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.430
if you drive a 1000 lbs. in the back?

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.180
Speaker 8: Well it will take it, I mean it
is rated for a 1000 lbs., it will carry that

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.390
but put that in there and before you know
it the back seat is down, doesn't handle the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.790
corners very well, wallows through, sways
a lot, but we've got a fix that.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.550
It's the roadmaster active suspension system.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.540
Speaker 7: And here it is right here and it's
available for leaf spring vehicles that have

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.880
a rear leaf spring.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.150
Look at this display, this should be your
axel tube.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.260
These are the spring shackles that contain
the leaf spring and of course this is your

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.560
leaf spring roadmaster clips over here.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.390
It has its spring and this tab was bolts underneath
display.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.390
Speaker 8: Yeah.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.780
This is also my kind of system here, requires
no drilling, no welding; it just clips on

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.630
and when once it's on it actually retained
there by its own tension.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.630
Speaker 7: Right.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.630
You don't have to modify anything.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.870
As you can see right here, we got two pivot
points that is constantly self-aligning with

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.390
the spring, works in conjunction with and
reduces shock to your springs.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.480
In fact when the truck is empty this will
reduce wheel hop, it will reduce axel rep,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.270
and actually make the vehicle ride better
when it's empty.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.270
Speaker 8: That's right.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.670
And you can always you know beef up your load
handling capabilities with heavier springs

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.360
and before you take the load out and that
truck going to beat you up it will shape your

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360
feelings loose.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.519
This system isn't really made to increase
your load handling capability but boy it'll

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.370
handle a load it's rated to much better with
it on.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.370
Speaker 7: Absolutely.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.840
You put this in the sport utility and I'll
tell you what you will get rid of all of the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.449
body sway and roll when going down the exit
ramp for a real windy day, that's a big difference.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.270
Now this is half ton and three quarter ton
in sport utility right here and these are

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.370
the big boys, the one tons.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.949
Speaker 8: yeah I love those things.

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.080
Speaker 1: The story behind the amazing roadmaster
active suspension system is simple.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.370
Speaker 9: Really, it's a story about the
stability and vehicle dynamics.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.370
Speaker 10: Absolutely.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.889
Increase the stability, increase the safety.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.060
Speaker 9: Alright.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.419
Now let's talk about that in terms of how
the suspension is actually works.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.800
I'm going around the corner and turning the
car right, and the car wants to lean left

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.800
that means I'm actually picking up a wheel.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800
Speaker 10: That's correct.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.800
Speaker 9: Now.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.920
This loose-leaf sprung wheels, you know, we
can actually lose control that way now that

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.789
actually how does this help me in that situation.

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:08.800
Speaker 10: Okay Tom.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.770
The force of the turn flattens your leaf spring,
our unit grabs that pulls it back so that

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.879
you actually got a load absorbing action of
the spring holding your leaf spring in an

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.169
arch which keeps you on a level ride and your
cornered more smoothly.

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.919
This way you don't get that dipping sway.

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.819
Speaker 9: Well I'm conscious of the fact
that when you do shock a lot of the leaf springs

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.460
on that, I think its going change the ride
and make the ride rougher.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.129
Speaker 10: Our unit is actually going to
improve the ride.

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.830
It's going to absorb load, it's going to absorb
bounce.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.189
It's a perfect synergy between the two systems.

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.409
We introduce the coil spring to the leaf spring
suspension.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.779
We keep the dynamics of the leaf spring by
having the load absorbing coil spring action

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:50.669
you'll actually smooth the whole system out.

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:57.389
Speaker 1: Roadmaster active suspension means
better vehicle control for vans, trucks and

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.939
SUV's.

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:03.319
The roadmaster active suspension kit is the
most important addition you'll ever make to

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:09.240
your vehicle but it doesn't take a pro to
install it.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.499
Once it's out of the box, you're just minutes
away from better hauling, improved handling

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:17.669
and a smoother, safer ride.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.199
The road master active suspension kit is simply
the best money can buy.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:29.050
The roadmaster active suspension kit improves
your vehicle performance beyond all expectations.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.469
It's everything you need in safety, strength,
stability, control and savings.

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:40.189
Roadmaster active suspension; it's not just
an accessory, it's a necessity.

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:41.839
Speaker 5: Roadmaster.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:42.839
It really does what its say it will do.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:50.249
Speaker 1: The 
vehicle used in this video do not in any way

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:53.020
reflect in any particular make or model of
vehicle.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.800
They were used to illustrate the typical handling
ability of a vehicle equipped with a rear

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.539
leaf suspension.
