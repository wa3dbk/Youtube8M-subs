00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.870
Bayer Built is a two-step distributor and
what that is, we sell to the end user through

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.870
a retailer such as a lumber dealer, such as
a second party. That is we do not sell direct

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.660
to contractors. The product lines we carry
are Exterior door products, Interior door

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.510
products, stair parts, millwork of all kinds
that goes around the windows, around the baseboard

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.510
of the house. We have hundreds of door styles
in our inventory and in our stock which gives

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.129
us thousands of options when you think of
all the different mouldings and jambs and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.110
trim that you can put around those door styles.
There are a lot of different panel configurations

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.110
in these doors and if there isn't one in our
inventory that suits your flavor, we can order

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.979
any type of door that you would like. If you
can draw it, we can have it made. The system

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.100
that we build, the Acclimated Entry System,
is comprised of that door blank plus components

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.100
that go around it that allow it to open and
close and seal properly. We developed our

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.790
own trade name for this door system because
we felt that the system itself and the components

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.610
around the door were as important, if not
more important, than the slab itself. Most

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.610
of the major slab producers out there put
all their emphasis on the door slab and lesser

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.440
emphasis on the components around it. Since
we live in a harsher climate than most of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.070
the rest of the country, we felt that the
components around it were very important in

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.000
providing a sound and weather-tight seal to
the environment.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.170
We are providing a solution

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.420
rather than the piece of the product that they're
putting in to the building. There is value

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.720
to it, they know we're going to be there and
if someone is interested only in the lowest

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.950
price, then he's come to the wrong place.
By Pre-Finishing, our state-of-the-art facility

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.040
we can do a much better job of preparing the
door. By Pre-Finishing, we mean staining and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.400
sealing the products, the trim products that
go in to your home before they get delivered

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.230
to your job site. This eliminates of course
you having to either do it on site, have someone

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.209
else come and do it on site, or ship that
product off to someone else thereby having

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.790
more handling involved and the risk of damage
to your product before it gets installed.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.790
Our products are sold through 850 dealers in a
primarily 8-state region centered around Minnesota.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.580
Minnesota is fully covered by our service
area, we have a good share of Wisconsin, most

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.440
of Iowa, all of Nebraska, all of South Dakota,
a little bit of Wyoming, a little bit of Montana,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.800
and the border states of North Dakota. Bayer
Built employees, as your know, here in Belgrade

250 employees. We vantage as a family company

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.959
to gain quite a lot of trust and confidence
in the lumber dealers and the customers that

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.300
