00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.059
The success of Jetpack Joyride has given Halfbrick
Studios a kind of blueprint for future releases

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.219
to follow.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.150
Fish Out Of Water! is the latest from the
Aussie studio, however you'll be trading in

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.660
your skilled trigger finger for something
a little more relaxed.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.690
The aim of the game is to score as high as
possible from a panel of crabs.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.050
Each one will assign you an individual score
(ala gymnastics) and your final is the average

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.640
of them all - just watch out for the final
crab as he'll mark you down for no reason

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.640
at all.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.220
Actually, all the judges have their own quirks,
and in knowing them all you can hopefully

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.129
satisfy what they're looking for in each of
your attempts.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.129
"Attempt what?"

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.129
I hear you screaming.

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.479
If you're familiar with the many long-distance
slingshot style games on the App Store, then

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.830
you'll already know what you're in for here.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.510
At its most basic level all you have to do
is take one of the fish (or mammals) at the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.839
start of the stage, fling them with a swipe,
and watch them fly, skip, and bounce.

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.230
However, if that's all the game offered you'd
probably not even give it a second glance

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.940
before ignoring it.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.150
Thankfully each fish (or mammal) you choose
from sports a unique trait, be it speedy,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.250
streamlined skipping, to gracefully jumping
through the waves, to slowly, but surely bouncing

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.340
around rough oceans.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.440
I say thankful because each hour the weather
within the game will change (sometimes drastically),

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.100
forcing you to think carefully about how to
get the best score.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.250
You'll be motivated to do your best thanks
to: the carefully scaling mission system and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.890
its clever way of teaching players new skills;
also, by joining a 'league' you can participate

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.220
in a global team effort to see who can get
the best overall score.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.650
Though by far, the best feature of the game
is the way it feels.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.810
Each animal has a distinct weight and buoyancy
that feels gorgeous when swiping and interacts

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.770
with the beautifully rendered world.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.880
It's hard not to spend a moment or two enjoying
the detail that has gone in to such wonderful

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.260
visuals.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.060
As such it's a shame to say the game (excuse
the pun) flounders in terms of depth and variety.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.590
Despite all the animals to choose from, and
all the environments the game throws at you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.850
(not to mention the temporary power ups you
can craft with gems), it all feels far too

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.260
same-y no matter what you do.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.030
The missions provide some direction, but it
regularly deviates from the core gameplay

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.319
in a way that's less exciting than watching
fish bounce.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.540
Early adopters will no doubt get their fill
and it's definitely worth playing once it

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:27.119
goes free, just be wary of Fish Out Of Water!'s
initial lack of variety.
