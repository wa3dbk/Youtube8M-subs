00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.850
I'm Annie Copps and welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.250
Today we're going to make an old New England
favorite and a traditional St. Patrick's Day

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.010
favorite, corned beef and cabbage.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.110
But we're not going to make your grandmother's
corned beef and cabbage.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.570
We're going to make something that's going
to make you sing it's so good.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.290
We're going to start with a 5 to 6 pound cut
of flat brisket, not tip.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.820
We want a nice, even cooking surface.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.750
What we do is we make a brining solution,
which is salt and some aromatics.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.410
That goes into the meat, pulls out all the
moisture, and then puts all those flavorings

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.410
in there.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.160
We're going to let it sit for about seven
days in the fridge.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.860
You take it out of that brine and then simmer
it in another aromatic broth.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.690
That's the boiled beef part of it.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.580
Then, traditionally, you'd boil your vegetables.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.741
No, no, no, we're going to roast them.

00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:55.780
Let's get started with that brine.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.760
You're going to start with a nice, big pot
with about a gallon of water.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.690
What's important is that the beef is submerged
under the water.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.640
To that we're going to add a cup and a half
of salt.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.490
Now that might seem like a lot, but you've
got to get it in there.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.619
That's what's going to keep it preserved.

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.030
Stir until that salt dissolves.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.590
That's very important.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.499
To that salted water add a half-cup of brown
sugar.

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.310
You could use honey or regular sugar.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.859
I prefer brown sugar.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.630
I'm going to take some whole cloves of garlic
and just smash them up a bit so they really

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.799
release their flavor in there.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.780
You don't have to chop it, but just give them
a nice smash.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.170
I'm just using the edge of my knife here.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.340
That seems like a lot of garlic, but we want
this to taste good and really flavorful.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.340
There we go.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.450
That one was fighting with me a little bit.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.090
And smash, and in they go.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.880
We're going to add a small handful, probably
20, whole black peppercorns, about a teaspoon

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.639
of crushed red pepper flakes - again, we want
this to be as flavorful as possible - and

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.100
whole coriander seeds.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.770
That's what cilantro comes from, but these
are the seeds.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.319
We want to crush these up, again to release
their flavor, just with a mortar and pestle,

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.540
and dump that right in there.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.470
This adds this really beautiful floral note
to our brine.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.890
Some bay leaves, and again, I'm going to crush
them up to release their flavor.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.720
Then about 8 to 10 sprigs of thyme.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.860
Just pop them in whole.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.210
No need to break them up.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.080
Now here's that brisket I was talking about.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.490
Put it right in there and submerge it.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.680
Sometimes it wants to float to the top again.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.040
Pop a plate on top, pop the lid on top, and
into your refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.150
Forget about it.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.540
Now what your grandmother would have done
was while that's simmering away, she would

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.720
have started chopping up vegetables, and once
the corned beef was done simmering, she'd

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.720
take it out and let it rest, and then start
boiling all those vegetables in that beautiful,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.150
flavored, simmering water.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.150
We're going to do it a little differently.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.890
We're going to roast them, and it's going
to be heavenly.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.590
I like to use traditional vegetables like
cabbage, and what I like to do is chop them

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.010
up into wedges.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.470
As you can see, I've left that root piece
on.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.930
Well, a few pieces fall apart, but it's going
to stay together.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.610
I'm just going to halve it and then quarter
it, like so, so you have pieces like this.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:44.200
I'm going to dump them all into a bowl, like
so, and add some olive oil, just enough to

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:54.091
coat it, pepper, because we want this to taste
good, and salt.

00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:55.740
Then use those tools that God gave you.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.960
Stick your hands right in there and get enough
oil on there to coat the cabbage.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.210
Then arrange the cabbage in a nice layer on
an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.050
The aluminum foil is on there just to make
clean up a little bit easier for you.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.770
I like to make it easy for everybody.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.829
If there are some loose pieces there, that's
okay too.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.600
We're going to be doing some other vegetables,
and it appears that there's going to be some

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.320
extra room on this sheet.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.350
See this little pile?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.600
These are just loose leaves that I'm going
to put on there.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.050
They'll roast up beautifully.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.410
I still have a little bit of olive oil, salt,
and pepper in there.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.110
I'm going to use that.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.370
How about some carrots and some parsnips?

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.520
The parsnips you just need to peel and cut.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.500
Use any vegetables that are hearty and will
do well under roasting conditions.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.050
Toss them in that olive oil, salt, and pepper.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.460
A little bit more salt and a little bit more
pepper, and they are good to go, right on

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.460
here.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.510
I'm going to pop them into a 400 to 450 degree
oven.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.880
They take about half an hour or so.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.350
It depends on your oven.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.940
You want them to get nice and brown, and really,
really caramelized and flavorful.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.790
So you might have to flip them over at some
point.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:11.910
Just keep an eye on them.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.090
The first tray goes right in the oven.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.280
The roasted vegetables have come out of the
oven and look how gorgeous they are.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.320
Those potatoes are nice and brown and crispy
in texture.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.400
The turnips are just going to get nice and
sweet and still have a little bit of heat

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.410
in them, because they are turnips, and the
onions and the parsnips and the carrots.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.870
Look at that cabbage.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.490
Boiled cabbage or beautifully roasted cabbage?

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.560
You have a choice.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.810
I'm going to help you make it.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.940
Now, the corned beef.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:46.030
We pulled it out of that really aromatic broth
that it simmered in for three and a half hours.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.639
We covered it with foil so that it would stay
nice and warm, but we let it sit for a half

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.430
an hour, just sitting here like this.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.190
That way all the juices that are in there
can redistribute and it will be nice and easy

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.190
to slice.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.310
The thing about slicing brisket; you see this
grain?

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.680
You want to slice this way, against the grain.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.430
If you slice it this way, it's just going
to fall apart.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.950
We want to have a nice, beautiful plate to
serve.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.870
So I'm going to start on this side and just
cut some really nice pieces.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.350
Oh, look at that.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.030
Isn't that gorgeous?

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.660
I'm going to have two slices.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.660
Beautiful.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.310
And that is not dry.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.500
It's just absolutely gorgeous.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.940
I also saved about a cup of the broth that
it was cooking in because I'm going to drizzle

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.940
that on top.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.650
Here we go.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.830
Oh, beautiful.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.060
I'm going to take some Brussels sprouts and
some parsnips and make a nice, beautiful,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.060
colorful plate.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.740
Get a little bit of every single one of these
vegetables, because we took some time to prepare

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.740
them.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.470
Oh, turnips, one of my favorites and, of course,
the cabbage.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.650
Also traditional to this is some whole-grain
mustard.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.460
I'm just going to give that a plop right there.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.310
Let me get that beautiful broth.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:12.820
I'm just going to drizzle a little bit of
that on top because it has all that flavoring.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.150
Right on top, like that.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.560
Wow.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.090
New England boiled dinner, St. Patrick's Day
corned beef and cabbage, whatever you call

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.780
it, I think you're going to like it.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:33.300
Oh, it's really great.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.320
