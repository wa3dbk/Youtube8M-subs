00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.841
- Hello friends!

00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:04.292
So welcome to a very special
episode of Cherry's Kitchen.

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:05.973
As you can see,

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:07.517
I'm not in my kitchen today!

00:00:07.517 --> 00:00:10.512
No, in fact I'm actually at Pizza Express!

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:13.101
They are letting me
loose in their kitchens.

00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:15.438
Let's get pizza making.

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:22.356
(atmospheric guitar music)

00:00:24.113 --> 00:00:27.417
So I am in the Pizza Express Kitchen.

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:30.035
It's much fancier than mine;
it's got granite surfaces.

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:34.411
So I have not made the dough bit because

00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:37.047
they don't trust me with
that, and quite frankly,

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:39.543
neither do I, so the
pizza I am making today

00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:42.202
is a vegetarian pizza
because quite frankly,

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:44.512
I don't really like
meat on my pizza at all.

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:48.053
I am gonna start with some peppers.

00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:51.700
This is gonna be a very
fancy colorful rainbow pizza.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.648
Yeah, just gonna throw those on because

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:57.515
we all know in Cherry's
Kitchen, it's very very very

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.862
very professional.

00:00:58.862 --> 00:01:01.277
Next, I'm gonna put on
some tomatoes because

00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:03.483
you can never have enough tomatoes, OK?

00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:04.365
No.

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:06.780
So sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.240
These feel absolutely fantastic.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.958
Next I'm gonna throw on some onions

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.546
to give it that onion bit.

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:16.660
You know what I'm saying.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.997
Again, it's very professional.

00:01:20.373 --> 00:01:21.673
I should come and work here.

00:01:21.673 --> 00:01:23.844
Then, to add even more
color, I'm gonna go in

00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:26.421
with some sweet corn, which
personally is my favorite,

00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.475
but it's not (mumbling) fancy,
but hey this is my pizza

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:31.553
and it's gonna be great.

00:01:31.553 --> 00:01:32.888
It's gonna be great.

00:01:32.888 --> 00:01:35.895
I'm gonna throw on some mushrooms because

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.524
why not?

00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:39.806
These mushrooms are massive;

00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:41.814
they're like the size of my face.

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:43.520
Now the last thing I'm
gonna put on my pizza

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.935
is of course the best
bit which is the cheese.

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:49.070
I am obsessed with cheese.
Everyone loves cheese.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.277
And I'm actually lactose intolerant.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.913
Then maybe pass on putting this on.

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.701
So yeah, let's put that...

00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:56.628
I'm just gonna go wild.

00:01:56.628 --> 00:02:00.506
I think that that is my pizza done.

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:02.375
So now I'm gonna get my friend to help me

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:04.209
put it in the oven.

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.800
Are you gonna put it in the oven for me?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.971
I don't trust myself. I don't
trust myself with ovens.

00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:10.085
You guys know how bad I am.

00:02:13.727 --> 00:02:15.387
Hell yeah. (mumbling).

00:02:15.387 --> 00:02:17.929
The pizza takes approximately
four minutes to cook,

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.355
so not too long to wait
and I'm very very excited

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:23.848
because oh my god, pizza!

00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:28.848
(tranquil music)

00:02:31.104 --> 00:02:32.741
My pizza's come out the oven and it looks

00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:34.958
absolutely fantastic.

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.373
It's so colorful and
the cheese just makes me

00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:39.788
wanna put my face in it but of
course I'm not gonna do that.

00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:43.573
But I am, however, gonna cut
it up and try a little bit

00:02:43.573 --> 00:02:45.915
and hopefully not burn my
mouth because that oven

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:46.925
was very hot.

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:49.047
Totally very professional at doing this.

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:50.715
(playful piano music)

00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:52.016
K.

00:02:52.016 --> 00:02:57.016
(playful piano music)

00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:02.058
Didn't get cheese in my hair.

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:03.945
We'll ignore that.

00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:10.038
That was probably like the
best pizza I've ever eaten.

00:03:11.118 --> 00:03:12.446
That is good.

00:03:12.446 --> 00:03:14.327
If you wanna go ahead
and make your own pizza,

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:17.915
then head over to PizzaExpress.com/create.

00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:22.278
Because I have enjoyed
making my pizza so so much,

00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:25.589
you can win a prize of up to
10,000 pounds, the first prize.

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:29.130
And don't worry if you don't
win because in my opinion,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.011
the better prize is
that you get free food,

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:34.552
you get free dough balls and what's better

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:36.305
than dough balls? So head over to there.

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:37.977
The link will be down below.

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:40.384
And get pizza making!
