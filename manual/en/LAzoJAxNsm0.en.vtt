00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:06.624
Stanford University.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.490
&gt;&gt; Life at the zoo is about what it means
to be living at the San Francisco Zoo.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.440
What it means to not only be an animal
in the zoo, but also to be somebody that

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.120
takes care of those animals, and somebody
that benefits from viewing those animals.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.220
&gt;&gt; This is a class I've dreamed of
teaching for probably ten years.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.460
They've been learning about
the day-to-day life of,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.870
of the keeper,
the day-to-day life of the animals,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.630
the day-to-day life of what the zoo is
trying to do in terms of its mission.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.940
It's not really about
correcting a problem.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.890
Zoo animals have pretty good welfare.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.140
It's more how can we get it more
engaged maybe with the guests.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.270
Or easier for the keepers to handle.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.950
&gt;&gt; I was on team giraffe.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.560
Our project basically, ended up being
a back scratching kind of apparatus for

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.910
Floyd, who's the giraffe
in the closure behind me.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.840
We started off by just
researching our animals.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.310
We did get kind of better idea for

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.050
what behaviors we want to be
seeing in their enclosures.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.580
After that, we stated prototyping.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.160
We were thinking of different designs.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.100
Things that we could do to really
enrich these animals' lives.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.730
We came back and presented our initial
designs to the curators here at the zoo,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.120
and we got some feedback.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.630
And then we spent some more time
to kind of fix up our designs,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.880
make it more sturdy and just improve
it to the curator's expectations.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.840
The days since,
we've been observing the animals.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.730
Charting data and

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.250
making sure that our enrichment is
actually enriching the animals' lives.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.100
&gt;&gt; Our group worked the lions.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.760
And we were inspired by
talking to one of the keepers,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.120
who mentioned that one of the lions
especially liked playing with rhino dung.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.920
Smelling it, rolling around in it,
which is a classic predatory behavior.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.820
We made something that dispenses,
it could really be any kind of scent.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.910
Right now, we're using pre-pelletized
droppings from animals.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.950
They basically fall out at timed intervals
and split out three different pipes.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.270
So there's some variety and
space, as well.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.110
And we're hoping by delivering this
enrichment throughout the day,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.080
we'll encourage them to be more attentive
and engaged with their environment.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.342
&gt;&gt; They all came up with phenomenal ideas.

00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:10.090
They all came up with things that worked.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.120
And they all came up with things
that Jason and I hadn't thought of.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.840
&gt;&gt; I also have a new appreciation for
zoos.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.105
Now I really see how much work and
research goes into making a zoo and

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:22.087
really making sure that the animals have
a habitat that they can enjoy living in.
