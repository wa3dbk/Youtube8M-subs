00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.060
So we're going to do something
that looks really complicated,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.120
something actually, if you talk
about maths, you go, oh,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.710
no that looks horrific.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.164
And then we'll see how it
turns out, all right?

00:00:11.164 --> 00:00:22.270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.030
Yes.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.090
We've done it.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.730
That is probably the most
horrific equation we've ever

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.690
done on Numberphile.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.080
But what does it mean?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.440
Well, let's try this out.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.510
We're going to plot it, right?

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.630
We're going to draw a graph
in my computer here.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.410
And now, I'm going to
draw the graph.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.440
And it should be-- let me make
that bigger for you-- it's the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.640
equation Batman deserves, but
not one he needs right now.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.650
Again, that is the
Batman curve.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.740
It was famous when it went
viral last year.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.620
A high school teacher designed
this curve, this equation, so

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.810
that it would draw
the Batman logo.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.280
And he made it quite cleverly
out of different curves and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.700
straight lines.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.760
Can I show you how he did it?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.490
So here we've got some things
that you may be familiar with.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.750
Straight lines are quite
easy to draw.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.260
What he did, though,
is we don't want

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.100
a circle for Batman.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.630
We want an ellipse.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.210
Has a slightly different
equation, so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.650
it looks like that.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.220
Now, he turned this into
his Batman wings.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.570
Obviously, we don't want
the whole thing.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.610
That's not what the
curve looked like.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.640
He actually just used
these two ends.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.210
He found a way to multiply his
equation, and the effect was

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.720
it hides some of the curve.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.880
What happens here in this bit
that's missing, this becomes a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.140
complex number, imaginary
number, which means

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.740
you can't draw it.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.760
And that's what he did.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.720
He just carried on doing that.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.450
He just used curves and
straight lines.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.840
And let me show you what they
look like to make his Batman.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.760
Now, he used six curves.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.590
Let's have a look at them.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.290
So he used the ellipse.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.580
And, oh, this is quite clever.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.650
This is the bottom of
the Batman symbol.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.380
And these straight lines and
these ones are going to form

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.670
his ears, very pointy
ones there.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.255
And then, there you go,
some more curves.

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:16.620
That finishes off the picture.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.540
You put it all together, and
that's what you get.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.420
That's the Batman.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.800
So he hid parts of it using
imaginary numbers, yeah, using

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.380
square roots, which would turn
some numbers that he doesn't

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.520
want to find into imaginary
numbers.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.950
It was a very clever way.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.160
He used the same curves, but
now you can see he's hidden

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.860
some parts of it.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.890
You put those together, and
you put them together by

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.470
multiplying.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.740
So he put it together.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.510
He multiplied these equations
together.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.260
What do you get?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.160
The Batman curve.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.370
It went viral last year, but I
wanted to do it, because I'm

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.380
very much looking forward to
the Dark Knight coming out,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.630
Dark Knight Rises.
