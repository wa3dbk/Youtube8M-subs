00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.970
TimeLine comes with a built-in 30 second stereo looper.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.990
It's super simple to use and it can be routed pre-delay or post-delay.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.280
Record, Overdub, Play, and Stop are right at your feet.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.180
Just press and hold Tap to enter and exit Looper Mode.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.080
Press the Record/Dub switch to start recording.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.230
When you're done press Play or press 
Record/Dub to begin your overdubs.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.480
Press again to stop overdubs.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
You can also press Play to re-trigger the loop.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.500
You can also adjust any Delay Parameter while using the looper.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.490
You can also set your looper to be Post Delay or Pre Delay.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.520
Here we've got the looper after the delay.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.640
Now the looper is running before the delay.
