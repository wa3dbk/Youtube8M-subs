Off2Kali Vlog Richard Young
"The first vlog I ever did talked the problems of me being a brown person with

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.999
a white name. So I asked you to suggest
what my fake brown name should be. And Internet

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:20.640
you did not disappoint. I decided to invite, bribe,  blackmail, cajole some of the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.800
funniest people in Canada and have them judge the names. So let's see what they got to say!"

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.169
"Paula Brancati here."
"Hi this is Peter Keleghan."
"I'm sorry Colin Mochrie, what are you eating?"

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.409
"It's a brownie."

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:31.400
"Hi I'm Ennis Esmer."

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.620
"Where did you get that brownie?"

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.789
"It was in my son's room. I didn't have time to eat, I knew I had to come down here..."

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.170
"Pahjahma Pahnz."
"Pahjahma Pahnz."

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.220
"Pahjahma Pahnz man, yeah.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.860
I know I did that with a kind of Jamaican accent.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.249
Which is wrong."

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.929
"He is India's Hugh Hefner."

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.450
"Yeah, maybe a little, maybe a little

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.060
smarter than me, a little slicker."
"He's probably going to marry one of the young ones, 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.010
a twenty-three year old

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.090
and then sacrifice her to something."

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.220
"Problem with Pahnz.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.970
Because Pahnz, in Italian, is that little bit of stomach that just 'poop'." 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.330
"How many of those have you had?"
"I've had four."

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.080
"Jamiroquai."

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.979
"Jamiroquai."

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.860
"This is Noreen's favorite band."

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.730
"I'm sorry?"

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.950
"Could also seem French, which I think is an upside?"
"I'm really jazzed about that name.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.090
Yeah!

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.630
Jamiroquai!"

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.420
"My ex-girlfriend screwed Jamiroquai.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.900
Okay? So...

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.609
This is great. No, it's a terrible name!"
"Screams to me:

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:37.730
Drag Queen."

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.670
"You know, I'll try it.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.740
Why not? I'll try it."

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.049
"No Peter, this is actually

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.729
this is actually for, I need a name."

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.910
"And you make a plan to propose after the Jamiroquai concert."

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.050
"What the hell am I doing--I've been here for forty minutes talking about names for me.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.590
I thought they were names for me!"

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.890
"Can we just get through it?

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.159
Can we get through it?"
"Screw you!"

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.750
"Brownie McBrownerson."
"Brownie McBrownerson

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.790
would be the retired

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.779
quarterback

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:12.129
of the Cleveland Browns."
"I have the ring.

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.039
Because I keep it with me.

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:18.139
I can't get it out of my pocket."
"I don't give a good goddamn if I said I do this!

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.999
Is that rolling?"
"Brownie McBrownerson comes out of retirement

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.559
to lead them to the Super Bowl.

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.529
He only has one leg 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:31.169
because he lost it to Diabetes."
"To me the first thing I think of is a brown-nose, so

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.030
if that's what you want to go with?"
"He goes, 'Whoa I can't pass there! I can't

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.909
pass there!'

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.760
There's one little opening!"

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.019
"Who would this inspire you to think of?"
"Johnny Depp."

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.759
"What I do like is the 'Mc'

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.790
It's a little nod to your

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.990
Canadian roots."

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.549
"No, let me change that: Paul Gross."

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.819
"You know what Noreen? She took the ring. She took the ring! Oh that--"

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:55.969
रिचर्ड यंग 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.750
"Well that's a good name.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.729
That's a great name."
"It's very mysterious, but 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.859
just raises a lot of questions."

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.209
"That name would work particularly well in the War of 1812."

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.989
"But I'll tell you this: it worked for Prince.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.449
Right?

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.989
So, Prince,

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.129
wouldn't think he's a ladies' man. But he is!"

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.769
"You know, you open up and say you want to explore gender roles in the bedroom and all of a sudden you're not a man to her anymore."

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.709
"Thought there was something behind me.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.259
Oh come on!"

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:31.870
"You're a good looking guy Ennis, you know? You cut a good figure.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.019
Not many people can wear that sweater the way you do."
"It's just a sweater.

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.199
"She got it for me."

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:43.289
"If you don't use that name I'm going to use it."
"We already discussed that it's going to be for me."

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.019
"Indian Jones."
"I think that's the one."

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.859
"That is such 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.459
a great name."
"Feels like you could be a rapper if you wanted."

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.199
"You can tell that he's brave because

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.499
indians are...brave?"

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.200
"You might have to wear a fedora

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.039
and a whip

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.859
all the time."
"And the woman? Brancati? What did she say?

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.789
Is she seeing anybody?"

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.309
"Do it! Use it!

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:14.109
Do it legally!"
"So first, a big thank you to my judges for

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:14.950
helping me out.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.840
But an even bigger thank you to you, the
audience,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.129
for not only suggesting these great names
but for continuing to watch Off2Kali.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.469

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.090
"You want something to eat there Colin?"
"I'd love something!

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:46.090
A buffet! We should go to a buffet!"
