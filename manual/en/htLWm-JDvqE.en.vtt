Hi, this is Antonia Hoyland, on behalf of
Expert Village. This game is called Royal

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:17.560
Families.
This game takes a standard deck, 52 cards,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:26.619
no jokers. Pull out the aces and the 2s. These
are going to form your eight foundation piles.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.770
Yup, eight foundation piles. Lay them out
as you see here, with the aces on the outside

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:42.220
of your diamond, and the 2s on the inside.
The 2s should be perpendicular to the aces,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.370
sort of forming a T-like shape, depending
on how you look at it. Although it looks a

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.780
little bit like a square or a diamond now,
it's actually going to form an X, so make

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.850
sure to leave room to have that X connect
with four kings that will go in those spaces.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.799
Deal three cards face up as auxiliary piles,
and one card face up as the start of your

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.680
waste pile. The rest of the cards will become
your stockpile. Cards may be placed on the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.969
foundations so long as they're built upwards
in either odd or even fashion. That doesn't

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.729
make much sense at first, but think of it
this way: if it's an odd card as the beginning

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.969
of the foundation, you're building upwards
odd, if it's an even card, you're building

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:44.079
upwards even, therefore you do ace, 3, 5,
7, 9, and jack, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and queen.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:51.709
The kings go directly in those spaces to make
that X. Their freebies. Cards from the stock

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:57.270
may be dealt onto the auxiliary piles so long
as they go in descending order according to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.490
suite, even or odd, as the card calls for.
Therefore, if you have a 10 of clubs, you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.390
can put an 8 of clubs on it, but not an 8
of spades, or a 7 of clubs, or even a 9 of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.410
clubs. The rest of the stock cards can go
onto your single waste pile. Only the top

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.510
card of the waste pile can be played at any
given time. Spaces in your auxiliary piles

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.450
can be filled with cards from the stock, and
that's a very good thing. It's sound strategy

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.530
to go ahead and try to put the highest card
you can muster onto the empty spaces. You

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.849
can also fill those spaces with the top card
from the waste pile. If you can't manage to

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.130
get all of your cards onto the foundations
by the time the stockpile is gone, you're

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.300
allowed to pick up your waste pile, flip it
over, and do another deal.
