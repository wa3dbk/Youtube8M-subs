00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.510
How to ride in a mass participation event.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.930
If you're a beginner, allow space between
yourself and the rider in front.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.990
You might have seen some bike racing on television
and noticed how close the riders are, but

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.240
if you are new to group riding then it's best
to give yourself some safety room. &nbsp;Even

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.310
if you are an experienced sportive rider,
you should still take care, as you never know

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.661
how experienced the riders are around you.
&nbsp;Give yourself enough room that you will

00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:28.360
be able to avoid crashing if something happens
in front of you.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.000
If you overtake other riders, give them plenty
of room, or even a vocal warning.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.730
Due to the nature of sportive or charity events,
it's likely that you'll pass a lot of people,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.981
and that plenty of people will pass you. &nbsp;When
overtaking another rider, try to do it on

00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:44.940
the outside. &nbsp;That means, that if you're
in a country where you drive on the right,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.940
overtake on the left, and vice versa. &nbsp;Also,
give the rider plenty of room in case they

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.680
make a sudden movement, and finally, if the
rider in front of you is looking particularly

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.250
wobbly, give them a vocal warning as to what
side you are going to pass them on.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.129
Make sure that you pace yourself for the specific
distance of the event that you're doing. &nbsp;It's

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.859
no good setting out on a 100 mile event at
the same pace that you'd do a 20 mile blast

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:07.899
at home. &nbsp;

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.469
On the first half of the ride you should feel
well within yourself, and only on the second

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.189
half should you allow yourself to press on
if you are still feeling good. &nbsp;It's always

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.950
better to finish fast - starting with too
much exuberance and paying for it in the last

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.100
half of the event can potentially lead to
an experience that you'd rather forget.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.299
There's nothing like the morale that friends
can give you when you hit bad points on a

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.229
ride. &nbsp;If you can organise a group of like-minded
friends to do the ride with you, you can help

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.789
and encourage each other through the inevitable
highs and lows that will come during a long

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.840
event. &nbsp;The strongest of the group can spend
more time on the front, shielding the weaker

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.590
riders from the wind.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.679
Doing your research and knowing the course
beforehand can help you to break the event

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.009
down into more manageable chunks. &nbsp;Find a
landmark which is going to let you know when

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:59.090
you're over halfway, know where the major
climbs come, the feed stations etc.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.710
It's very easy to forget to eat and drink
in the first part of an event. &nbsp;There will

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.709
be plenty going on around you, and you will
be so concentrated on just riding and eating

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.489
up the miles in front of you. &nbsp;It's often
said that by the time you feel thirsty or

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.709
hungry, it's too late, so try to remind yourself
constantly to eat and drink in the first half

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.940
of the ride, and this should help give you
get enough energy for the second half. &nbsp;If

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.840
you've got a device that will give you an
audible beep every 15 minutes, try using that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.530
as a reminder.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.920
