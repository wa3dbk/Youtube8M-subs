Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen from Vanveen Bulbs.
And next, we're going to talk about how to

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.780
grow cactus. Cactus or cacti, if you have
more than one plant, grow naturally in the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.630
desert. They're found all over the planet
but usually in areas with very little rainfall.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.269
Well, if you live in the NorthWest like I
do. We can still grow them without living

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.560
in the desert. They do really well in our
climate, as well. So the trick with cacti,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.500
is to make sure to only put them outside over
the summer. If you live in a cold climate.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.570
And make sure and grow them inside in the
winter. If you get below maybe, 50 degrees

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.510
at night. Because they really don't want to
freeze. If they freeze, you will lose them.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.940
So they're very easy to grow. I just put them
out on my deck. And they love the hot sun

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.980
and they like to dry out, in between. And
so whenever the nights get below fifty, I

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.930
bring them back inside. And they seem to do
really well that way. So there are so many

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.600
different ways you can grow them. The key
with cactus, is to not water them too much.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.100
And this is just one in a little bowl. And
it seems to really like it. It gets lots of

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.829
moisture that stays in there. And it looks
neat there, too. So there's lot of different

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.340
creative ways that you can grow them. And
I water this, maybe once a month. Very, very

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.319
little, do I water it. This small cactus,
I really like. It's a kind of Euphorbia, which

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:34.119
isn't considered a true cactus. But it's so
beautiful and it'll just keep growing and

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.369
growing. And I started with a little one like
this, about ten years ago. And the little

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.959
one, now has to be transplanted. Because it's
got this big. I just love. It's just grown

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.390
and grown and grown. And as you can see, I'm
using gloves when I play with them. Because

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:00.289
they're very sharp. And I can't tell you,
how hard it is to get the little cactus, little

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.249
pricks back out of your skin. Because it's
really hard. And they come in all different

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:10.479
shapes and sizes. And this particular cactus,
I like too. It's very sharp. So you've got

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.810
to be so careful. And I over watered it so
the the mother plant actually started dying

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.480
on me. It just turned to mush. So I just broke
of the top parts of the cactus. That still

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.510
looked good. And I put them back down, in
the dirt. And they're, now they're living.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.209
Even when you think, you killed them. Half
the time, you can still take parts that are

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.260
still alive. And put them back down into dirt.
And they'll grow again. That's why I love

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.090
them so much. So I found too, if they get
too big or they start falling over. You can

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.689
give them a little bit of a haircut too. And
these are so sharp, you've got be so careful.

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.430
But like on this one, when you break it. It
actually makes kind of, a. It gets really

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.200
gooey, like Elmer's glue. So the real danger
that you have with cactus, is watering them

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.620
too much. So when in doubt, don't water. That's
been my rule of thumb. And I only water them

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.689
maybe, once a month, if that. Then in the
winter time, maybe, only once every two months.

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.989
And I kind of, look at them or put my finger
into the dirt. And you can kind of, see if

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.430
they're wet enough or not. You don't want
them to be really wet. You want them to be

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.189
a little bit on the dry side. So that, they'll
do really well. And even if they do die, I

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.239
try not to take it personally. Because you
can always get a new start off, of another

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.499
one. And they're so easy to grow.
