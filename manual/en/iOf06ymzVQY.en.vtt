00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.719
Hey guys what's going on it's Phil here from
TechSmartt and today we're going to be looking

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.309
at the Top 9 Features in iOS 9.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.150
So lets go ahead and jump right into it.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.680
We're gonna open up Apple Maps because they
added a lot of new information regarding transit.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.480
So as you can see here I'm going to go ahead
and pull up Penn Station in New York City.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.740
Once we're in here, we can actually view train
schedules.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.710
So we have New Jersey Transit and you can
see we have a ton of different out bound trains.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.079
They also updated the walking information
on Apple Maps so it's a little more accurate

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.410
and you can just see here if you're in a city,
it's definitely going to be a much more improved

00:00:43.410 --> 00:01:04.470
application and you won't have to head over
to Google Maps like most of us 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:28.410
have 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:02:14.849
been 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:30.810
doing 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.829
in the past.
