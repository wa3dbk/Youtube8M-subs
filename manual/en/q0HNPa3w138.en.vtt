00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.253
- Middle Ages are about to start

00:00:09.253 --> 00:00:11.108
and we are going to fight for food soon.

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:12.980
- I want to say that I will not give

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.790
this box to anyone for free,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.067
because there is food inside.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:18.300
- Can I have a look?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.938
- Sure, I will show what is inside.

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:21.217
Do not touch! I packed it.

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:24.578
There is a sandwich, even few

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.822
ones and Coca-Cola.

00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:31.629
That is it for now, stop filming!

00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:40.662
Guys, please be civilized.

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:42.128
I will be back soon.

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.749
- Wait.

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.106
- This box will stand here.

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:50.490
- Were you given any clothes, blankets?

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.780
- No, nothing. If anything

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.309
happens to me here,

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.796
I say HI to everybody,

00:00:57.796 --> 00:00:59.008
HELP ME PLEASE.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.683
- By the way, we can

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:08.290
smoke inside of the airport.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.756
- This is your last wish.

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:15.591
- I have a lap top.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.517
- Vanya, what would be

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:24.841
the last words in your life?

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:26.870
- I want to say HI to Ukrainian consul.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.304
- To Ukrainian president? To Azarov?

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:30.724
- Yes, to Mykola Yanovich.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.428
- If we are stuck here longer

00:01:32.428 --> 00:01:34.562
than for a month, I choose Vanya.

00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:35.950
- Let it be.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.244
- Mykola Yanovich, a year

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:41.160
has passed since we met,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.577
we miss you very much, help us out!

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:49.943
- What will be your last words,

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.113
emperor?

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.495
Call the Death Star â€“ strike Bosnia?

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:58.995
- This is not the end still.

00:02:02.502 --> 00:02:03.984
- I think that should we have

00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:05.496
military equipment it would

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:07.930
be a right time to use it.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.459
- Calling for Jeep army.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.831
- Cobra, Cobra.

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:12.299
- Let me go there, I wanna

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.293
get onboard. That is the way

00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:17.058
the cookie crambles.

00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:26.127
Goodbye freedom!

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:24.676
Goodbye freedom!
