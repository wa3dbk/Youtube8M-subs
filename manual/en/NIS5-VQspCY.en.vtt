00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.120
in this example we are given that a small
object is kept at the centre of bottom of,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.830
cylindrical beaker of diameter 6 centimeter
and height 4 centimeter. which is filled completely

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.480
with water.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.480
and we are required to consider light ray
from object leaving the beaker through a corner.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.249
and if this ray and the ray along the axis
of beaker is used to locate the image we are

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.359
required to find the apparent depth in this
situation.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:37.329
now here if we draw the situation we are given
with a cylindrical beaker. and it is given

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.050
that.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.460
the diameter of beaker is 6 centimeter that
means it is of radius of 3 centimeter and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.199
its height is, 4 centimeter. and an object
is kept at the bottom of, this cylindrical

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:00.090
beaker. and, a light ray we need to consider
from object, which is passing through the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.210
corner. and another light ray which is passing,
along the axis of this beaker.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.250
so the light ray which will incident at an
angle theta on the water surface which is

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.640
completely filled.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.460
then it’ll be certainly bending away from
normal say at an angle phi. and from these

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.560
2 rays 1 and 2 if we locate the image this
will be the point where image will be formed.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.940
now we are required to find the apparent depth
in this situation the apparent depth will

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.190
be this. and that will be h prime.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:39.040
now in this situation first we’ll calculate
these angles here as, this radius is 3 centimeter

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.220
and this 4 centimeter.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.790
the value of tan theta in this situation is
3 by 4. this implies the value of angle theta

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.810
will be tan inverse 3 by 4 this is 37 degree.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.970
so here if we use snell’s law then we can
write by snell’s law.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:06.910
we can write mu of water sine theta is equal
to 1 into sine phi. if we substitute the values,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.000
of sine theta. and mu here.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.900
this mu is 4 by 3 and sine 37 degree here
we can write 3 by 5.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.900
it is sine phi. so the value of sine phi we
are getting is 4 by 5 this implies the value

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.880
of i will be 53 degree that is sine inverse
4 by 5.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.790
now if we know the value of angle phi this
is also angle phi and directly we can calculate

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.600
in this triangle the value of h prime.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.730
so in this situation, tan phi we can write
as. this distance upon h prime which is the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.370
radius 3 divided by h prime.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.800
so this implies we are getting the value of
h prime is equal to 3 upon.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.040
tan phi. and here tan 53 degree will be equal
to 4 by 3 so this will be 9 by 4.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.140
so the value of this apparent depth we are
getting is 2 point 2 5 centimeter that will

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.730
be the answer to this problem.
