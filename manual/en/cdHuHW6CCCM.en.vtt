[intro music]

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:05.269
Hi, welcome back to Make Thrift Buy, a show

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:09.760
that’s been on hiatus for about a month
as I was in Hong Kong.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.740
So today’s episode was suggested by… me,
because I saw this top on tumblr and thought

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.509
it was really cool and wanted to recreate
it, and I also just wanted to pick something

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.380
that was quite easy just to get back into
the swing of things here on Make Thrift Buy.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.130
So the thing I wanted to recreate is this
daisy-boobs cropped t-shirt. The daisies also

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.029
have creepy little smiles on their faces.
So, let’s get started.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.300
So I have this kind of half-mangled shirt
that I originally thrifted and used for fabric

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.649
back in episode number 10. I didn’t want
to throw it out at the end of episode ten,

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.410
and I’m glad I didn’t because now I can
use it for this episode.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.039
First off I thought it would be a good idea
to make the sleeves more, well… even. 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.980
So I chopped off the other sleeve to match the
first one.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.890
So, this top has already been kind of cropped.
If you were, however, working with a fresh

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.260
shirt, all you’d need to do is crop the
bottom of the shirt to a length that suits

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.470
you, but add a couple of inches for hemming
just before you cut it.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.470
So with the shirt inside out, I folded the
sleeve up once, then twice. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.140
Then I selected a stretch stitch

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.520
 and I sewed all the way around
the sleeve like this.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.380
 With both sleeves  done and the shirt still inside out, I then hemmed the bottom of the shirt. Now, I 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.290
only folded the bottom edge up once, because I don’t
really have a lot of fabric left to work with,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.630
and like I did with the sleeves, I then stitched
all the way around the hem using a zig-zag

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.049
stitch. So a good trick to stop the hem from
ruffling is to sew a piece of paper onto the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.670
shirt while you’re sewing the hem. And even
better, if you put the piece of paper underneath

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.299
the shirt while sewing, you can still see
what you’re doing.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.329
Then I simply ripped the paper off and…
spent a good ten minutes removing little bits

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.619
of paper from the stitches, and - I’m done!
I’ve got a crop top.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.479
Now it’s just time to add the daisies. So
I basically just drew a couple of daisies

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.700
using Photoshop, but it’s such a simple
design you could totally even do this on 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.349
MS Paint. I made two of these and then I printed them out onto iron-on transfer paper and I

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.090
cut them out. Then I put on my newly-cropped
top and I figured out where I wanted the daisies

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.790
to sit, putting a small piece of blu-tack
where I want the middle of each daisy to go

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.040
because, well, pencil won’t show up on black
fabric and I couldn’t find my chalk. I then

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.040
peeled the transfers from their backing paper
and I ironed them onto the shirt.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.120
[music playing]

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.159
So the only problem with this shirt is that

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.849
it’s a little bit too short. I mean, it’s
fine if I don’t lift my arms at all, but

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.649
if I do… yeah. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.964
So my number one tip for
recreating this top? Don’t accidentally

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.580
cut your top too short. Now, I didn’t really
have a choice, but when you’re deciding

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.000
on the length to cut your shirt, just add
a couple of extra inches. If it’s too long

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.150
then you can just fold it up again and hem
it across but if you cut it too short then

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.159
there’s no going back from there. But I
think if I wear this with a pinafore or overalls

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.349
that will um… stop the flashing from happening.
So I can definitely wear this lots.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.729
So that’s that. And my conclusion?

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.659
[scissors snipping and zipper sound effect]

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.879
So please do keep sending in suggestions of
things you want me to try out on Make Thrift

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.250
Buy. I want to get lots of episodes of that
going.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.060
I actually have a Pinterest board where I’ve
accumulated all of the things you’ve suggested,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.040
which you can go visit to see things I might
do in the future or even vote up items, so

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.189
if a particular suggestion gets lots of likes
then I know you all want to see it and that’ll

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.739
go to the top of my to-do list. Aside from
that, I hope you enjoyed this video. Give

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:21.739
it a thumbs up if you did and I’ll see you
all for the next episode. Bye!
