00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is a sneak preview from the slidepark here in “Avonturenpark Hellendoorn”

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is done in May, hoping that they at least

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here lays Total for 489 meters of slides and it becomes Total 85 meter high!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In brief, a lot of slide fun for the whole family!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There are some unique slides at. Like the Multi slide

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here you slide with your head forwards on a mat

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
There comes a freefall slide

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And the big extreme, that is a floatingring slide with a length of 130 meter

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:57.000
For the comparison: That’s bigger then the Familyslide and Superslide in Tiki Bad but the Moonlight and Starfright are bigger with 140 meter by the way in Tiki Bad

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This slide is big so that’s gonna be fun here in Hellendoorn!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So is the placing from the slides

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Here the slide parks come!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
With 11 slides and in the back becomes the highest tower with a hight of 14 meter

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The slidepark is gonna be so big like from the castle to the tower

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It will have an open character with a fence like this. This allows you to look around but not climbing

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Not this one, this ones are temporary. Smartasses

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There comes no pool but the wholes are for waterstorage 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The water can pump up from the whole to the slide and on this there will be the skim-outs

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
These are concrete boxes and there is concrete in which a support will be placed

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
There are a lot together, but that's where most slides come to that tower

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
These are pieces of the “Dark Devil” is no suprise for you but it is a Black Hole slide

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But it’s also a floatingring slide. The slide becomes 10 meter high and has a length of 95 meter

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
These are pieces of the “Wacky Wave” this will become a Half-Pipeslide

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This here is the “Green Fall” this is a Freefall slide from 20 meter length and 10 meter high. But he must put in togehter

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
This orange slide has the name: Twist &amp; Twirl. 80 meter length and 10 meter high and is a bodyslide

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Before here is the Yellow “Tornado Twist” it has a lengt of 60 meter and is a bodyslide. The high becaome: 7,5 meter

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This become the longest and the highest: The Extreme. Is a miss that he is not called Xtreme Rides. Surely a minus

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.000
130 meter Total: 90 meter open and 40 meter in the dark. With these very nice “Daylight-Rings”

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000
This gonna be the Multi-Racer. In other words: Mult-slide. He becomes 45 length and 10 meter high

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And the special thing about this slide is that you slide forwards laydown in your paunch on a mat. We don’t have here in Holland!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
There is also enough room for expansion. Especially the big tower. Here they can put even more slides. And here some

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
This is just a basic package and hopefully save the good that they can build some extreme slides

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We gonna test this slidepark this summer!
