00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:12.170
Hey guys today I'm gonna be showing you an
inside the cab exhaust video sound clip of

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.470
the Corsa sport exhaust.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.640
This is going to be a cold start.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.640
My truck has been sitting outside all night,
it's 53 degrees this morning.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:36.580
So, you'll be able to hear what a cold start
is with the Corsa.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:01:11.870
Get past the chimes here.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:28.530
And I apologize if you hear something clanking
around back there it's a screen I'm bringing

00:01:28.530 --> 00:02:25.810
to work.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.360
Now that's it in V4 mode.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.730
55 miles an hour.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.870
And then you heard it just flip into V8 when
I'm going up this hill.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.510
It's not that annoying, um, I've had it out
on the highway.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.540
Going 75 miles an hour or so.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.970
It really doesn't flip back and forth much
at that speed, on the highway.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.130
Um, you can tell the difference it's not overly
annoying, I've heard worse exhaust systems

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.930
flipping back and forth between V8 and V4
mode on GM trucks, and this is by far, not

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.050
that bad.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:29.150
I don't know if you can pick up the throttle
blips as it's decelerating.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:04:19.590
It's kind of cool.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:34.030
I'm doing very light throttle in V4.
