Hello I am Sarolta Eke. Hello I'm Tamas Kassai,
we are here on behalf of Expert Village. We

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:17.330
are going to show you how to dance Jive. We
are here to show you the Jive basic step.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:30.099
Tamas will show you the man's step. 1-2-3
and 4-5 and 6, 1-2-3 and 4-5 and 6, 1-2-3

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:43.840
and 4-5 and 6. The foot positions for this
step is left foot back, right foot in place,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.110
left foot to the side, close right foot to
left foot and left foot to the side, right

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.460
foot in place, left foot closes to right foot,
right foot to the side, and now you can start

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:11.039
from the beginning. Once more it's back, in
place, side, close, side, in place, close,

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:25.359
side. The foot technique for this step is
ball flat, ball flat, ball, ball, ball flat

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:33.159
and ball, ball, ball flat. Once more it's
ball flat, ball flat, ball, ball, ball flat,

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:43.219
ball, ball, ball flat. The first two steps
are called rock. Rock back and then the next

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:53.840
steps are called chasse. This is a chasse
to the left and this is a chasse to the right.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.869
Chasse to left, chasse to right, chasse to
left, chasse to right. So the basic step consist

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:07.090
of three parts. It's a rock back and the chasse
to the left and then a chasse to the right.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.600
Chasse means stepping to the side, closing
the feet and stepping to the side. It doesn't

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.910
always mean you have to go to the side, you
can even go forward. So it's forward, close,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:27.700
forward. Or you can go backwards. Back, close,
back. In any direction you are using the chasse

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:37.010
is always a step, a close and a step. Jive
has many ancestors, Lindy Hop, Blues Swing,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:45.640
Boogie-Woogie and later Rock-n-Roll. American
Soldiers drove them to Europe and this freestyle

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.960
movement became very popular amongst the youth.
Later English teachers made them more moderate

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:02.470
and so it became more elegant, but still lively
and active. 1-2-3 and 4-5 and 6, 1-2-3 and

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.050
4-5 and 6.
