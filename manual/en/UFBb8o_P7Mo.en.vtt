00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
“The Wrong Way to Boost Serotonin”

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.020
Recent studies like this suggest that
dietary patterns characterized by

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.889
high intakes of vegetables, fruit,
mushrooms and soy products

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.799
are associated with fewer
depressive symptoms.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.880
The year before, it was this study,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.520
“The association between dietary patterns
and mental health in early adolescence,”

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.310
showing “[i]mproved behavioural scores…

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.990
significantly associated with higher
intakes of leafy green vegetables

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.920
and fresh fruit.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.230
Could any of this be because of the

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.970
psychoactive substances
found in plant foods?

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.520
The neurotransmitter serotonin,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.070
often referred to as the
“happiness hormone,”

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.210
is found in plant foods.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.070
But, serotonin doesn’t
cross the blood-brain barrier.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.840
So, it shouldn’t affect our mood,
no matter how much we eat.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.690
The precursor to serotonin, however,
what your body makes serotonin out of,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.680
is an amino acid called tryptophan.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.290
And, there’s a transport protein
in the brain that plucks tryptophan

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.549
out of the bloodstream,
and so, what you eat can

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.069
end up affecting your mood.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.469
Back in the 70s, they did
tryptophan depletion experiments,

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.220
where you give people specially
concocted tryptophan-deficient diets.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.610
And, indeed, their mood suffers.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.060
They get irritable, annoyed,
angry, depressed, right?

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.920
Their body just can’t
make enough serotonin.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.380
Likewise, you can give people
tryptophan pills to improve their mood.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.759
And, indeed, it became a
popular dietary supplement—

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.399
until people started dying from something
called eosinophilia myalgia syndrome,

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.139
an incurable, debilitating, and sometimes
fatal flu-like neurological condition,

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:51.649
caused by the ingestion
of tryptophan supplements.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.219
May have been due to
some unknown impurity,

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.460
but, better safe than sorry.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.619
Instead of supplements,

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.499
there are dietary strategies
one can use to improve mood—

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.489
which we’ll talk about next.
