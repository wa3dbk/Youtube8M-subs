On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Bill
Bassett and I'm here to tell you about how

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.630
to play the Pedal Steel Guitar. Now a lot
of people play jazz on the steel guitar too

00:00:10.630 --> 00:01:10.890
and you might hear something like

00:01:10.890 --> 00:02:23.230
and there's those who play rock-n-roll, I
would hook up the fuzztone for that. A little

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.870
rock-n-roll Pedal Steel Guitar with fuzztone.
