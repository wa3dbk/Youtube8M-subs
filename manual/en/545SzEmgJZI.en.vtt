Hi, I'm Deborah Kane.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.639
Farm to School programs are taking place all
across the country.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.911
Schools are bringing local products into the
cafeteria and teaching children where their

00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:20.150
food comes from.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.890
At USDA, we're transforming school food and
creating a healthier next generation.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.000
We're really pleased to support Farm to School
programs because we know they grow jobs and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.120
healthy kids.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.670
I admit sometimes it's a challenge to get
the kids to eat the healthy local options,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.920
but we have had great success with our signage.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.280
We have Harvest of the Month signage.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.670
We make announcements in the classroom.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.930
Then we stand in the front of the lunch line
and remind them that day, "These are the pears

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.930
from Oregon.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.010
They're great; you've got to try them."

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.010
And that works.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.350
This last month, we did lentils.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.680
And we had the lentil farmers come in, and
we made vegetarian lentil chili.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.530
And you wouldn't think that kids would enjoy
vegetarian chili, but they went crazy over

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.770
it â€“ especially at the middle school and
the high school levels.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.640
We really feel that exposure is a key piece
to getting students to eat new, healthy, local

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.640
foods.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.979
So we have a program called Food ABCs, where
kindergarteners get a chance to taste a different

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.790
thing for every letter of the alphabet.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.729
We have a group called Student Nutrition Advisory
Council; and these students taste test our

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.060
food, evaluate it, give feedback, and then
try to be ambassadors for the rest of the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.899
school.

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.420
Tasting days are very exciting at the schools.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.149
We usually promote them for the entire week.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.899
Every child gets to taste; and then they vote
on whether they like it, it's just okay, or

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.899
no thank you.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.090
And sometimes what happens is the kids get
way too excited, and you've got cheering in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.940
the cafeteria to try.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.020
And then you've got to calm them down before
the at-lunch monitors come over.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.160
One of the promotional activities that we
do is we take all the fifth graders on a field

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.160
trip.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520
So this last year, we took them to Siemers
Farm.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.870
And they learned how corn grows, and they
went through a pumpkin patch and a corn maze.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.750
It was during the fall and it was a lot of
fun and the kids really enjoyed it.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.640
We have an Iron Chef competition where we
have students cook seasonal dishes and then

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.510
compete to have the most delicious dish to
eat.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.209
We do several promotional activities throughout
the school year, the first one being Colorado

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.099
Proud School Meal Day, where we get as many
Colorado products as we can on the menu.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.069
We're going to offer summer camps with our
summer school students to introduce them to

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.049
the Farm to School concept and also where
their food comes from.

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:52.129
We took a model of a food truck, and Fresh
Approach created a healthy food truck.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.469
So the food truck pulls up to the school site,
opens the side door; and inside, instead of

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.439
unhealthy beverages and snacks, they have
farm-fresh fruits and vegetables.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.849
We have Meet the Farmer programs where we
bring a watermelon farmer to each of our schools,

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.689
and he brings 50 watermelons and cuts them
up and serves them to each of the students.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.359
And so they get a chance to not only have
a joyful day where they get to get messy with

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.969
watermelon and taste that delicious, fresh
watermelon; but they get to meet the farmer

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.090
who actually grew it.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.060
When kids get to engage with their food system,
where they're seeing where their food is grown

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.280
and how it's prepared, they're more likely
to give it a try because there's a relationship

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.280
with their food.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.299
At USDA, we're committed to creating a healthier
next generation.

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.950
We've got seven regional offices all across
the country ready to help.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.810
So if you would like to bring the farm to
your school, visit our website and check out

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.649
the many resources.
