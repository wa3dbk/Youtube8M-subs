MARIETTA DINDO: Hey, guys. Hi, Modu.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.300 position:73%
MILES O'BRIEN: You know the saying, monkey see,
monkey do. But how about, orangutan see,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.570 position:77%
orangutan do? If that holds true, this little guy
should learn how to get a tasty treat

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.070
just by watching mom.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.070 position:72%
MARIETTA DINDO: One of the questions that we
we're looking at as individuals is how do they

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.000 position:78%
learn from one another and how does this relate to
group behaviors that we see in the wild.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.570 position:75%
MILES O'BRIEN: With support from the National
Science Foundation, Primatologist Marietta Dindo

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.800 position:70%
is studying these primates at Zoo Atlanta to
better understand how our distant ape cousins

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.770
watch and learn.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.000 position:70%
MARIETTA DINDO: What's interesting and unique
about orangutans compared to humans or even

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.470 position:84%
other great apes is the fact that they're what we call
solitary but social, which means that individuals,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.200 position:69%
aside from a mother-offspring interaction,
will only have limited times during the week

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.530 position:72%
or even months where they spend in affiliation
with other orangutans.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.530
MARIETTA DINDO: Close it.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.730 position:64%
MILES O'BRIEN: Orangutans in the wild are
difficult to observe, so Dindo designed

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.630 position:73%
an experiment with captive animals.
She demonstrates it for us using this orangutan

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.130 position:78%
named Modu who has figured out she needs to slide,
not lift the door to get a treat.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.030 position:73%
Little Domadi is paying close attention. But in
this case, big mama Modu is so dominant

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.930 position:77%
she mostly keeps him at bay. In the actual study,
Dindo found equally matched orangutans

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.670 position:69%
are superb copycats, but only when it serves
their purposes.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.070 position:72%
MARIETTA DINDO: It's known from other research
studies that apes won't actually

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.170 position:63%
imitate unnecessary actions if they know
it's unnecessary.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.200 position:72%
MILES O'BRIEN: So does this orangutan behavior
tell us anything about how much humans

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.970 position:66%
have evolved? Dindo says studies show that
humans aren't nearly as selective.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.000 position:78%
We'll ape each other just to be part of the group.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.030 position:67%
MARIETTA DINDO: With humans, what we see is
that people want to do as others do and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.400 position:70%
this starts around three years of age when we
start identifying ourselves with others.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.100 position:69%
MILES O'BRIEN: So when it comes to following
the crowd, who's more on the ball:

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.570 position:80%
the humans or the apes?
Dindo says it really depends on your point of view.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.030 position:67%
MARIETTA DINDO: As intelligent to be as
others when its so integral to our society,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.130 position:66%
the cultural norms and doing as others do,
well, then, yes, it's very smart to do.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.130 position:70%
But if you're not going to want to waste your
resources and you want to get to your

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.200 position:75%
food fast that, too, is very smart. So it really
depends on where you're coming from.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.300 position:80%
MILES O'BRIEN: In this case, just making the effort
to follow the leader finally paid off for Domadi.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.000 position:59%
For Science Nation, I'm Miles O'Brien.
