00:00:00.776 --> 00:00:07.911
C.E: ...so I think we should sack the voice actors from the TrackMaster series and I'll do them all

00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:12.200
because then you cut on costs and faffing about.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.412
S.T: One - I don't pay them and secondly - no.

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:19.125
So we need to finalise these Christmas arrangements here.

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:25.348
C.E: We've already done that, ain't we? You know I've got a festive SteamTeam Quizzes coming out over Christmas.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:30.669
S.T: Yeah, but I mean what about before that? We've just finished Season 2 of SteamTeam Quizzes

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.379
meaning that we won't get all of Season 3 in before Christmas...

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.189
C.E: You mean we'll be recording up to and all through December?

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:40.558
S.T: Well, yeah. Why not?

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:42.069
C.E: Can't we have a break?

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:43.799
S.T: No, you lazy sod.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:49.910
C.E: Here's my plan. Why don't we stop the quizzes until next year with the exception of

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.872
the festive seasonal special obviously. And we'll restart the series on, say, the third of January.

00:00:58.072 --> 00:00:59.682
Well, it is Christmas isn't it?

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:02.332
S.T: You mean start SteamTeam Quizzes on the third?

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:03.453
C.E: Yes.

00:01:03.673 --> 00:01:07.072
S.T: What if everyone wanted time off? This country would just grind to a halt wouldn't it?

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:13.894
Where's your Great British fighting spirit? We don't need time off. It's hardly a chore recording one of these!

00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:22.055
C.E: Yeah, but I don't have to worry about the country - that's not my problem, that's the prime minister's problem.

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:24.312
And secondly, you can make it my Christmas present.

00:01:24.312 --> 00:01:26.723
S.T: Done! So what are we going to do now then?

00:01:26.723 --> 00:01:28.683
C.E: We're going to watch Ted of course!

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:35.083
S.T: Oh, fantastic. So what have you got me for Christmas then?

00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:37.133
C.E: Oh, yeah. I got it the other day.

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:43.195
S.T: HMV! I wonder what's in here? I bet it's...

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.177
This is an empty box!

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.446
C.E: Yeah. I remember you saying you had a wonky table

00:01:48.446 --> 00:01:52.538
and you needed something about three centremetres tall to stop it from wobbling.

00:01:52.748 --> 00:01:54.817
S.T: Yeah...thanks....

00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:56.718
C.E: Merry Christmas everybody!

00:01:56.718 --> 00:01:59.417
STEAMTEAM HITS CALICO ROUND THE HEAD WITH THE BOX.

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:01.278
CALICO SNIGGERS.
