00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.450
Now I'm going to introduce to you the part
on your Canon XH A1where you'll be connecting

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.780
most of your external audio. This is what
I recommend using instead of the mic terminal.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.609
You can see we've got two XLR inputs right
here, and that's what an XLR looks like, should

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.570
definitely get really familiar with that when
you're working with a lot of audio. We've

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.400
got a bunch of switches right here, let me
just introduce those. We've got a switch between

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.720
line and mic. If you're using these you want
to be switched to mic. Channel one and then

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.260
channel one and two. Basically, you can choose
to record, if you only have one input into

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.470
one channel, or you can make that a stereo
recording and duplicate the audio, also be

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.180
using this when we record separate channels.
Over here is the, micontinuator, and basically,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.170
if you're in a really loud situation and your
audio levels are peaking, turn this on, it's

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.350
off in that position, on in that position,
and it will reduce the audio levels by 20

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.960
decibels and hopefully give you better levels.
Also, we've also got a couple of switches

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.620
over here which we will be talking about in
a second. First, let me show you how to turn

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.220
on this XLR input. Basically, you have to
go into the menu and the let your XH A1know

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.420
that you do not want that on-board microphone
on any more, you want that XLR on. So, hit

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.610
your menu button, and going back down to the
audio set-up. It's right here, XLR input,

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.490
and you just have to turn it on and there
you go; now you're set. You can see we've

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.450
got a little indicator that our XLR is on,
on our display, once we plug a mic in we'll

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.950
actually get some levels. Just remember if
you ever want to switch back to your on-board,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.920
and you don't know why you're getting any
sound, this is probably why. You have to go

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.689
back into the menu and turn that off. Let's
get started connecting some external microphones.
