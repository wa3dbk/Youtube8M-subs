00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.650
Hi, I'm Brad with Orbit.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.480
Today, we're going to talk about how to adjust
your Saturn IV gear drive.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
The Saturn IV is new in the line up of gear
drives by Orbit.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.930
It's similar to the Saturn III but it uses
a key instead of a screwdriver adjustment.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.150
All you'll need for this procedure is your
adjustment key.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.029
Let's go ahead and get started now.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.120
Here, we have a Saturn IV that's already been
installed in the ground.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.960
The first thing you'll want to check is the
rotation of the arc on top of the head.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.170
The arrow on top indicates the direction of
the spray.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.600
First thing you'll want to do is turn the
turret or the green top all the way to the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.210
left to clear it.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.960
Turn it back to the right to indicate your
right stop.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.469
The right stop is a fixed position.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.699
To adjust the right stop, you'll want to loosen
the top of the head from the canister by turning

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.050
the collar like this.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.830
Remove that from the canister.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.790
You can see the teeth on the bottom of the
head.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.250
It will keep it in place once it's put back
in.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.000
We'll set this so that the arrow goes down
the right side of our area to be watered.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.700
As you can see on this sidewalk is the right
edge of our area.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.670
The sidewalk is also our left edge.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.670
We'll twist the turret to check the adjustment
of our spray.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.270
You can see that it's not going far enough.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.350
At this point, we'll use the key to make further
adjustments.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.650
To make pattern adjustments on the head, simply
insert the plastic end of the key into the

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.740
plus or minus slot indicated on top.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.290
With the key in place, you can now make your
adjustments.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.369
All adjustments you make, you're going to
want to do in the right stop position.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.970
Again, you can turn the turret to the left
and then back to the right.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.340
This is where you'll want to make your adjustments.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.759
In this case, we need to increase the arc
so we'll turn the key clockwise.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.510
One full turn of the key equals 90 degrees.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.829
You can see, we need to go just at little
bit further.

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.389
If you need to make further adjustments, again,
repeat the same procedure by turning the head

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:30.440
back to the right stop position and then turning
the key.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.290
There, our adjustment is complete.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.299
You can leave the key in the head during the
adjustment but make sure to remove the key

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.760
before you activate your sprinklers.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.160
After you've adjusted the spray pattern of
your head, you can now adjust the spray distance.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.519
Using the defuser screw located under the
arrow we indicated earlier, you can decrease

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.320
or increase the spray coming out of the head.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.850
In this case, we'll turn the key clockwise
to decrease the spray distance using the defuser

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.660
screw.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.670
You can also loosen the screw to increase
the distance.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.030
One thing you'll want to make sure not to
do is back the screw up too far as that's

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.889
what holds the nozzle in.

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.359
After youï¿½ve set your distance, your head
is ready to go.

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.229
