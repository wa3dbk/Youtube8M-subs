00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.830
Daniel D'Amico: Did you know that here in
New Orleans we eat babies? Seriously when

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.430
I first moved to town I was excited to hear
about this delicious cake where they put baby

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.840
right inside.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.550
So here we are on St. Charles Avenue at Swiss
Confectionary Bakery to learn about how this

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.510
original New Orleans treat is made -- King
Cakes.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.150
Good afternoon sir, Professor Dan D'Amico.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.699
Larry Moecklin: How you doing Dan, Larry Moecklin.

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:40.729
D'Amico: Larry, pleasure to meet you.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.920
Moecklin: Same to you.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.589
D'Amico: We're going to make some King Cake
today?

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:43.379
Moecklin: Sounds like a deal.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.089
D'Amico: Let's do it.

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.019
Larry I'm really excited to get started, I've
eaten lots of King Cake but I've never gotten

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.690
to make one before, so what's the first step?

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.940
Moecklin: Well the first step that we kind
of skipping over today is mixing the dough

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.519
and fermenting it overnight.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:56.860
D'Amico: Well let's get started!

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.559
Moecklin: And the first step would be to just
stretch it to the length we want. We get it

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.920
to the length we need it.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.040
D'Amico: Cut it down the center.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.040
Moecklin: And split it in half so I can roll
two nice pieces, and then form into a nice

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.270
"O." And then we ready to place the baby inside.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.610
D'Amico: Now what's the, what's the significance
of the baby?

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.600
Moecklin: When they serve the cake at a party,
whoever gets the slice with the baby in it

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.130
has to buy the cake for the next party

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.250
D'Amico: So what happens if you neglect those
duties?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.770
Moecklin: Ahhh, I don't think you get to,
invited to the parties anymore.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.710
D'Amico: The first year I moved to town, we
bring King Cake during Mardi Gras season into

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.380
the office a lot, and I got the baby with
the first piece I ever had! And the faculty

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.380
secretaries the next day were like, "Hey!
Where's our King Cake? You buy one, you bring

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.640
it in the next day." It was a very cutthroat
system.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.960
Moecklin: I've heard that happen at some of
the offices, we have some very traditional

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.570
customers who of course do it exactly the
same way.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.850
Put a little egg wash on 'em.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.120
D'Amico: So we have purple for justice. Green
for truth.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.870
Moecklin: And the gold's for power.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.870
D'Amico: And the gold's for power. Seems like
Mardi Gras. Let's head over to the oven.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.750
The key to King Cakes is sharing. Most people
have them in their offices, or schools, or

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.319
parties. It's not really something that you
just eat by yourself.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.000
Moecklin: Right I think the idea is to have
a get-together.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.450
D'Amico: Yeah, it's great way to build community.
Oh wow!

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.030
Moecklin: And that's it, it's a nice fresh
baked King Cake.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.090
D'Amico: Smells great! Seems like the key
to New Orleans food culture is about community

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.040
and sharing, whether it's crawfish boils,
or fish fries, or, King Cake. My favorite

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.510
place to enjoy a piece of King Cake is actually
right on the parade route, meeting new people,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.270
and neighbors, and community, and sort of
sharing in that experience. But you never

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.599
want to get the baby. Because then it's your
responsibility to bring the next batch. Can

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.530
we try some?

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.760
Moecklin: Of course! Let me make sure you
get the baby.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.720
D'Amico: You're cheating! That's not fair.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.410
Social capital is something that represents
the value and productivity of human relationships.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.220
It's not just what you own, or what you happen
to have on hand in terms of food or resources,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.310
it's often times who you know that makes all
the difference. So King Cake seems like a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.910
really easy way to build a little bit of social
capital. And social capital, is going to be

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.180
a critical variable in understanding how the
city, and the culture within it, rebounded

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.180
from Hurricane Katrina, and thrives and succeeds
today.
