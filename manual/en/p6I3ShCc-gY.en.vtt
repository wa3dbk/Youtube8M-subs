Helen McMahon for Expert Village. That will
hold a full pan. In the meantime, you can

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:20.589
use this tray. You don't have to wash it.
Just sort of take the extra crumbs off and

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:34.140
put on your next batch of cookie dough. Now
these should cool for 15-20 minutes, depending

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.780
on the size. These are small ones. Depending
on temperature in the room, they should cool

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:49.070
pretty quickly. When they are nicely cooled,
you can arrange them on a pretty platter like

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:59.260
this. They'll be very attractive when they're
served. These are being made for a theatre

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:07.640
party. All of these cookies are available
at the Lantern Theatre. These are especially

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:17.600
made for the theatre in Philadelphia, which
is an award winning theatre and they have

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.869
award winning cookies as well. So you can
have cookies during intermission and then

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:31.380
go back to see an award winning play. That's
the Latern Theatre at 10th and Ludlow Streets

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.590
in downtown Philadelphia in this historic
city of Brotherly Love. These small ones are

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:48.750
good for receptions or for children's lunch
boxes. The other sizes can go in daddy's lunch

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.159
box or at the theatre. You can just pile them
on although these are still warm. Sometimes

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.979
we make other types of cookies and intersperse
them. For this time of year, we'll put some

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.319
Hershey's kisses among them. Red and green
ones look really pretty for a Christmas tray.
