00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.309
It's been a couple weeks, but the Friday News
Wrap-Up is back for the 29th of July 2011.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.200
As such, other than the usual news pieces
I'll be giving the thumbs up to two games

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.680
from the last fortnight - will they make the
cut for the Top 3 for July? Who knows? At

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.990
any rate, lets get the show started!

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.170
Lets be perfectly honest... did anyone think
that we'd NOT get Years 5-7 for the iOS? With

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.790
the Lego series of platformer-adventure titles
being so wildly popular on almost any device

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.350
it's released on, the only reason we'd not
see an iOS release is because the last one

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.410
flopped. Tentatively announced for November,
players will get to journey through The Order

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.930
of the Phoenix, The Half-Blood Prince and
The Deathly Hallows. With a host of new spells

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.000
and items to add interesting mechanics to
the mix it's a casual title worth looking

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.970
forward to.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.690
Uncontent with sitting on their hands or at
least hiding away from the spotlight, developer

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.600
Crescent Moon Games has announced their next
title, fresh off the heels of their recent

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.290
online-focused twin-stick shooter Deadlock
Online. Siegecraft takes another stab at the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.390
classic castle defender genre, putting you
in control of a catapult, ballista, trebuchet

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.750
and other deadly weapons of war to stop an
invading horde. To add some variety to the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.010
mix you'll be able to initially play through
campaigns as either Knights, Vikings or Samurai

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.600
with future updates rumored to include fantasy
races such as Orcs and the Undead and other

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.830
classic era armies such as the Egyptians and
Spartans.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.490
Have I gushed enough about this game yet?
Have you felt like our review and constant

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.210
poking hasn't been enough to convince you?
Why not try the demo! A free trial version

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.740
featuring a fifth of the content from the
full game is now available, so now you can

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.970
see for yourself whether my craziness is justified.
For those of you who have already taken the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.520
plunge Game Center is now supported along
with a bunch of achievements to boost your

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.320
e-peen ratings (note: side-effects of a larger
e-peen may include buying a 360 to yell at

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.560
people in Black Ops)

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.760
Fellow gamers, I think it's about time to
sit down and talk about the Minecraft phenom

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.360
that continues to grip the world. Simply put,
the open exploration and objective system

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.290
along with the ability to create unique machines
and structures (not to mention the survival

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.170
aspect) can be addictive and its a formula
we're bound to see repeated again and again.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.680
Terraria recently brought a 2D spin to the
concept and now Junk Jack seeks to fill the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.319
gaps in the day when you're not at home playing
on your PC. One thing in particular has piqued

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.220
my interest and that's the prospect of real
secondary objectives - while self-guided gameplay

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.090
can be fun, being given an objective can add
a focus otherwise absent in similar sandbox

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.100
titles. We'll keep an eye on this one for
future updates.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.439
I won't go and say anything as cliched as
'you're not a gamer if you haven't tried Final

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.620
Fantasy Tactics' - while I may believe there
are amazing titles that any serious gamer

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.700
should have tried (or at least want to try),
I can't hold it against someone for not having

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.010
done so. Thankfully playing this title has
become a whole lot easier as (after much posturing)

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.919
Square Enix have finally submitted the game
to the App Store, meaning fans of the series

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.000
and those keen on checking out the tactical
RPG can hopefully expect to have it in their

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.840
hands soon. Those who can still play the PS1
or PSP versions of the game may be slightly

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.450
less excited, but it's one step closer to
seeing other classic RPGs making the jump

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.670
to iOS.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.310
To make up for the lost week I've decided
to do something special - it's unlikely to

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.069
become a regular feature at this time, so
consider it as a sort of apology for leaving

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.069
our viewers hanging!

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.439
When a developer like Popcap games says they're
using a side-project studio to test out some

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.529
edgier, whackier ideas, you know you have
to keep an eye on it because Popcap are the

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:33.560
guys that brought us zombie fighting plants
and pachinko-crazy unicorns. Allied Star Police

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.400
is a line castle-defense title much like Legendary
Wars where players duke it out against an

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.219
AI opponent by summoning various units that
attack automatically while traveling down

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:46.650
multiple 'lanes'. The challenge here is that
almost every unit is capable of aiming and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.739
firing at units in any lane, forcing you to
fill up the gaps as soon as possible while

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.219
timing larger units to appear at the front-lines
to smash through an oncoming wave. The pace

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.159
is frantic and matched by the hyper-color
cartoonish visuals that fall in line with

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.370
the creative flair of a nine-year-old child,
which is unsurprising given that the Make-A-Wish

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.010
foundation helped just such a child to work
with PopCap to create this game. Aside from

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.309
the increasing difficulty level there's not
much depth to the game, but for a something

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.559
that only takes a couple minutes to play it's
a fun (and free) way to blast away those spare

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:17.720
moments in the day.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.040
If you've paid any attention to the reviews
of the last fortnight there's at least one

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.699
outstanding title that's easy to recommend
to anyone itching for a puzzle title that's

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.509
not only challenging, but unique in its style
and simply gorgeous to look at - Qvoid by

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.169
Gavina Games. Like any puzzler it's bound
to have its detractors, but with so many easy

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.000
to jump in to action titles available it's
nice to have something a bit more relaxed

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.879
and refined to offset the action and bloodshed.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.349
Speaking of action and bloodshed, it's worth
taking some time to check out Reckless Getaway

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.740
by Polarbit. This is no easy run-of-the-mill
action racing title either - instead of using

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.659
polished controls that conform to realistic
physics you'll need to hold on to the reigns

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:57.100
of a barely out-of-control muscle-car as it
careens its way across highways, suburbs,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.370
farms and other dangerous locations as you
attempt to outrun the Police. Getting 'stars'

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.280
in this game is hard enough without deaths
also penalizing you, so take the time to learn

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.250
each level because you'll need all the help
you can get to survive this crazy ride.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.050
And that's the wrap-up for the weeks cover
the 22nd and 29th of July. I hope you enjoyed
