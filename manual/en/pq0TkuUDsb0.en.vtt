00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.450
Hello everyone! Today we are making a delicious and beautiful colorful amazing salad. So

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.209
whoever said salads boring has never eaten one of my salad. So, if someone tells you salads are boring you have to tell them

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.360
"You've got to try one of Lunden's salads!"
Because this is the bomb! It's going to

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.220
fill you up, it's not rabbit food, it's not
going to make you feel like you still wanna

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.550
eat everything in sight.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.280
It's going to be very, very, very yummy. So our base is going to be spinach, you want to go for the

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.680
dark leafy greens when you are making a salad. If you don't like spinach just go for something

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.190
dark like kale or some of the darker
letturces. The iceberg lettuce is pretty

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.050
much water and there's not that much
fiber in it-  so you want to go for

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.940
the dark leafy greens ok? We also have
some quinoa. We have regular and red quinoa.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.570
This is kind of a rice-like consistency. It has a low glycemic index which means it's not going

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.260
elevate your blood sugar and it's

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.160
going to give you sustained energy. And
there's also protein. Per one cop you'll

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.719
find six grams of protein in quinoa.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.000
So I will add that in there too, there's about 3/4 of a couple that I put in

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.650
here. I also have beautiful antioxidant
rich blueberries and raspberries - throw

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.070
them on top of their too. And then for
some healthy fats I have sunflower seeds

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.490
and walnuts, so I'm going to put those on top.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.720
There's about two tablespoons of sunflower seeds and just a small handful

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.390
of walnuts. You don't need to measure
everything out but just go by good

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.450
portion practices okay? And then I have
half of a cucumber chopped up

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.479
and then for dressing, a little bit of
oil is ok like some olive oil or avocado

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.310
oil something like that. But what I
really like is fresh lemon. So I'm going

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.200
to squeeze some fresh lemon juice over
the salad here gives it a really good

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:10.200
citrusy flavor if you like lemon. Grab a fork and a spoon and toss it around a little bit.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.200
And you have yourself a delicious meal, you can eat this for lunch you can eat this for dinner and it's not boring

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.640
