Background music playing.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.260
We got so bored staying in China that we decided
to change things up.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.990
Now we're in Venice, Italy.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:43.000
Actually we just crossed the street from our
hotel in Macau and now we're visiting the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.769
Venetian.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:53.659
So we're still in China.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.999
Background music playing.

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:05.000
So even if you're not a huge gambler there
is still plenty to do in Cotai Central here

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.230
in Macau.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.100
There are so many hotels that you can visit
and every hotel usually has a unique show

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100
that they put on.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100
Here at the Venetian you can ride the Gondola
and just feel like you're in Italy for an

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.100
afternoon.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.800
Then the hotel we were staying at was having
some kind of Shrek parade which you missed

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.800
out on.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.080
I did miss it but Sam loved it.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.080
Oh wow, yes!

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.300
There is just lots of shows and different
performances that you can attend in the evenings.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.380
So plenty to do aside from gambling.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.700
Coming early in the morning was a really good
idea.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.110
We basically almost have this whole place
to ourselves.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.390
background music playing.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:59.600
Well, Macau is a 
place where dreams come true.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.150
You make a little wish and throw your coin
into the water.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.410
Being the high roller that I am.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.340
I've got a Macau ten cent piece here.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.640
Which I'm going to throw.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.360
Missed it.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.939
You missed it?

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:19.939
Nice.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:31.980
And of course 1 baht. what?

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.810
Great camera work on the coin toss.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.650
I got the splash at the end.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.629
The after splash.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.779
