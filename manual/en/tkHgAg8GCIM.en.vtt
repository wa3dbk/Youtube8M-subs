00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.780
Hello

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.700
and thank you for joining us.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.960
My name is Burnie Burns and we here at Rooster Teeth

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.660
would like to celebrate the Fourth of
July which is a very important day

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.300
in American history by sitting down with one of our

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.400
foreign friends, Mr. Benjamin King who is a British teenager

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.900
and the product of the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.869
obviously superior British school system and discuss

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.649
basic American history.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.360
What is the Fourth of July?

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.590
It's a day when people set off fireworks

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.140
because they want to celebrate that they are independent.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.260
Who is Abraham Lincoln?

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.220
He's a guy

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.160
who has a hat.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.120
That is correct.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.780
And he was killed while watching a play.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.650
Right. What is something that is
significantly different about America,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.630
when it started as a country as opposed
to where it is today?

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.720
When it first started

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.739
a had tribal people who lived in tents

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:03.879
What were those people called?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.900
I know them because they gamble.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.020
Alright. What's a famous court case that's been before the Supreme Court,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.770
that had a major impact on American
history and culture.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.040
The one about Michael Jackson?

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.170
Where he was alleged to be like... a child...

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.610
Like, that... the whole thing.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.789
Mmhmm. Michael Jackson...

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.129
Where he was alleged to be a child.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:28.890
Okay. Who was a better

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.109
American president and why, do you think, George Washington or Benjamin Franklin?

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.670
Benjamin Franklin has to be the better one because he's on the hundred dollar.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.050
You gonna be cool to be on a hundred
dollars.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.020
What are the denominations of American currency?

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.850
100

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.580
'Kay

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.400
20?

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.530
Yes, and who's on that?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.760
George Bush?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.700
Correct.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.040
Do you know what Prohibition is?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.520
Something to do with alcohol?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.160
You like, after a time you couldn't have it.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.720
And what ended Prohibition?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.280
*Sigh...*

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.840
There was like a civil war?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.960
Civil War? Kay.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.760
And who was President during the Civil War?

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.540
Franklin.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.740
Franklin?

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.680
That's not right...

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.840
Benjamin Franklin?

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.900
Benjamin Franklin.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.400
And...

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.040
But I don't know who would be leading the other ones.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.420
It wouldn't be like two presidents fighting each other, would it?

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.640
Here's the thing.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.720
Stop living in the past.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.860
We don't need to know this.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.820
So you want to go to more recent American history?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.880
What is Vietnam?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.140
Vietnam is a place.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.300
Vietnam is a place. Where is Vietnam?

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.680
hah

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.239
Well it's hot, it's like somewhere near
Brrrazil?

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.819
Brazil. Okay. What direction is the UK
from America?

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.119
Left and up a bit.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.500
So if I was gonna get on a plane and travel to the UK

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.720
I would say "Just turn left,"

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.320
"and go up a bit." Right?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.580
Alright. When did World War II happen?

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.850
World War II was the Hitler one.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.560
World War II was the Hitler one, yes.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.220
World War II happened in like the...

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.440
1800's?...

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.820
1800's? Thats a big... It's a whole century then.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.189
What part of the 1800's?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.580
1850?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.180
1850.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.100
Just like, split the difference. I don't know.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.920
What was the event that drew America into World War II?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.739
I guess Germany must have...

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.800
tried to attack America, with like a
missile something?

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.550
Where did they attack the US?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.580
Good question...

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.960
Washington? That's where all the stuff happens.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.080
If I say Pearl Harbor to you, as an
event that drew us into World War II,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.820
Right...

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.700
What was Pearl Harbor?

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.660
A boat. Like a ship?

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.220
That... was involved in this fight.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.120
And the movie makes up that America won when in actual fact Germany won.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.000
The movie says that America won the the battle of Pearl Harbor...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.160
against the German missile but in reality it wasn't, it was the German missile that won.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.660
Okay.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.160
Any other wars?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.400
You lost World War I.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.120
We lost World War I. To who?

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.340
Was France in there?

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.480
So we beat Germany twice but lost France.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.940
Alright.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.320
You're doing great by the way.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.260
How many stars are one the American flag?

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.790
52.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.680
Why are there 52 stars on the flag?

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.600
Because there are 52 states.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.510
That is correct.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.900
How many original colonies were there in America?

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.740
10?

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.720
Who was the first President of the United States of America?

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.500
Abraham Lincoln.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.480
Abraham Lincoln.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.740
What is Watergate?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.780
There was this...

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.420
Waiter...

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.459
Who killed someone at a party.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.000
Who is Bill Clinton's Vice President?

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.350
George H.W. Bush? (British pronunciation)

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.820
George H.W Bush. (American pronunciation)

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.340
Well Ben, I want to thank you for coming and filling us in on American history.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.560
I hope I've enlightened you.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.720
You did an incredible job.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.660
I'm just glad that I can teach people

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.620
what they just didn't know before.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.520
Clearly you have, clearly you have. And I think that we
learned a little bit about the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.780
American history and a lot about the
British school system, today.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.840
Thank you for joining us.
