"Dairy Estrogen and Male Fertility"

00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:13.857
Why is high dietary intake of saturated fat 
associated with reduced semen quality? 

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:15.537
What’s the connection? 

00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:18.398
Well, a significant percentage of
the saturated fat intake

00:00:18.398 --> 00:00:20.524
in the study was derived 
from dairy products, 

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:26.807
and residues of industrial chemicals may 
bioaccumulate up the food chain into cow fat, 

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:33.358
and some of these lipophilic (fat-loving) chemicals 
may have hormone-disrupting abilities.

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:38.192
The EPA performed a national 
survey of persistent, bioaccumulative, 

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:41.325
and toxic pollutants 
in the U.S. milk supply. 

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:46.524
Since milk fat is likely to be among the highest 
dietary sources of exposure to this pollution,

00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:48.626
it’s important to 
understand their levels. 

00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:57.125
They tested milk from all over the country 
and found a witches brew of chemicals. 

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:59.691
They estimate that dairy 
products alone contribute 

00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:02.658
about 30% to 50% of 
our dioxin exposure. 

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:06.455
And like dioxin, other toxic pollutant tend 
to be widely dispersed in the environment, 

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.489
bioaccumulated through the food 
chain and ultimately result

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:13.326
in low-level contamination 
in most animal fats.

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:18.511
This may explain higher pollutant 
concentrations in fish eaters.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:22.854
Xenoestrogens like PCBs are associated 
with the fats of fish or animal flesh 

00:01:22.854 --> 00:01:25.446
and cannot be fully removed 
by washing or cooking, 

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:29.388
so can accumulate 
in our fat too. 

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:35.219
Xenoestrogens are chemicals with 
demasculinizing or feminizing effects,

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:42.920
but even in a non-polluted world animal fats 
have actual estrogen, not xenoestrogen, 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.750
but estrogen-estrogens, which are unavoidable 
constituents in non-vegetarian nutrition. 

00:01:49.752 --> 00:01:53.650
All foodstuff of animal origin 
contains oestradiol, 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.320
which is at least 10,000-fold more 
potent than most xenoestrogens, 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.780
and dietary exposure—meat, dairy products, 
and eggs—to these natural sex steroids 

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:07.430
is therefore highly relevant since the hormones 
in these animals are identical to our own. 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.680
Cow estrogen works just 
like human estrogen. 

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:14.960
Estrogens are also contained 
in meat and eggs, 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.150
but the major sources are 
milk and dairy products. 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.330
By drinking a glass of milk, 
a child's intake of estradiol 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.820
is 4000 times the intake of xenoestrogens, 
in terms of hormone activity. 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.280
See, modern genetically-improved dairy cows 
can lactate throughout their pregnancy; 

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:38.240
The problem is that’s when the estrogen 
levels can jump as much as 30-fold.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.440
Though cheese intake has been associated 
with lower sperm concentration, 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.070
dairy food intake has also been associated 
with abnormal sperm shape and movement.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.430
So this suggests that dairy intake may be 
implicated in direct testicular damage, 

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:56.970
and not just potential suppression of 
sperm production due to the estrogen.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.770
While milk products supply most of 
our ingested female sex steroids, 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.890
eggs are a considerable 
source as well, 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.800
contributing as much as meat 
or fish, approximately. 

00:03:10.802 --> 00:03:16.100
I guess that could be expected, as eggs 
are produced directly in the hens’ ovaries.

00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:20.160
Meat may also come 
hormone-enriched. 

00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:24.140
In the U.S. anabolic sex steroids may be 
administered to animals for growth promotion, 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.570
a practice banned in 
Europe 25 years ago. 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.700
This study in New York found a 
progressively lower sperm count 

00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.970
associated with processed 
meat consumption, 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.570
but similar studies in Europe after 
the ban found the same thing. 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.290
So it may not be the 
implanted hormones, 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.340
but rather a consequence 
of other things in meat 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.780
such as the saturated fat, 
perhaps through cholesterol. 

00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:49.750
We’ve known for decades that men 
with high cholesterol levels 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.950
show abnormalities in their spermiograms, 
decreased sperm concentration, 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.950
about a third of the normal sperm movement, 
and half the normal sperm shape.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.790
25 years later we’re 
finding the same thing. 

00:04:03.794 --> 00:04:06.060
Cholesterol is bad for sperm. 

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:08.180
In the largest study to date, higher levels 
of cholesterol in our blood 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.320
is associated with significantly 
lower percentage of normal sperm. 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.280
Cholesterol was also associated with reductions 
in semen volume and live sperm count. 

00:04:17.282 --> 00:04:23.210
These results highlight the role of 
fats in the blood in male fertility, 

00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:29.310
and should be of concern given the rising 
prevalence of obesity and cholesterol problems.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.550
Though a healthier diet may be associated 
with healthier sperm counts, 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:43.540
cholesterol-lowering statin 
drugs did not seem to help.
