00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.250
i'm dave thomas of cars com and we're
here with the 2008 honda civic is one of

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.550
the most searched cars on cars.com and
we're going to tell you why

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.050
now the civic is usually known as a very
boring kind of economy car few years ago

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.310
how to redesign it and turn it into this
radical shape you see here it comes in

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.689
sedan coupe boards and also comes in a
hybrid power and all the non-hybrid

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.800
civics is the same 240-horsepower
four-cylinder engine it's pretty peppy

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.920
but will win any street races but it's
right up there with the rest of its

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.700
class

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.170
it also gets great gas mileage 25 city
36 highway for this model here equipped

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.879
with an automatic transmission

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.289
that's right at the top of its class the
current generation civic is actually a

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.280
few years old but interior definitely
holds up with a design competition like

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.050
the 09 corolla and the redesigned Ford
Focus we have inside is a very

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.100
futuristic looking dashboard is almost
like a star trek shuttlepod as i always

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.809
call it but the the quality of the
materials actually quite high person the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.080
EXL trim level the civic which is
top-of-the-line this one has leather

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.320
moon navigation system center so the
price is kind of out of the ordinary

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.610
twenty-three thousand dollars you can
get into any civic at 15 and even the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.229
eax starts at 18 so it is an affordable
economy car when you go down a little

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.710
bit and don't get all the options and
it's pretty safe to with lots of airbags

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
this model the ex has this breaks as
well since the new generation came out

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.020
i've actually tested pretty much every
civic out there from the sporty SI to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.399
the base model to the hybrid one thing I
really never liked where the basic cloth

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.970
seats that come standard this one has
leather and you can see the cloth

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.509
unfortunately but it really isn't the
best of materials that kind of has a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.509
static you feel you always feel like
you're going to shock someone when you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.799
sit next to him even though the
dashboard is very futuristic it is a

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.729
typical honda controls are laid out
simply they're easy to reach the air

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.759
conditioning controls are actually
simple knobs and buttons which is great

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.380
it's a typical hunt and even if you have
been one for a couple of years it's very

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.880
familiar feeling when you get inside one
eccentricity in the civic is that it's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.619
put on our tech town or split up the
tachometer is down below shows you the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.760
rose and rpms and all that stuff and up
above the speedometer is red digitally

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.290
which is kind of strange will see that
much anymore

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.879
tricky thing about researching a car
sometimes the numbers lie and we'll just

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.629
be honest at pacific actually has shows
less legroom in the back then the

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.769
redesign ford focus for example but I
just drove the focus yesterday sat in

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.750
the back and trust me the civic is much
room here the seats adjusted for me as a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.859
driver just as it was in the focus and
my knees do not touch the back of the

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.280
seat here and they didn't focus and I
felt much more claustrophobic in that

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.290
car than this car so you can kind of say
that the civic has more real room in the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.829
back the nice thing is the floor in the
back is completely flat so you're

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.129
bringing along for friends set of 3 and
someone has to sit in the middle seat

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.959
will be much more comfortable this it's
been reliable economy cars as i can

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.810
remember and will probably stay that way
for a long time

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.329
what's nice about this current
generation is that has some style and it

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.079
keeps all the reliability all that
practicality resale value all of that

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.280
it's still there

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.319
