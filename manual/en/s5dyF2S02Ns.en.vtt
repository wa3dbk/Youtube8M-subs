00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.060
We are going to install part number 11034
from Curt on a 2002 Chevrolet Corvette.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.640
As you can see here, we already have one of
the mufflers taken down already.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.400
Basically we did that to give you a better
view of the frame.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.570
This is such a tight working area to begin
with.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.240
The instructions say you do not have to do
it, but I think overall it would be worth

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.039
the effort to take down the mufflers and get
your work done and then put them back up when

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.039
you are done.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.449
What is going to happen is the hitch is going
to install on this frame rail here and on

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.500
the end of this frame rail here behind the
bumper.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.430
What we are going to do is hold the hitch
up into place, center it, and we are going

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.430
to mark our holes.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.960
To take down the muffler, there is a bracket
right here that gets unbolted.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.120
And you can simply pull it down and get our
exhaust out of the way.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.900
And this clamp right here, which is in its
original position right here, we just loosen

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.860
it up and just push it back.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.629
Then we can take the whole assembly off.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.300
Let us go ahead and hold the hitch up and
get it centered on the frame.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.120
We will mark out our holes using a Sharpie.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.880
We are going to drill out our holes using
a 1/4-inch bit first, and then we will follow

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:14.420
it up with a 1/2-inch bit.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.220
We will go ahead and fish wire our hardware
into our drilled hole right here.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.881
What we are going to do is actually wire our
wire pull through the hole and out through

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:33.569
this access hole here and install our plate
and then our bolt.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:40.720
Thread that into place and then pull the whole
assembly back through.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:54.560
All right, what we are going to have to do
next is make our own access hole for these

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:11.520
two bolts on the end of the bumper.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.450
At this point we can go ahead and install
our hitch and the hardware.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.560
At this point we can go ahead and snug down
our hardware.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.739
Now we can tighten the bolts down to their
specified torque ratings, as quoted in the

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:28.890
instructions.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:38.110
All right, at this point we can go ahead and
start reinstalling our exhaust mufflers.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:54.739
Once you have your exhaust reinstalled and
positioned the way you need it to be, then

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.319
your install is complete.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.109
And there you have it for part number 11034
from Curt on our 2002 Chevrolet Corvette.
