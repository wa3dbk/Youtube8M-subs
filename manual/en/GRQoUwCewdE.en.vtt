Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village while our
dough is rising I'm going to show you how

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.350
to make this challah receipt by hand with
out a electric mixer. First we would add our

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:27.700
poof yeast and water, then we would add our
110 degree water the remaining. We use the

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:42.129
same measuring cup a 2/4 cup of oil, I'm going
to measure my honey out in the same cup we

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.289
measure the oil out in and that would help
with the honey slip out, out of that cup.

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:56.739
I'm going to measure out 1/2 cup of honey
and we would pour that right in. You see how

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.330
nicely it came out because the oil has oiled
the cup, now we would also crack our eggs

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.391
into the glass measuring cup. This is a good
to make sure that you don't get any egg in

00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:25.070
your egg shell in your batter and we put that
right in. I'm going to add the salt also into

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.329
the liquid ingredient it would help dissolve
the salt and mix it in nice and evenly. Now

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:38.090
we are going to mix ti we want to break those
eggs and mix those eggs up evenly in our dough

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:50.219
and get that honey mixed in. Just mixed that
up for a minute or so.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.630
Next we would be adding our flour.
