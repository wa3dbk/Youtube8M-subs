00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:11.789
Hi, how are you?

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.359
Anyone who hasn't dreamt of flying

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.880
riding on a fast dragon?

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.880
Well, this is possible thanks to Epic Dragon VR

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.580
Take a look at the little dragon with his mighty wings

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.000
We're going to pilot him right now!

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.000
Another contender for the VR Jam contest

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.919
organized by Oculus

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.919
Very similar to the Crashland video I showed you before

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:39.000
Around me I can see the menu and the scoreboard

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.370
The "about" section

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.370
But let's start flying!

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.960
You can see the dragon's head in front of me

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.060
The 3D effect is incredible

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.900
I was going to say that it feels like I could touch him

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.500
But I'm indeed touching him, you can see the pilot hands here

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.600
I'll go higher

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.950
The dragon is directed by the Oculus Rift movement

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.890
I don't need any controllers

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.420
The demo goal is very simple:

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.300
Collect the eggs by touching them

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.000
and we are awarded points and combos when we get them

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.300
They change colors if we don't take too long

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.000
But the best of the demo is the feeling of height and speed

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.300
The sound of the wind when going down

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.060
And if I look around I can see the dragon body

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060
Look at the left wing and the tail

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.060
And now I'll go down fast!

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.560
The screen is shaking, the wind roars!

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.560
It's awesome, I love this demo

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.560
It can be one of the best for VR Jam

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
Over the dragon head you can see the timer

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.860
I've got 60 seconds remaining

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.500
The weather changes, night is coming

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.500
I'll play until the end, it's not too long

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:21.089
With this demo you can surprise anyone

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.089
showcasing your Oculus Rift

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:34.089
By the way, it doesn't have collision detection

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:36.089
I can go through it and nothing happens

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:44.989
You can see some figures and the moon on the sky

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.989
I'll go down again

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:50.989
Up now

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:56.589
This must be healty for my neck!

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:06.189
As I said, the dragon is very well done

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:10.789
This is the closest thing most of us will ever be

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.659
to ride a dragon in our life!

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.369
The demo is over!

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:28.409
"The lords of darkness put an end to the reign of light"

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:35.259
And now look, like in good old arcade games

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.279
I can type my name

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:42.059
But this time, looking with the Oculus Rift!

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.269
A very cool retro-detail!

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.259
Well, that was the dragon demo!

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:51.109
See you soon!
