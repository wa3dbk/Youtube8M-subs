00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:14.112
Welcome to the Nespresso Assistance video on setting the water hardness on your Lattissima Pro machine.

00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:21.771
To optimize descaling intervals and keep a machine well serviced for optimal in cup quality, 

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:26.100
we recommend that you set the water hardness on your machine.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:31.823
According to your consumption profile as well as the water hardness you have set in the machine, 

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:37.422
the machine will trigger a descaling alert visible in the display.

00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:43.791
To start, enter the menu by pressing the “Gears” button, and browse the options.

00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:47.248
Select [WATER HARDNESS].

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.966
You will be guided throughout the whole process. 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.616
Just follow the machine display instructions.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:59.664
Place the water hardness sticker provided with the machine in the water for 1 second.

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:04.128
The number of red squares indicates the water hardness level.

00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:08.021
The results can vary from 0 to 4 red squares:

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:12.216
0 squares for the first level which is for a very soft water

00:01:12.527 --> 00:01:17.049
4 squares for the level 5 which is for a very hard water

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:20.942
Set the value accordingly,

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.386
and validate.

00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:31.480
A short text display indicates that the new value has been stored.

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:35.138
Validate the message to exit "WATER HARDNESS".

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.582
To exit the menu completely press and hold the "Gears" button for at least 2 seconds. 

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.878
