My name is Brandon Sarkis, on behalf of Expert
Village. Today, I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.950
to make Vichyssoise, which is a cold potato
soup. I'm not resting this in the bottom,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.120
because if you just let this sit all the way
in the bottom, it's just going to puree that

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.490
one spot. Then it's going to stop, because
nothing else can get sucked up into it. You've

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:34.260
got to hold it at an angle; you've got to
keep it moving; lift it up, stir around with

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.210
it. Once you thin it out a bit, you could
also strain it. You could also add more chicken

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.260
stock if you want, just to thin it out. I
know that at this point, a lot of other people

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:56.750
will add nutmeg, or they'll add cinnamon,
or they'll add paprika. Just remember, whatever

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.470
you add, add a very, very tiny amount, because
if you add more than just a little bit, it's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:26.729
going to really overpower the soup. I'm just
more of salt and pepper kind of guy. I'm still

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.030
working all the lumps out. Don't be afraid
to let this go for a while, because you don't

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.840
want there to be any pieces of anything in
here; this should be really super smooth when

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:54.470
you're done with it. When you're done, there
shouldn't be any chunks of anything in here.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.670
You could also put it in a blender, if you
so chose. You could put it in a food processor,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.320
and I know a lot of people who hand blend
it in a pot, like this, and then they'll turn

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.120
around and put it in a blender before they
serve it. You could also strain it. I like

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.769
mine to have the spots and specks and stuff
in there, so I'm not going to strain mine.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.069
I like mine just like this. Next, I'll show
you the last step before presentation, and

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.099
then presentation.
