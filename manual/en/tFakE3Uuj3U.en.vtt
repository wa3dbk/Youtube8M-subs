00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.169
 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:04.589
 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.680
 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.350
 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.900
 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.880
Welcome to the first Climate and Water Outlook for 2015.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.240
El Niño indicators have eased considerably since Christmas; however, our outlooks indicate the odds, 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.860
while not strong, still favour drier conditions heading into autumn. 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.820
But first, let's look at recent conditions.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.020
Heat was a major player in the climate of 2014

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.160
Last year was not only Australia's third-warmest year on record, 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.600
but it was also the hottest year on record for the globe—mainly due to record warmth in the oceans. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.040
Similarly, this year began with heatwaves in many parts of Australia 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.340
and bushfires in western Victoria, the Adelaide Hills and around Perth. 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.480
Relief from the heat and an end to the South Australian fires came when favourable weather patterns across central Australia

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.100
linked with the first burst of the northern monsoon.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.520
Although the monsoon arrived late, it brought record rains to parts of central Australia.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.420
In Alice Springs, the normally dry Todd River started flowing, and waters have once again made their way into Lake Eyre.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.780
However, over inland and drought areas of Queensland, rainfall was patchy and far from widespread.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.200
Drought is typically over when soils return to at least normal levels of moisture. 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.680
Unfortunately, deeper soils are still drier than average across most of the country.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.860
We moved our ENSO Tracker back to neutral in mid-January,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.000
as indicators in the Pacific Ocean had eased away from El Niño thresholds. 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.800
This means that the immediate threat of El Niño forming has passed,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.160
and we'll now focus on what may happen in the next ENSO cycle, which starts in autumn.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.320
The rainfall outlook indicates drier-than-average conditions are likely to continue in some parts of inland eastern Australia,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.380
as well as in the majority of Western Australia.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.920
This outlook has moderate accuracy.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.980
However, as we’ve already seen this summer, 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.100
at this time of year flash flooding is always possible,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.040
as moist tropical air can feed summer storms, even in the south of the country. 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.500
As expected, the tropical cyclone season has been quiet so far—with no cyclones crossing the coast.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.780
But that’s no reason for complacency—we’re expecting the next monsoonal burst in February and with it a heightened cyclone risk.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.300
Our streamflow forecasts to the end of March indicate lower-than-usual flows are likely at 35 of 41 locations.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.460
Median flows are forecast at five locations, 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.120
with just one expecting high flows—the Tambo River at Swifts Creek in East Gippsland.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.860
Accuracy for our streamflow forecasts is high at this time of year.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.380
Streamflow forecasts for the rest of Australia will become available later in 2015.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.580
Cooler-than-average days are likely for the Northern Territory, particularly when the monsoon is more active; 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.520
however, warmer conditions are still expected for much of the continent, as shown by the red areas on this map. 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.900
This outlook has moderate accuracy.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.480
Nights follow a similar outlook pattern.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.220
These outlooks, and the dry deep soils,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.140
suggest heatwaves are still on the cards and bushfire risk remains for southern Australia.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.320
So in summary, drier and warmer than average for large parts of the continent.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.580
While the cyclone season has had a slow start, 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.380
it doesn’t usually peak until late February, so more is yet to come.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.040
Finally, with deep soils still quite dry, drought continues in many areas.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.280
Low streamflows are expected to continue in eastern Australia, and the bushfire risk remains for the south.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.120
More details are available on our website at bom.gov.au/climate/ahead 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.140
Our next video will be released on Thursday 26 February.
