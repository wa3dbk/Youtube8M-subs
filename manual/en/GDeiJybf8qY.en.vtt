00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:29.208
On top of rails stretching straight

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:34.684
I stand with you like last time

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:40.109
I swallow down my dry throat

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.381
Letting air cool off my sweaty back

00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:45.711
Just a little bit

00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:48.416
Just a little bit

00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:51.217
Yes, then

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:56.624
I went up to you asking about your day

00:00:56.624 --> 00:01:02.225
Listened to your same old stories

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:06.305
Trying to tell you I changed for you

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:09.968
Looking for excuses

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:10.826
And we play

00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:13.512
bowling bowling bowling bowling

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:15.402
bowling game again

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:16.272
that ball just

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:19.009
running running running running

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.842
running out again

00:01:20.842 --> 00:01:23.666
Pick up the ball again

00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:26.542
Check the scores

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.288
Yes, oh we're so sad

00:01:32.518 --> 00:01:35.249
Sideway, we take

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:41.002
You were off track, so why did I

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:46.416
look into your eyes, not look out for your steps

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:50.628
Actions speak louder than words, you know

00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:51.914
There's a lot of pins

00:01:53.324 --> 00:01:55.038
You're the one of them

00:01:55.038 --> 00:01:57.372
Yes now

00:01:57.372 --> 00:02:02.899
I'll go up to you, asking for a chance

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.413
Then in the silence, waiting for the answer

00:02:08.413 --> 00:02:12.459
I'll look for excuses to tell you

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.141
that I've changed for you

00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:17.045
And we play

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:19.725
bowling bowling bowling bowling

00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:21.585
bowling game again

00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:22.583
That ball just

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:25.293
running running running running

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:27.122
running out again

00:02:27.122 --> 00:02:30.004
Pick up the ball again

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.725
Check the scores

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:38.374
Yes, oh we're so sad

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.990
Not so pure

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.613
But I was naive

00:02:45.613 --> 00:02:48.302
Didn't know anything

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:51.125
We were so out of it

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:53.876
We didn't do anything

00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:56.875
That's why we're nothing

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.395
Didn't know anything

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:01.939
We were so out of it

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.219
And we play

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.963
bowling bowling bowling bowling

00:03:25.963 --> 00:03:27.852
bowling game again

00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:28.731
That ball just

00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:31.498
running running running running

00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:33.456
running out again

00:03:33.456 --> 00:03:36.106
Pick up the ball again

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.019
Check the scores

00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:44.679
Yes, oh we're so sad

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.049
And we play
