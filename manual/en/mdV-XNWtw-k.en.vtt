00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.110
Psicobloc is a discipline that I think was born 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.000
in the late 70s, early 80s. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.160
One of the major places was Mallorca, Baleares Islands, in Spain. 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.090
It is a very psychological activity where you normally are many meters up high,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.090
but the difference is if you fall, you fall into water. 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.200
Often falls are not as good as they should be right?

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.110
It is impressing don?t you think? The wall, more than psicoblocing. 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.210
The word itself comes from physiologic and blocs and small rocks. 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.180
Here it would be psico big wall, that is the way I would call it because it 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.180
is a very big wall behind us and the truth is that it impresses a lot.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.190
When it comes to the route?s design I can say it was something new. The rock was the location called 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.260
to attention.  A bit unstable but it was perfect for the event

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.170
we all wanted to have. We had to work very hard on the routs. 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.250
The route is very technical. It has some small strips 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.290
on the route and you can grab. Once you enter the desplomito at the end, 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.290
you can reach a good one and put your foot very high, then you turn around and there

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.230
is s strip where you can place three fingers into it very nicely.  

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.230
It?s good, but small.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.220
The Prado?s dam is a fantastic place for

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.130
psicobloc especially because it is beautiful. It is a tropical 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.000
place with lots of vegetation, and a lot of wildlife. 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.080
I think the problem for all boys and girls will 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.170
be that they will certainly are going to come very strong, with good training, 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.000
but what will solve everything here is that your head is strong enough to face it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.160
The rock had the features for participants to climb it, 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.140
there have been some participants who have climbed the routes well so everybody was very happy

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.100
For sure, we are convinced that the winner won?t be the person the most muscles. 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.040
The winner will be a strong one who knows what his head is for because 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.100
for sure they are going to be afraid

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.240
They have done a great job because most of them had never practiced psicobloc 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.260
and they have made a good effort. They reached the top, the truth is that they did a great job. 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.110
They impressed us.
