Hi, and welcome back to Hair with Hollie with
me, Hollie. This week I'm going to show you

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.580
how to do a knot braid. It's a really simple
style that looks really striking. It's great

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.430
for school, and also great for formal occasions,
too.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.510
[Music]

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:29.121
What we're going to do first is start by pulling
all of the hair towards the back of the head.

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:33.390
For the top layers we're just going to puff
it out a little bit to add a little bit of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.010
volume to the front of the hair just about
an inch from the hairline.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:49.370
There, just take it in different sections.
And, just with your comb work it back towards

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:58.660
the crown just until you see a little bit
of a lift there. Do this all around the face

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.660
area.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.749
So, once you're happy with the volume you
have at the front of the head, we're just

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:19.979
going to pull all the hair back towards the
back and we're going to start our knot just

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:30.469
here, just around the crown area.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.720
Just make sure you have an even amount of
hair on both sides of the head, and I'm going

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.049
to start this off. So if your hair is a little
bit fine or quite fresh it's a nice idea to

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:53.780
give it a little blast through with hairspray
just to make it a little bit stickier. Let's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.780
give this a quick spray.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.450
So to start off this knot, it's actually quite
easy. It's literally just tying knots all

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.679
the way down the back of the head, kind of
incorporating hair as you go, just like you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:11.760
would with a French plait. So we're going
to start off. Split your hair in two. Then,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:21.470
simply cross one over the other, pull it through,
just like you're tying your laces, and knot.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.370
So there's the first knot. So this is going
to anchor our whole style. So if you want

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.920
to pop a little grip in here, or a little
bobby pin, or a claw, just to keep it even,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.670
it' s a nice idea. I'm just going to pop a
little claw in here and it just help us keep

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.040
the direction straight. All you do now is,
as you work your way down the head, just grab

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:56.569
pieces of hair from either side, still trying
to keep them as even as possible, incorporate

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.262
them in, and knot again. So, just literally
keep going. You can make the knots as big

00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:03.262
or as small as you like. And just keep working
your way, until you have used up all of the

00:03:03.262 --> 00:03:05.330
hair.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:23.319
So, when you get to the end of the hair, what
you can do here, is you can plait it, you

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.890
know you could pop in a little fishtail. What
we're going to do is keep knotting it all

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:39.000
the way down and then twist it over. So, I'm
just going to keep on going until we've used

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.829
up all the hair.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.434
So, now we've knotted the hair the whole way
down the shaft, and I'm going to secure it

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.700
with a pin. And what we're going to do is
going to work it back into the style, to make

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.909
kind of a feature at the back of the head.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.739
So it's a good idea to use curler clips that
are the same color as your hair so it gives

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.079
it a really seamless look.

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:18.400
So, once you're happy with your style you
can take out the claw, if you have one, at

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.220
the top of the hair, that has anchored your
style. So this look is not too fixed. It's

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.940
all about kind of being a bit relaxed and
a bit messy, so if you have any fly-aways,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.170
don't worry about them too much. You can just
spritz them back with a bit of hairspray.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.410
So there you have it: the finished look. If
you like this look you can give the video

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.509
a big thumbs up. If you have any ideas for
any other videos you'd like me to do, drop

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:43.229
a comment in the box below. I'll see you next
week. Bye.
