00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:02.721
Hey, I greet you all very cordially.

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:05.160
Today I will discuss another game on the card.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.440
This is a game meant for two people,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.180
popular,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.580
under the name "ships", "warships" or "battleship" (naval battle).

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:23.180
Each person has their card, on which draws a two fields

00:00:23.488 --> 00:00:25.088
10 x 10

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.780
at the top denoted the letters "A" to "J"

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.280
and the side of the numerals "1" to "10".

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.780
Of course, we cover cards so that our opponent could not see where we mark our ships.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.640
Placing ships on the fields, it is contractual between players,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.460
that is, they arrange themselves as to the quantity, size, shape and positioning of ships.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.320
The most popular, of course,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.280
4 x "1 mast", 3 x "2 masts",

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.340
2 x "3 masts" and 1 x "4 masts".

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:18.400
Of course this is a matter of contractual, because it can be a different number of these ships of the various quantities masts,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.140
that is, for example, can be 5 x "1 of the mast" may be, for example, 1 x "5 mast"

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.000
There are also used different versions of the shapes of ships

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.620
The most popular are, of course, that simple

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.460
where we have 1, 2, 3, 4 mast, and say 5 mast

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.700
as I said earlier, the issue of contractual.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.600
And here, as I say, straight, that is horizontally or vertically

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.800
I also met with laying mast in different ways

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.660
or such as, for example, here we have a broken

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:17.360
That is, the 3 masts, here, for example, 4 masts thus arranged, and, for example, 5 masts this version.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.140
In any case, you can not lay diagonally ships, as presented here

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.840
So the ships can not be set in any way diagonally, only must these masts adjacent to each other.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.500
So, as here, vertically or horizontally, or like here I have said above.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.560
Ships also should not, in any way, contact with each other

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.820
It should be between them, at least one grid space,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
that is like here,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.500
that is we have 3 masts, 2 masts and 1 masts and between them

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.700
is at least one grid spacing

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.940
this may not be as here, it is a 3 masts and 2 masts and here they are in contact with the corner.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.080
And yes, we proceed to the game.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.200
Here I marked with my example fields.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.160
The player first has placed their ships in this way.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.260
Here you will be outlined where gave his shots at the opponent.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.320
And the player number two

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.220
In this way, the selected ships.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.460
Of course, I this presented here on one page.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.740
But like I said, everyone has their ships on their piece of paper marked and not shows their opponent.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.480
Of course, everyone has one shot.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.800
It is also a matter of contractual, because you have met also with a version

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.580
that, for example, when you hit your opponent in the mast, we get an extra shot.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.820
I'll stay with this version of the basic,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.620
that is, everyone has one shot, hit or not hit, opponents of the change gives the shots.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.060
And here, as I said earlier, I selected the basic version, that these ships are arranged

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.660
horizontally or vertically and in a straight line without any distortion.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.380
And so, let's say the player first

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.620
he shoots and says

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.720
"field F6"

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.300
And the player number two, check

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.880
field "F"

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.000
"6"

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.080
He missed

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.260
And he says that it is "miss"

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.980
And that player marked himself here, in his field

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.780
And the player first

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.820
"F6"

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.560
marked

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.040
that miss

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400
Well, now the number two player

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.680
ie change

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.880
says

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.120
for example shot "A1"

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.140
"A1"

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.960
It is also a miss

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.440
And the player to whom they shot

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.220
himself marked, that here was shot in his field.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.000
And this marked here on his "A1"

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.640
that was off the mark.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.180
Well, now change, again this shot, say

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.700
"C8"

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.940
"C8"

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.780
And it hit two masts.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.500
And the player says "hit".

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.540
If it were, for example, one mast

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.300
they immediately would be hit and sunk.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.220
But since it is more masts, for example, 2, 3, 4

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.340
he only says that "hit" can add that "hit not sunk."

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.560
And the player first marks the his "C8"

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.180
that here hit.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.680
And now know that, for example,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.900
near here, here, here or here will be additional masts.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.100
And now the number two player shoots out there, say "D4"

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.820
"D4"

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.040
miss

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.680
Marks himself on his sheet.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.460
"D4" miss

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.220
And now this player

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.120
number one can afford to shoot, or anywhere else,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.140
because he knows that there already is certainly a ship

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.640
or

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.400
shoot further in these fields to destroy this ship.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.500
So let's shoot "C7"

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.780
Player number two checks, "C7", is hit.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.360
This is the second mast

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.700
that is hit and sunk.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.980
Hit and sunk.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.000
And now player two shoots, for example

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.480
"B1"

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.440
Marks himself "B1", I mean not

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.780
shoots "B1"

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.560
Player number one says it is hit.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.380
but not sunk, that is "B1"

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.800
Here the player number two marks to myself that hit

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.540
and also somewhere here in this or in that field, another mast.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.880
Well, the game looks that way.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.980
Wins the person who first destroy all enemy ships.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.240
And thanks for watching.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.860

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.840
