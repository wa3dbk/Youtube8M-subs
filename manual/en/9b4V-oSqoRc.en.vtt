00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.620
I am Mr Veec

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.400
Today i am going to talk about Second bosses in Blackrock Foundry

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.960
Which is Oregorger

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.680
Fight in general is too easy

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.618
It is require more focus

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.800
and everyone in raid should do his job completely correct

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.620
In begin i will talk about tanks

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.620
First ability called "Acid Maw"

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.160
This ability like dot's on main tank which is tanking the boss

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.700
damaging the main tank with 8,000

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.300
every 2 second

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.560
for 8 second

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.160
When we are testing the boss encounter

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.840
we don't see this ability hurt tank so much

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.400
so better don't use any Defensive Cooldown in this ability "Depend on gear of tanks"

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.460
so he will depend on self healing

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.880
and on Disc Priest

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.100
to give tanks absorb shields

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.760
so tanks need to keep defensive cooldown

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.900
for another ability which i am going to talk about it later

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.140
There is another ability which is so important in this boss

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.720
so many wipes will be happen becuase this ability

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.100
if tanks fail on it

00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:38.445
raid will receive massive damage or maybe wipe because this ability

00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:40.845
this ability called "Acid Torrent"

00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:42.372
what's this ability ?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.060
Boss will cast this ability

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.780
he will choose closest player from him

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.840
player who is close from boss will receive 500,000 physical damage

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.860
after that boss will damage all raid members 200,000 Natural damage

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.840
Tanks in this situation...

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.760
2nd tank who isn't taking the boss

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.240
When boss start casing Acid Torrent

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.200
2nd tank have to move under the boss 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.380
to be closest player from boss

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.280
we won't melee dps to be closest player from boss

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.420
We want off tank to be closest player to the boss

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.851
because of that off tank have to move under the boss

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.060
when off tank move under the boss he need to use Strong Defensive Cooldown

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.060
to make sure off tank won't die

00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:27.481
because this ability damaging 500,000

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.040
and reduce damage taken to raid members

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.880
example: if off tank use defensive cooldown 50% reduce damage taken

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.520
Acid Torrent will be reduced 50% to raid members

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.733
instead of damaging raid member 200,000

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.502
it will damage 100,000

00:02:45.502 --> 00:02:48.362
so tank who is soak the ability have to use strong cooldown

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.500
also you have to ask cooldown from raid members

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.640
if you use more active mitigation thats mean less damage to raid members

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.600
after off tank getting acid torrent debuff

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.780
here will be switch tanking

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.840
each tank should have only one debuff from acid torrent

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.960
if tank have more than 1 stack...

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.820
thats mean more damage to the tank and raid member

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.460
switch tankinf will be after getting 1 stack from acid torrent

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.300
Main tank now will soak next acid torrent debuff

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.200
thats all for tanks 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.340
now i am going to talk about range dps and healers

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.920
healer have to focus about acid torrent damage

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.980
you have to balance between healers and tanks 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.580
thats mean if tank and healers don't have defensive cooldown for tank who is soaking

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960
here you have to use Raid Cooldown

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.360
Like Aura mastery or barrier or Sprint Link

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.280
There is should be communications between healers and tanks

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.780
There is another ability will occur on range dps and healers...

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.020
boss will choose random player

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.140
boss will spit black circle under player, you have to move away from it

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.020
So better if all range dps and healer stack in one spot

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.380
to organize these circles

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.120
to be away from raid

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.920
because when phase 2 start these circle will be up on ground

00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:27.411
you have to make it close from each circle so you have space to move

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.160
There is another ability called "Blackrock Barrage"

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.700
this ability will damage 66,000 physical damage to all raid members

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.720
you can interrupt this ability

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.720
assign 3 players to make rotation for interrupt

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.740
prefer to assign melee dps to do that

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.020
if boss success to do this ability , healers have to heal more

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.320
because there will be chance boss going to cast acid torrent 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.100
There is another ability only on melee dps which is "Explosive Shard"

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.440
Boss will turn his face to melee side and jump

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.000
he will throw small shard in one spot

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.820
when this shard hit ground it will knock all players around it

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.520
after 3 sec ...

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.520
shard will exploding and stun all players around it 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.660
here you have two solutions..

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.400
First solution is melee stack on one position

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.900
behind the boss in left foot or right foot

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.640
so when boss throw the shard move to next foot

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.780
Second solution is spread around the boss

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.360
choose which one is best for you

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.640
In my opinion i like first solution

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.800
because you will know where is shard will land 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.080
problem of second method is shard is so hard to see it so maybe it will be close from you 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.200
then it will stun you 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.520
and bad situation if it is your turn to interrupt blackrock barrage

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.040
Phase 2 start when boss have 0 mana

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.780
each ability cost 5 mana 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.900
Phase 2 boss will rolling in whole room

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.540
if boss hit the wall...

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.780
he will deal 30,000 to all raid member

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.080
in phase 2 try to split in small groups

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.280
each group have to destroy all boxes 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.540
These boxes gives boss movement speed when he moved above it

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.060
so in phase 2 main focus on boxes

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.740
phase 2 will finish when boss gain 100 mana

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.673
there is trick here

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.080
way which boss move into it 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.379
he will never move back in same way

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.380
if boss too close from you

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.180
try to move to the way which boss came from it

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.572
because he wont go back

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.980
but if boss coming to you..

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.120
use defensive cooldown

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.620
he will do a lot of physical damage or maybe you will die

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.900
when boss fill up his mana phase 2 will finish and he will back to phase 1

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.300
That's all for 2nd boss in blackrock foundry

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.140
