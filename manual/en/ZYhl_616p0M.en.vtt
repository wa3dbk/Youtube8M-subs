00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.130
I started coming to Headway because I wasn't going out at all.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.280
I wouldn't leave the house, I wasn't
mixing with anyone

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.559
and they talk to me about me about coming to the day centre

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.500
and to start with I was like "no, definitely not.  It's not for me".

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.159
After a couple of visits, and getting to know people,

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:28.519
erm, this is my

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.800
relaxed atmosphere, this is where I can
be me.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.410
I've not got make the effort.  It doesn't
matter if

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.800
I go off on a tangent or forget what I'm talking about, because we're all the same.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.130
And sometimes

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.570
normal life is so difficult, because
although your family

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.670
except what happened and they help you,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.850
you continually

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.560
try to be "normal".  And it's,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.750
sometimes it's just too much effort.  I want to just let me tongue run away with me

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.460
or,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.200
I want to just sit, and doodle and draw,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.439
and coming here,

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.700
I think is made me more independent as well, because

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.960
it's made me think "I can do I for myself",

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.609
and, you know just chatting to people,

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.789
because they've been there and done it, erm,

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.630
or even, you know, somebody that's... that's
not as far along

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.979
the path as you are and you can say: "You know what,

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.399
this is how I coped with that", or

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.869
"That's where I was", but, you know

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.840
the friendships that... that we've

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.039
.... I've lost the word now...

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.889
[interviewer: "Forged?"] Yeah, that's a nice word, forged, we'll use that one,

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:58.159
and what I call, these are my real friends.  They didn't know Jeanette before,

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.869
so they've got nothing to compare me with,

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.359
and you all come together don't you?

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.450
Everybody goes into a little gang from
nursery upwards,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.930
and we're a little gang.  But the support we get from staff as well,

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.740
is: "You can do it Jeanette, you can.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.540
"Have a go.  See what happens".

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.490
Without being forced, you're cajoled more.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.470
But as well it gives my family a rest.  They,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.830
I come to Headway two days a week,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.030
and that's two days [when] they can do whatever they need to do, whether it be work, or

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.060
go out shopping and they've not got to worry about me.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.630
'Cos, I'm at Headway, and I'm being looked after,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.770
and they've got to make the most of it between 9 and 4, you know,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.880
so, I think, I come because I enjoy it -

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.140
I love it.  Nothing gets in between my Thursdays and Fridays at Headway.
