Hey guys. How is it going? Fernando here.
I'm shooting this quick video just to let

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.350
you know about a way that I used to get ripped
fast, because if you're watching this, you're

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.950
probably wondering how to get ripped fast.
It's something that I wondered a while back,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.950
lifting weights, as you probably have, for
a long time now -- for many years, actually

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.269
-- and I was not able to really get the definition
I wanted. Even though I was doing all the

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:41.839
training, all the hardcore stuff, doing all
my running and my cardio work and all that

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.600
stuff, I just couldn't make it. Obviously,
I was doing something wrong or I was missing

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.399
something. I correct myself on that. Maybe
I was missing something -- the things that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.399
are key when you want to get ripped fast.
Through searching and researching and reading

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.570
-- all these things -- I've found out
about Kyle Leon. He is a trainer, a guru,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.570
in the bodybuilding world. I pretty much followed
his techniques and his tricks and his tips

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.530
and everything he had to say, and I was able
to get the definition that I wanted, that

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.530
I have always been looking for. So I just
wanted to let you guys know about this. If

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:39.929
you really want to get ripped fast, you certainly
have to check this out. Especially, while

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.530
building muscle, gaining lean muscle mass,
that's one of the best things. Here's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.530
the proof, if you don't believe me. That's
not bad at all, huh? And then this arm. I

00:01:53.609 --> 00:02:00.609
broke my chest right here and after going
through rehab, I was outside of gym for a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.049
couple of years. I got back strong and with
Kyle Leon's help I was able to get ripped

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.850
and gain muscle. So check it out. I'm going
to put a link down in the description below.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.970
Just click on it and check out the video to
see if you're interested in Kyle Leon's

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.080
program. Alright, guys, best of luck. Thanks.
Bye.
