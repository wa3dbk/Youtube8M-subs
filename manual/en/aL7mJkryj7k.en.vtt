00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.030
The Isha School is not designed to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.080
impose education on the child

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.380
There is a natural

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.659
longing in every human being to know 
something

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.850
What is it that he wants

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.560
to know, to discover that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.870
and to support that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.320
is the teacher's business

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.090
anything that you pursue

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.520
you will always remember

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.440
anything that's imposed on you

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.760
will never add to

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.690
your life. This is the basics

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.250
on which the school is structured.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.760
Anything that a child pursues with

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.930
interest, he

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.840
will always remember this, it will 
always become a part of his life

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.330
anything that is heaped upon him

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.590
it doesn't matter how valuable it is,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.290
he tends to reject it

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.310
instead of enforcing that all 
children should  

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.200
study everything else

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.979
which is causing a huge damage 
to the child

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.960
somebody maybe good at one thing

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.689
and not so good at the other thing

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.290
when he's compelled to do it at 
the same level as other children

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.929
his...if he has any genius in him

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.899
for a particular aspect

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.329
of life, is generally lost.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.329
I dont know. It kind of excites me to

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.119
think about what could have happened for me

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:28.609
because so much of my time and energy as a 
child was spent trying to understand things

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.609
that didn't make any sense

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:36.609
so, if that was gone and that energy could
have been directed into something far more

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.309
dynamic and exciting 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.219
I don't know what I would have done with it

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.599
Art maybe,

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.979
I would have had more freedom to do more art

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:49.319
put paper on the table for each child and
we set the tables up like musical chairs

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.429
and we turn the music on and they drew, 
and we turn the music off and they

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:58.909
went around the chairs, and went around the 
tables so, by the end of that they were all 
just screaming and laughing

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.790
and just drawing crazy, and the way that 
they loosened up and just got comfortable

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.079
and since then we've started painting 
and they are so just full of

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:09.649
life

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.540
and expression and just,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.540
I mean it's amazing, I'm learning 
so much from them

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.189
The child will learn not just to read and write

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.900
we will make sure that the child is exposed
to every little thing in life

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.509
he should know how to fix a bicycle, he 
should know how to milk a cow, he should know

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.419
how to cook his food, he should know everything

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.059
he may not become an expert cook or an expert bicycle repairer

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.679
but he knows the fundamentals of everything

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:41.779
he's not helpless in any kind of situation

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.329
this will not deviate him from his academics at all

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.499
in fact it will enhance him

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:51.459
because your academic capabilities 
don't come just by reading

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.029
Your academic capabilities come

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:58.489
because your intelligence is in full swing

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.309
not half asleep. Today

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.859
the world education scientists are saying that

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.249
if a child goes to kindergarden school and goes
through twenty years of formal education

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:11.569
let's say he comes out with

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.599
something like an MS or PHD or whatever

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.949
20 years of education

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.830
they're saying 70% of his education 
is irrevocably destroyed

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.650
that means he's coming out as a
knowledgable idiot

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.969
and he will not be truly competitve 
in anything

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.169
he will try to survive on his

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.719
two alphabets that he has gathered next to his name 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.949
so I want the children to grow up in such a way

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.159
tomorrow if your qualification has no value

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.810
still you survive

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.030
you survive because of your capability, not
because of your qualification

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.729
this is education

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:51.569
for knowing

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.150
and to become capable

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.379
this is not education just to
 
0:04:56.379,0:04:59.870
you know, decorate yourself with something

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.710
I cut the vegetables

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.060
then we put them in this big pot

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.160
and then we stir them and put fire under

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.210
and we put all these different type of 
things inside and mix it and make taste
