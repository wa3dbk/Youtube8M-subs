00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.822
?The third match of Korea Clan!

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:11.134
First two matches were very exciting

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:14.862
You can watch these only in OGN PLUS

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:23.792
Unless you are the member of the clan, it's impossible to watch these

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:29.268
Hope you all are enjoying CoC Battle Master

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:23.792
I'm sure the third match would be as exciting as the previous ones

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:30.761
But actually, I don’t understand everything because I'm a CoC newbie

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:34.195
Think of it as a prep lesson

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:38.126
Someday, you will control those high-level units as well

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:46.589
Okay, let's check out the game

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:55.122
The attacker is '111' and the defender is '雙喜'

00:00:55.122 --> 00:01:00.405
'111' looks like the number commonly seen on buses

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:03.015
I'm curious about the strategy '111' brought

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:07.028
This is his composition

00:01:07.028 --> 00:01:17.116
In case of the spells, he brought Rage, Lightning, and Jump

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:18.579
I haven't seen Jump Spell so far

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.870
It's the first time we see it in CoC Battle Master

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.898
He's using Goblin with Jump Spell

00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:27.458
Must have prepared for this show

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:31.135
'111' is quite a showman

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:32.811
He might have changed his username too

00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:34.660
If '111' wants to be a greater showman,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.387
he should put the Goblin in first with the Jump Spell

00:01:39.387 --> 00:01:41.063
I'm looking forward to it

00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:44.660
I wonder if he will actually do that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.287
This defender doesn't have colorful walls

00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:53.608
I think defensive structures are loosely built in general

00:01:53.608 --> 00:01:56.575
His walls are those of Town Hall Lv.8 users

00:01:56.575 --> 00:02:04.245
And that's why '111' didn't bring Wallbreakers

00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:09.944
Jump Spell will come quite handy

00:02:09.944 --> 00:02:19.223
Let's see if the Goblins will be the first ones to use the Jump Spell

00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:22.576
Will it be the Goblins?

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:27.431
Aww, the first invaders are the Golems, not the Goblins

00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:32.154
Two Golems are in, and the Wizards are attacking from behind

00:02:32.154 --> 00:02:34.775
Archer Queen is in quite early

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:38.940
She's clearing off from the north side

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.728
Jump Spell is used!

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:43.491
There's nothing to jump over

00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:48.469
but the Golem successfully went in

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:53.559
Guards are out to protect. There's Witch

00:02:53.559 --> 00:03:00.668
'111' used Lightning Spell to clear off the guards

00:03:00.668 --> 00:03:03.075
Barbarian King used Jump Spell to get in

00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:09.272
Archer Queen got in there in time!

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.860
'111' got to the center with no trouble

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.025
Barbarian Kings are moving in rapidly

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:20.148
All Hidden Teslas are up

00:03:20.148 --> 00:03:24.415
Rage Spell was used just now

00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:27.767
Anyways, Jump Spells were very useful in the end

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:29.708
I think '111' didn't bring Freeze Spell

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:33.107
because the defender doesn't have Inferno Towers

00:03:33.107 --> 00:03:33.960
Were there any?

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.888
Nope

00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:39.215
The defender is Town Hall Lv.10, but looks like Lv.8

00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:43.858
Now Balloons are coming in

00:03:43.858 --> 00:03:46.844
Lava Hounds are destroying Hidden Teslas

00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:50.705
And the Balloons are...

00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:52.098
Oh, he has the Inferno Tower

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:55.552
Sorry, I underestimated you

00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:57.066
What happened to you?

00:03:57.066 --> 00:03:59.596
I didn't see that

00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:04.015
Anyways, the Balloons are getting in from sideways too

00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:06.088
clearing everything off

00:04:06.088 --> 00:04:08.160
Goblins are not used yet

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.487
He will eventually use them

00:04:10.487 --> 00:04:15.901
But he's using the Wizards...

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:18.014
Goblins are finally here!

00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:19.325
Three of them

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:24.284
Goblins are trying to destroy the wall

00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:27.301
I'm happy that there are some units that I know

00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:34.747
Goblins are making scratches instead of destroying the wall

00:04:34.747 --> 00:04:38.160
Meanwhile, the Balloons are in

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.040
The Town Hall collapsed

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.367
I think '111' will reach 100%. Almost everything is destroyed

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.852
There's no defensive structure left

00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:50.676
9% left!

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:52.454
What are the Goblins doing?

00:04:52.454 --> 00:04:54.506
Five of them... a boy band?

00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:55.917
Making scratches on the wall

00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:59.859
Balloons are moving down to finish the game

00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:04.603
Is this going to be the first complete-destruction?

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:06.614
It's getting exciting!

00:05:06.614 --> 00:05:12.856
Town Hall Lv.10 users are difficult to wipe out

00:05:12.856 --> 00:05:15.589
Goblins are doing nothing!

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:22.273
But 100% achieved!

00:05:22.273 --> 00:05:25.418
That was very first complete-destruction match

00:05:25.418 --> 00:05:28.060
You said it's extremely difficult to do so at this level

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.463
It's almost impossible

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:34.409
'111' was a showman, indeed

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.741
Goblins, Jump Spells... they were all useful

00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:41.144
Jump Spells were used strategically

00:05:41.144 --> 00:05:44.763
Golems' routes were tracked perfectly to use the Jump Spell

00:05:44.763 --> 00:05:49.462
so all the units could jump easily after the Golems

00:05:49.462 --> 00:05:51.067
They jumped as if they were running away from school

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:53.304
Sure

00:05:53.304 --> 00:05:58.546
Anyways, that was a successful strategy

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:01.888
We've seen three matches so far

00:06:01.888 --> 00:06:09.288
We will be back with the fourth match
