00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.080
Today on our 2012 Buick Enclave, we'll be
installing part number 13424 from Curt.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.650
Here are a couple of measurements to help
you when selecting accessories.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.630
From the top of the receiver tube to the ground
is 18-3/4 and from the center of the hitch

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.190
pinhole to the outermost point of the bumper
is 4-1/4.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.610
Now well go ahead with our install.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.030
To begin our install, well need to remove
the cover here at the rear bumper.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.430
To do that well just undo the clasps on either
side.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.610
Well go ahead and put this back in the vehicle,
because it will not be re-used after the hitch

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.830
is installed.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.930
With the cover off of the bumper, well now
go ahead and drop the exhaust.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.800
Before you drop the exhaust, it would be a
good idea to run a strap across to help support

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.910
the exhaust while its disconnected.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.230
Well undo the rubber insulator here at the
exhaust hangers.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:01:14.070
There 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:42.380
are 
three 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:02:17.099
that were going 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:29.120
to undo.
