Green Coffee Bean Extract Weight Loss Benefits

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:05.320
I'd like to talk a little today about a certain
natural ingredient that's been getting a lot

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.640
of media attention, and it's the green coffee
bean.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.169
There is a lot of hype going on about this
little small green bean, and I wanna kind

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.400
of get into the bottom and find out what's
true and what's not true .

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.900
So, normally, I'm agains weight loss supplements
because I've seen for over the past 20 years

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.750
there's a lot of them come and go.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.660
Green coffee bean has been getting a lot of
media attention because there was a study

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.730
done recently, and it was presented in San
Diego at the American Chemical Society, which

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.400
is one of the largest scientific conferences
in the world.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.170
Here is what the study show.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:52.149
It show that participants who took green coffee
bean extract lost a total of 17 pounds each.

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:59.010
They also lost 10.5% of their total body weight,
and this is the one that shocks me... they

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.820
have lost a total of 17% of their body fat.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.050
The most interesting part of this clinical
trial was done on human, not rats or monkeys,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.000
is that there were absolutely zero side effects.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.830
Now, to a nutritionist, this is specially
important.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.461
Let's take a look at this green coffee bean.

00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:24.440
How Does Green Coffee Bean Extract Work?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.260
Green coffee bean is what we called in the
natural health world the "triple threat".

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.400
It has an active compound called Chlorogenic
Acid, and this is critical, it's natural,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.010
it's healthy and it is so, so important.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.150
Now the firs mechanism of action is it works
by inhibiting the absorption and utilization

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.610
of glucose also known as sugar into the bloodstream.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.220
No sugar into the bloodstream, means no build-up
of fat in the body.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.550
The sugar is turn into fat in the body when
it is not burned.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.659
Number 2, it helps to boost our metabolism.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.890
What is our metabolism?

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.390
It's our body's ability to burn the fuel that
we put on our body.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.819
How efficiently are we burning our fuel.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.930
And, number 3, reall...really important is
that enhances the burning of fats in the liver.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.930
The liver is responsible for processing all
of the fats that we put in our body.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.319
And this Chlorogenic acid helps enhance the
metabolism of fat in the liver.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:34.080
When you combine all of these 3 actions together,
you get an amazing natural compound that is

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.260
basically getting the body to do what it is
supposed to do on its own which is metabolize

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.620
sugar, metabolize fat and lose weight naturally.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.880
Let me explain how this works.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.040
If you take a car or train, can you imagine
that they are not metabolizing the fuel, the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.110
coal or the gasoline they are using.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.810
You gonna get a lot of smoke, you gonna get
a lot of inefficiency, the car or train will

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.830
not going to run well.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.940
On the other hand, if you take a high-performance
vehicle or a high-performance train like a

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.620
bullet train, that's burning at maximum efficiency,
and maximum capacity...that train is burning

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.200
its fuel.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.800
That's what happening in our body.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.760
The Green Coffee Bean Extract mainly the chlorogenic
acid helps to enhance, helps to speed up and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.350
helps to make our body more efficient in burning
its fuel.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.550
And, the answer is absolutely NO.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.830
This is a really, really important fact, so
brown coffee beans have been dry roasted.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.909
And, so they have a different smell, they
have a different flavor, and they have removed

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.159
all of the chlorogenic acid.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:04:00.430
When you dry roasted which is 470 F or 480
F, you basically remove, you basically destroyed

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.580
all the chlorogenic acid.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.769
Green coffee beans, on the other hand, have
a very different smell, a very different flavor,

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:14.750
they are very bitter, very pungent...and they
have 50% of the entire bean is chlorogenic

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.349
acid, because it hasn't been heated, it hasn't
been destroyed.

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.740
This is really important, the green coffee
bean is bitter.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.710
And I've been saying for over 2 decades now,
bitter is better.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.580
And, this is another perfect example of that.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.809
Dr. Lindsey are these the typical results
because there people losing 3 pounds in 4

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.000
days, or 6 pounds in 5days?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.509
And the answer is yes.

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.900
It's amazing, but the answer is yes, these
are typical results.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.729
And, it's because of the mechanism of actions
but I always try to get people to make sure

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.720
that they are drinking enough water.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.319
Because these type of products, being so bitter,
you really have to drink a lot of water.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.059
So, try to go 10 to 12 glasses a day.

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.610
And also as a nutritionist, I always recommend
to exercise.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.460
Even though a lot of the results are happening
without the exercise, you just can't beat

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.460
exercise.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.650
It is so important for the entire body.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.029
Another really important thing is people always
say, is it due to the caffeine.

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.589
The answer is absolutely NO.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:30.520
One serving of green coffee bean extract in
capsules, two capsules has about 23mg to 24mg

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.520
of caffeine.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.639
So, if you compare that to a regular coffee,
that's gonna have betwen 100mg and 200mg of

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.639
caffeine.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:48.639
If you take a venti of coffee, we are talking
about over 400mg of caffeine in one venti

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.639
coffee.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.020
So, NO...it's not because of the caffeine.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.360
As a matter of fact, this is not a harsh stimulant,
it's not like fedra or it's not like a caffeine

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.449
pill or it's not like anything that it's gonna
make your body jittery or nervous or have

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.919
a harsh effect of hippee waffic night, or
make you anxious.

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.060
As a matter of fact, in the study it show
that the average person, or actually all of

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.800
the participants reduced their heartbeat by
approximately 2 beats per minute.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:26.720
Now that's amazing because it's speeding up
metabolism, yet it's lowering the heartbeat.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.520
So, it's not a stimulant, and no it doesn't
cause these great results because of caffeine.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.919
It has a completely different mechanism of
action.
