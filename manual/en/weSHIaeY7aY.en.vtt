00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790
Hi, my name is Mason

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.400
and I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.220
register for classes using WebAdvisor.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.490
The first thing you want to do is go to

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.220
the Southwestern College WebAdvisor homepage.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.790
This can be accessed via wedabvisor.swccd.edu or

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:20.299
through the college website, where it is located

00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:24.299
on the bottom right side bar, under "WebAdvisor".

00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:30.269
Now, you're going to want to log in.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.279
Enter the first letters of your first name

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:36.559
and last name followed by your

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:37.749
student ID number.

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.889
If this is your first time logging in,

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:42.309
your password will be your birthday

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.739
in month,day, and year format.

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.739
For example, if you were born September 24th, 1992,

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.739
you would enter "09" for September,

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.099
"24" for the day, and "92" for the year.

00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:02.143
The system will ask you to enter a new password

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:04.543
of your choice upon logging in, and that

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.603
password will be used for your first log in.

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:10.784
I, however, already have a password, so

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:13.514
WebAdvisor will not ask me more than once.

00:01:20.172 --> 00:01:24.172
Once you're logged in, click on the "Student Menu",

00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:28.341
now find the "Registration" header

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.151
and click on "Register for Classes".

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.135
On this screen you will see all

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:34.785
the available registration options plus

00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:37.245
"Drop Classes" and "Manage Your Waitlist".

00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:40.191
For this video, we're going to click on

00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:42.251
"Search and Register for Classes".

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:47.862
The first thing to do on the screen

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:49.242
is to choose a term.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:52.712
In this case, I will choose "Fall 2014".

00:01:52.743 --> 00:01:54.493
But your term may be different.

00:01:54.493 --> 00:01:56.263
You will not be able to register

00:01:56.263 --> 00:01:58.503
unless you choose the correct term.

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:02.205
You can also search based on class beginning

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:05.505
and end dates, meeting times, course titles,

00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:08.118
location of the class, credit or non credit, and

00:02:08.138 --> 00:02:10.138
by the instructor's name.

00:02:10.138 --> 00:02:11.548
For the purposes of this video,

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:14.568
We're only going to use the middle area.

00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:17.236
I want to take Math 100,

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:20.286
English 116 and a philosophy class but,

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:22.396
I'm not sure which philosophy class

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:24.296
I want to take.

00:02:24.296 --> 00:02:25.746
In the subject drop-down menu,

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.258
I will look for math and I will enter

00:02:27.258 --> 00:02:31.518
"100" in the "Course Number".

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:37.784
I will look for English, and in the "Course Number",

00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:41.784
I will put "116".

00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:44.858
Now, philosophy,

00:02:44.858 --> 00:02:48.858
but I will leave the "Course Number" blank.

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.249
These are the list of courses taken from

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.499
the criteria you entered in the previous page.

00:03:00.497 --> 00:03:04.497
They tell you the term, in this case, it should say "Fall 2014",

00:03:05.782 --> 00:03:07.532
the section name and title,

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.249
the location or campus of the class,

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.269
meeting times, and room number,

00:03:12.627 --> 00:03:16.067
the professor, if there are seats available,

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:18.477
and the amount of credits you will receive

00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:21.337
if you take the class.

00:03:21.337 --> 00:03:23.747
Look here under "Status".

00:03:23.816 --> 00:03:26.626
If the class is "open", that means it has

00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:29.246
available seats, and if it is before the

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:31.506
the first day of class, you can register for

00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:33.276
the class immediately.

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:34.786
If it says "waitlist', that means

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:37.266
all the available seats are filled,

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:38.986
and you can still waitlist a class in

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:41.416
case some open up.

00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:42.396
Pay special attention to the

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:43.776
"Location" tab.

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:46.226
Not all classes at Southwestern College

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.676
are at the Chula Vista campus,

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:49.216
and some are online.

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.276
You can also click on the class link

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:52.886
to open up the class information

00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:54.756
in a new window.

00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:56.526
Here you can see the required

00:03:56.526 --> 00:03:58.438
prerequisites for the class and

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:01.148
any additional information.

00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:05.148
English 116 requires English 115, or equivalent.

00:04:05.148 --> 00:04:08.248
And if we look at Math 100, we see it

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:12.248
requires Math 60, or Math 65.

00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:14.373
Be sure to click on the classes you

00:04:14.373 --> 00:04:16.113
are thinking of taking to make sure you

00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:17.633
meet the prerequisites.

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.263
So, when you are ready

00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:21.503
to register for classes,

00:04:21.503 --> 00:04:23.293
click the check-boxes next to

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:24.253
the ones you want.

00:04:24.253 --> 00:04:26.203
Now that I have chosen my classes,

00:04:26.203 --> 00:04:27.253
I'll click the submit button

00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:29.554
at the bottom of the page.

00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:31.494
We are now on the

00:04:31.494 --> 00:04:33.214
Add or Drop Classes screen.

00:04:33.697 --> 00:04:35.657
I'm going to manually select

00:04:35.657 --> 00:04:37.087
"Register" on all the classes

00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:37.777
I selected.

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.347
Once I made sure there are no conflicts,

00:04:39.347 --> 00:04:41.247
I will then click "Submit",

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.220
and that's it!

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.200
If an error message pops up,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.920
and you don't understand,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.770
or WebAdvisor is not letting you

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.680
register, we suggest

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.210
you come to Student Services at

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.800
the Chula Vista campus or

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.600
one of the Higher Education Centers in

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.070
National City, San Ysidro, and Otay Mesa,

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.680
where our staff can walk you through

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.660
the registration process and figure

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.260
out what errors are occuring.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.100
You have five business days to pay

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.240
for the units you are registered for.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.240
Classes at Southwestern College,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.300
cost 46 dollars per unit.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.300
So, a three unit class will cost 138 dollars.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.700
And that is how

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.431
you register using WebAdvisor.

00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:23.701
I hope this video helps,

00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:25.741
and good luck at Southwestern College.
