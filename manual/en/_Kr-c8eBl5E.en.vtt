00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.500
Hey guys! ChrisFix here, and Today I'm gonna show you how to replace an air fuel ratio sensor on a

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.319
2003 Toyota Rav4. You can see here

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.839
We have a check engine light for code P1 one five five (P1155) , And this code indicates a bank two

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.539
sensor one air fuel ratio sensor error.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.639
This is a common problem for Toyota's and Lexus engines typically the heater element in the sensor goes bad

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.720
And I'll show you how to test that before you go out buying a new sensor since they can be expensive.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.549
The process will be the same for any Toyota or Lexus with this 2-liter four-cylinder engine

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.540
So here's our Exhaust Manifold, Where the new sensor screws into you want to make sure the engine is cool because this gets very hot

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.559
And you'll burn yourself. so what you're looking for is bank to sensor one

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.109
This is the sensor right here so the first thing we're gonna

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.389
Do is test the sensor to make sure the sensor is the actual problem to do that? We'll go right over here

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.610
You follow this line you make sure it's for Bank Two Sensor One.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.480
Follow it up press on this tab here, and as you're pressing on this tab you're gonna pull out and

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.390
Then you can see on here

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.720
There's two black wires on top and then a blue and a white on the bottom

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.209
You want to test the two black wires so we have our Ohm meter. I'm gonna set it to 200 ohms

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.249
We'll take our sensor here and again you want to go to the two black wires right there,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.439
Which are gonna be the top of this pigtail here

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.029
Connect each lead of the multimeter to each black prong in the pigtail you can see there's no continuity so the heater circuit is broken.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.459
Let's compare this to the sensor that works

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.740
So here's a brand new sensor

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.390
And I'll show you what it should look like the two black wires are on the top right here.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.989
You just touch one prong and touch the other

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.580
and you can see there is resistance and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.420
Obviously, this is a good sensor because It's a brand new. Now that we verified the sensors bed. Let's replace it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.810
I just got back from the parts store, and we rented this oxygen sensor socket, and it has a special slot

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.089
So you could slide the sensor wire in it you definitely want to use this socket because it'll make the job go smoothly and you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.290
Won't strip the old sensor while you're trying to take it out plus. It'll help for installation of the new sensor

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.509
I'll put a link to a good oxygen sensor socket kit in the description. So be careful working on a hot engine

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.700
All you're gonna. Do is you're gonna get this,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.410
slide the wire in

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.139
Slide that down and get your ratchet on there

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.799
Unfortunately this kit fits a 3/8 ratchet, but my breaker bar is a half inch ratchet so what I'll do is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.070
I'll use a cheater bar. Just put a piece of long tubing over your ratchet

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.780
And twist

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.489
This is really hot once you crack it open. You'll be able to take it off by hand. I have a welders

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.139
Glove you can either let this cool off, Or get in there with your welders glove.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
Just unscrew this all the way now.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.280
Pull that out.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.700
So here's the new Air Fuel Ratio Sensor

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.299
I'll have a link in description to where you can get one cheaper than at the part stores

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.900
As always you check to make sure that the sensor is the same and it looks identical has the same length and everything

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.329
It comes with this anti-seize, which is good. You're just gonna add a little bit of anti-seize right on the threads

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.070
Don't get it on the actual sensor itself

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.690
You don't want that, Just on the threads

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.020
And that'll make it a lot easier to come off if you ever have to replace these again

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300
You don't need a lot of this stuff, Just

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.410
Get it on like that and push it in with your finger

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.519
Just get it in the threads and that looks perfect

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.309
You do not need a lot of this stuff now. Let's go thread it into the hole and tighten it up

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.480
Be careful not to cross thread this make sure it goes in nice and smoothly

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.300
Once you get it threaded in

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.709
Tighten it up all the way. Get your oxygen sensor socket

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.389
And snug it up you don't need to make this super tight you just need to get it real snug.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.610
Good

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.880
And then after we tighten this we're going to just connect the clip right in here that

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.410
snaps in like so

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.770
so we have our new air fuel sensor

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.139
Going up clipped in and now let's delete the codes to check engine light and see if it gets triggered again

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.700
So we have our bank two sensor one code right here

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.350
We're going to delete it

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.850
good

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.850
Now we'll start the engine

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.339
And we'll go for a ride and see if the check engine light comes back on

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.010
After the ride you can see the light didn't come back on so we fixed the problem

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.339
That's how you check and replace an air fuel ratio sensor

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.019
