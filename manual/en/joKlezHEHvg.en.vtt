How do you increase test scores, teaching time, 
and retention?

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.590
For this middle school teacher, it's all about
Conscious Discipline!

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.080
Some of the Conscious Discpline
structures I have in my class is we've

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.290
got jobs, we've got a Wish Well board,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.119
we've got Kindness Hands, and that's been fun
for the kids because

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.740
they really notice each other's kindness.
All they like to do is walk up to

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.439
the board and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.350
slap that little foam hand on there when
they notice that people are being kind

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.680
and I started noticing they point to
each other, like Ohh, I saw you. You

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.670
did something cool.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.040
And somebody who wasn't even
involved in it will walk up and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.760
slap a Kindness Hand on the board.
I've put these Conscious Discipline

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.230
structures in my classroom and we do
Brain Smart Start. We

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.260
breathe at the beginning of class, and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.329
motivational message, and this kind of stuff
and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.890
I sort of have been tracking the time and
I realize

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.600
if I give up that 10 to 12 minutes at
the beginning of class,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.780
than I've got them for the rest of the
class period. We're under time pressures,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.200
all of us are. We've got this
meeting and that meeting and we've got

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.119
all this content to cover, and it seems
really overwhelming,

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.550
but I've taken that 10 or 12 minutes

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.660
in my day to help the kids

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.310
so that they are ready to learn. Now
when

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.979
I've got them, they're mine and I can get
that content to them because we are

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.380
working as a learning community, instead
of a whole bunch of individuals

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.800
who don't see a goal that we work on
together. And

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.500
giving up that little bit of time, it
seems like Oh My Goodness, how are we

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.340
going to fit all this curriculum in,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.670
and we're all frantic, but I got
that time back,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.890
because I'm not managing upset in the
kids.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.910
The kids can begin to manage their own
upset

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.130
with support. 
We're about to take our science CBA.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.360
Remember that's nine weeks. You are
ready. We have prepared.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.709
Okay, so let's just regain our focus so
we are ready to go.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.720
Take your hands, rub them together. As you're rubbing, breathe in,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.080
you're breathing in calm. Shake out that
worry.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.520
 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.170
Breathe in focus.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.450
You got this.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.160
Breathe out concern.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.490
Take those warm hands and put it wherever
 you're feeling that stress. For me,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.600
it's the back of my neck. For some of y'all the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.050
forehead is where you feel stress. Okay,

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.280
bend your neck forward.
Relax a little bit.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.260
Relax those muscles because we feel 
stress there. Bend it back a little bit.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.150
Side to side.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.050
Okay.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.140
Roll the shoulders around a little bit.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.440
Shake it out.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.099
Pick up your pencils and you may begin.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.099
I found out that Conscious
Discipline helps kids

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.860
but what it really helps is me. This is
the first year

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.310
that I've been consistent with using the
Conscious Discipline structures in my

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.690
classroom and have the support of
other staff members on our campus doing

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.379
the same thing.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.930
It's also the first year in my nine years
of teaching

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.540
that I have yet to run out to my car at
the end of the day

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.970
crying, frustrated, and really awful

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.290
to my family members because I am 
more focused

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.970
and I'm now able to get

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.459
the kids to do what they need to do to
be successful.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.849
If mom and dad aren't giving them what they need,
it's got to come from somewhere,

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.030
and it's got to make a difference or

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.150
I'm gonna end up with the issues later
on in society. And that's not worth it to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.590
me.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.480
I'd rather spend my time here and talk
to the kids and teach them what they

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.909
need to do to manage their own upset,

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.970
or to deal with the frustrations that
they feel.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.450
A kid the other day wrote a
note to me.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.950
We were talking about
appreciation,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.489
and he came up, he said, "You helped me
learn how to deal with my anger,

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.430
and no one has ever taught me that before." 
I about fell on the floor.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.520
Those lessons that we teach
kids don't always show up

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.610
at that moment. This is a student I
had last year,

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.120
but he was talking about appreciation in
a different class,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.970
and that made a difference. That's why I'm
here as a teacher

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.139
but now I feel like I've actually got
the skills to give them not just the

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.169
content learning,

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.539
I'm excellent at that, but I can help them
get

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.820
the life skills that help make them to
be a successful kiddo,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.470
and that's more valuable than anything.
