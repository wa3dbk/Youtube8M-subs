00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.310
Alright so today we’re going to replace
shocks on a ’91 Jeep Wrangler.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.430
This will work for any of the YJs.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.430
So we have the wheel already taken off, the
car jacked up, and you can see the shocks

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.430
are right there.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.930
We got the bolts at the top, bolts on the
bottom.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.820
This one is rusted out so we’re going to
switch them.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.860
So as I’m trying to take off the top bolt,
it’s a 14 millimeter and as I spin it you

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.579
can see that the top part of the shock is
spinning as well.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.230
So what I do is I just grab a pair… and
this is alright since we’re just going to

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.530
throw these shocks away anyway…I’m just
going to grab onto the bar like that with

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.440
a pair of channel locks and keep on twisting
that wrench.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.510
The cool thing I like about this wrench is
it’s got a little ratchet head in there

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.969
so I don’t have to keep on adjusting it,
it just always spins on its own.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.050
I’ll put a link down at the bottom of the
video so you guys can see how much they cost.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.359
I got them off Amazon.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.010
They are pretty solid little tools.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.990
Anyway, so I’m just going to get rid of
that bolt.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.941
Ok so when you’re installing the new shocks
you just put the bolt in the bottom there.

00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:15.741
And usually the shocks come bound in some
kind of way so they don’t stretch out – it’s

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.350
easier to ship and stuff.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.990
I put the rubber washer and the metal washer
on it and now we just have to extend it up

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.229
into the housing there.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.979
So what I’m going to do is I’m going to
cut that and it will extend on its own and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.039
I just kind of have to guide it in there.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.329
It’s a lot easier to lift with two hands,
I’ll tell you that.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.640
And then by its own means it will go right
up into the top there.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.380
And then I’ll put the other washer on top
with the little groove there, so it will go

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.420
down inside the metal housing.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.960
And then the nut goes on top of that.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.120
So once I tighten it all down, that’s how
you install the shocks.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.960
Alright so the shocks come with kind of a
metal sleeve that goes over the metal part

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.250
of it so dust and water and stuff doesn’t
go down inside of that.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.250
It is kind of a good idea to have them.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.270
They’re not super super important but, you
know, it’s worth having.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.910
You can get them for just a couple bucks on
Amazon.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.530
I’ll put a link in the description so you
can get some of those if that’s what you

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.530
want.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.530
That’s it.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.020
The bottom nut on the shock was a 19 millimeter
by the way.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.790
And yeah, if you have any questions leave
them in the comments.
