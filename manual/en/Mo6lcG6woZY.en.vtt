00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:15.810
(Music and sound of space shuttle liftoff)

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.400
Elmo: How do you spell your name?

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.720
Astronaut Leland Melvin: What? My name?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.040
Elmo: Melvin. Is your last name Melvin?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.580
Melvin: You know, people usually confuse it and call me Melvin first instead of Leland.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.460
Elmo: Wow.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.910
Melvin: You know, Melvin's a first name, Leland Melvin, you know.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.050
Elmo: But Elmo's just Elmo. (Laughs)

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.980
Melvin: Maybe I'll just be Leland then.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.990
Elmo: Cool! Well . . . Elmo's wearing a launch, isn't this a launch and entry suit?

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.280
Melvin: Yes, it's an LES suit and we call it .

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.770
Elmo: That's what you call it? An LES?

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.370
Melvin: LES, launch and entry suit. LES. And it's orange.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.980
Elmo: Well, when do you, when do astronauts wear launch and entry suits?

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.860
Melvin: We wear the launch and entry suits, Elmo, when we launch . . .

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.610
Elmo: I see, when you launch, when you go up.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.600
Melvin: Yeah, we go up, and then when we enter, come back home.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.680
Elmo: Oh.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.650
Melvin: And the suit can be pressurized, can be blown up a little bit.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.920
Elmo: Why?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.930
Melvin: Because if you lose pressure in the shuttle, then you'll have pressure in the suit.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.210
Elmo: Oh!

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.960
Melvin: Because you want to be under pressure.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.200
Elmo: Why?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.620
Melvin: Because. It's a good thing.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.660
Elmo: Oh, Elmo hopes so.  Don't you call this something else?

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.580
Melvin: It's also called a pumpkin suit. Wonder why? Why is it called a pumpkin suit?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.860
Elmo: Because it looks like something you'd wear during Halloween?

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.090
Melvin: Exactly. It's orange and black.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.700
Elmo: No! Elmo was just kidding!

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.710
Melvin: No, you're right. Elmo's smart.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.580
Elmo: That's cool!

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.600
Melvin: Yeah, we wear this. We have a helmet that goes on,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.080
that keeps everything pressurized and we come home in this and we launch in this.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.350
Elmo: Wow

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.000
Melvin: You look really good in it, too.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.040
Elmo: Elmo loves the collar. Collar is really cool.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.330
Melvin: The puffy collar?

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.080
Elmo: Yeah.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.890
Melvin: Yeah, it's pretty cool. You look cool in it Elmo.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.700
Elmo: Thanks for teaching Elmo about these really cool suits.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.020
Melvin: Yeah, no problem.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.620
Elmo: When do you wear the blue one?

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.640
Melvin: You wear the blue suit when you come to talk to people like Elmo, and . . .

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.950
Elmo: So that's the formal wear.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.110
Melvin: Yeah, that's our formal wear. And when you're flying on the NASA T-38 jet,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.660
which are high performance jets. So if, if something caught on fire, this does not burn.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.450
It has something called Nomax in it.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.560
Elmo: Nomax?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.790
Melvin: Nomax. So it keeps it from burning, so your skin won't burn.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.110
Elmo: What about the white one? When do you wear the white one?

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.540
Melvin: The white one, those are when you're doing a spacewalk.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.720
Elmo: Really? When you're outside of a spaceship?

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.960
Melvin: When you're floating in space and you're actually outside the spaceship.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.880
And that suit is pressurized, too. And you can float around, you can work.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.690
The elbows are hinged, so you can move your elbows around.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.260
Elmo: And you have air conditioning in that?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.580
Melvin: You have air conditioning, you have heating.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.640
You have water, you can actually drink water in there.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.680
Elmo: Where?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.790
Melvin: It's its own little spacesuit, or your own spaceship.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.300
Elmo: Well Mr. Leland, how do you use the bathroom in there?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.650
Melvin: You use a diaper.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.660
Elmo: Really?

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.470
Melvin: Yeah, I mean, you've got to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.480
Elmo: It's just like being a baby!

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.410
Melvin: A baby astronaut!

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.280
Elmo: Yes!

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.770
Melvin: That's right, a baby astronaut!

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.390
Elmo: Thank you for teaching Elmo about these wonderful suits. Thank you.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.400
Melvin: You're welcome, Elmo.
