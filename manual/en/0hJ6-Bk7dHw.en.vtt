How to Start a Lemonade Stand. It’s hot
out. You like money. How about starting a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.090
lemonade stand! You will need An adult to
help Lemonade A serving pitcher Ice and an

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.470
ice bucket A sign A table A tablecloth Paper
cups Some money to make change A box for your

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.940
money and a big smile. Step 1. Before you
make your lemonade, make a business plan.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.910
Will you have to spend any money on supplies?
If you’re going to spend $5 of your own

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.890
money on ingredients, for example, you’ll
need to make more than $5 to make a profit,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.010
or the money you get to keep. Now you can
decide how much you want to charge per cup

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.000
to make sure you earn that. Remember, if you’re
setting up shop with other people, you’ll

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.860
have to split the money you make with them!
Step 2. Pick the perfect day, time, and location

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.070
for your lemonade stand. Think about where
and when the largest number of thirsty people

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.729
would walk by your stand. Think hot days at
playgrounds and fairs, or during little league

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.420
games. Of course your front yard is just fine,
too. Step 3. Make your lemonade sign using

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.580
some cardboard or foam core and a large, bold
marker. Write “Lemonade for Sale” with

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.490
the price clearly visible. You can add a drawing
of lemons or a glass of lemonade if you want.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.509
The bigger and flashier your sign, the more
people will notice it. Step 4. While “walk

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.460
in” customers are usually the bulk of lemonade
stand business, you might want to let your

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.200
friends and family know what you’re up to.
You can either make flyers or do an email

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.609
blast announcing the time, location, and date
of your grand opening. Step 5. Make your lemonade

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.700
ahead of time. You can make it from a mix,
but serving homemade lemonade will make your

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.520
stand special and might help you sell more.
Either way, have a grown-up cut up a lemon

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.749
so you can float the slices in your pitcher.
For 1 gallon of homemade lemonade, ask an

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:02.659
adult to juice 6 lemons, then mix that with
1½ cups of sugar and 2 quarts of water and

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.270
ice. Step 6. Now comes the fun part&amp;#8212;drink
it! You’ve got to make sure it tastes good,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.549
but don’t drink too much or you’ll have
to mix up some more. Step 7. Pour the lemonade

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.670
into a large thermos or several pitchers and
refrigerate it until you’re ready to start

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.099
selling. Step 8. Set up your table. You can
use a folding table or some milk crates with

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.500
boards on top. On top of this set a clean
tablecloth and lots of paper cups. Hang or

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.629
prop up your sign. Make sure everything looks
clean&amp;#8212;the cups, table, pitcher, and

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.459
even you! Step 9. Depending on what you’re
charging, you’ll want to either have lots

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.489
of quarters or single dollar bills to make
it easy to make change for your customers.

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.689
Keep the money safe and organized in some
kind of box on the table. If there are other

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.580
stands in your area, try to make yours stand
out. Put the words “Gourmet” or “Secret

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.870
Recipe” on your sign. Step 10. Store extra
ice and lemonade in separate containers under

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.459
the table so you won’t have to run back
to the kitchen, and fill a see-through serving

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.930
pitcher with some ice, lemonade, and cut lemons.
Don’t set out cups already filled with lemonade.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.360
Flies will swarm around them and it will look
gross. Step 11. Smile and wait for customers.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.829
People like to buy from kids that smile. Did
you know In 2003, a 6-year-old boy started

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.140
a lemonade stand to raise money for breast
cancer research. Today “Max’s Lemonade

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.939
Stand” is a nonprofit that’s made over
$30,000.
