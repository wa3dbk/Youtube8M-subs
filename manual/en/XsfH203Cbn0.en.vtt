00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.013
I'm on my second cup of coffee, which means it's time to talk about some books.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.280
I actually filmed a haul last week

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.700
or the week before. I don't remember.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.960
and then I obtained quite a bit more books, so I decided that it was a good reason to 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.420
refilm and talk about books that I got in the mail 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.114
that are awesome and to start off with, I got these two

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:25.434
books of awkward postcards from Quirk Books

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:29.360
and this one is Hugs and Misses: Thirty postcards of awkward romance.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.560
This one is Stars and Swipes: 30 postcards of Awkward Americana

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.720
And this one has some funny stuff like on the front. It's basically all silhouette looking stuff

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.640
and some awesome backgrounds, but this one says

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.200
"Would you like to make out?" "Sherwood."

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.120
This one is the Americana one and the first one in there is "I'm the king of the New World!"

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.240
with the silhouette of George Washington

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.800
my favorite is this one. It says "Miss Susan B Anthony... the B stands for Badass."

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.580
Moving on to other books that I obtained this month

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.681
or the past couple of weeks or so...

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.241
I got Jackaby by William Ritter

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:06.960
and I started reading this as an ARC a while back

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.000
but my book club is reading this book

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.440
and so it was a good reason to actually buy a copy and support my local book store

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.920
and all that. but also this is kind of like Sherlock meets Doctor Who, supposedly.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.020
There's like a little bit of Fantasy element to it, but like the main char-- not the main character

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.020
the narrator is kind of like his assistant, but the basically... 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.980
There's a guy who acts a lot like Benedict Cumberbatch's version of Sherlock.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.840
I think this one is an indie thing... No it's from Scholastic.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.040
This is When My Heart was Wicked by Tricia Stirling

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.600
and I just thought that this was a really cool cover

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.480
and basically it involves birds and trees.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.260
Good to know.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.180
This one is kinda swoony... It's from Swoon Reads.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.154
And it is the Boy Next Door by Katie Van Ark

00:01:59.154 --> 00:02:00.836
Yes, I know how to say things.

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:04.740
This one comes out in February, so I've quite a while to read this

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.420
but this looks adorable. it involves some ice skating stuff and 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.400
yes. That's adorable.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.920
Every once in a while you've gotta pick up something a little heavier

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.016
and this one is called The Last Time we say Goodbye

00:02:14.016 --> 00:02:15.134
and it's by Cynthia Hand

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.616
and I've heard good things about her other books

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.560
the Unearthly Trilogy, so she's done some stuff that is good

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.620
so I look forward to reading this

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.783
and I book that didn't expect to be at book club but OMG this is awesome

00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:30.383
Love and Other Theories by Alexis Bass

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:32.352
and I've heard good things about this

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.700
it's ... new boy in town kind of stuff

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.540
main character doesn't want to fall in love

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.160
and so you know that always works out well, right?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.333
I don't think I've shown this in a book haul or anything like that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.800
but this is Jane Austen Cover to Cover by Margaret C Sullivan

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.200
and it's basically curating all of her covers

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.180
I received this from Quirk books... It's huge, it's gigantic

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.010
It's all the covers and stuff -- uh oh my gosh I'm feel like I'm gonna break this

00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.641
It's got all sorts of oh yeah... that's-- that's classy

00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.560
oh i want some of these special ones

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.200
but oh goodnes.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.000
oh goodness.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.060
a couple of weeks a go I went to a book signing that

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.500
involved Stephanie Perkins, David Levithan and Jennifer E Smith

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.040
and Jennifer E Smith doesn't have a story in here

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.787
but this is My True Love Gave to Me which was editied by Stephanie Perkins

00:03:22.787 --> 00:03:25.000
and she has a story in there and there's a bunch of other

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.879
people that you might recognize like Holly Black, 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.934
Ally Carter,Matt De La Pena, Gayle Forman, Jenny Han, David Levithan, Kelly Link, 

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:36.920
Myra MCEntire, Stephanie Perkins, Rainbow Rowell, Lainey Taylor, and Kiersten White

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.280
Most of these people write in the real world sometimes

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.000
sometimes. but some of these do more like Fantasyish or Paranormal 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.460
or other types of stuff, so it's nice that it's ... you know... 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.280
I look forward to reading this.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.380
That's how you do it, folks!

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.356
When you can't think of anything to say, just say, "I look forward to reading this."

00:03:58.356 --> 00:04:02.300
I got this hunkin' beast... this is In the Afterlight by Alexandra Bracken 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.060
and this is the third and final book in the Darkest Minds trilogy.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.069
I feel like I keep picking up big books... Right now I'm reading 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.617
Brazen by Katherine Longshore which is a Historical Fiction,

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:14.916
and it's ... it's pretty -- it's about the same size as this.

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:17.401
And then in the mail from Disney, I got Rogue Wave

00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:20.800
by Jennifer Donnelly and this is the second book after Deep Blue

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.140
by the same author.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.900
and basically, it's about mermaids from different parts of the world

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.620
and they get together and fight a big evil.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.100
That was quite a bit of books, but I think we got into in a record time.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.960
Tell me if you're excited about any of these books or if you have gotten some book recently

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.300
that you're super excited... Let me know about it so you can share the love in the comments

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.600
and people can recommendation yes.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.760
So that's all folks. Have a great day and keep reading.
