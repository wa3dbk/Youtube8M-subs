00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.810
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another Minecraft Tutorial. In this one,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.260
I'm going to show you how to locate the spawn chunks in your Minecraft world.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.780
For those of you who do not know what the spawn chunks are,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.660
they are a group of 12 by 12 chunks that are always loaded wherever you go in your world.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.410
This is the same for both servers and singleplayer worlds, but first let me explain to you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.100
why you might want to find them.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.049
Because the spawn chunks are always loaded, they are ideal for things you would want running all the time.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.940
For example, an Iron Farm or a redstone contraption.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.460
The Spawn Chunks will also replace the items coming through from the end portal,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.120
so you might want to build a storage system here to collect those items.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.760
And if you are following this video in an attempt to mark out your spawn chunks,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.800
make sure you watch the whole video first so you can plan out everything you will need to do this.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.560
Finding the spawn chunks isn't too difficult and there are several ways to find them

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.380
and we will go over them one by one.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.180
First of all, you can use an external program like Amidst.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.460
If you enter your seed it will show you the coordinates of your base with the home icon,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.180
but this may be considered a little bit cheaty which Is fine because there are two ways to find it in-game.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.360
You can craft a compass which will always point to the center of your spawn chunks,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.260
just follow the needle of the compass until it changes direction very quickly.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.989
When this happens you are either at or very close to the central point, so move around for a moment

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.920
And it will become obvious where the center is.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.140
When you have figured it out, make a marker to remember where this location is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.900
This is a fantastic tool. However, if you are a long way way,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.780
it may be quicker to kill yourself. If you have slept in a bed,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.709
then you will need to remove the bed for the game to respawn you in the spawn chunks.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.069
When you do respawn, it may not be exactly in the middle

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.720
so it would be a good idea to get a compass and mark the center like before.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.500
If you're not sure how far away from the spawn chunks you are, press F3 and bring up the debug screen.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.799
Spawn chunks are usually located around

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.970
x0 and z0, so if you're several thousand blocks away from it,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.660
it might not be worth the journey using a compass and quicker to kill yourself, but the choice is yours!

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.180
So, once you have made it to the spawn chunks

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.540
we need to be able to map out where they are as the total size of them is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.180
192 blocks by 192

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.860
For this you are going to need a lot of disposable items to throw on the ground.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.240
We are going to do this in order to let the items inside the spawn chunks despawn.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.960
As the chunks are always loaded, the items will despawn after five minutes.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.660
So go to your marker where the compass said is the center,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.990
then walk away from it in one direction for about 64 blocks.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.760
Once you have got this far, keep walking, but also throw cobblestone on the ground.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.080
You will need to do this for another 64 blocks or so.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.040
And then you will need to do one of two things. If you're in single-player,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.100
you will need to go through a nether portal.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.680
When you are in the nether, only the spawn chunks and the nether will be loaded

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.420
So, you can wait five minutes and all the items in the spawn chunks will despawn. If you are on a server,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.040
you can do this too, or simply log out, as the server will still be running.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.720
But if there are other players online, make sure they are not in the same area.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.160
Then, after five minutes, you can log back in and the items in the spawn chunks will have despawned.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.020
When you return to the overworld, you should see where your trail of items cuts off.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.160
This is because the items in the unloaded chunks would not despawn.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.020
Press F3 and check to see if you're on a chunk border. If it is,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.700
then you have successfully found one border of your spawn chunks. You should mark this with some blocks,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.460
so you don't forget where it is.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.440
You can now walk exactly 192 blocks back across your spawn chunks to the opposite side.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.740
I'd recommend re-doing the test in this area, just to make sure that it is correct.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.940
Then, make a marker on this side as well. Once you have done this, return to the middle,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.220
and repeat the test on the opposite axis.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.840
It shouldn't take you too long and once finished,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.600
you have successfully marked out the borders of the 12 by 12 chunk area.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.060
So, this is optional, but what I'd recommend doing next is expanding those borders until you have a big square

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.960
showing where the edges of your spawn chunks are.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.580
And so, there are a couple more things I would like to mention about this.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.380
First of all, you can move the spawn chunks using the "/setworldspawn" command.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.860
If you do this, then you will still need to re-do the Item Despawning Test to find out the borders.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.800
However, the center will be exactly where you typed the command.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.880
And the very center of the spawn chunks is where the compass points too.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.880
This is the exact place where items will come through from the end portal.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.460
Hostile mobs will instantly despawn in the spawn chunks, if the player is not in range by 128 blocks.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.180
This means it's not ideal for mob farms, just because it's loaded.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.920
Passive mobs won't spawn at all unless the player is in range by 240 blocks,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.160
and plants do not grow in the spawn chunks unless a player is there. The same thing goes for grass spreading

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.100
and leaves decaying from trees.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.820
Also, ice will not melt either.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.620
And that, my friends is everything you need to know to find the spawn chunks in your world.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.880
