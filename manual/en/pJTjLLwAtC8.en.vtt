00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.560
Hello

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.480
how to start..

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.980
This is the 'Alternative Longboards' model: Chauma

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.260
Chauma is a true freestyle and freeride board

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.320
top mount

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.660
long 39.4"

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.400
wide 9.3"

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.520
with a radial concave, excellent for freeride

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.780
 but not too aggressive for freestyle and cruising

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.860
 It has the characteristic of being twin tip

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.900
so the direction of the board won't be difficult any longer!

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.960
Rocker profile lowers the center of gravity for more control

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.060
 especially in slides

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.613
with

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.940
or without hands on the ground

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.960
3d kicktail

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.520
anatomical nose and tail

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.120
for the fixed foot during slide and tricks

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.980
wheels flares

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640
you can carve how much you want,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.540
the wheels will never touch the board (wheelbite)

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.100
and also give you a reference point on your Chauma

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.360
for never having to look down

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.600
one of the most amazing things about it

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.574
is the construction:

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.180
the layers are pressed together in a high temperature,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.240
so as to distribute the resin evenly,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.380
 and eliminate the excesses.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.720
layers that ..ยง#"?!ยฃ..

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.680
you will never have problem of delaminations

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.540
furthermore there is a layer of Kevlar

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
under the nose and the tail to increase pop

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.160
All along the board

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.820
there is a strip of carbon fiber

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.200
that makes the board rigid
 and stiff.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.140
 This strip also suppresses vibration

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.260
(VIBRATIONS)

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.140
and increases the reactivity

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.700
We want to talk about the graphics?

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.680
 do not talk about.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.560
 For anyone who cares, I've got a good news:

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.140
the graphics is covered by a layer of Scratch-resistant polymer,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.140
and so will last long.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.620
 For other curiosities, insights 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.780
or any other questions..
