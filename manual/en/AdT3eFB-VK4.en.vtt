00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.680
There are numerous things that result in a
patient needing to have heart surgery today

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.290
and that would include a problem with their
coronary arteries, blockages of their coronary

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.279
arteries; then you have a huge category that's
actually growing now where the valves either

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.599
leak or they're too tight. The third category
although less common but still exists is where

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.670
patients have had congenital heart problems
that they were born with and now they've

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.599
grown into adulthood either having had them
diagnosed late in adulthood or knowing it

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.710
was there but now needing to have something
done about it. A fourth category would be

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.010
electrical problems with the heart in which
there would be some conductivity problems

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.270
or rapid heart beat problem that would result
in needing to have specialized studies done

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.610
and then possible interventions. Traditionally,
everybody knows about open heart surgery through

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.350
what we call a sternotomy where people quote
have "their chest cracked" which is the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.359
typical terminology for that but basically
it's dividing the breast bone, going through

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.780
the middle of the sternum to get access to
the heart. And this has served physicians

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.020
and patients very well for 30 or 40 years.
We have become more and more comfortable with

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.819
doing the same types of procedures through
smaller incisions. So we have begun a fairly

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:21.160
comprehensive program where every patient
that comes to our center is looked at initially

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.830
for a minimally invasive approach, a small
incision approach, or a robotic approach;

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.849
one of the two. And if they are candidates
for that then that's how we do them. If

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.560
we can't do it that way then of course we
offer them and provide them the traditional

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.550
approach but every patient first is considered
for a small incision and less invasive surgery.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.239
I do think it's important today as we go
forward that patients understand that as we

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:50.420
have emerging technologies that are rapidly
coming at us it's important to choose a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.979
hospital that has a team that is looking at
that, the team is highly specialized and super

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.289
specialized in the area of coronary bypass
surgery or minimally invasive valve surgery.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.000
All those are teams of experts that share
their particular area of expertise. I bring

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.270
something to the table as a surgeon, the cardiologist
brings something to the table as a surgeon,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.140
and then at the end of the day we have the
best plan for the patient with the current

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.250
and emerging technologies. Probably only 15-20%
of centers in the country are routinely doing

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.250
successful minimally invasive valve surgery
either aortic or mitral, or closing holes

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.140
in the heart or doing electrical work. We
understand now that high volumes equate very

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.530
much to high quality. The centers that are
doing high volumes and the centers that are

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.860
developing this team approach and a comprehensive
commitment to minimally invasive surgery and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.630
robotic surgery utilizing those types of techniques
are the ones that are getting the best outcomes.
