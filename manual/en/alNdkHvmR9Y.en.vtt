Hi! I'm Adam. We're here at the Bird All American Bar and Grill in beautiful downtown Mount Pleasant, Michigan. On behalf of Expert Village, we're going to mix up some drinks today, pour some shots, and have some fun. This next drink is a holiday favorite. It's Spiced Egg Nog. The ingredients for the Spiced Egg Nog are egg nog, spiced rum, and your glass here. We're going to go ahead and throw some ince the glass. Do a hot of spiced rum and some egg nog. We'll toss it in the blender. That is your Spiced Holiday Egg Nog.
