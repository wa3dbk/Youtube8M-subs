Hello, this is Sandra with the DisneyCarToys
Channel and today we are going to do

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.599
something super exciting, I have been waiting
a long time to do these.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.599
I am going to

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.550
make Elsa an ugly Christmas sweater.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.650
And if you would like to follow along with
me,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.680
all you’ll need is a few cans of Play Doh,
A Play Doh roller, a Play Doh knife and a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.680
hard surface.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.800
I can’t wait to make Elsa’s ugly Christmas
sweater, so lets get started.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
All you need to do is roll out some red Play
Doh.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.450
And for this Christmas sweater for

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.780
the Elsa Barbie doll you’ll need to cut
out three different pieces of Play Doh.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.780
One

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.440
piece which I am cutting out right now, a
rectangular piece, for the top.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.440
And then

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.390
later we will cut out two pieces for sleeves.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.210
Once you have that big rectangular piece

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.460
cut out just wrap it around Elsa’s body.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.890
You can see I made it a little bit long, so
let

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.780
me pull back her hair.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.320
And I will just cut off the extra Play Doh
here.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.450
It’s a little bit on

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.450
this side.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.650
And I will have to cut off a little bit on
this side too.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.860
And we are one third of

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.119
the way done making the actual sweater part
of the outfit now.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.590
So lets move on by

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.770
cutting out the sleeves, to be kind of thicker
on one end and thinner on the other.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.469
Just because Elsa’s shoulders are obviously
thinner then her wrist.

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:36.689
And the pieces

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.789
almost look like a triangle with the top cut
off.

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.159
This is actually my first long sleeve

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.259
Play Doh Barbie outfit.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.600
It’s not as hard as I thought it would be.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.719
All you need to do is

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.859
attach the sleeve, and its kind of easier
to start at the shoulder.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:53.859
And then work your

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.119
way down, you juts find of punch together
the end of the Play Doh.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.119
Just on the under

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.680
side of her arms like this, kind of press
it to her body, for it to stick well.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.680
And I made

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.610
the sleeves a little long, but luckily it’s
Play Doh so just cut off the excess Play Doh.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.730
And tada a beautiful sleeve.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.159
And we will do the other side, just attach
it at her

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.159
shoulder again.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.129
You watch to make sure the Play Doh on sleeve
attaches to the top

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.260
part of the sweater.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.329
Pinch in the sleeve at the arms and its long
again have to cut this

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.329
part off.

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.530
This actually kind of reminds me the birds
building the dress for Cinderella

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.040
in that movie.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.250
Elsa’s sweater actually looks really pretty
at this part, perfect for a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.709
Christmas party.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.220
But we want an ugly Christmas sweater, so
lets start making the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.569
ugly stuff.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.650
Elsa’s ugly Christmas sweater is going to
have a Christmas tree design,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.769
which I am hoping will be pretty easy.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.209
Now your normal ugly Christmas sweaters do

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.300
have kind of the puffy soft 3D look.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.930
And so a good way to get that with Play Doh,
is

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.659
by doing more a 3D build with the Play Doh.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.109
So I am going to roll out a bazillion little

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.800
green balls here.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.519
Almost looks like peas actually, we’ll make
all these little balls then

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.989
put them together to make a nice Christmas
tree shape.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.610
And now for the fun part!

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.400
The decorating, so I am going to smoosh each
one of these green balls here into her

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.400
sweater.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.430
It really really looks like peas, but we will
do one row at a time, it’s like

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.670
building a pyramid.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.930
Its starting to look a little more like a
Christmas tree, can you

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.290
see it?

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.560
Just a few more, there we go.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.510
That looks pretty good but maybe a little
to

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.430
small let me add a couple more, on the side.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.439
You want the Christmas tree to be nice

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.280
and thick and noticeable.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.230
This really looks like a real life ugly Christmas
sweater.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.989
Now I am going to add a tiny little yellow
ball on the top to be the Christmas tree

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.040
topper, like a star.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.010
And we are going to need a tree stump too,
so just add a tiny

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.090
brown rectangle.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.900
We are now done with the Christmas tree design,
but I want to roll

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.540
out some green Play Doh.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.500
Just to make some decorative cufflinks on
the sweater,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.140
cufflinks are going to dress up the sweater
a little bit.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.330
And make it even more ugly.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.140
And that’s what we are aiming for right?

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.550
All you have to do it wrap it around Elsa’s

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.280
wrist and connect the two ends of the Play
Doh, and kind of push it to the red

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.460
sweater, it will help hold it in place.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.780
Well there you have it Elsa is ready for

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.600
Christmas with her hideously ugly Christmas
sweater.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.240
I am pretty proud of myself,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.210
this turned out a lot better then I thought
it would.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.700
Wow Elsa, your ugly Christmas

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.590
sweater is so ugly its cool.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.590
Oh thanks.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.200
Oh I wish in had an ugly Christmas sweater.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200
Oh

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.420
well maybe DisneyCarToys can make one for
you too.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.760

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.750
