00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.860
The bonds that hold atoms together in compounds
are called intramolecular forces. There are

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.890
3 main types of intramolecular forces: ionic
bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.140
This video will focus on ionic bonds. Covalent
bonds and Metallic bonds will be featured

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.890
in their own videos.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.210
An ionic bond is formed from the electrostatic
attraction between two oppositely charged

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:42.150
ions - one positive, the cation, and one negative,
the anion. The cation is usually a metal,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.140
and the anion is usually a nonmetal. A familiar
example is the bond forming table salt, NaCl.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.200
Sodium ions, Na+, are strongly attracted to
chloride ions, Cl-. When they are joined together

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.860
by an ionic bond, their opposite charges cancel,
and they form a compound that is electrically

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.770
neutral. Remember this when you write the
formula for any ionic compound - the total

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.140
positive charges of the cations have to equal
the total negative charges of the anions,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.470
to form a neutral ionic compound.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.049
You can write the formation of an ionic bond
using Lewis-dot-structures. In the reaction

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:38.929
2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl , for every formula
unit of NaCl, one sodium atom loses an electron,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.549
and one chlorine atom gains an electron. We
can write the reaction like this:

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:52.540
An atom of sodium, which has 1 valence electron,
gives that electron to an atom of Chlorine,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.290
which has 7 valence electrons. Now the sodium
ion has the same electron configuration as

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.290
the noble gas Neon. By losing that extra electron,
it has a full octet of valence electrons.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.139
The chloride ion, by gaining an electron,
now has the same electron configuration as

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:19.459
the noble gas Argon. The oppositely charged
ions, which are strongly attracted to each

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.459
other, arrange to form a lattice in 3 dimensions,
where each sodium ion is surrounded by 6 chloride

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.639
ions, and each chloride ion is surrounded
by 6 sodium ions.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:37.829
Let’s do another example, and use electron
dot structures to determine the chemical formula

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:44.829
of the ionic compound formed when potassium
and oxygen react. Potassium is a metal that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.010
has 1 valence electron. Oxygen is a nonmetal
that has 6 valence electrons. A potassium

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.709
atom will lose one electron and will become
a cation with a 1+ charge, and so will have

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.290
a filled valence shell. In order for oxygen
to have a filled valence shell, it has to

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.710
take on 2 electrons. The oxygen anion has
a 2- charge. In order to balance that negative

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.930
2 charge, it has to bond with 2 potassium
cations, which are each 1+. So the formula

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.319
of the ionic compound is K2O, potassium oxide.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.319
Ionic bonds, like those in NaCl, are often
easily disrupted in water - the ions separate

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.790
and are surrounded by water molecules. We
call this a “solvation shell” or “hydration

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.349
shell.” Notice that the water molecules
are arranged so the partial negative oxygens

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.719
in water are oriented towards the positive
sodium ions, and the partial positive hydrogens

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:57.619
in water are pointed towards negative chloride
ions. Because the ions can move freely when

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:04.260
dissolved in water, aqueous solutions of ionic
compounds can conduct electricity.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.389
Not ALL ionic bonds are soluble in water.
This isn’t something you can figure out

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:16.030
just looking at the periodic table - solubility
is determined by experimentation. You may

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.020
have seen a table of “solubility rules”
- that’s a summary of experimental results.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.970
Ionic compounds involving nitrates, for instance,
are all soluble in water. Most chlorides (like

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.069
NaCl), are soluble in water, but there are
some exceptions, which include the chloride

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:40.340
compounds involving silver, mercury, and lead.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.360
Despite often falling apart in water, Ionic
bonds are considered strong bonds, as are

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.360
covalent bonds. We’ll compare their relative
strengths in another video.
