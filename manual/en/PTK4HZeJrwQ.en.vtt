00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.320
GYPSY LORE

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.080
The passionate struggle of an old gypsy  
for his daughter,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.100
his dignity in life,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.480
and for purification in death.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.000
A tale about forgiving,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.440
and the power of love.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.100
My daughter, too, had a horse...

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.260
but also a trumpet.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.220
At least show me a picture of her!

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.040
But I don't have one!

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.320
What kind of a fucking gypsy are you?

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.100
You're right, gypsy.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.160
Let us in, John...

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.120
As long as I live,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.280
you won't settle in here with your tales, 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.160
and this whole god-damn fucking gypsy shit!

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.160
And take your fucking angels with you!

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.420
Show me...!

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.160
Come on, old fart... stab me!

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.060
The old gypsy put on his favourite clothes,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.120
settled on the doorstep,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.280
and waited for the bird of death...

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.360
...but the bird avoided him...

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.480
...perhaps it caught a breath of his sins

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.200
that cannot be absolved.
