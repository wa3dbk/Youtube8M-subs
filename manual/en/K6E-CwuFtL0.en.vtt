Welcome back to Passionate 4 Angels my name is Aron and on today's episode like to

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.580
continue our series

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.370
on breeding angelfish and today's episode I
would like to talk about how to obtain a

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.670
breeding pair angels

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.670
so stay tuned we'll be right back

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.760
in our last episode

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.310
we showed you how to set up a breeding
Tank for angelfish

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.940
if you missed that episode

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.140
we recommend that you click the button
below before continuing

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.660
Now that your Aquarium has been set up and
cycled and ready for fish our next step is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.579
to get a pair of angelfish.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.030
There are commonly two ways for this to happen the
first method is to openly purchase

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.179
a proven pair of  angels in this manner you
have an instant pair of Angelfish

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.429
this can be very expensive to get
started we recommend that you check with

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.229
local area breeders before ordering online.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.879
The second method is cheaper but takes a lot longer and  is our preferred method

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.119
for obtaining pairs. Start with six to
10 angel fish

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:08.700
they can be any size. Feed them well, keep
their water clean, and in a minimum of 55

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.080
gallon tank or larger

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.770
and wait for them to grow. Normally after
eight to 10 months

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.009
your Angelfish approach maturity and
will start to notice to fish hovering over

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.850
over one side and have started cleaning and area of your the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.369
aquarium

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.409
Normally it's about the time when they
become very territorial and aggressive

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.810
forcing the remaining angelfish to the
other side of the aquarum

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.220
watch carefully for the next few days
make sure that you can easily identify

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.869
the two adult fish

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.939
if you notice that they have laid eggs
anywhere in your aquarium

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.610
then you have a proven pair now it's
time to move them to their

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120
own home congratulations

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.550
