00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.920
You may be thinking I really want to install
new cabinets in my kitchen, but I don't want

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.090
to pay someone to do it for me.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.530
Well stick around and we'll show you how to
install those new cabinets yourself.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.930
When your new cabinets arrive, arrange them
in the order they'll be installed.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.140
This will allow you to find the right cabinet
when you need it.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.970
Remove the old countertop and cabinets.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.310
For older homes it's a good time to repair
uneven walls and add adequate insulation.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.250
If you want to also add new flooring, now
is the best time to do it while the cabinets

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.280
are out.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.240
Also, prime and paint the walls before the
new cabinets go in.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.350
Start installing your new cabinets by finding
the high point of your floor.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.260
A long straight edge or laser level will help
you do this.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.600
From that point measure up thirty four and
a half inches, and make a mark.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.560
This indicates the top of the base cabinets.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.480
Make a second horizontal line at fifty four
inches from the high point on the floor.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.420
This is the bottom height of the wall cabinet.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.640
If the finished floor is not yet installed,
remember to add the thickness of the floor

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.070
material to the height of the lines on the
wall.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.710
Now locate and mark all the wall studs.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.400
Make sure there is at least one stud behind
each center cabinet and two studs behind end

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.850
cabinets.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.130
In most kitchens it's best to begin by installing
the wall cabinets.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.890
That way there won't be any base cabinets
to work around and you can more easily use

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.479
a step ladder.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.400
Remove the cabinet doors, and starting in
the corner, measure from the corner of the

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.600
wall to the first wall stud.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.470
Transfer this measurement to the back of the
cabinet and mark.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.420
Drill three one eighth inch holes along this
line for thirty inch tall cabinets.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.740
Place the cabinet up to the fifty four inch
reference line on the wall.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.820
Screw the cabinet into place, but don't tighten
the screws all the way just yet.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.380
Make sure it's level in all directions.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.689
It's critical that the first cabinet is square
because it could otherwise throw off the entire

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.229
installation.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.739
This will allow you to make any minor adjustments
after you install the rest of the wall cabinets.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.730
Now place the next cabinet up to the reference
line on the wall.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.050
Align the bottom and sides with the other
cabinet, and attach it to the wall, but don't

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.849
tighten all the way.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.029
Clamp the face frames of the two cabinets
together making sure they are flush on the

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.900
front and bottom.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.829
Drill a nine sixty fourths inch hole into
the first face frame.

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.599
Then change to a one eighth inch bit and drill
into the second face frame.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.349
This will allow the second face frame to be
drawn up tight when they are screwed together.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.519
Two number eight two and a half inch screws
are recommended for each thirty inch tall

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.299
wall cabinet.

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.310
Make sure the wall cabinets are straight and
level.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.340
Then screw in the wall screws all the way.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.019
Install only one wall cabinet at a time, making
sure each is square and level.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.370
For base and tall cabinet installation also
start in the corner.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.540
Mount the corner cabinet to the wall using
the line marked at thirty four and a half

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.309
inches as a guide.

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:15.969
You may need shims to bring the cabinet up
to the line.

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:20.379
Make sure it is level and square before attaching
it to the wall.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.769
If the corner cabinet is a lazy suzan type,
a one by two inch wood strip must be place

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.589
at the thirty four and a half inch line to
help support the

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:29.709
counter top.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.069
Be sure the corner cabinet is square to both
walls so there is a true ninety degree corner

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.859
and a straight line for the remaining cabinets.

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.640
Align the face frames, clamp them, and screw
them together the same as the wall cabinets.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.439
Add shims if there are gaps between the wall
and the back of the cabinet or between the

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.709
floor and the bottom of the cabinet.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.580
A level placed across the front and back of
the base cabinets will tell you if the cabinets

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.299
are straight.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.139
Attach the base cabinets to the wall in the
same way as the wall cabinets.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:06.239
Double check all cabinets to make sure they
are straight and level.

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.000
Now that the wall and base cabinets have been
installed, it's time to add the doors, drawers,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.669
and shelves.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.510
If the doors do not line up vertically, the
hinges can be adjusted for depth, height,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.630
and side clearance with a screwdriver.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.540
Other finishing touches include the installation
of the countertop, the toe kick to cover up

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.200
gaps between the base cabinets, the installation
of

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.260
handles and pulls, and moldings and trim.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.230
