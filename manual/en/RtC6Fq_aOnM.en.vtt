Hi my name is Greg Goldberg we are here at
Minetti's Italian Specialties in Wayne, PA

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.590
on behalf of Expert Village and today we are
cooking linguine aglio E olio. First thing

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.509
we need to do is to start heating our water
up, we are going to turn that up to high and

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:28.090
we are going to turn our oil on to medium
and get both of those nice and hot. Just when

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.440
your water gets hot is starts to steam and
boil that is when you need to salt it. Putting

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.239
salt in the water is going to actually going
to raise the boiling temperature which means

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.370
it is going to take a little longer to boil
so that is why you want to get it when it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.199
is already boiling. And now that, that is
boiling we are just going to drop our linguine

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:57.789
in 1 pound right in. After about 3 minutes
you want to give your pasta a good stir that

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:04.629
is the half way point it will take about 3-4
more minutes to cook. We are going to start

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.781
over here with our oil, we have on a plate
here everything we just chopped up and we

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:25.220
are just going to put it right in the pan.
We are going to add some seasoning salt, black

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:34.920
pepper,
a little bit of red pepper flake not to much

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:46.100
unless you like it spicy and a ton of garlic.
Turn the flame up a little cause we introduce

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.750
a lot of liquid a lot of water and watery
things so that is going to cool our oil up

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:05.630
a lot. We are just going to give that a little
toss through. After about 5 minutes we are

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.950
going to remove this from the heat, set it
over there and our pasta is done. Let's check

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:22.370
it, we are going to pull a little out, bring
it over here, we know these noodles are done

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.430
cause if we cut them and look in the inside
I don't know if you can see but they are fully

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.550
cooked throughout there is just the tinniest
snap in the middle when you bite. Not a crunch

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.590
just a little bit of resistant and that is
al dente that is a perfectly done noodle.
