&gt;&gt;Jen Lee: Hello, I'm Jennifer and I work
on Google search quality team.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.531
A really common question we hear from new
site owners is, “How do I get my site to

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:11.430
show up in Google search results?”

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.100
Well, the good news is, Google has likely
already found your new content.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.590
You can easily determine if Google is displaying
your site in our search results by doing what

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.640
we call a site search.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.360
To do this, from a Google search bar, type
the word site colon and your domain name without

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.579
any spaces.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.610
If something comes up then congrats!

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.720
You're in Google search results.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.560
If there are fewer pages displaying than what
you have in your site, make sure we can find

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.770
and crawl your content and that it delivers
value to users.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.710
It could also be that we just haven't discovered
those pages yet.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.730
In which case, your best bet is to be patient.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.270
We'll likely pick up on the change soon.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.900
If you'd like to expedite this process, you
can add your content to Google through our

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.610
tool at Google.com/submityourcontent.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.150
If, on the other hand, nothing at all is coming
up in your site search, there could be a number

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.810
of things going on.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.330
One of the more common causes of this is your
site could be blocking our crawlers by what's

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.470
called a robots.txt file.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.900
You can read more about this at our help center
resources.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.090
If you've recently purchased your domain,
it might not be performing well because it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.760
formally contained spamming or problematic
content.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.740
If you believe this could be the case, you'll
want to log in to web master tools, add and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.530
verify your new site, then file a reconsideration
request noting this information.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.590
If your site is in our search results but
pages aren't performing as well as you'd like,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.880
keep in mind that Google discovers new pages
on your site just as users do; by following

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.060
links from page to page.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.670
That means, the easier you make it for users
to navigate your site, the easier it is for

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.980
Google to discover its content.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.990
Adding a navigational bar or a menu to your
site is a popular and clean way to improve

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.439
site navigation.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.730
You can always find more information by checking
out our user forums and our extensive help

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.470
center materials.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.470
Thanks for watching.
