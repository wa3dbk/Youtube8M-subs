Hi there, and welcome back to hair with Hollie.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.380
Okay, so today we are going to be doing a
Kate Middleton braided chignon, lovely, lovely

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:15.919
for formal occasions and also great for work,
if you want something a little bit different.

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:16.919
[Music]

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.150
Okay, so this is look is all about sections.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.310
So once you get your sectioning right, the
rest of the look will be doddle.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.382
So, this look does not really have a parting
per say, but just a little bit of an indent

00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:30.950
at the front, kind of using in around the
arch of your brow.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.850
With that in mind, keep that indent there
and you pull the hair back.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.809
The first section we are going to do is we
are going to split the hair, over the crane

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.300
all the way in half, keeping it quite close,
just in front of the ear as your mark.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.120
We are going to pin this section out of the
way, and we are going to come back to it in

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.120
a few minutes.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.780
So you are going to want to do two section
on this side of the head, kind of just behind

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.780
the ear.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.930
Just in and around, behind the ear, just to
the start of the nape of the neck.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.399
That is one section there.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.680
I am going to get the exact same section on
the other side.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.330
And again, pin those out of the way, and we
are going to come back to them shortly.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.810
The remaining section that you are left with
in the middle of the hair, this is going to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.570
be your bun, so this is going to be the basis
of the bun at the back of the head.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.781
So again, just twist this out of the way.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.010
So, with all of these sections out of the
way we are going to start work on the top

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.030
half of the head.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.130
So the first thing that you are going to want
to do, section this bit off again, just about

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.280
a two inch kind of band running along the
face, so from ear to ear grab and arrange

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.320
a two inch section, section that off from
the rest of the hair, and that is going to

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.360
cover all of our back.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.390
Finally, the bit of hair that we are left
with, this is going to form the volume of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.390
the style.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.710
So, working from the roots, start running
your comb down along the hair shaft working

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.240
back towards the scalp.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.270
So you can see already that there is a little
bit of volume there.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.150
Just keep going, work into the sections until
you are happy with the amount of volume that

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.150
you have.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.770
And then pin in place, using curly grips.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.850
You are looking for a nice little fan shape.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.230
I am going to finish that off with a little
bit of hair spray.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.120
What we are going to do now is we are going
to take the top section down and join it over

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.430
this little bouffant section to complete the
front of our hair.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.120
So if you want to give this a little backing
at the roots to make it stand up just to the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.800
front of your face go on ahead.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.730
So, once you are happy with the front sections
of your hair just start drawing them back

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.040
nice and easy and pinning them in place where
your pins are from the bouffant.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.480
Once you are happy with the top section, give
it a quick spritz of hairspray, and then we

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.319
will move on the the bottom bits.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.020
So we are going to turn these into a braid,
and it is going to make quite a nice feature

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.500
at the back of the head.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.670
So, just take your section of hair and then
just braid.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.932
So, when you get to the bottom of this braid,
just secure it with a curvy grip and do the

00:02:54.932 --> 00:02:58.060
exact same thing to the other side.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.430
Finally, we are going to get working on this
back section here and turn it into our bun.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.340
What we are going to do is leave a big enough
section of hair from underneath, over the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.240
shoulder, and just going to roll it up, towards
the head, and pin in place

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.410
So once you have anchored your first roller
there you can play around with this, you know,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.790
give it a nice and kind of fan shape.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:34.370
So do the exact same thing to the other bob
and the other piece of hair.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:44.040
I am going to take this flat piece of hair,
and pull it over the hair.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:53.020
And then just wrap the remaining hair in under,
and in to the back of the bun.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:01.310
So easy breezy, just take the braid, and just
place right across the top.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.360
And then, with the two little bits that you
have left, just keep wrapping them around

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.580
until there is no more braid left.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.130
And then just pin it into place, using another
curvy gripper.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.810
And finally, just finish the look off with
a good spritz of hairspray.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.780
So there you have it, a gorgeous Kate Middleton
braided chignon.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.690
If you like this video, do give the thumbs
up, and, because I know how much you love

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.020
the Greek goddess hair, next week I am going
to be doing a curly Greek up-do, so tune in

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.020
for that.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.020
See you then guys!

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.021
