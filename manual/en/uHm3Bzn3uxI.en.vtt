00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.830
Hi! I’m Katie and I’m here on behalf of
expertvillage.com to talk with you about accidentals.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:19.039
It’s also important to be aware of accidentals
that occur within the piece of music, so in

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:27.089
this piece of example the key signature contains
no sharps or flats but that does not mean

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:37.201
that a composer can’t throw in sharps or
flats. So here for example we see a sharp

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:46.730
a written sharp, here we see a written flat,
now an important rule to remember is that

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:56.090
any sharp of flat that appears in a measure
here for example A-flat carries through the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:05.509
measure. Let’s look down here for a better
example, looking at this measure the notes

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:15.520
between two vertical lines we see an A-sharp
appear, as soon as that first A-sharp appears

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.810
we know that every other A that appears in
the measure will also be a sharp, so this

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.970
would actually be an A-sharp and an A-sharp
even though the sharp is only written the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:39.380
first time. Now if for example a composer
does not want a sharp or flat to carry to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.640
the measure he or she might write a natural
sign to remind a reader of his intentions,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.770
so here for example we have an A-flat and
an A-natural and all that natural means is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.170
that there is no flat and there’s no sharp
it’s just a regular A so here the composer

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.709
had to put in a natural so that the reader
knows not to make this a flat because the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:19.079
A before it was a flat. Other times a composer
might write a natural just as a reminder,

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:28.340
here for example we see a C-sharp and even
though a new measure has begun so we know

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.060
this C will be a regular one, the composer
helps you out by writing a natural to remind

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.749
you that this is just a plain C and that’s
everything you need to know about accidentals.
