Hi everyone!

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.600
It's Jeff with Home Repair Tutor, and today
I'm going to share with you how to unclog

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.679
a bathtub drain the right way so that you
don't have to deal with soap scum building

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.510
up on the sides of the bathtub and water will
actually drain down into the pipes.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.930
So let's get to it.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:29.790
Okay, you want to place some paper towel over
the bathtub drain because you're going to

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.239
remove the screws from the overflow valve
here, okay?

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.110
The last thing you need is for a screw to
fall down the drain.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.969
Once you remove the screws, you can pull out
the lever and the plunger, okay?

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.699
Now sometimes the plunger has hair all over
it.

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.749
In this case, it does not, which means that
the clog is down in the drain.

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.269
Now you have to remove the screen.

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:05.591
If there isn't hair on your lever, what you
can do is reach down in.

00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:10.910
That means that the clog's a little bit higher
up in the pipe.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.610
Fish down in there with needle nose pliers.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.540
As you can see, I'm just pulling out tons
and tons of hair, okay?

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.380
All right.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.130
So all this hair was down in where this tub
shoe is.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.300
And the tub shoe runs to the front of the
bathtub and then down into a P Trap or a drum

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.610
trap.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.330
Hopefully though, it doesn't make it that
far.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.920
You just yank it out.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:49.640
Now you could also use a special tub removal
tool to remove this drain so that you can

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.450
fish down in there a little bit better.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.120
But I didn't have to do that today which is
a good thing.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.360
Obviously you want to discard all the old
hair into a bag.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.900
Get a few other paper towels to clean this
up.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.620
Before you put anything back all together,
always test to see if water drains properly.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.590
Run the water for about a minute or two.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:36.510
If you really want to be safe, run it for
5 minutes and see if it drains.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.030
Looks a lot better.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.130
Totally draining.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.030
And that's how you save $70 - $90 on a plumber's
call.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.610
But I'll show you how to put everything back
together.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.340
Again, so what you do is just put your screen
back in place.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.920
Put your screw back down in.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920
Tighten it.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.990
I would never use a drill or an impact driver
to tighten the screw.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.860
You could break it, and you could break the
tub show as well.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.240
You want to take your overflow valve and the
plunger on the end of it.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.670
Make sure there's no hair, grime in there.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.319
Just clean that off if you can, okay, with
toilet paperâ€”which I obviously did notâ€”because

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.530
the grime that's in it, through it, and whatnot,
sometimes that catches hair and all kinds

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.630
of muck and yucky stuff.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.560
Stick the plunger down into the waste pipe,
the overflow pipe, okay?

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.840
Oh, before I do that, I wanted to show you
that there are two holes here, okay, where

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.770
these screws go that hold the trim kit in
place.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.010
And there's also a washer here that butts
up against the back of your bathtub.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.209
Just make sure that that washer's in halfway
decent shape 'cause that's what prevents water.

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.181
If water would ever overflow into this overflow
valve, you want it to go down that pipe and

00:03:56.181 --> 00:04:00.340
not behind the bathtub, and the washer prevents
that from happening.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.670
So line up the screw by hand with the hole
in the overflow pipe in the back.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.520
Just tighten it a little bit.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.740
Oops!

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:20.799
Take the other screw and do the same thing.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.690
Don't over-tighten this too much.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.670
Just enough to make sure that that seal is
compressed.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.700
And that's how you unclog a bathtub the right
way.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.199
So I hope that this video helped you out.
