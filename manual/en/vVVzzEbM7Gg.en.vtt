00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.930
These are the blades. These are the main blades.
They're relatively flat bottom high camber

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.869
blades. So that means they produce a lot of
lift at relatively low speeds. Now, the Icarus

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:21.310
Royal has a maximum head speed, which is the
rotation of the main rotor head, of one thousand

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.110
six hundred and fifty. These blades need to
be balanced. They need to be balanced both

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.640
in and of themselves, finding out where the
center of gravity is, and then as a pair to

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.270
make sure that they both weight exactly the
same. Now you also have to balance the tail

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:47.460
blades. Now this is a simple jig that I made
to balance the blades on my coaxial helicopter

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.579
that you've probably seen, and it works fine
for this too. It's just a threaded rod with

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:03.449
a collar and a nut on one end, and I can lay
the jig over the side of a desk or table like

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.350
this, and you can see the blades rotating.
Now as you can see, these are pretty well

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.890
balanced. When they stop, they'll pretty much
be horizontal, which is a good thing. That's

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.960
really what you want. If one blades was significantly
heavier than the other, than what you'd want

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.860
to do is take some clear cellophane tape and
then on the flat surface of the blade--and

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.730
if you look at the blade, you'll see there's
a curved upper surface, and a flat surface.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.310
Now, sometimes they're symmetrical. I believe
that these tail blades are symmetrical. So,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.031
you want to put a piece of tape on the surface
of the blade towards the tip--on these, it

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:54.220
doesn't, the static balance is as important
as the big rotor blades, and tell the high

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.771
blade became heavier, and you wind up with
something like this. Now the larger main blades

00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:07.050
can be a little bit more difficult to balance.
You need to find the static balance point,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.200
which is the center of gravity of the single
blade. And the best way to do that is using

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.120
something like this architect's scale that
you can balance this blade on until you get

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.920
it--until you find the balance point on this
blade. Now, when you find this balance point,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.530
it's good to put a couple of very small reference
marks so that when you do the larger dynamic

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.230
balancing of the blade, and you need to add
tape or material to one blade or the other,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.819
you want to place it at that center of gravity.
Okay, you can see here this blade is perfectly

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.310
balanced on there--it's not one side or the
other. So, I'm going to take a very small

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.130
marking pen and put a dot on the leading edge
and on the trailing edge, so I know when I

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.290
got to dynamically balance these blades where
to add the tape to make it, that blade a little

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.970
heavier if it's the light blade. Balancing
is a really important step, and you don't

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.290
want to skip this. Now there are some really
nice balancing jigs out there available for

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.520
rotor blades, and if you have an extra thirty-five,
forty bucks, I would say by all means go buy

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.420
one. Another thing you can do, and I'm going
to show you kind of a low cost method of doing

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.980
this, you can bolt the blades together, probably
with the mounting hardware. Make sure the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.270
leading edges are parallel--they're not going
to match, but they'll be parallel. And then

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.310
you can suspend this whole rig between two
kitchen glasses, and what that does is it

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.640
gives you a very low friction bearing. Now
you can see that this blade--this blade over

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.959
here--is a little heavier. So what I'm going
to do is I'm going to add some tape to the

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:10.910
high blade at the balancing point, the center
of gravity of this blade, until it comes down

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:20.000
and balances. I've added clear cellophane
tape to the flat side of the high blade at

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.169
the center of gravity until it balances nice
and even like this.
