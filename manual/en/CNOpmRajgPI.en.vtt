00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.859
be there everyone this is David with
rocks

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.980
fast dot com where we only sell
american-made products

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.219
and I just wanted to talk a little bit
about

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.349
the dekorra backflow

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.140
protection covers that we sell

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.699
through our website here these things
are awesome

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.660
there they're they're really durable
there may not have a real

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.369
fek polymer I am yet

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.489
what's what's really nice about him is
there there

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.899
a lot more attractive then than the
traditional

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.620
backflow enclosures I am to get a real
nice shape to him

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.739
and they really blend in well with with

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.629
residential and commercial landscaping
I'm

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.210
and these these are actually becoming
really popular backflow devices

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.210
a lot of folks have these in their yard
you're probably familiar with him there

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.359
it's basically just copper piping that's
coming out of the ground

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.530
and its candidates usually shaped take a
you I guess he called a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.560
it upside down you an arch can give and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.729
in the middle of the arch would be the
the backflow

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.509
protection device there's there's what's
as earn

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.189
eyes RPC are busy there's all different
types and manufactures up these but

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.310
they're basically AM valve

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.060
and it it provides yet

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.170
check valve that it provides protection
for your water supply

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.009
I'm basically it it doesn't allow water
to flow back

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.990
into your well sophie had something and
your whole was a cab

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.630
you know insect spray or something and
is a potential where the water can get

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.310
sucked back in your well but

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.890
the backflow the their backflow
prevention unit prevents that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.159
so long story short is they're becoming
more popular a lot of the building codes

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.770
are requiring these now

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.329
and as a result allowed people want to
cover them up

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.629
because they're pretty ugly to look at
and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.580
they tend to be out you know on the yard
you really want kids running around by

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.209
Arman

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.540
I'm they're they're targeted by thieves
because they're metal copper

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.620
I am you know they use it for scrap
metal so a lot of people just want to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.390
cover mop

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.000
outta sight outta mind type thing and
provide some security for

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.720
so we've got these backflow enclosures

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.060
made by Dekorra in in the USA

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.780
and I am ones were gonna touch and here
are the class to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.129
is there we we call on the XL size there
there the larger size have the two

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.930
and they're available in three different
ASSE classifications

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.819
by bat what that means is class 1 is

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.220
its insulated are 13 and he did

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.739
I'm or one other one other things with
these backflow

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.610
prevention devices see you don't wanna
freeze

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.810
if they do bad things happen and the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.860
you know they can the seals and then
we'll

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.650
well blowout pretty easy and they're
very expensive to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.269
to repair and replace so if you live in
a cold climate you want to be sure that

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.319
that you're protecting these with
insulation and or heat

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.260
and this class one here includes the the
insulation

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.620
in our sewer an electric heating cord

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.659
which is just plugs into a standard
outlet

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.349
the class to hear just includes the
insulation

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.830
are 13 insulation in the class 3a is
just the case there's no insulation

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.200
and there's no heat included here we'll
just go into the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.470
the Class one here and as you can see
it's

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.920
heated and insulated I'm I was want to
show you the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.110
the breakdown size this is really
important

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.569
before you order any of these anything
closer any the rocks as well for that

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.060
matter you want to be sure

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.480
you measure carefully measure the back
for the HIF

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.620
the length to be this way and in the
with

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.629
I am the you wanna make sure that

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.880
edit at the given HIF this covers gonna
be

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.019
long enough you can see how can a cash
flows in were here

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.850
I just want to be sure that the with
there's going to be enough with you on a

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.520
measure that actual backflow device it's
usually the widest part of the whole

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.290
unit

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.370
and make sure that the that this can be
wide enough for their

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.360
to real popular mistake the people
forget and the end up with the cover

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.780
this

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.850
too small and that's never a good thing

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.900
so be sure to measure carefully

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.639
arm I just wanted to show you here

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.270
see if have better for a look at this
one

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.530
quickly these have a they're there to
two piece design

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.400
so this base piece here would go down
first

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.500
and in the cover would lift and and to
it

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.630
at is filter media here for air flowing
are so so water can escape

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.130
there's a dual locking had lacked a abs

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.370
so you can't relax and the sticky P
secure

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.539
and also here you can see where you are
you can stay this into the ground urs

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.699
threw it into a concrete slab or
something along those lines

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.300
so the Zoe is a very versatile I you
know they've got all the bells and

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.810
whistles and like I said the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.539
they really look nice they've got a real
nice

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.419
Kevin green you look to me when you when
you're up close to home

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.440
surely here me on that one of the
smaller ones here

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.009
and its see this one has some other

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.270
other photos here as

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.270
one me good this

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.280
but the actual technology that is used

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.490
by I'm by the court to manufacture the
Iraq covers

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.280
its a similar technologies used for the
specs alone closures

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.780
surely here the agency that Canada and
aggregated look

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.500
its get a real nice finish to it and
it's really this is real ficken

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.259
durable to Sri a real quality

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.319
back from closure and as I said before
they they really can to blend in well

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.350
with the with the surroundings and and
look nice

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.889
so if you have a backflow enclosure that
needs a it is because bird

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.900
we've got him here again racks faster
can

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.990
these are very very at economically
priced specially considered air

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.160
if you look at what else is out there
home these are these are a great deal

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.650
does

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.120
this price includes shipping so objects
racks fast at camp or we only sell

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.500
american-made products

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.210
and that's about all for today I
appreciate you sitting in

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.150
and have a great day
