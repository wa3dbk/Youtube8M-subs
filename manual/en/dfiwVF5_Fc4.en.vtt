Hi there! Lindsay here, the Frugal Crafter
with a super quick tip for you today, and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.150
it's because I botched this technique in
my art journal video this week, so what I

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.710
have here is a report cover, or actually
page divided, you could buy the dollar

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.070
store. They have like a pack of five and
they're just these transparent sheets

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.119
of plastic that you'd use in your in
your notebooks and they come with like a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.510
little tab and I cut that off. Cut this so
it's eight-and-a-half by eleven, and then

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.160
what you do is you print on your
computer what you want to have

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.399
for wording on your journal page because
you know, you can't stick this in your

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.719
printer not unless you want to remove a
page. So you need to print it backwards

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.649
and I tried this technique earlier and
it worked fine when I was practicing,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.520
then when I had my actual journal I was
working on I completely botched it.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.149
And it was smudging and smearing and it
was just a nightmare, so I thought I'd

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.750
show you a better way and
also I was using like the back of a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.510
label sheet, like kind of a release sheet but you know, you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.369
might get on the back of stickers or labels or mine was

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.909
from easy mount, and so I couldn't
even see where it was going, and I was

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.460
smearing it because it was moving on me,
and also it kind of starts to dry

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.299
after a while, so with a plastic sheet
you've got a much longer time you can

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.580
work with ink or leave it before
you press it down. So hopefully this is

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.430
all transferred pretty well. I'm gonna
peek under there. Yes, look at that.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:41.220
So I can lift this up, yep, that's transfered. So I did this upside

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.619
down, of course I did. I did it so
this would be right side up  for you and of

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.170
course I put it on upside down. So
that says "dream, believe, do, repeat" and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.590
it's just a way that you can get your quotes
or your lettering on your art journal

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.729
page if you want to use something you've
printed off the computer. So there.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.479
Quick tip so when you do print it, you
need to reverse it so the way to do that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.259
is to set up here whatever you
want in you know, OpenOffice or

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.060
Microsoft Word, whatever you want to do.
To print reverse instead of just

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.209
clicking the little print icon
so I'll just print whatever you have, you

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.769
need to go under file click print, then
click properties, then click advanced and

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.830
then there be they'll be like a there be
a mirror image but they'll be a usually

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.970
like a will say mirror image and on or
off or they may be another little box

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.549
you check to make it mirror image, but
you kind of have to tell the computer to

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.849
do that. It's not going to do it on its
own, so my ink is still wet there,

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.569
so we'll want to give it plenty of
time to dry, or if I'm feeling very brave,

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.760
I could give it a little spritz of ink
and actually let the color become darker.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.410
So why not? Let me go grab my ink. We'll try that,
we'll see how it looks. This might be a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.530
terrible mistake, but I'm going to try it
anyway, because I'm kind of curious.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.299
Alright so I'm just gonna give it a very
light spritz, and it's kind of activating

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.000
that ink there, you don't want to go too
crazy, because I don't want to make

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.060
a mess. But anyways
that's the the ink technique. I could

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.790
actually even kind of go over there, yep,
with my little Judikins color

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.630
shaper, and I can fill in so it's not so
pixelated, not so dotty,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.260
I guess, but you know it's
just that kind of a fun technique. You're

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.739
probably not going to get the most
perfect of results, but it's

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.849
artsy and fun, and just what you need in
your art journal, so I messed up the

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.930
technique in my big long mixed-media fun
video. Actually I had to shoot the video

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.190
twice this week because I had it and it
was going so well, and it's like last 20

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.919
seconds of the video and I was doing the
this technique last and it

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.430
didn't work, and I made a big smudgy mess
and I felt so sorry for myself, because

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.349
the page was coming along so nicely.
But that happens sometimes and you know

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.680
what? What are you gonna do, just gonna
laugh about it. I need a little

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.139
period in the end of that. So there you
have it,

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.400
easy peasy. I will show you.This is
the page now that's upside down in my

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.760
journal, it's gonna bug me, not too bad. But that's the

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.070
page I messed up on, so what I did after,
and I'll show you the full page, and my

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.270
full mix media fun journal. I just went
over it with a marker. What else

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.580
you gonna do? So there you have it.
Thank you so much for watching! Please

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.420
give me a
thumbs up if you liked this tip,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.640
subscribe, and until next time, happy
crafting.
