What up FAM, is your boy Cristian Barberena so today I'm going to be showing you

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:11.090
"How to factory unlock your iPhone for AT&amp;T" so let's get started Vamos

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.259
okay you guys so the first thing we need
to do is make sure that we qualify to

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.249
unlock our iPhone so

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.310
select your internet browser which in
this case I will be using safari

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.340
and on your search bar put ATT dot COM (att.com/deviceunlock)

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.929
forward slash

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.359
device unlock

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.450
and press ENTER

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.410
and don't worry I will be posting a link on my video description

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.299
make sure to read the following

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:41.640
and if you qualify

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.420
our next step

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.199
will be to acknowledge the terms

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.150
in the small box select agreed

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.540
once we do that this page will come up

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.670
and it will give us some options

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.650
in this case I will be selecting current
customer

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.110
now you can your basic information

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.759
to get the IMEI from your iPhone 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.180
* (star) #06#

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030
or you can go to SETTINGS

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.310
select GENERAL

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.630
select ABOUT

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.939
scroll down and you will see the IMEI

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.240
if you have a lot of applications

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.120
then you can also scroll all the way to
the left

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.860
and start typing

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.570
"settings" it will be the first

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.680
on your list

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.680
once you fill out your personal
information select submit

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.600
you will get that an email confirmation from
AT&amp;T  and you will have to wait about seven

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.850
business days

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.500
for an email approval that would look like this

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.500
the next step is to sync your iPhone

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.720
we will do two scenarios the first
one

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.000
is using iCloud

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.759
go to settings select iCloud

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.129
make sure everything you will need is turn ON

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.549
and select storage and backed up

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.650
make sure iCloud back up is turn ON

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.159
select ok

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.689
select back up now

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.619
the second option is buy plug in your iPhone to your computer using the usb

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:29.579
cable

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.559
open iTunes

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:38.109
and once your iPhone is display under devices go head and select sync on the

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.339
bottom right of your screen

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.279
this could take a few minutes

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.029
once is sync 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:51.499
select "RESTORE" if it ask you to "back up" the iPhone select "Don't back up" since we just did 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:53.669

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:58.319
and select restore

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.019
