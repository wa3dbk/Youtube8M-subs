00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:25.740
Spiders. Deep in the forest. You might just
come across a creepy crawly Spider.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:38.210
Spiders can be found all over the world. From
Timbuktu to Uluru.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:57.870
Clever spiders can make silk. Which they use
to spin elaborate spider webs. Spider webs

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:11.070
are great for catching a spider’s dinner.
Blowing gently in the wind, unsuspecting flies

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:29.960
get caught in the spider webs. The spider
then wraps the fly or other prey up with silk.That

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.140
way the spider can eat the prey later. Some
spiders use venom to like a snake, to paralyse

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.140
there pray.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:42.240
But most spiders are harmless to humans. Did
you know? Spiders are arachnids not insects.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.880
Insects have 6 legs, 3 body parts and antennae.
While Spiders have 8 legs, 2 body parts and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.159
no antennae. They can have up to 8 eyes too,
but they still don’t have very good eyesight.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:12.350
Daddy long legs have really long legs. And
some spiders are brilliant and white. Spiders

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:33.640
can lay unto 1000 eggs. That’s a lot of
babies when they hatch, isn’t it?
