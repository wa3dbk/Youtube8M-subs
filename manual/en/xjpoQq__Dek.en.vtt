Hey YouTube, it's Brad from Fairview Mall
in Toronto, Canada.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.939
I'm here to talk more about the invisibleSHIELD
Glass.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.480
It's our new tempered glass screen premium
screen protector.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.869
It's absolutely amazing and today I'm going
to show you the difference between the HTC

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.609
One, Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Galaxy Note
3, iPhone 4, and iPhone 5.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.349
I'm going to show you the different cuts and
how they all differ from each other.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.100
For example, we'll start with the Samsung
Galaxy S4, you'll notice it's closed around

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.173
the button at the bottom, but it is left open
at the top for all the Samsung sensors.

00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:45.173
The edges are rounded.

00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:46.399
Very, very smooth.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.289
It reduces fingerprints and scratches.

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.339
Fantastic!

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.359
The difference between the Samsung ones and
the iPhone ones is that they're actually sealed

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:55.359
at the top and precision cut around the speaker.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.699
So just a hole cut out for the speaker and
home button.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.620
I'm going to show you a bit more close up
here in a bit.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.620
So here's the box.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.860
It states on the box "Advanced Clarity, Ultra-Smooth
Surface, Easy Installation, and Lifetime Warranty."

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.240
It's one of the only tempered glass screen
protectors with a life-time guarantee.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.790
There are a couple of other companies out
there but it's really convenient when you

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.720
have a ZAGG location near you, you can just
pop by and they'll professionally install

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.140
a new one on for you.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:36.860
I'm going to open up the box and show you
what's inside.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.590
So inside you have a piece of paper to register
your warranty.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.590
If you buy it online you'll actually want
to go and register your warranty.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.710
If you go into a ZAGG kiosk you don't even
need to register your warranty because you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.610
can bring it back to the kiosk and they'll
happily exchange it for you.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.789
So it comes with a wet wipe, a microfibre
cloth to clean your device and make sure it's

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.789
really clean.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.130
If you want to see an installation video and
see how to properly install the Glass we have

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.439
another video in our channel so just check
out our channel and you can find the video

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.439
there.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.410
And of course you have the invisibleSHIELD
Glass with instructions on how to install

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.410
it.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.410
Again, check out my installation video.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.590
I show you a few cool tips to ensure no dust
and a perfect installation.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.960
That's all that comes in the packaging.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.030
Here I'm going to show you all the different
close ups of all the phones.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.660
This is the iPhone 4.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.900
You can see that it's closed around the camera
and notice the extremely rounded edges.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.410
This is what makes the ZAGG glass a lot different
than the average tempered glass screen protector.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.200
Here's the iPhone 5.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:48.570
A little harder to see because it's a white
phone, but that's what makes it so awesome.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.450
And the Samsung Galaxy S4.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.940
Notice it is left open at the top for all
the Samsung sensors.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.960
But it's precision cut around the button.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.090
Again, with rounded edges.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.510
And here's the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.310
Again, left open at the top for the sensors.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:20.150
And finally, the HTC One, a very basic rectangle
with rounded edges.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.900
We make one for the new HTC One M8 as well.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.270
That is now available.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.300
