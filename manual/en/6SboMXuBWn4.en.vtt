00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.940
Here we're standing in front of little
bit different kind of compost.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.330
This is what I call "leaf mold". And I learned
about leaf

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.740
mold as a student at Michigan State
University years and years ago.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.590
And leaf mold is something that I use for my perennials.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.239
And it starts really with leaves
that were collected last fall,

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.120
and then I put these leaves into a
compost bin and I usually

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.410
collect them in a plastic bag or a paper
bag,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.150
and then I layer the compost piles. So I put a bag of leaves on

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.059
and then I put a little of last year's compost on the top of that,

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.420
and then another bag of leaves, and then more compost. And so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.199
in the springtime these leaves are really not

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.460
broken down yet. They're starting to be broken down, but they're not quite there yet.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.940
Now, throughout the summer this compost

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.979
will turn into a light, fluffy

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.310
material that, in the fall I simply

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.460
side dress or put over-the-top of my
perennials

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.100
when I cut them back, and so it's a wonderful
addition to help improve the soil of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.430
a perennial garden.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.090
It's something that I think gardeners really need to do more with because it does

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.240
use a waste product and leaves, and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.650
helps to improve the soil at the same
time. It also hopes to reduce

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.830
the amount of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.080
material going into landfills. So this is a
little different kind of composting.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.530
Today we've really talked about different
compost systems.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.900
And I hope that if you've haven't composted in the
past that maybe you'll try it in the future.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.820
Here's a different system

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.530
for a bin for composting. We're over at a neighbor's compost pile and here you can see

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.869
that it was constructed a frame

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.880
with some mesh cloth

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.570
hardware cloth or some light mesh hardware cloth, and you can see the beginnings of a compost pile

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.200
in here. Bill looks like you use lots of grass seeds, and I can also see

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.120
some remnants of coffee grounds and eggshells and other things from the kitchen in here.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.330
So this a young compost pile, but it's a
different example of a system that

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.640
you can use. There's hundreds of different things
that people can use at home to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.040
construct their active compost piles all the way from

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.330
pallets to a wood frame to what I used in my

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.900
compost pile.
