00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.900
All these voices in my head...

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.680
Trying to get back to me...

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.740
But it's too late. My heart... is already too far.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.800
It is wild.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.140
All these voices that want to force me...

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.040
Force me to do...

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.300
Going against who I am...

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.200
Against my liberties, my goals...

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.740
They whisper in my ear...

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.300
Continuously...

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.120
That I have to be wise...

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.580
That I should stand straight...

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.020
Not move too much...

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.220
That I have to stay here...

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.180
Safe...

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180
But my heart is stubborn.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.320
They want to catch up with it.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.120
Entertain it. Turn it away from what's good.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.460
They say that it will make him happier.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.480
They will close his eyes.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.940
Will make him see what's right.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.680
But my heart doesn't understand it...

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.660
It is wild.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.240
It has understood that it was free long ago.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.780
That you just have to admit it.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.660
To know it.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.000
My heart is an animal.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.600
No...

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600
Do not let these voices poison you.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.060
By all of those who say the opposite.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.160
The naysayers... the one who despise...

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.360
My heart doesn't hear them...

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.520
It is wild.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.100
It wants to get away from all this fakery.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400
It understood that words are magic

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.020
and that movements are the masters.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 It understood how to grow with them,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.360
and use them as a weapon and a shield.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.400
Words are magic.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.800
Movements are masters.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.720
When the body speaks, it guides us...

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.720
In harmony with our spirit.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.520
Our feelings.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.640
My heart wants to master them.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.520
It is a quest... of liberty.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640
The most beautiful of all.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.920
My heart wants to believe in its power, in its dreams.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.880
There's nothing that won't ever change. 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.780
We evolve . We must evolve. To stay free.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.780
These voices don't understand.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.820
They want to corrupt me.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.660
Keep me.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.660
My heart is an animal and won't eat this animosity.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.080
They tell me that I just have to go with the flow.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.160
And then everything will be alright.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.920
That's my heart won't let them reach their goal.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.380
It knows that one can cut, jump, fly through.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.640
I will follow it.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.740
My heart... is wild.
