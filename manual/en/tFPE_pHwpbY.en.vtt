00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.380
did you understand of which combine harvester we are talking about??

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.360
the ARBOS come back in production

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.000
The Arbos, as you know, has been closed in the 1994

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.360
but these combines are beloved by a lot of italians

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.440
if you google Arbos combine

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.160
in few seconds you have a lot of results

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:46.220
because still now these combine are sold and bought in all the world

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.020
But what made the story of Arbos a case unique and special is what happened in 1975, when the works council of Arbos was informed that the company was put into liquidation

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:08.760
The case had national resonance mainly because, in that November of '75 employees decided to buy the Arbos, engaging their liquidations

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.540
and now the production is back

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.920
and thanks who?

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.880
do you know?

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.920
thanks chineses

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.160
yes, because a chinese company, th LOVOL

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.160
They bought th ARBOS-BUBBA to put it back in production

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.560
and now do not do the usual controversy about the Chinese

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.180
we should thank chinese

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.500
because unfortunately our hands are tied

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.460
anyway

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.480
Headquarters for the distribution of Arbos will be here in Italy

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.820
we will have Arbos again

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.360

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.700
