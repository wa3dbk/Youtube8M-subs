Hello, I'm Matt Cail and on behalf of Expert
Village, I'm going to show you easy ways to

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.660
draw turkey cartoons for this holiday season.
For the main body, we are going to start off

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.030
with several effects. First, we are going
to go over with our brown and we are going

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:21.880
to make little wedge shapes. This is actually
representing feathers on the main body. Next,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.949
we are going to add in some gray accents.
I usually like to match these up with the

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.830
brown areas so they start forming more of
an actual pattern, like feathers actually

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.930
form. And then, now for this main upper body,
going back to about the mid area, the rest

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.960
of this is going to be in black or extremely
dark brown. So, we cover all of this in in

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:55.300
black, all the way in here. It doesn't have
to be jet black. You know, if the the pencil

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.140
is coming off in your hands, you know you
are pressing too hard. And the one thing is

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.890
actually, we are going to leave some white
areas around the feather marks that we made.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:14.250
This is going to kind of keep the feathers
still showing up as opposed to not. And then

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.549
we take the coloring and make sure it's nice
and uniform. You don't want it to be too blotchy

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.869
in the black areas and make sure it's showing
up and that you can't actually see the little

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.700
lines underneath it anymore. And then basically,
then, we take it back and we go back more

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:39.770
into the brown all the way back until right
near the tail section. And then right at the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:48.139
tail section, I like to mix things up a bit.
We have a little layer of tan feathers right

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:54.139
there. At this point, we've finished with
the main body and need to move on to the tail

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:58.469
feathers. Right before the little triangular
feathers that we drew in, we are going to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.389
have a line of black. And then we are going
to draw in the triangles all in this light

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:12.050
tan color working into the center. Often times,
I don't let myself be constricted by the shapes

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.270
I've set. So you know, I'll just sort of squiggle
through. I actually find that that makes everything

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.350
look better if you don't actually follow in
with the lines, but you certainly can. It's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.740
kind of however ordered your drawing style
is.
