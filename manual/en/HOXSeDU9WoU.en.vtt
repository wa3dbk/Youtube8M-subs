00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.920
This John Hughes comedy-classic was released
the day before Thanksgiving in 1987, and was

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.730
a huge hit, earning over $50 million at the
box office.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.990
Iconic funny men Steve Martin and John Candy
star as a mismatched duo forced to work together

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.800
to survive the ultimate road trip from hell,
as they attempt to make it home to Chicago

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.880
for Thanksgiving.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.680
With Murphy's Law in full effect, Martin does
an excellent job portraying the arrogant,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.789
and impatient business man perpetually pushed
to the end of his rope, both by the ridiculously

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.890
horrible circumstances he continually finds
himself in, and by Candy's irritating antics.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.829
What makes this odd-couple pairing work however
is Candy's marvelous performance as the good

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.360
natured and lovable shower-curtain ring traveling
salesmen, who is so oblivious to his obnoxious

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.230
behavior, it's hard to fault the endearing
guy, defending himself by saying, "I'm the

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.149
real article, what you see is what you get."

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.309
Although the supporting cast includes familiar
names and faces like Kevin Bacon, Dylan Baker,

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.449
Matthew Lawrence, and Ben Stein - most are
reduced to quick punchlines, and remain largely

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.449
inconsequential.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.899
Stretching the bounds of believability, the
92-minute American adventure bounces from

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.160
one awful traveling disaster to the next...
from grounded airplanes, to broken-down trains,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.660
to having their rental car catches on fire;
which results in perhaps the movie's funniest

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.940
laugh-out-loud scene when Candy attempts to
calmly dismiss officer Michael McKean's safety

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:33.580
and legal concerns over 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:47.750
their destroyed vehicle.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.539
Earning its R-rated in a single, hilarious,
F-bomb laced scene, this picture is otherwise

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.560
a family friendly story with noble themes
of friendship, family, and not judging others

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.670
by a first impression.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.070
With some silly, and perhaps hammy dialogue,
the original screenplay by Hughes is otherwise

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.160
very tightly constructed, despite ending with
an abrupt emotional shift, and a rushed ending.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.720
Technically and visually speaking, there's
nothing noteworthy with this picture, which

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.910
has held up extremely well over the years...
except for its cheesy and overly synthesized

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.610
score from Ira Newborn, which is far too goofy
to ever feel appropriate.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.350
The briskly paced experience is a holiday
staple, and the greatest reminder of how talented

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.050
the late John Candy really was... this is
a delightful picture I love watching around

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.050
turkey day.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.880
"Planes, Trains And Automobiles", "Brilliantly
funny characters.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.350
Amusing situations."

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:45.380
Now let's see what you had to say about this
picture in the Google+ comments.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.850
And our ratings are... a double EIGHT.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.450
Everyone praised Martin and Candy's performances,
scoring the film a GREAT.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.590
Despite some story flaws, I too loved the
characters in this picture, and laugh every

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.680
time I watch.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.440
It's a GREAT movie.
