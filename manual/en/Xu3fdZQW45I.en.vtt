00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.040
Now's the time to put some handles on our
cupboard doors.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.130
Only got a little bit of equipment this time.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.310
A drill.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.790
We've got a great little template here that
helps us out with the location of all our

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.790
holes.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.329
It's actually set up for various types of
cabinets, various sizes of handles as well,

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:20.329
so a great bit of kit.

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.949
A tape measure for marking out.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.730
A pencil to help us mark out as well.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.759
We've got our handles, a screwdriver to tighten
the screws up on the handles.

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.539
And, we've got some special nippers.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.930
We need to cut these screws for the handles
shorter.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.620
They're supplied long, almost too long, and
you can adjust them by cutting them a bit

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.690
shorter.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.980
That's what the nippers are for.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.970
Our first job is to mark where we're going
to drill all our holes for the handles, so

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.390
we'll get ahead and do that.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.640
Trusty pencil and magnificent little template
to help us out.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.940
In this case, we have modern doors, modern
cabinetry, and that's actually listed on the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.940
template.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.110
We also have 128 mil handles, and that's also
marked on the template, so it all helps us

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.110
out.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.570
We'll start with our overhead door first.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.530
The bottom of the template goes flush with
the bottom of the door.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.930
We're looking for our modern.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.830
In this case, it is that series of holes there.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.880
We mark the bottom hole with the pencil.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.280
We need to go up 128 millimeters, mark our
drilling points with our trusty pencil, and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.549
then a good hint is to just double check offering
the handle up to those marks to make sure

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.910
we've got them in the right place.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.910
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.630
That's all marked, so now I'll drill our holes
for those screws in that.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.659
We'll get a couple of screws and our nippers.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.510
The first thing I want to do is just poke
the screw for the handle through here to figure

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.220
out how far it pokes through.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.320
Remember, I talked about the fact that the
screws are too long and we need to cut them

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.320
shorter.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.150
So, as I can see here, there are little shoulders
on these screws as well, which is a good indicator,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.270
a good helper for us.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.940
On this one, I need to cut off one, two, I
need the third one along.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.530
If you don't cut them short enough, too much
thread hanging through there, the screw won't

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.770
tighten up.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.230
So, I just need to cut that a bit short.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.760
One, two, three.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.130
Just poke it through the door.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.690
I've got about 5, maybe 7 millimeters poking
through, which is plenty.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.599
Let's start attaching the handle.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.240
A good idea not to tighten the first one all
the way.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.440
Just leave it a little bit loose.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.380
It just gives you a little bit of wiggle room.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.580
The second one going in.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.250
All looking good, that one.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.430
The next step is to do the drawer unit and
the lower cupboard.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.780
In that respectfully drawer I need to find
the center, so I've got my tape measure.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.180
Finding the center of the drawer, which is
here.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.360
I'll look for the center line on the template
to match up with the center line that I've

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.360
already marked.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.090
I'm looking for modern again, which is the
series that this all is.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.760
Okay, now I'll start drilling the holes.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:50.370
In this case, I only need to cut off one little
section of the screws.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.019
The handle, the screwdriver, again, just a
few turns just to locate it, get the screw

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.629
started.

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.239
Lovely.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.750
Now, let's move on to the cupboard.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.769
In this case, we're using the template, and
we'll put it flush to the top of the door.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.830
Okay, modern again.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.129
Mark our little hole.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.079
Two screws in the handle.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.160
Start that one.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.470
Beautiful.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.790
Marvelous.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:33.340
So, I've just shown you three different techniques
on how to attach handles to a cabinetry, upper

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.360
cabinet, drawer, and lower cabinet.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.930
Now, we'll work our way around doing the rest
of them.
