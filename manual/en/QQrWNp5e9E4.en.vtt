Hi, my name is Guillermo Gomez, I coach youth
soccer and I'd like to talk to you about how

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.000
to buy goalie gloves. You know once you get
to the store, you want try on a variety of

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.400
gloves to make sure that you're comfortable
with the different options available. You

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.800
want to put them on, okay and make sure that
they are slightly bigger than your hand. You

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.660
want a little room for it. Check for mobility
of your fingers. Inspect the glove. Look at

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.460
the stitching of the glove to make sure they
won't come apart very easily. Look at the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.781
grip, feel the grip in the palm of your hand
because that's very important as you're going

00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:50.579
to be grabbing the soccer ball all of the
time. Then look at the strap around the wrist,

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:01.859
and make sure that it straps really well and
that the velcro holds the strap well comfortably.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:10.080
There are a number of gloves out there. You
have gloves for extreme weather conditions

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.070
so they're waterproof gloves. These gloves,
the palm of the hands are made of a special

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.000
material so you can have a better grip on
the ball.Then you have gloves that give you

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.890
better protection of your fingers or to protect
you from hyperextensions and as a goalie you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.960
might be trying to get a ball, you're on the
ground and somebody might step on you so this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.060
kind of glove will protect your fingers as
well. Then you have match gloves which is

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.600
what professional goal keepers use. These
gloves give you a very comfortable feel. They

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.950
protect you very well. They do tend to be
pricey. Then you could have just your training

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.960
glove which is what I have right here. It's
just a basic training glove. For just soccer

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.910
players, I recommend just a basic training
glove. By just soccer players I probably refer

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.810
to the age of youth 8 through youth 12. All
their players perhaps should be looking into

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.980
a more well made glove for additional protection
since players at that age tend to shoot at

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:29.670
the ball pretty hard. So, again, go out to
the store. Try them on. Try many pairs on.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.370
Make sure you leave a little room when you
buy. Make sure they are a little big for comfort

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.959
and allow you to feel the grip on the ball
and that's how you buy soccer gloves.
