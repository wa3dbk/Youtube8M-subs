JOAKIM NEJDEBY: Linkoping
is some 200

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.340
kilometers south of Stockholm.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.420
And our university has around
25,000, 26,000 students when

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.630
it comes to heads.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.390
And when it comes to full-time
equivalents, less than 20,000.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.280
The biggest problem with our old
email system was that it

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.525
was growing older and older.

00:00:20.525 --> 00:00:24.170
It was getting more and more
difficult to keep pace with

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.750
the new versions, and also the
demand of increasing storage

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.410
capacity for the students.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.870
So the old system was a Sun
iPlanet system, and we had

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.120
very limited storage
for each student.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.160
It was like 50 megabytes
per student.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.350
We asked the students, and the
students said, Google Apps is

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.510
what we prefer.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.840
And we also did an economical
study at that time, and we

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.910
found out that, from a pure
economical standpoint, it's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.050
easier to integrate
to Google Apps.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.095
The change was seamlessly--

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:03.290
it was no problems. We didn't
get much questions.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.600
[? Seeing a ?]

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.840
[? sound ?]

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960
solution--

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.970
when it was in place, it was
really working well, and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.530
things like that.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.860
So the students really
didn't have much

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.970
issues with Google Apps.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.430
And when we asked them in focus
groups, they'd tend to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.470
be very pleased.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.660
They'd tend to say that this
platform provides what they

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.880
are looking for.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.120
The biggest changes is probably
allowing the students

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.580
to have a student-centric
learning experience.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.340
So if a teacher teaches a class
which is normally not

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.050
given electronically, which
would probably be best held in

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.080
[? learning a ?] management
system, but rather history or

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.080
something, then the students
themselves can form ad-hoc

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.640
groups, share documents, and the
like, and build everything

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.420
themselves.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.830
The first viable, really
tangible cost saving is that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.230
we will save some million
Swedish kronas not to upgrade

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.670
the old system, buy
new hardware,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.040
educating new people.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.930
If we save a million Swedish
kronor this time, in three

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.790
years' time we would have to
reinvest in a new system, and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.920
[? all of that. ?]

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.755
Going into Google Apps, using
the software as a service

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:23.440
platform, we will refrain from
doing that type of stuff,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.240
concentrating our resources
rather on integrating with

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.980
Google Apps rather than building
an email platform or

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.590
buying in email platforms
from time to time.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.800
We see a mega-trend basically
going toward

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.970
software as a service.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.960
So it's increasingly more so
that we buy software as a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.320
service rather than hosting
stuff in-house.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.370
So that is changing the way that
we need to think about IT

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.190
as such, making it more of a
business process support

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.810
system, rather than something
that some people might

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.670
consider as core business
for the university.
