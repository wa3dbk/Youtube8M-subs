00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.320
Amongst us, in our homes and close
to the food we eat,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.960
live some mysterious tiny,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.880
yet extremely energetic creatures...

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.460
Much  smaller!

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.360
These are microorganisms,
 extremely small living beings.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.520
There are three different types
of microorganisms.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.940
The good ones help to produce foods and
drinks such as cheese and yoghurt,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.680
fermented meat and fermented vegetables.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.000
Some other microorganisms are annoying.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.620
These are the bad ones, they are
responsible for the foul smell,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.820
bad taste and repulsive look of rotting food,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.020
but they normally don't cause diseases.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.130
But it's the other kinds of microorganisms
that we really need to be afraid of!

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.020
They don't cause food to smell bad
and they don't change the way it looks,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.899
they are the dangerous ones and it's
necessary to be very careful with them.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.240
These are known as pathogenic microorganisms
and they can cause severe illnesses

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.740
such as stomach pains, vomiting,
diarrhoea, fever and even death!

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.619
They are deceitful, invisible and dangerous.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.520
These tiny beings are very, very prolific.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.240
To increase in number they need food,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.720
water, time and warmth.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.000
They can multiply very quickly.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.160
Fortunately, no matter how strong and frightening
these microorganisms are,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.320
they are preventable and vulnerable...

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.980
I t takes as little as five simple rules,
five behaviour keys to get rid of them.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.020
Protect yourself and your family
from diseases in the home.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.780
The rules are easy to apply.
These are your five keys to safer food.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.340
Keep clean to prevent contamination.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.320
Separate raw and cooked foods
to avoid cross-contamination.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.360
Cook thoroughly to
kill microorganisms.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.620
Keep food at safe temperatures, either hot or cold, 
to prevent bacterial growth.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.520
Use safe water and safe raw materials
to avoid contamination.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.240
Food producers are the ones primarily responsible for the safety of the food you buy.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.300
But you can protect yourself and your family
from diseases in the home

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.460
by applying the Five Keys to Safer Food.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.960
Use them!
You also have a role to play!
