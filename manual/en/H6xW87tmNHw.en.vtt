00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.130
Until recently, the search for planets beyond
our solar system was a matter of calculating

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:21.900
the odds and laying out theories of solar
system formation.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.029
Circumstantial evidence began to trickle in,
a color shift in a stars light as a planet

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:41.030
tugged on it, or a dipping in its light as
a planet passed in front.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.129
When would our technology allow us to see
through the bright light of stars to see these

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.140
alien worlds directly?

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.890
Scientists using the Hubble Space Telescope
began examining a star visible in the southern

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:07.770
hemisphere, just 25 light years away.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:19.030
Called Fomalhaut, itÕs much hotter than our
sun and 15 times as bright.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.859
In fact, itÕs one of the brightest stars
in our night sky.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.270
What makes it so curious is the large ring
of gas that surrounds it.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.560
The ring is slightly off center from the location
of the sun.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.729
That suggests thereÕs a gravitational presence,
a planet, thatÕs distorting its shape.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:58.049
With a coronagraph in place to block the starÕs
light, Hubble zeroed in on the ring.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.179
Right there in the data, it turns out, was
a bump, perhaps a planet.

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.660
Hubble photographed this planet a second time,
two years later when it had progressed in

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.770
its orbit.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.400
Based on the change in position, astronomers
calculated that it takes about 872 Earth-years

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.920
to complete an orbit.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.250
Astronomers thought it to be a huge planet,
many times larger than Jupiter.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:46.300
The reason they could see is that it may have
a very large and reflective ring system.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.820
From the ringÕs narrow width, the planet
seems to be sculpting it, by pushing on and

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.110
sharpening its inner edge.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.390
Hubble had delivered a rare direct image of
an extrasolar planet, the first one ever in

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.970
visible light.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.530
Astronomers could not confirm its presence
by looking in the infrared portion of the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.510
light spectrum.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:26.450
That seemed to be the end of it.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.690
Enter ALMA, the not quite completed Atacama
Large Millimeter-Submillimeter Array in the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.180
high desert of Chile.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.040
It produced this picture of the disk, which
showed that its inner and outer edges are

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.800
both relatively sharp.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.110
Computer simulations refined the parameters
of planets.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.010
There is not one, but two, on both edges of
the ring.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:14.689
They had to be relatively small to avoid destroying
the ring: larger than Mars, but only a few

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.090
times larger than Earth.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:26.470
ThereÕs little chance that these frigid worlds
harbor life.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.230
What they do is extend our vision, and our
ideas on what it takes to form a solar system.
