00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.860
Hi, I'm Toby from The Killer Bits. And I've
been sent this XMG P703 to review.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.939
So lets take a look inside, do some benchmarking
and see how it holds up.

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.590
The black behemoth itself is clad in matte,
black plastic which gives it a very clean,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.090
modern look without pussy footing around like
a MacBook.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.860
The matte does, however, show up marks easily
but that's a purely aesthetic qualm. And it's

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.850
pretty sturdy and easy to clean.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.370
Also, purely for the look of the thing, it
comes with a flashy glowing keyboard and backlit

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.600
decal for the touchpad. But that is a pointless
addition that can be turned off or altered

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.649
at will. It adds nothing but it's nice to
have the option. And apparently, on the final

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.159
build, there'll be a different decal to "the
snitch" which is a merciful relief.

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.600
The keyboard and touchpad are excellent, lighting
aside, and seldom misfire. Even if the biometric

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.569
scanner and touchpad can be rendered useless
with a single bead of sweat.

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.489
The keyboard on this model is a German one
but that will be rectified on the commercial

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.309
model.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.540
The touchpad is also a little bit janky, rendering
it useless for gaming. However the inclusion

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.710
of 3 USB ports, two of which are USB 3.0 (aswell
as the combination of one eSATA port which

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.350
doubles as USB) makes mouse usage a near mandatory
improvement.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.870
Also, there's no delete key. You have to press
Shift + Entf. I have no idea why but Entf

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.160
is found on the NumPad - which is always a
plus.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.020
Now on to what matters, the inner workings
of this model of German efficiency. Inside

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.340
there's the new Haswell Intel chip. It's a
beastly processor which pumps out enough power

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.750
to support any game on the market with relatively
little effort.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.480
On CPU intensive games, such as those that
run on the Source Engine the framerate remains

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.470
silky smooth even when the action heats up
which is a real relief given that other gaming

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.950
laptops sometimes scrimp on the processor
in favour of meaty, higher-end GPUs.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.190
Speaking of graphics cards however, the P703
does boast a beefy NVIDIA GeForce 780M aswell

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.380
as full HD support in the form of the new
Intel HD graphics 4600. Which is a really

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.750
long winded way of saying that everything
looks gorgeous. With full PhysX support and

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.640
a display rivaling some pretty decent desktop
machines.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.790
It's also got 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a brilliant
cooling system. Which means even after hours

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.709
of continuous play the P703 is ready for more.
Which is lovely as it turns out being part

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.219
of the glorious PC master race looks and sounds
pretty brilliant.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:32.760
The screen on which these brilliant images
are displayed is a 17 inch LCD HD display.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.639
Backlit and it looks stunning. It's clarity
is kinda unlike I've ever seen in a laptop

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.459
before which may, partially, be due to my
inexperience but it doesn't do anything to

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.189
detract from how visually impressive the games
look on this monitor.

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.849
It also has a HDMI port on the back aswell
as in built capabilities for a second monitor

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.219
which seems kinda like a novelty given that
this is meant to be a portable machine.

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.319
One thing that does underline that this machine
is designed to be picked up and played is

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.950
the incredible boot speed. In less than a
minute from hitting the on key you can be

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.969
playing a game. Which, given that it's booting
Windows 8 Enterprise is a real achievement.

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.799
The whole thing is streamlined aswell by the
inclusion of a biometric scanner which can

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.349
be used to remember any password online aswell
as a handy hotkey.

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.629
The scanner however does replace the middle
mouse button on the touchpad. But that's not

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.540
so bad considering that each finger can be
a different application. And that a middle

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.719
mouse button or wheel is largely unheard of
on notebooks.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.919
Networking and sound are up to the same high
quality however there were some teething issues

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.709
with the second hard drive. A little Google-ing
alleviated the problem freeing up 500GBs of

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.059
free space. But it was a pain that I had to
do it at all given the price tag of this impressive

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:41.639
piece of kit.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.719
Another storage issue was the conspicuous
lack of a blu-ray drive. Admittedly the DVD

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.930
drive included is incredibly quick and responsive
but at this point it does feel like a shortcoming

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.950
given how future-proof the rest of the package
is.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.709
So - does the XMG P703 provide a good PC gaming
experience?

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.549
Well, it's absolutely everything I want it
to be. I've yet to run a game that has dipped

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:10.219
below 60fps and most stay at least above 120.
With some games I play never coming below

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:11.590
200.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.449
It doesn't heat up conspicuously and it has
a card reader, a couple of USB 3.0 ports and

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.570
all the sound gear I could ever really want.
Aswell as the brilliant marriage of new Intel

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.950
technology with the reliability of NVIDIA.
So - yeah, as a gaming PC it's great.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.760
But... is it a competent notebook? Well that's
another matter. It's heavy and the power pack

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.650
is the size of a Wii Mini meaning only handsome,
strong PC gamers will be able to heft it around.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.910
Obviously all PC gamers fit into the bicep
ridden phenotype so it's not really that much

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.260
of an issue. And the battery's impressive
life span means the charger is basically only

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.500
a necessity for prolonged gaming sessions.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.790
For what it is it's astonishing that Schenker
have managed to fit everything that they have

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.390
into something this size. It's a testament
to German efficiency and it takes it's place

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.240
as the king of the XMG Pro range with a fairly
reasonable price tag of ï¿½1175.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.230
For what it is it's a great price. And for
this price you'd expect this level of engineering.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.920
All in all it's a damn good laptop and I'm
really enjoying my time with it.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.880
So that's about the long and short of it really.
It's a pretty great gaming laptop but it's

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.760
in no way a desktop replacement. Although
at times, because of the weight, it kind of

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.910
feels like one.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.340
