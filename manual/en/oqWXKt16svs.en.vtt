00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.799
Hi! I'm Mark Wilson from United Soccer Academy.
We are here today with Expert Village and

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.750
we are going to take a look at shooting the
soccer ball, and more specifically how we

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.510
create swerve on the ball. By looking at the
soccer ball here, we want to make contact.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.090
If we think of the soccer ball as having a
equator, we want to try strike the ball across

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.510
the other side of the ball to allow the ball
to spin. So it starts in old say traditionally

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.370
and comes in, and it is a very deceitful shoot
to fool the defenders. If we show that on

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.690
the ground, our toes are pointed down, we
place our non kicking foot beside the ball,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.140
and as we come through, we actually make contact
on the outside of the ball with our toe pointed

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:23.070
down, locked ankles to spin the ball away.
Let's show that with our demonstrators. So

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.460
just to recap, creating swerve on the soccer
ball is used to try and send the goalkeeper

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.670
one way and have the ball finishing the other.
We create spin on the ball by striking towards

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.590
the outside of the ball with a locked ankle,
our toes pointed down, and we follow through

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.950
to create a spin, so traditionally the ball
starts moving outward and then bends inwards.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.249
And that is swerving the soccer ball.
