00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.870
This is a video for an origami jumping frog.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.850
The first step for the origami frog is to
pick out a sheet of paper and now we're going

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.500
to start with the white side up and we're
going to fold a book fold.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.900
So take the bottom edge and bring it up to
the top just like this.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.490
You can see how you get it nice and lined
up, so you don't want it so it's a little

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.490
askew, it's a little off.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.770
You want to get it as precise as you can,
so it lines right up there.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.489
Slide it across and now we're going to do
a diagonal fold.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.210
So the diagonal fold is going to come from
this top edge is going to go up against this

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.210
side edge.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.540
So we're going to fold it over like this,
and then the important thing, you want to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.140
have a nice sharp point here at the top, too.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.930
So when I'm folding this over I'm getting
both of these two edges to line up.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.920
Do one side, open it up and then we're also
going to do the opposite side.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.530
Now there's two sheets of paper here and it
might be on either side, but go ahead and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.109
fold both of them at the same time.

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:16.840
We're going to fold this one over, and again,
a nice sharp point right there at the top,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.069
so it'll make a nice X here at the top of
the paper.

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:27.450
Next we're going to flip the whole paper over
and take the top edge of this X and we're

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.211
going to fold it down to the bottom edge of
this X.

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:34.549
If you see where these two points are right
here, we're going to fold them down to these

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.950
two points, which are the bottom of the X.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.530
So fold it down right like this all the way
across.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.799
So if you open it back up again, you can see
how the line that we made went straight through

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.599
the middle of that X when we folded this.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.460
Now flip is over, we'll have little bit sort
of like a ski jump going on right there.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.259
So fold it over so it looks just like this.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.419
Now what we're going to do is take our finger
and put it right on the center of the paper.

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:10.440
So put it right in the middle of that X and
push down, and there's a moment where the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.730
paper is going to pop right there.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.379
See how it went from it started over here
like this, and then the paper is going to

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.870
pop, where these two edges are going to pop
up.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.189
So now we're going to fold these two edges
in, and as these two edges come in, the top

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.409
part sort of comes down as well, and go ahead
and flatten the whole thing down.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.159
It makes what is kind of a water bomb base
right there at the top.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:39.129
So it starts up like this, you fold it down,
bring this top edge down while these two triangles

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.459
come in.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.180
It sort of looks like a house shape, a nice
shape of a house right there.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.700
Next step take the bottom edge and fold it
up to right here, the bottom edge of that

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.730
triangle, fold it right up there just like
that.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.609
After that we're going to take these two corners,
there's these two open flaps that are sort

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.709
of available and free right here.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.220
We're just going to take those two flaps and
put them right to the top of that triangle

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.340
on the left side and also on the right side
like that.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.530
Then after that step we're going to take both
of these two edges and fold them into the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.530
middle.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:29.180
It's very close to a cupboard fold where you
see how I fold both of these edges over, it's

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.269
sort of like a cabinet or cupboard doors.

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.950
You see how they open up and close just like
that.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.140
So once those have been folded over, go ahead
and squish them good.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.269
There's a lot of paper here, so we're going
to use some pretty hard squishes right here,

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.500
some hard folds.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:58.459
Then take the bottom of this and fold it up
to right about here, right where the triangles

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.060
have their biggest point right there at the
top.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.670
Fold it right up to these.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.200
That's the first fold and then fold it back
down to bottom edge.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.450
Make sure it doesn't go past the bottom edge.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.870
It's okay if it's even a little bit less than
the bottom edge, because you want to have

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.760
that under enough for the spring on the frog.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.800
So now I'm going to show you when you open
up these two legs and you flip them over,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.040
that's the finished frog, but it's really
important you have a nice little S curve right

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040
here.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.820
It's a really nice S curve, that's the spring
that you're going to use to help make him

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.820
jump.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.300
This is a jumping frog, and the way it works,
just put your finger right on top of the frog

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.430
and pull back, and then let it slide off your
finger, and once it slides off your finger

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.800
he should jump pretty well.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.990
It depends on how much of that spring you
have, but try not to just push and squish

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.010
him, and squish him flat.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.690
You sort of have to slide your finger off
the back, and that is the origami jumping

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.200
frog.
