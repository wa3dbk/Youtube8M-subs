00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.940
So part in the spring pond maintenance
is thinning out some of the aquatic

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.530
plants

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.599
So they don't really take the pond over.
This particular plant right here,

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.099
"Pennywort" and it's actually
really cute plant

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.439
and some people love it and some people
hate it and I can tell you

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.420
that people hate it don't manage it
because if you let this thing takeover

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.000
are really getting between all the rocks

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.489
and it's really hard to manage if you let it
take off

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.150
So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna thin it out
really well this season

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.030
this plant actually, all this is from back
over here we have a nice little cluster

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.460
here and all the runners that kinda made
their way here

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.309
so I don't manage it now, the runners can
continue on and by the end of the year

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.850
they'll be all over by the skimmer

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.869
So I'm just gonna thin back what we don't
want, clean it up

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:58.869
and get it back to a nice little
specimen plant

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.950
So I'm working on this little beach
entrance here

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.950
and I'm just gonna more around some of this gravel so as I'm rinsing it

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.010
And in doing so, I found a little bit
more that Pennywort

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.010
running across. I stripped that out and then
I'm gonna continue on rinsing

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.189
So when we're doing the rinsing of the pond

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.880
in this fashion, without doing the
pressure washer, remember I'm not

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.950
worried about this algae

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.900
this is a good biofilm and it takes
some time to develop so I don't want to

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.130
hit it with the pressure washer

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.439
But what I do want to do is get in behind
the cracks because that's where all the

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.340
sludge is

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.479
back in behind here so I'm really gonna work my hose

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.659
in these cracks and if you'll notice, what
I'm getting out of here

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.940
some pretty Blackwater, So if I want this
ecosystem the run super efficiently the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.599
season

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.450
I want to get in here and and just kinda
clean that stuff out. So work you way

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.430
in and around the pond like

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.910
so and one other tip I want to give you
when you're cleaning the pond

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.709
we have we have the pump clear, we moved
all the gravel we have the pump down lowest

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.739
end of the pond

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.160
and you'll see we have this gravel on this
section and as the pump is draining the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.130
pond down

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.170
this gravel is holding back

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.750
that dirty water that we want to get to
there, so kinda what we'll do is we'll

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.430
create a trench like this

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.120
by all the way across the bottom of the pond

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.120
and that allows all the dirty water to make
itself

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.190
all the way over to the pump. I'll move this
guy the way. So now everything that I'm

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.769
rinsing this way comes into this

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.200
trench and everything that I'm rinsing
on this site comes into the trench

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.800
it works its way to the pump and then we
can pump it out to the landscape

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.600
it's a great opportunity when you have
the pond drained down like this you doing

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.400
all the rinsing

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.480
to inspect all the underwater lights. So I've got
the light

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.630
transformer turned on and we're gonna
come through and check to make sure all

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.280
the lights are

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.800
adjusted. I'm gonna take the time and clean the face of them off right here

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.400
when algae starts grow on the light
fixtures, it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.700
dulls the, it dulls the impact that has as
well

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.729
so I'll just check on them, they're running good. If
I have any bulbs that are out right now

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:45.829
it's a perfect opportunity

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.360
make a change.
