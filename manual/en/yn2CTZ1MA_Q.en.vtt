00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.450
one, two, three, four!

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.440
Rev up your engines!

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.220
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.720
if you're tuning up your car and change
the spark plugs, and you pull out the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.619
boot and it's covered with oil, don't
freak out and think that your engine's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.650
falling apart, because the fix can be as
simple as changing these spark plug tube

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.210
seals on the engine, as cars get older,
the gasket materials made out of rubber,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.500
it cracks and it starts to leak oil
into the engine, so the engine itself is

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.610
probably okay, it's just that the gaskets
are leaking, then they coat the spark

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.780
plug boots and the spark plugs with oil,
now to fix it, first take all the hoses

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.219
off that are connected to the top of the
valve cover, and they often stick on, so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.829
get a big screwdriver, and start to pry
them off, then they come off easier, thing

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.670
at a 10 millimeter socket, and a ratchet,
and take all the little bolts off that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.449
hold the valve cover gasket on top of
the engine, it's a pretty easy job when

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.470
it comes down to it, and once you take
all the little bolts off, get the giant

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.880
screwdriver again, and realize that the valve covers are pretty stuck on, so you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.979
find a little ridge like this and pry,
then you can pry it off, and with a bit

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.150
of wiggle and you can get it off, now
we're also going to change the valve cover

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.560
gasket, as you can see it's all cracked
and worn, but the spark plug tube seals

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.660
are even worse, they're totally brittle
they come off in pieces, and these are so

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.910
caked on, we have to use this little
putty knife in order to scrape them off,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.060
and I'm also going to buff them off with a
buffer, because there's a lot of pieces stuck

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.580
on there, you want to make sure they're
nice and shiny like this, so they seal

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.840
good, now there's a bunch of oil stuck in
a spark plug hole, so I'm going to use this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.130
little vacuum pump, and it's going to suck
the oil out, so it gets out of the engine,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.090
then you just stick your pumping device
in the hole and pump it, so you can see

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.090
it sucks the oil out, now I'm changing
the spark plugs too, but we didn't want

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.780
to take the spark plugs out first, because if it did, all that oil will get stuck in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
the engine, and we tried to crank it, it
might hydro lock and break the pistons,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.239
and you can see what an oil soaked mess
the spark plugs are, it's speaking of the

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.110
new spark plugs, here's a tip, you'll
notice these newer spark plugs have

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.859
metal that's coated, you don't need to
put any type of anti-seize on them

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.290
anymore,
the coating keeps it from sticking in the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.720
engine, you just put them in and bolt them up tight, you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.070
make them snug, then just a little turn,
now this Toyota has an interesting design,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.940
the valve cover gasket and the spark
plug tube seals are all in one piece, it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.100
just fits right on, you feed the gasket
on, and push it into all a little holes, so

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:52.310
it's nice and snug, then the valve cover
gasket just fits back on top, then you put

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.020
all the bolts back in, and before you put
the spark plug wires on, or in this case

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.760
it's called coil on plug, get some spray
electrical cleaner, and clean all the oil

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.530
off the boot here, normally it's okay to
do this and not having to replace it,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.460
unless it's really rotten, in which case,
you have to replace the rubber, then put

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.210
them back in place, and don't forget to
put the hoses back on too, that was a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.980
tough one, then of course, started up and
check for leaks, it's dry as a bone,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.450
nothing's leaking, so the next time your
changing your spark plugs and you find

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.360
they're covered with oil, don't freak out
fix it yourself,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.620
and remember if you've got any car questions
visit the Scotty Kilmer channel and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.930
I'll answer them as soon as I get back
from my Shack.
