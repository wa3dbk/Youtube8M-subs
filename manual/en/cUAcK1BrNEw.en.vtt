00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.620
This is a short little video on how to install
radiant barrier into a wall assembly on basically,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.590
how to keep the heat out; this is more of
a hot weather or summer application.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.390
We get a lot of customers calling and they
are doing a remodel or tearing out some walls,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.180
they've got their studs open, they've got
their exterior sheathing and they want to

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.460
know whether or not they can install a radiant
barrier on that west or south facing wall

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.369
to help reduce the heat coming in.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.449
The answer is "yes" but the first thing you
have to do in order to do this is create an

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.160
air space; you have to have an air space for
a radiant barrier to exist.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.010
Normally what happens if you stuff this bay
full of insulation is the exterior sheathing

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.309
gets hot and the heat travels by conduction
all the way through the insulation and in

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.629
to the house.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.539
When you create this air space and you put
the radiant barrier foil right there, what's

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.710
going to happen is the exterior is going to
get hot, it's going to want to conduct across

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.049
but when it hits this air space, in order
to get across that air space, it mostly has

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.740
to convert to radiant heat and once heat is
in a radiant form, it's great because we own

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.740
it.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.090
We can just reflect it back.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.110
What that does is keep the insulation right
here cooler and that drives less heat into

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.110
the home.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.260
So, the insulation is more effective basically;
it's almost like adding more insulation is

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.260
the net effect.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.070
Now if you are doing a remodel and you really
want to do it: what you do is you put some

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.399
foam strips in, then you're going to staple
your foil up - so the foil is going to go

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.700
basically right up against the wall on the
spacers (use either 1/2" or 3/4" foam board)

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.729
staple and pull it across and staple on the
other side.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.570
Put your batt insulation in and then this
is an optional layer.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.189
This is 1/2" blue board (or foam board - blue,
pink, it doesn't really matter) and what it

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:59.289
does is it gives more R-value to the wall
but it also makes the wall air tight and it

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.079
reduces what is called "thermal bypass."

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.620
Basically this is heat coming through the
stud that would go into the house.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.119
It's kind of like putting a jacket on that
wall, and ultimately drywall or sheetrock.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.740
So, coming from the outside in, you have:
exterior sheathing, you've got your air space

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.660
made up by your foam furring strips then foil,
you've got your insulation, optional foam

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.630
board, and then sheetrock.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.270
Now if you do the foam board and the sheetrock,
one thing you might want to do is offset all

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.450
the pieces so you don't have two seams on
one location; you don't want to have a foam

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.010
seam right on top of a sheetrock seam.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.060
Really, that is about it!

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.300
It's an easy install, it's cheap, it works
great; you're going to notice this wall is

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.510
a lot cooler, a lot less heat is coming through,
the room is going to be a lot more comfortable

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.940
and energy efficient.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.230
