00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.040
Here's something called

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.250
the magnetic hand. You take some cards

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.970
and place them into your hand just like this.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.240
Here's what might be

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.000
interesting, You hold the whole bunch of
cards

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.450
and then you're able to let go just like
that. It appears as if the cards

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.579
are floating or attached to your hand.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.230
You turn them all over and right there

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.420
that is the magnetic

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.380
hand. Well you need a gimmicked card, here it is, right here

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.830
it has a little tab that you have

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.610
in the card. You need two playing cards:
one you cut a little tab out

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.850
and get a second card and simply put glue along here

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.939
and glue under here. You glue them
together and this will create

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.850
your gimmicked card.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.340
Once you have your gimmicked card here's how you perform the trick.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.010
You bring out the cards and show them to
be

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.510
ordinary cards, And then what you do is
take your gimmicked card - it happens to be the

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.350
bottom one.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.900
And with the tab I'm actually gripping
your between

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.780
my ring and middle finger. See at this
point the card is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.530
already attached. Now all I have to do take all the other cards

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.780
slide them underneath my

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.890
gimmicked card. Hold the whole bunch,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.340
turn it over and they magically stay

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.550
as if the hand is magnetic or the
cards are magnetic. Simply turn the whole

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.460
bunch over

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.670
and then you can take the cards apart
and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.930
show them and put them away.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.420
That is the magnetic hand or

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.420
playing card trick.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.510
 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.439
