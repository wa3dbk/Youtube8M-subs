Hi, my name is Drew Neilon from Myrtle Beach,
South Carolina in Little River. I work at

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.889
Beach Customs and today I'm going to show
you how to change and maintain a tire for

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:21.170
Expert Village. Alright now I'm going to remove
this spacer right here and I'm going to put

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.070
this on this side of the bike because I know
that when I put the tire back on this axle

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:35.210
will go right here, the same exact spot. So
I'm going to take the chain off the bike.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.149
Some bikes have belts and some have chains,
which will be the same exact thing. I'm taking

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:56.820
the chain off. And now I'm going to jack the
bike up. Once the bike is jacked up, I'm going

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.440
to go over on the other side and remove the
brake from the frame itself. Now I'm going

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:20.610
to remove the brake from the frame itself
so I can pull the tire out.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.710
I'm going to put the brake right here. I'm
going to put a rag right here over the pipes

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:35.320
to prevent any scratching on the pipes as
I lay the brake here. Now the tire is ready

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.400
to be pulled out, so I have to go back around
to the other side and jack the bike up higher.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:02:05.000
Now I'm going to jack the bike up and remove
the tire.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:23.250
On this step you want to make sure that you
have the bike tied strap too, to lift itself.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:36.580
I'm jacking the bike up so I can have enough
clearance to pull the tire out. And that's

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.940
how you remove the tire.
