Hi my name is Jenna Halfacre and this is the July update for our bus project

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.860
Probably the biggest and saddest update since our last one is the bottom of our radiator rusted through

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.480
This is going to set us back anywhere from twelve to eighteen hundred dollars

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.140
with larger than usual PFD's predicted for this year

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.420
this may not set us back as much as we think but we'll still probably leave later than we thought

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.020
On a positive note we have one of our biggest pieces of furniture done: the couch

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.220
We've built three cupholders in the end of each arm

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.440
Two standard size and one big enough to hold a Nalgene bottle

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.120
We've also built bins into the end of this arm

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.000
and storage at the end of the other as well a chamber above for the inverter

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.260
Behind the cupholders on each arm is a storage compartment for small items

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.460
The cushions are made of two different kinds of foam

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.600
We have two inches of high density foam

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.980
topped with three inches of memory foam

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.660
so they're very comfortable to sit and sleep on

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.620
Everything underneath is storage which you get to by removing the cushions

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.860
and lifting the lid

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.320
Eventually our batteries will be in this end while the other end will just be general storage

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.040
The next big thing we've finished is Erik built these two hollow core doors

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.020
for the bathroom and the bedroom

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.520
By building them ourselves out of plywood we were able to build them to our own size specifications

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.420
as well as keep them light

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.220
Erik also built this fan box with three twenty millimeter PC case fans

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.480
Which will pull air from here, where the woodstove will be into our bedroom via the register

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.040
The fan box is turned on and off from a switch in the bedroom

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.540
 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.560
We also put a small PC case fan inside the composting toilet to create negative draw

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.480
and vent the toilet box

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.760
Leftover from the couch project we had enough memory foam to build Ryan his own mattress

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.420
Thanks for watching our July update progress has been slow but steady

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.220
Hopefully by the end of August we'll have more interesting things to show you
