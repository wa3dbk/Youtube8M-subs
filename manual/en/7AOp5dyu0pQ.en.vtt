00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
For anglers coming from a northerly direction,
Guilford Road is the most logical choice to

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.130
get to Sandwich beach.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.790
There's a heavy toll charge though, so to
avoid this, take the long way round from Deal

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.110
in the south, along Golf Road.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.000
Whilst we're doing that, I'll point out some
marks you might hear about.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.270
Godwyn Road is definitely in Deal but people
do refer to the Godwyn Road end of the bay.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.439
A few hundred yards further up, marks what
starts to feel more like Sandwich now than

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.910
Deal with the remains of Sandown Castle as
the landmark.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.340
Half way up Golf Road is the country pub called
Chequers, a mark often mentioned in fishing

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.050
reports.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.440
The most northerly mark in the bay with easy
parking is the slipway that forms part of

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.750
Sandwich Sailing Club...which is where we'll
start.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.610
The slip end of the bay is much quieter and
this is a really nice place to fish.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.317
Sandwich Bay is a very popular spot as it
regularly produces big fish - bass and sole

00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:02.317
but especially rays and is snag-free fishing
onto clean sand.

00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:15.040
On the way into the sailing club along Golf
Road, you'll pass Chequers, that we saw on

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.700
the map earlier.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.700
Fishing here involves a walk across the golf
course.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.110
A quick look at the depths in the bay...

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:44.040
And then finally, as we come back to Deal,
to fish the south of the bay best place to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.980
park is by Sandown Castle - free parking within
yards of the beach.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.309
If you like to fish a certain set of conditions,
then check out the wave buoy data for the

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:57.690
Goodwin Sands.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.779
There's not one specifically for the inside
of the bay but the Goodwin Sands aren't far

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:02.779
out.

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:07.009
The wave buoy will tell you the sea temperature,
wave height and if the sea is building or

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:07.199
falling.
