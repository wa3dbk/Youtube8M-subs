00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
amazing amazing board

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
this is your all mountain everywhere board

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:07.506
this thing is gonna take care of everything at once

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
real riders, real reviews

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:30.516
regular cambered technology

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
just a minor camber in a short distance

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and then it has early rise once it gets

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:39.435
past your bindings, reverse camber

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:43.054
it's got a shallow magna-traction on it

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.842
nothing that's too extravagant 

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:47.025
so it's not gonna send you

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:50.063
it's not too catchy for magna-traction

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:52.918
it's really shallow

00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:55.245
it's just perfect shallow magna-traction

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.055
hit the powder first 

00:00:56.308 --> 00:00:59.308
went and hit the park afterwards

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.166
everything was a great thing

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:01.745
control was amazing

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.727
edge to edge was great 

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:05.624
it engaged really well

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:06.785
I felt really comfortable on it and 

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:09.584
stability was an important part of this board

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:12.036
this board was actually a very

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:14.567
playful board really nice in the turns

00:01:13.398 --> 00:01:16.398
big turns small turns

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.077
it was kinda poppy around

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:21.576
you could kinda just pop around on it

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:25.709
very playful board I liked

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.084
the way it buttered and nose

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.619
and tail presses that was really nice about it

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.521
with that soft flex it made it really

00:01:29.768 --> 00:01:32.768
easy on the knees and ankles

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:34.092
to hold that flex in the butters

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.040
that was a really awesome part about it

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:38.132
I was comfortable riding switch

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:40.200
180's spinning the spin weight was great

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.470
it's a pretty lite weight board for its size

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:44.670
and I really loved it, great control

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.380
great fun board

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:48.670
it was actually pretty stable as well

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:52.010
in the chop it kinda bounced around a little bit

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:54.800
but as far as a groomer board 

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.250
or an all mountain board 

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.480
I would say it's really nice

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:00.720
I would recommend this to somebody like myself 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.620
who just likes to make the mountain their park

00:02:02.114 --> 00:02:05.610
go out on the natural features 

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:06.810
find yourself a good little natural hit

00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:08.530
maybe a tree to ride up

00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:10.980
and jump off the top seemed be perfect for that

00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:13.030
just about everybody who's gonna wanna ride

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:15.470
all over the mountain all day

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:18.540
anybody who wants to ride from powder to

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.140
all mountain through trees

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.910
and then jib in the park a little bit

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:25.540
it works out great and

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:27.140
this board is amazing for all that

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:29.310
I recommend it for anyone intermediate 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
to advanced who just likes

00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:32.910
to have fun on a nice playful board

00:02:32.554 --> 00:02:36.050
I gave this board a shred cred of a 96

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:38.960
pretty steezy board

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:40.960
I gave this board a shred cred of a 96 

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:43.240
just because it was an amazing all mountain board

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:46.140
and all around board for every thing I needed

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:49.530
I gave it a 92 I thought it did really well

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.170
it was an exceptional board

00:02:50.643 --> 00:02:54.640
it gave a lot of flavor to the snow
