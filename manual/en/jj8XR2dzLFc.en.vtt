00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.820
hi I'm Joe Weisenfelder for cars dot com this is a 2010

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.710
Buick LaCrosse at the second generation
up their midsize sedan

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.200
it is a new platform and design partly
in China

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.949
which is you know problem seems little
bit weird but Buick is a huge brand

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.800
in China to pretty bold look up for a
Buick which is the direction they're

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.670
kinda going in

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.769
pretty a large real missus

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.800
a Buick signature they used to be on the
side

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.190
now they've got a kind of talk then you
can even see it from the side is this

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.649
angle for the hood kinda dished out
another element

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.520
this is called the sweeps Pierre if the
line that dips down comes back up a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.010
little more stylish than you probably

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.890
scene and do it before and I'm a small
element here this little

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.770
body colored square on basically it
allows the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.050
keyless entry Bob to communicate on

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.390
data basically bouncing off the chrome
lot of cars have a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.369
a button up like a black but it's kinda
ugly or some other form that doesn't

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:08.780
work

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.990
every fourth time use that not a bad way
to go

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.429
know the interior quality very nice I
mean

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.869
two-b_-one GM's had kinda three eras
have interior quality there was the

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.490
are not really trying era then there was
the a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.179
trying which was the previous generation
across

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.020
are not great and then now you have me

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.280
trying and succeeding era %uh this
really shows you what general motors

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.860
do when it but the effort and money into
it on

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.250
the materials quality is good I think
the design is kind of conservative

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.390
compared to something like

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.569
the Cadillac CTS whether the display
pops about the dash

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.399
are kinda classic gauges are really nice
and there's this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.729
LED kinda ambient illumination little
hard to think that it's not dark in here

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:55.170
but

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.789
generally speaking a big big improver so
even though to mid-size this platform a

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.700
little different than the Chevy Malibu
and the Saturn Aura

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.129
are still pretty roomy back here the
back the front seat as is all the way

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:09.440
back and I think me a lot a letter about
their

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.500
so I could have even more on pretty good
that way headroom

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.910
seems to be fine pretty wide see to
there's that center floor home

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.460
which doesn't make the best possible
same in the center here but it's pretty

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.970
wide

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.630
up alarcon for and then here

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.110
optional of course video screen to have
them

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.780
on the trunk not about size especially
cuz the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.990
back to be pretty roomy on and aside
from

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.370
being a good size with a pretty big
opening you've got a pastor in center

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.880
and with people so I am driven the 2010

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.180
Buick LaCrosse but from the look at that
it's a much better car than the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.120
first-generation

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.490
and I like the fact that they didn't try
to make it the new youth brand

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.200
it still kinda conservative but the
quality is up across-the-board

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.250
will cost more than the Chevy Malibu and
the Saturn Aura

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.590
are write a little smoother little more
luxury up
