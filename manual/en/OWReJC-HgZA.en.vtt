Hi I’m Chris and now we’re going to talk
about song structure. As you will listen to

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.160
songs with drummers, you will understand that
usually there is an intro and then you have

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.249
a verse or two then you have a chorus then
you have a verse and then you have another

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:23.240
chorus you have a climax maybe a bridge back
into the chorus soft verse and then end, okay.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.380
It varies, many songs vary from verse chorus
to bridge chorus, however you might think

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.000
about it. So what I’m going to do is I’m
going to assemble a mini song so it will allow

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.320
you to understand the techniques that I’ve
shown you and I’ll apply them to songs and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.579
so kind of give you a better idea of song
structure, okay. So here we go; we’re going

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.210
to start with a verse then we’re going to
do chorus, verse, chorus, and then I’m going

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.471
to end, okay. Now in a verse usually it consists
of high hat, snare, base drum, maybe a crash

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:05.290
at the end of the verse, okay. Then at the
end of the second verse, when we go into the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.460
chorus usually that is when we transition
down from the snare drum down to the toms,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.470
use the crashes and then we transition into
the ride, okay because the ride is mainly

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.969
used for the chorus. So allow me to demonstrate,
here we go. One, two, ready go.
