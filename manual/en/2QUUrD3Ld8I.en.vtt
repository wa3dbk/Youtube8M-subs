00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.470
We Brits like a good estate car.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.200
This is Mazda's, the Mazda6 Tourer, a car
styled with the company's Kodo design ethos

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.590
and bristling with a series of efficiency
technologies under the SkyActiv banner.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.160
More a collection of principles rather than
a focus on any one particular technology,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.200
SkyActiv starts with the creation of a strong
yet light-weight body.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.020
It's quite a handsome one in our eyes, with
nicely aggressive almost feline headlights

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.070
and, for the Tourer, a high window line that
tapers towards the rear.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.130
That high waistline creates a sensation of
security from inside, and there's a wide range

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.950
of adjustment for both seats and steering
wheel that makes settling yourself in easy.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.560
Rear seat passengers are well looked after,
too.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.040
The controls for the ventilation system are
well placed and operate with a satisfying

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.310
quality, while the instruments are pleasingly
illuminated and elegant in design.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.880
Many of the Mazda's functions are relegated
to the colour touch-screen and this is presided

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.700
over by an iDrive-style twisty-turny controller
mounted just behind the gear lever.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.360
We find these systems a little clunky to use,
particularly on the move, but at least with

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.460
the Mazda system you can revert to jabbing
at the screen or, if you're feeling brave,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.650
venture into the realms of the voice command
system.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.560
To be fair, Mazda's part of this system works
well, the TomTom satnav is less successful,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.560
though.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.021
Dictating addresses is painful, and there
are many strange mispronunciations: ask for

00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:39.929
directions to a petrol station and you'll
hear: *Navigate to the nearest petal station,

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.119
is that correct?* Still, if you are planning
on collecting a load of petals, you'll find

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.889
the cargo space to be very practical, with
cubby holes in the sides, an underfloor compartment

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.600
where you can store the retractable cover,
and clever hooks for shopping bags that also

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.399
double up as supports for the load floor so
you don't need three hands.

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.170
With the rear seats in place, there's 506
litres of cargo space, rising to 1,648 litres

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.990
with the seats folded, a process made easy
by a pair of levers in the boot walls.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.720
Four engines are available - two petrol and
two diesel - with our test car powered by

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.580
the excellent twin-turbo 2.2-litre diesel.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.599
It produces 175PS and 420Nm of torque, and
can sprint from 0-62mph in 8.0 seconds dead.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:38.210
It's not just punchy, though, but incredibly
refined, too.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.810
Efficiency is also a strong point, with even
our top-spec Sport model with 19-inch wheels

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.469
recording 61.4 mpg on the combined cycle,
with CO2 emissions of just 121 g/km.

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:53.220
We found it easy to maintain an average around
the 45 mpg mark, with long journeys likely

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.310
to achieve a figure usefully into the 50s.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.670
Some of this efficiency stems from Mazda's
i-stop system, which stops the engine when

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.430
waiting at traffic lights but can restart
again within 0.4 of a second, as well as their

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.569
i-Eloop system which recovers energy during
braking and uses it to power the car's electrical

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.189
systems.

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.340
The six-speed manual gearbox has been given
a satisfyingly stubby gear lever and a beautifully

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.870
balanced short throw, making it a pleasure
to use.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.709
The steering, too, has a sporty theme to it,
requiring just 2.57 turns lock-to-lock, making

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.480
it faster even than that in an MX-5.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.019
It's effortlessly manoeuvrable, too, with
an exceptionally tight turning circle.

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.890
Out on the open road, surface imperfections
are quietly filtered out, and even larger

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.569
bumps and pot-holes are quickly supressed
without imposing on the calm of the cabin,

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.660
although we will say that the 19-inch wheels
of the Sport model do produce a touch more

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.299
tyre roar than we'd like.

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.060
The handling continues the sporty theme, the
Tourer's light weight allowing it to respond

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.640
with finesse to changes of direction.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.599
In short, it's easy to have fun - something
that can't be said of all estate cars - and

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.230
it's particularly surprising how happy the
2.2 diesel is to be revved to its red-line;

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:15.360
and how refined it remains once there.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.720
The Mazda 6 Tourer, then, is efficient, well-engineered,
comfortable and refined.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.630
For most estate cars, that ought to be enough.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.920
But Mazda's engineers have gone further: it's
also engaging to drive and incredibly easy

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.950
to live with.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.980
This isn't just a good estate car.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.670
It's a great one.
