00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.320
two three species for it today
I get asked constantly about what kind

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.799
of foreground plant what kind of carpet
plant how can I get a carpet Dustin I

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.170
want to carpet in my tank
everybody emails me all day long I'm

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.189
gonna give you my one two three favorite
foreground plants here we go okay number

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.860
one baby cheers I'm gonna start with
baby tears I'm talking about baby tears

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.170
not dwarf baby tears okay I'm talking
about regular babies baby tears hc'

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.700
there so I'm just growing just rampantly
in its own setup in one of my 75 7 full

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.030
Sun quick note who saw this PC sunny
last week I talked about high groffle

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.939
and I put it under water that's a
growing you can see the difference there

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.439
you check out the video here as well on
that so uh yeah regular baby tears

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.160
absolutely love it here's why I love it
look I've seen this stuff growing wild

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.220
in South Carolina I'm sure it grows in
the southern states great great plant

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.360
nice stalk okay like thick enough stock
loves dirt okay you can see the video

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.420
here where I talk about how it's growing
I've showed you actually how it's

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.040
growing in a 40 tall I really really
like it I mean this plant can handle the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.650
abuse it likes to be done with some
substrate I don't have that great of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.920
roots and herbs you can see super
healthy super great I really recommend

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.330
this it needs trimmed as you can see in
that video over there so baby tears is

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.620
definitely definitely one particularly a
dirted tank like say a finer substrate

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.520
though because it's got smaller roots so
we can push down through the finer stuff

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.570
should definitely dirt underneath it
okay number two all right

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.920
star of gyne rippen's now look folks I
was late to the game on this I'm not

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.120
going to act like I was the first half
as playing up you know it's a sick sick

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.830
sick plant though hearty beefy like nice
little stem I've only seen it get about

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.459
that tall which is real hot by the way
side people that was on backorder for a

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.500
while I got a ton of them now though but
yeah star Gani rippen's wicked you can

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.840
see a photo of it in the legendary Tom
bars tank right here just super hot

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.280
little plant beefy you know great root
structure I believe it's related to high

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.590
groffle which is a hell of a hot plant
and hearty plant so that's awesome and

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.900
then finally here I want to talk about
my favorite dwarf sach you can see a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.950
link to the original species Sunday I
did when NOLA was just a little baby

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.110
now she's five but yeah dwarf said sure
folks this plant right here is like the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.989
og plant I've seen people growing it
obviously in dirt and it grows like

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.239
crazy without dirt you can grow it okay
just an amazing amazing plant like easy

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.530
just start off with the simple stuff
folks start with the easy stuff when you

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.560
master the easy stuff move on to the
hard stuff and I just want to make a

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.940
quick comment on this - okay everybody
wants the carpeting plants they want

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.730
that effect they see those sick
award-winning aquascapes and they're

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.160
sick as hell okay but I want you to
think about something here's the way you

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.400
think about carpeting plans short plants
come from shall

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.450
little-ass water generally speaking case
shallow shallow water okay so what is

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.829
shallow water do for us well we've got
this much water and I've seen baby tears

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.000
growing in the natural state okay very
very little water which means what which

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.229
means an assload of sunlight a sload of
sunlight okay so like ridiculous

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.990
sunlight like I'm growing them in a
greenhouse here okay so you got to

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.780
duplicate that in your tank you got to
do think that with intense light and

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.979
then more importantly you got to
duplicate the little plant might

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.960
actually come up out of the surface and
get that co2 rich oxygen or co2 you were

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.250
talking to co2 out of the air okay so
what do you need for the plants like

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.570
glosso dwarf air grass um
dwarf paragraphs of gloss so dwarf baby

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.830
tears particularly those three driving
me crazy in my opinion those need high

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.460
light and high amounts of co2 you know
look you can grow them if you have

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.870
ridiculously high light but you just
have them like you know very like the

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.660
lights like directly on top of them so
that's what I want to talk about today

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.580
folks so my top three baby plants again
here baby tears really is regular baby

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.919
tears not the dwarf baby tears star
