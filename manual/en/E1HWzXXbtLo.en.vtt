Hi. Today I will show you
how to make pineapple made from bottle and candies.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.500
We need:

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.180
...bottle of wine...
(or other bottle)

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.180
...glue gun...

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.960
...sisal...

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.220
...ribbon...

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.080
...green paper ribbon...

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.020
...scissors...

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.300
...yellow tissue paper...

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
...and candies.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.360
Wrap bottle in tissue paper.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:37.640
Secure it by using glue.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.020
Glue the candies to bottle (starting from bottom).

00:00:44.020 --> 00:01:00.140
1 pineapple = around 35 candies

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.920
Cut a strip from paper ribbon.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.880
Cut it lengthwise.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.740
Trim the ends and curl a little by using scissors.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:30.720
Glue the leaves above candies.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:43.500
Hide the connection spot by using green sisal.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.140
Tie the leaves by using ribbon.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.120
And it's done.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.160
