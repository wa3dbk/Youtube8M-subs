Hi everyone! This is Keith's Toy Box and today we are going to show you the Chuggington Construction Mega Bloks Wilson.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.100
This is available at Amazon and Mega Bloks for $8.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.260
Wilson is completely buildable and he has real working wheels. He's part of the buildable chuggers set

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.220
and he has eight pieces. Now let's open the box and look inside.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600
 Instructions.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.200
The instructions even come with a coloring page.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.780
Now let's take Wilson out. 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:13.500
So these are the pieces that make up Wilson. There are eight pieces all in all. Let's put Wilson together.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.260
There's Wilson.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.200
If you press down on Wilson's horn, his mouth moves.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.000
Let's ride the rails.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.540
Wilson has only one set of wheels for going down
on Mega Bloks Chuggington sets.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.020
These Mega Bloks chuggers work on this type of track. Let's try it.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.220
If you have other Mega Bloks chuggers, you can connect them too.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.660
You can combine them with other Chuggington construction Mega Bloks playsets for more fun.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.500
This is the Chuggington Construction Mega Bloks Roundhouse Racing Set.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.920
So that's the Chuggington Construction Mega Bloks Buildable Wilson.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.980
