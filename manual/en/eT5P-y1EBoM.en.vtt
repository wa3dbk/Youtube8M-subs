00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.100
meal, in here we have got some boiled broccoli which we have reduced

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.600
We have got some seaweed

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.500
which we have boiled up and then frozen

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.400
We have got raw oats and we have got milk and the milk

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.700
makes the oats more palatable and more
digestible

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.700
To this we add some fresh tripe

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.700
this is straight from the abattoir

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.700
So into the dogs dish goes the tripe

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.100
with the BARF Diet

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.900
The raw tripe really is a super food, with the enzymes

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.300
It's full of nutrients, it's full of minerals

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.800
It's nature's own pro-biotic

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.900
when you are preparing your own tripe

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
Make sure there are no foreign objects hidden in the tripe

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.100
we found this nail, could have resulted in
a very expensive that bill

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.200
so be careful

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.400
Three month old male bull terrier. Hello Spud here's your meal

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
Raw tripe, broccoli, seaweed

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.100
Milk and oats. Seams to be enjoying that.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.600
Spud is 12 weeks old, so

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.700
we need to make sure that the chunks
of tripe are small enough for him to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.100
swallow. Spud has three meals a day

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.600
rest the tripe is frozen and stored in
the freezer

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.600
The beauty about

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.200
cutting it into chunks rather than mincing it, is that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.600
the dog has to chew the meal

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.700
And this get's the teeth clean and releasing the saliva from the chewing

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.700
is actually natures own tooth paste

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.800
 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.200
Enjoying that Spud?

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.200
 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.600
it's always a good tip to feed your puppy by hand as well

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.600
This is good practice and save aggression at feeding

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.400
something we always try to do

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.500
All done?

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:23.500
Good Boy

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.300
Raw diet doesen't

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.100
doesn't produce anywhere near the bulk in
stools and they will be nice and firm

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.700
So easier to pick up. No Mess, No

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.200
Tarry oily smelly stools.  Your dogs will
become

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.100
balanced and content what more could you
ask?

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.800
Hope you enjoy watching my video. Hope you find it's useful

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.100
and most of all share it with your four legged pal

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.100
BARF stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food
