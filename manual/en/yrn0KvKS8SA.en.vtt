00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.260
Talking about alternate tunings still.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.450
We are talking about an open D tune.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.719
Alright, so what does that mean?

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.240
That means what we are trying to do is to
make the guitar sound like one chord.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.350
You know, right now, if I play the guitar,
there is no chord to that right?

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.580
So, what I am going to do is tune it to a
D chord.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.430
There is a specific way to do that.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.521
You are going to go ahead and drop your sixth
string down to D. So, I already have a D in

00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:32.410
the fourth string.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.739
Drop down my sixth string to D. and then I
am also going to get my first string, which

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.120
is E right now, down to D as well.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.969
So, Use the same method, we use that fourth
string D. Now, it gets a little trickier.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.460
We are going to need the second string to
be A, so I am going to use the fifth string,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.480
which is already A in order to tune down my
second string to match that.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.460
And then there is one more step.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.070
This one is a little trickier, because there
is no string that matches this.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.600
We need to try and get this third string to
be F sharp.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.540
So, erm, the way I do it is I am going to
go to the fourth string, alright, I haven't

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.540
moved that.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.360
And I am going to go to the note F sharp.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.040
That happens to be here on the fourth fret.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.040
Match that.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.910
And now, I get my D tune, open D tune.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.910
Alright?

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.810
So I don't have to even touch the guitar to
play D. So, a lot of blues guys might use

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.040
this to play slide guitar.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040
Right?

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.050
Or some folks who finger pick a little bit.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.480
They could get some interesting sounds from
playing like that.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.970
And then to play other chords, I can just
play one finger.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.020
Right?

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.960
That's how you make an open D tune.
