00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.240
In my experience of what my dharma practice

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.860
was like before I attended a Festival and what is was

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.160
like after attending a Festival

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.980
and I've shared that, next to being part of an

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.200
empowerment,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.520
the most significant event that has ever happened

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.140
in my dharma practice has been coming to Festival.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.580
It changed the course of my committment

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.440
and my appreciation of the teachings after being here

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.880
There's nothing, I think, there's nothing like

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.820
being in a room of hundreds, and thousands, really,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.620
of people meditating at the same time.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.460
The impact on my mind is just,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.460
it's unmatched; it's unparalleled

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.220
Having an opportunity to get involved

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.860
and help at the Festival gave me an opportunity

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.680
to really let go of a lot of that chatter

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.560
that I have in my mind when I'm doing my other,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.780
ordinary activities. But, being at Festival

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.280
and being able to work and stay engaged

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.300
was just a way to keep my mind

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.060
always present on virtue.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.840
I feel as if I was dedicated to the Path

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.780
of Kadam Buddhism before but, after going to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.120
that first Festival, and feeling my mind shift,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.260
that, for me, that was the fuel that I needed

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.100
to know that I wanted to dedicate to this practice 100 %

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.540
and it's never changed. It just keeps getting better.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.180
My oldest daughter, Kiera, is going to join me

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.700
for the Asian Festival in Hong Kong in December

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.580
I'm really excited about that. So she'll receive

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.360
the Highest Yoga Tantra empowerment

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.260
at the age of eight, which is amazing

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.100
so, I'm really happy about that.
