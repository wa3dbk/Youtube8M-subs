if you've been watching my videos for a
while you might have noticed that i'm

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.429
not always the most comfortable person
in front of the camera..

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.090
especially in my earlier videos from
way back a few weeks or months ago

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.470
you might have noticed that i a squirm
around a lot of my seat.. or that i don't

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.990
really look at the camera when I am speaking..

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.039
uh... or you might notice that I do a lot of
things with my hands

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.050
uh... mostly i think my biggest problem
is not speaking to the camera

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.949
uh... and uh...

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.510
looking around at look at other things
or just

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.960
st..stammering.. or having trouble getting
the words out of my mouth

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.860
this isn't really because i'm nervous
uh... a little bit nervous to the talking to

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.910
the the camera

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.390
uh... but it.. That's not the main issue
and i think the main issue is that when

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.090
i look at the camera on my iMac.. what I
see is a

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.859
black strip across the

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.769
top of the screen with a dead little
camera eye staring back at me and when i

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.460
look at it to talk to it

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.670
it.. there'd.. my mind just goes blank.. like
my mind and my brain just

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.960
stops processing

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.270
so you might have noticed actually
somebody that um...

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.060
follows me on Google Plus noticed over the
last

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.010
the last few videos, I've made some
improvements in being able to talk to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.060
the camera and she asked me.. She sent me a
message and ask what i did to you know

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.830
make improvements and i have no i'm no
expert there's still a lot of people

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.780
that i know

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.119
there were way more better at it and i a
m

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.280
and i'v got a long way to go uh...

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.520
but in this in in addition to just
practicing

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.570
I came up a little tip that has helped
somewhat it's made it easier for me

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.390
to be able to talk to the camera

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.630
uh... without uh... stammering and
looking all around and looking as

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.520
nervous..

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.070
so i want to show you my little friend

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.880
that helps me

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.270
if you see here

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.420
may have to taped

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.570
the face of a generic female

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.810
right over my camera so that the camera
can look right through it a little light

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.979
sensor

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.020
has a spot

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.780
to get through

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.029
and when i talk to the camera what i'm
doing is talking to

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:14.349
that face instead of.. Now I've removed
it.. i'm gonna start to freeze up

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.889
i talk to that face instead of the that
dead eye of the camera staring back at

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.439
me with it like a

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.720
dead zombie eye

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.159
uh... and makes it a little easier for
me to talk to... Now..

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.469
over time as i've practiced more and more..

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.169
um... and i do practice just talking to
an empty camera without ever

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:35.299
i do practice without not even recording
just talk to the camera but between that

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.289
practice

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:41.099
and having just this little face i got
this face from uh... MakeupAnarchist

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.510
dot com it's a make-up website may use
these

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.570
printouts to practice their makeup on..
But you could any face up there

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.049
i didn't want a real human face

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.219
uh... because i i want something more
generic.. I didnt want to feel like I was talking to

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.319
a real person.. But you could probably
use a real human face

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.029
that's helped me a lot so between that
and the practice and just talking

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.099
uh... i think i've made some
improvements according to the at least

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.749
one person the falls then google plus
she thinks i made some improvements so

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.309
if you have trouble

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.369
speaking to the camera in addition to
practice... Get "a friend" ...
