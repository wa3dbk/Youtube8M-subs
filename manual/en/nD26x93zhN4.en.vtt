Hi my name is Rachel and I'm the owner of
Austin Style watch dot com street fashion

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.820
site. And I'm also a freelance fashion reporter.
Today we are going to talk about how to clean

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.059
felt. Now felt is an amazing fabric, it's
great, I love it especially because you don't

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.090
have to hem it, you can just cut it out, sew
with it that's why it's great for crafting.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.250
Felt is awesome. But it's got one little weakness.
And that's that you can't wash it very well.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.099
You can't pop it in the washer. The washer
will tear it up and the dryer will shrink

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.260
it down. So for as easy it is to work with,
it's that hard to clean and take care of.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.980
So I would always hand wash my felt. There's
a certain school of thought that you can pop

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.110
it in the gentle cycle and that may work.
It might be fine but for my money, I'd hand

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.180
wash my felt. It's sort of like the particle
board of the fabric world. It's lots of little

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.960
fibers just kind of loosely held together.
While it feels sturdy it can just kind of

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.603
come apart. So it needs gentle treatment to
not weaken and fall to bits. So what we are

00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:09.530
going to do is hand wash it. Just take a basin,
we are going to use some warm water. We are

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.951
going to use a gentle detergent, something
like Wool lite is good. But pretty much any

00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:19.990
detergent will really work. Just take our
tiny bit of detergent and you can do this

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.960
in the sink if you want. Or a bathtub. Pour
a little lukewarm water, you don't want to

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.479
use anything super duper hot on this cause
heats sort of the enemy of felt. Then just

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.159
take your felt, dip it in there and just hand
wash it. And if you have stains just take

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.780
your time, hand wash the felt. You are going
to want to squeeze it dry but not wring it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:53.009
dry. So no twisting, it's very easy to damage
or manipulate this kind of fabric. So just

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.620
gently squeeze it. And we compress it a little
bit and when you've gotten out as much water

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.409
as you can, we are just going to air dry the
felt. Felt is not ever something that you

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.890
want to put in the dryer. So just put it out
to dry let it dry by air that will help it

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.750
keep it's shape. Don't pull it wring it move
it any, lay it flat to dry. That's how you

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.200
clean felt.
