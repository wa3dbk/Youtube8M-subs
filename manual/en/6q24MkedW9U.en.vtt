00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.410
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains
hold many treasures,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.940
among them the Peaks of Otter,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.480
which straddle a short section of the 469-mile
Blue Ridge Parkway,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.930
near a 10-hectare manmade lake

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.480
named for the Parkway's first landscape
architect, Stanley Abbott.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.929
Sharp Top's summit rewards hikers with sublime
360-degree views

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.070
of the Peaks of Otter's two other peaks,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.929
Flat Top

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:30.920
and Harkening Hill,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.439
as well as the Piedmont to the east,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.910
and the Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah Valley
and Alleghany Mountains to the west.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.610
The trail feels the touch of quite a few feet
year-round;

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.089
however, we discover that having the summit
to oneself,

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.390
even on a clear summer weekend, is possible.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.420
KARA&gt;&gt; The supermoon is tonight, so were
going to hike up Sharp Top.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.400
It takes about an hour-and-a-half to get up,
1.5 miles,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.860
and our aim is to get up there at sunset,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.659
have a picnic, see the moonrise, and come
back down by flashlight.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.170
NARRATOR &gt;&gt; And so we begin the 2.4-kilometre
climb through forest.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.840
After about 160 metres, the trail crosses
a bus road

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.500
and then continues its ascent.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.450
The forest canopy provides ample shade in
summer;

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.520
however, the humidity at this time of year

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.159
makes climbing the steep, rocky trail even
tougher!

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.759
We encounter a few hiking parties making their
descent,

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.700
but, aside from these brief hellos,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.179
the pitter patter of scampering squirrels,

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.979
and our own cooing when a white-tailed deer
greets us towards the summit,

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.579
the trail is quiet.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.299
After two kilometres, the trail reaches an
intersection.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.859
From here, you can make a side-trip to Buzzard's
Roost,

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.579
a rocky outcrop and overlook, 183m away,

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.020
or continue the last 580m to the summit.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.319
This last stretch incorporates a fair number
of steps

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.619
and passes plenty of hardy mountain laurel
as well as delicate wildflowers.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.700
The final approach passes a stone shelter
and a sign,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.549
which explains that Sharp Top was once thought
to be Virginia's highest peak.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.780
(Neighboring Flat Top is actually 38m higher
than Sharp Top,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.000
and 1746m Mt Rogers, in the far southwest
corner of the state,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.040
is the rightful owner of this Virginia superlative.)

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.069
As we settle upon the summit for the day's
remaining hours,

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.340
well above much of the rest of the visible
world,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.520
life's business seems far away.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.390
Here, our only chore is to rest,

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.560
and appreciate the majesty of the surrounding
landscape,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.220
until the sun sets and we head down the mountain,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.940
the full moon helping to light our way.
