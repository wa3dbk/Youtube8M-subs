00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.820
Here,
my Easy Bibimbap is done.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.520
It tastes very good.
I do hope you make it.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.190
Hello everyone.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.190
Today,
we are going to make easy Bibimbap.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.080
The ingredients are here.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.140
Hot boiled rice, bean sprout, carrot, spinach,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.030
sesame oil, dark colored soy sauce, salt,
thin sliced beef,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.610
Pre Cooked sauce for grilled meat and soft-boiled egg.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.650
Let's get started.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.480
First,
boil the vegetables.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.680
Boil the spinach.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.110
When you boil a leaf vegetable,
add salt to make the green color beautiful.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.180
And cut the stem part in a cross shape, like this.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.570
In doing so,
the spinach is cooked evenly.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.550
If overboil a green vegetable,
it become bad color.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.750
So, boil the stem part fast.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.900
After the stem part is boiled at some level,
boil all part.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.760
This technique is much the same for other leaf vegetables.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.940
After they are boiled,
Rinse the spinach immediately in cold water.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.060
Rinse it and make the leaf beautiful.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.530
Next,
boil the bean sprout and the carrot separately.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.900
Next,
season the boiled vegetables with sauce.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.770
Make Bibimbap sauce.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.900
Add the dark colored soy sauce.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.770
The salt.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.380
The sesame oil.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.540
Stir the liquid.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.400
Dissolve the salt enough.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.770
Add the sauce among the three.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.300
Apply the sauce to the vegetables.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.130
It will taste better while cooking the thin sliced beef.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.800
In the same way,
apply the sauce to other vegetables.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.150
Next,
cook the thin sliced beef.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:53.030
Add the beef to a pre-seasoned pan.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.250
Add the Pre Cooked sauce for grilled meat.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.260
Combine the beef with the sauce.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.510
The beef is cooked.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.520
Take out the beef from the pot.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.150
The beef is done.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.750
Next,
arrange to a dish.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.100
Today,
I think to place the soft-boiled egg in the center.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.040
Place the four fillings in four sides of bowl.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.240
the beef.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.330
The spinach.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.760
Today, we are using The spinach.
But there aren't rules in a vegetable's filling.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.800
You can add your choice of vegetables.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.800
Finally,
place the carrot and the bean sprout.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.160
Place the soft-boiled egg in the center.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.750
Finally,
Sprinkle the sesame seeds.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.860
Here,
my Bibimbap is ready.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.660
Here,
my Easy Bibimbap is done.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.460
It tastes very good.
I do hope you make it.
