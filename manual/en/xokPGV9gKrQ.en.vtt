"speaker 1: My name is Emily Finch and I'm
a graduate student in immunology and infectious

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:23.869
diseases.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.689
I look at how diet plays a role in disease.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.370
I'm looking at how we can use these dietary
interventions to prevent cancer like Leukemia.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.200
Leukemia is a disease that originates in the
bone marrow and there are these mutations.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.840
The one that we study is this chromosomal
trans-location that needs to the production

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.000
of this Philadelphia chromosome.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.930
This is what leads to the uncontrolled growth
of these tumor cells in the bone marrow.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.250
So we actually force this gene to be expressed
in bone marrow.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.360
Then we harvest the leukemia stem cells, LSE
population at the core facility and then we

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.409
can do different assays with those cells by
treating them with the compound of interest.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.280
The one that we look at is delta12-prostaglandin
J3 and this compound is unique because it

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.070
can be derived from the body, from changes
in your diet.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.030
An experimental day I'll get here around four
or five in the morning to start harvesting

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.110
these Leukemia stem cells because I have to
get them from bone marrow and then sort from

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.670
that population which will take an entire
day.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.770
And then after that, then that's in the afternoon,
is when I actually can start the assays.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.630
So those can end up being 12 to 17 hour days.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.539
Well I don't know, when I was a kid anyway
I used to always be mixing stuff up and like

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.329
playing with stuff and I sometimes feel like
I get to do that every day.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.920
Like I get to have, I get to design an experiment
and then try something out and if it works

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.049
that's awesome.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.189
Usually it does not the first time.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.529
So it just is a lot of manipulating things
and getting to really understand why something

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:08.110
didn't go well.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.560
I think that's probably my favorite part is
really just getting to explore these things

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.349
and Penn State and the Huck Institutes have
really been helpful for that.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.659
They, you really have all the opportunities,
all the equipment is here.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.750
It's just really, if you want to do it and
you put your mind to do it then you really

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.750
can.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.230
I also really love Penn State and love the
Huck Institutes because of how interdisciplinary

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.230
it is.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.360
I was a nutrition undergrad and now I'm doing
something that's taking that nutrition but

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.200
then looking at how it can play a role in
disease.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.480
I think that it will be a really cool thing
if people could just change their diets and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.519
have this leukemia stem cell population eliminated.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.980
Currently the chemotherapies will only target
the bulk cells of the disease.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.400
And that means that it leads to disease relapse
and these people have to take the drug forever.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.180
Even just this year alone there are going
to be, it's estimated that there will be 50,000

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.159
new cases of leukemia and 25,000 individuals
will die of the disease.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.120
So it is a prevalent disease.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.020
And if someone could have just one round of
chemotherapy and then change their diet, and

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.629
them survive from this disease, I think that
would be a pretty cool thing.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.510
I think that what we also are studying is
not just the dietary change.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.530
It's actually marketing this compound, D-12-PGJ3
as a pharmaceutical drug because it does specifically

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.270
target the leukemia stem cell population.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.469
And so far we haven't seen any negative side
effects of it.

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.630
Whereas with the traditional therapy there's
a lot of negative side effects.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.849
They don't specifically target cancer cells.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.579
They target your healthy cells too, meaning
that if you have some other sort of infection

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.959
or anything else going on, your body might
not be able to fight it.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.540
I'm going to be able to say that I was part
of this new wave of therapy.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.260
Like I said these, the targeting of a specific
cell type I think if where we're headed in

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.660
most therapies.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.400
Specifically in cancer though, looking at
the cancer stem population is really important.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.609
I think that if something could be made in
the body that may potentially, like it wouldn't

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.440
have as many negative side effects as something
just formulated on a bench top or in a tube

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440
somewhere.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.490
I think that the body is really the best machine
and that we have to try to, we're still learning

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.180
so much about what it makes and how it can
really be beneficial on its own.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.830
So being able to manipulate it to make the
things that we want is the, is why I think

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.820
this is really cool research."
