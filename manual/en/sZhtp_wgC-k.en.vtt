00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.440
It's fair to say that the media the past couple
years has had a serious love affair with zombies.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.890
But rather than just sitting down with Trisha
and talking it out in front of a bemused and

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.790
moderately repulsed studio audience, they've
taken it to the streets, shopping malls, forests,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.120
and anywhere else you can point a camera (or
plot a video game).

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.160
Shattered Haven might not have the vocal performance
or brand appeal of a Walking Dead, or the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.910
name recognition of a George Romero gig, or,
y'know, graphics past what you'd find in a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.080
16-bit console title.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.480
That doesn't mean it doesn't try, though,
to bring the action while managing to pull

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.280
at the heartstrings - and claw at the part
of the brainstem most receptive to visions

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.010
of eldritch abominations.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.839
In a world several years after the rising
of the "Grays," as they're known, a young

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.310
boy wakes up in a strange bed after being
rescued in the forest.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.820
A young girl of about the same age fills him
in on the situation, and gives him a tour

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.520
of the compound... only to be interrupted
by a frantic fellow survivor attempting to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.060
get in the gate 'cuz... well, zombies.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.460
He's let in, but immediately runs off like
the jerk he is, leaving these two kids to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.060
try to stem the tide of... oh, wait.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.280
That one's his mom.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.880
And since Dylan Moran isn't here to brandish
a firearm at her, they've gotta go give chase,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.549
out into the forest where they encounter...
a giant red squid with iron barbs on its tentacles,

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.890
hell-bent on... protecting them?

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.409
And then the gameplay shifts to the girl's
parents, who are then confronted by ANOTHER

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.390
eldritch abomination, and forced to travel
around and clear certain areas of zombies

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.290
else... well, it's not pretty.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.810
So it's off to small, instanced areas, either
by walking or by utilizing even more mysterious

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.350
portals, where there are zombies and landmines
and YOU GET TO BE THE BAIT!

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.770
Awright, so there's a bit more action than
just being a Running Buffet, as Shaun would

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.770
say.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.840
You can pick up an array of tools like hammers,
bear traps, axes, Servbot heads... wait, wrong

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840
game.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.310
But your most powerful weapon is... a simple
handful of nails.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.319
Iron nails, that is.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.350
Poisonous to zombies, as opposed to the steel
alloys used in most of the more reasonable

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.270
tools like axes and hammers and whatnot.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.120
So it's part keep-away, part run for your
life, part protect-the-AI-controlled-second-person

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.000
(since zombie drama is much better when you've
got someone to worry about).

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.250
Or they can just jump in and actually play,
using a gamepad or the other half of the keyboard

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.190
and yes, that sounds horrifyingly awkward.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.220
While I wouldn't call Shattered Haven a "Bad"
game, I do think it does a better job of telling

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.880
a story than presenting engaging gameplay.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.420
Sure, the shattered hellscape of a forest,
with its intermittent fires and inexplicable

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.420
sharks, does a fantastic job of setting the
environment, and the script makes the characters

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.330
immediately jump to life.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.660
But some control issues, especially as it
involves boats and maneuvering around water,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.310
really bring down the immersion... and don't
give me that Silent Hill "The Controls Are

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.790
Supposed To Be Bad" crap.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.050
I don't buy it.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.940
After all this vicarious training, I like
to think I'd be a little more adept in the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:25.730
face of a zombie apocalypse, thank you very
much.
