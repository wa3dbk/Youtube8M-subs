00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:12.366
 

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:16.999
This is a PDF document with
a layout table in the document,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.700
and some users need to magnify
their screen in order

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.733
to read the content,
which you can do directly

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.099
within Adobe Reader.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.166
But users who have
mobility impairments,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:37.699
or sometimes low vision users,
et cetera, will need to have

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
the text read in a way
that there is no

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700
horizontal scrolling.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.966
 

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:53.299
With the document not re-flowed,
it is difficult to read because

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.366
I have to find where
the horizontal scroll bar is

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:03.866
or use my keyboard commands
using the arrow keys

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:07.932
and slowly move back
and forth across the document

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:11.299
to read each line of text.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.700
This gets tiring on the eyes
and it can be difficult

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.966
to keep your place
in the document.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.966
 

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:29.066
To address this in Adobe Reader,
we can have the document re-flow,

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:37.066
which just means that it puts
all the content on one screen

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.766
with no horizontal scroll bar.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.199
So in this case,
the text is wrapped around

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.266
from line to line so that
you can vertically scroll through

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:50.332
the document but you don't
have to horizontally scroll.

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:54.233
This makes it easier for
many users to read the document.

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:54.366
