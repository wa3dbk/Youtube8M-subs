00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was on duty on a Saturday. We got 
 launched mid-afternoon on a SAR case. 

00:00:06.316 --> 00:00:14.316
Sector St. Pete wanted us to launch on an EPIRB hit 
 they were getting 30 miles west of the Skyway Bridge.

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:23.536
We launched from Air Station Clearwater and arrived on scene to find a capsized 
 boat and the two boaters were standing on the bottom of the boat

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.800
and they were getting pulled out to sea by 
 the currents. So we assessed the situation. 

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:37.675
Since we had good weather and light seas, we were going to first 
 harness the swimmer to assess the survivors for any injuries. 

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:46.686
So I harnessed deployed the swimmer down and he swam over, determined there 
 were no injuries and they were not in any imminent danger.

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:51.533
I then did two basket recoveries for the survivors, one for each person. 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.989
I then recovered the swimmer and we brought everybody back to Air Station Clearwater

00:00:58.027 --> 00:01:01.027
where the boaters were reunited with their families.
