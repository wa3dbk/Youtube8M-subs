00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:31.333
- [Orange] Okay, I'll stop now.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.308
Ah great, this is always really awkward.

00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:35.553
- [Apple] Yeah, when are they
gonna offer a no hands option?

00:00:35.553 --> 00:00:37.843
I mean really Nintendo,
it's so insensitive.

00:00:37.843 --> 00:00:38.705
Alright, who should I be?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.861
- [Orange] Obviously that
small red guy in the corner.

00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:41.944
Duh (laughs).

00:00:41.944 --> 00:00:42.956
- [Apple] Touche.

00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:45.114
- [Orange] Okay, looks like I'm player B

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:46.155
and you're player C.

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:46.988
The C must stand for

00:00:46.988 --> 00:00:49.728
can't reach stuff on
high shelves (laughs).

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:51.009
- [Apple] Yeah, well the
B stands for butthead.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:55.189
- [Orange] Nope, the B
stands for baller (laughs).

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.187
Okay, okay, quiet.

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:57.978
I need to focus if I'm
gonna roll the world's first

00:00:57.978 --> 00:00:59.208
thanksgaming turkey.

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:00.315
- [Apple] Thanksgaming turkey?

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:01.933
- [Orange] Yeah, it's when you
roll three strikes in a roll,

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:02.766
and then gobble like a turkey

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.984
until your opponent gets so annoyed

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:05.004
he storms out of the room.

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:06.068
- [Apple] I can't wait.

00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:08.368
- [Orange] Well I guess
the ole thanksgiving turkey

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.651
will have to wait until later in the game,

00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.204
but let's see if I can pick
up this sweet, sweet spare.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:13.095
- [Apple] Don't miss it Orange.

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:13.928
- [Orange] I won't.

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:14.761
- [Apple] Don't miss it Orange.

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:15.594

- [Orange] I won't.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.434
- [Apple] Don't miss it.

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:20.409
(arguing)

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.734
- [Orange] Not gonna miss
it, not gonna miss it.

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:22.567
- [Apple] Oh, no.

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:23.690
- [Orange] Ahh, I missed it.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.066
I missed it even worse than you
miss out on adult size rides

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:26.899
at the carnival.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:27.732
- [Apple] Aaugh.

00:01:27.732 --> 00:01:28.802

Alright, here's where
Little Apple takes the lead.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.714
- [Orange] Nice, pink ball you got there.

00:01:32.714 --> 00:01:33.676
- [Apple] I didn't pick it, the game did.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:34.523
- [Orange] Yeah, the game knew.

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:35.669
It knew you wanted a pink ball.

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:36.711
- [Apple] I didn't want a pink ball.

00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:37.885
I just got one at random.

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:39.574
- [Orange] (laughs) I'm
so in your head right now.

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:40.407
- [Apple] That's it.

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:42.041
I'm gonna roll a thanksgaming
turkey before you do.

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:43.077
- [Orange] Oh, you sure about that?

00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:43.910

- [Apple] Quiet you.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.793
Quit talkin' trash all the time.

00:01:48.793 --> 00:01:49.793

- [Orange] Spare a moment?

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:57.007
- [Apple] It's getting really, really old.

00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:58.283
- [Orange] Hey Little Apple, guess what?

00:01:58.283 --> 00:01:59.116

00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:01.432
Cuz I do.

00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:04.251
- [Apple] Just stop it, stop (laughing).

00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:05.164
- [Orange] Made you laugh, made you laugh.

00:02:05.164 --> 00:02:05.997
- [Apple] No you didn't.

00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:06.830

- [Apple] What, by looking at it?

00:02:22.327 --> 00:02:24.042

Okay, okay, okay.

Oh yeah, alright it worked.

00:02:45.752 --> 00:02:47.377
- [Apple] I'm trying not
to think of all the things

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:48.704
I could've accomplished
while waiting for you

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:49.537
to make that rule.

00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:53.898
Alright, that's it.

00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:55.543
Just because of that,
I'm rolling a strike.

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:56.376
Right now.
- Sure, sure.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.209
- [Apple] Here it comes.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.900
In your face.
- Yeah, keep talking.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.733
- [Apple] C'mon.

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.083

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:05.172
Yeah.

00:03:05.172 --> 00:03:06.368
- [Orange] Wow, I didn't
know you had such a big ego

00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:07.201
could fit in a small package.

00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:08.034
- [Apple] Whatever.

00:03:08.034 --> 00:03:09.812
You're just jelly.

00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:10.645
Alright, alright.

00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:11.765
Let's get that spare.

00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:12.598
- [Orange] Don't do it.

00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:13.431
- [Apple] Oh yeah.

00:03:13.431 --> 00:03:14.264
- [Orange] Oh man.

00:03:14.264 --> 00:03:15.265
- [Apple] That's right, that's right.

00:03:15.265 --> 00:03:16.639
Little Apple taking the big lead.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.727
- [Orange] Oh don't you worry.

00:03:17.727 --> 00:03:19.559
I got some tricks
underneath my peel still.

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:20.917
- [Apple] Yeah, but you're
gonna have to play amazing

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:22.350
in the last frame to catch up to me.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.565
- [Orange] Yeah I know,
I need to get a turkey.

00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:24.822
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

00:03:24.822 --> 00:03:26.635
- [Apple] Last chance, don't blow it.

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:27.851
- [Orange] Oh don't worry, I won't.

00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:30.273
I plan on having some winner,
winner, Thanksgiving dinner.

00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:31.106
C'mon strike.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:31.939
- [Apple] No.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.457
- [Orange] Yeah.

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:34.631
- [Apple] That was lucky.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.464
That was lucky.

00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:36.297
- [Orange] Hey, when I get this turkey

00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:38.147
I'm gonna gobble so long and so loud

00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:40.247
you'll have to put stuffing
in your ears to make it stop.

00:03:40.247 --> 00:03:41.514
- [Apple] You're not gonna roll a turkey.

00:03:41.514 --> 00:03:43.715
You still have to roll two
more strikes in a row dude.

00:03:43.715 --> 00:03:45.945
- [Orange] Indeed I do.

00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:47.296
Here goes nothing.

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:48.232
- [Apple] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:49.455
- [Orange] Boo ya.

00:03:49.455 --> 00:03:51.280
- [Apple] I can't believe that.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.172
- [Orange] Can you smell it?

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:53.215
Can you smell it Little Apple?

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:54.887
I smell a turkey cooking.

00:03:54.887 --> 00:03:56.157
- [Apple] Would you just roll already.

00:03:56.157 --> 00:03:57.470
We'll see who's laughing after this.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.218
- [Orange] We sure will,
and in honor of Thanksgiving

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:02.064
I will bowl this last
strike with my eyes closed.

00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:02.897
- [Apple] Bologna.

00:04:02.897 --> 00:04:03.730
- [Orange] Nope, I'm doing it.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.434
Please verify to the audience
that my eyes are closed.

00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:06.282
- [Apple] Fine, they're closed.

00:04:06.282 --> 00:04:07.479
- [Orange] And here goes.

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:08.312
- [Apple] There's no way.

00:04:08.312 --> 00:04:09.145
- [Orange] Oh, yeah.

00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:10.488
What, no way.

00:04:10.488 --> 00:04:11.321
- [Orange] Oh yeah.

00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.840
- [Apple] No way.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.199
- [Orange] Hey guess what Little Apple?

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.032
- [Apple] What?

00:04:15.032 --> 00:04:16.031
(gobbling)

00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:17.122
- [Apple] No, stop it.

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:17.972
Stop it.

00:04:17.972 --> 00:04:18.930
Quit it.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.457
Okay, that's it, I'm leaving.

00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:21.290

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.628
Alright, you win.

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:23.461
I'm leaving.

00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:24.294
- [Orange] Where you going, come back.

00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:25.343
- [Apple] No, I'm not coming back.

00:04:25.343 --> 00:04:27.268
- [Orange] Okay, but I have
one more thing to say to you.

00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:28.101
- [Apple] What is it?

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.292
(gobbling)

00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:30.789
- [Marshmallow] Television.

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.031

00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:32.864
Oh my goodness.

00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:33.878
I love you TV.

00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:34.915
You're my best friend.

00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:35.927
Oh, let's go.

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:39.213
Let's go on an adventure
to the dancing lights.

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:40.868
Whee.

00:04:40.868 --> 00:04:41.701
Alright.
