00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.200
The Cabrera National Park is the only land and maritime park in Spain.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.960
It is a group of 19 islands and islets, 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.160
and represents a true haven for the Mediterranean species, 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.160
both for the birds and the fish.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.920
This archipelago is an important refuge for endangered birds 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.720
like the Audouin´s gull that has found here its ideal place to breed. 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.000
As regards to gulls the yellow-legged gull is the most common. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.600
The action of the seawater on the limestone rocks

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.720
 has resulted on the creation of a lot of grottos and caves.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.120
The vast extensions of posidonia seaweeds are indicative of the cleanliness of these waters.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.680
The seabed of Cabrera has some tropical feel to it. 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.200
The pristine and bright water allows for the existence of numerous animals and plants 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.640
at deeper sea areas than usual.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.680
Diving here is a delightful experience. 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.040
The gorgonians, the sea plumes and the corals abound in this area. 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.600
In spite of their plant-like appearance, they are animals. 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.000
The most common ones are the Yellow Gorgonians and the Violet Gorgonians. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.440
Thanks to current conservation efforts, 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.560
they are being restored little by little from the plundering they have been subjected to.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.400
 Scuba diving in Cabrera is a pleasure.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.840
 A lot of curious fish gather around the divers.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.720
The conger eel is a trusting fish that in spite of its double set of teeth

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.200
 one can feed them directly from the hand.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.800
As a general rule they don’t attack you.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.080
Since underwater fishing was banned 10 years ago,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.320
 fish have become used to the visits and trustfully approach them.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.800
A scorpion fish comes out of the gorgonians. 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.960
Like many rockfish its best weapon is to go unnoticed. 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.360
If necessary it would use another means of defence, 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.160
a venom hidden in its spines, but only in case it is attacked. 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.280
That’s not our intention of course…

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.960
Like these fish we also prefer to go unnoticed.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.200
From the sea, the grouper.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.440
 Here this fish lives very much at ease.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.320
 In the ocean depths we find more than 200 species of fish. 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.360
Some of them don’t look very friendly

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.280
We find meagre, sea bream, barracuda, grouper, red porgy…

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.640
Some may take too many liberties.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.800
 They even look like they have become attached to us.
