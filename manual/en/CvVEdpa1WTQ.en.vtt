00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:09.570
Hey, everybody.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.910
Jamin here from "Game/Show"
with my weekly vlog update.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.034
So I wanted to take a look
at a very, very interesting

00:00:16.034 --> 00:00:18.450
development that's happening
in the world of a game called

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.480
"Rust," which is a
big incredibly popular

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.730
PC-based open world type game.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.350
It's engendered a lot of
very strange activities

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.100
is amongst its players.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.800
But in an update by
the devs most recently

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.580
two weeks ago, they made a
really, really interesting

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.290
change.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.150
That added a bunch
of different races.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.100
Now, you might be
saying, look, there's

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100
lots of games that have
different races in them.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.010
Here's the catch.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.890
In "Rust," the race
and the facial features

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.505
are actually chosen for you.

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:47.630
So it's not like it was a
character creator and you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.560
can decide what race you want
to be. "Rust" totally decides.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.200
And it's linked to
your Steam account.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.600
So it's absolutely the
same from game to game.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.810
Before, all the characters were
white and kind of clone-like.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.330
So it adds obviously
a spot of diversity.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.430
And not everyone gets a
unique skin tone and face.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.010
So the faces piece of it,
as a developers have noted,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.571
is a bit of a work in progress.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.820
But here's what's really,
really interesting about it.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.440
They made some really
interesting observations

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.360
about the nature of race.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.776
I mean, obviously some people
are not happy about the fact

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:20.700
that you might just
end up as an Asian guy

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.994
or as a black guy, which
is sort of ironic, because

00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:26.160
in a lot of games, for
example, that I have to play,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.230
that sort of decision
is made for me.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.700
So there's an interesting
bit of comeuppance

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.150
there in terms of getting
characters who are nonwhite

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.420
or players who are non-white
to experience what it's

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.880
like for everyone else
who doesn't get to choose,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.895
which is the vast
majority of games.

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:43.660
One of the interesting things
that Garry Newman he said

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.586
was that players just--
it was really interesting,

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.460
because they had
established this world where

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.710
all the characters were white.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.472
It was really, really
difficult to introduce

00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:55.930
nonwhite characters into the
game-- for example, the darker

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.760
characters-- because they felt,
quote unquote, "black up."

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.140
And he actually links to
a page about blackface.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.515
The reason why is if you see
all the characters are white

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.860
all the time, any kind
of additional skin tones

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.250
makes you feel
like it's perhaps,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.574
quote unquote, "too dark."

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:09.990
He also said-- and
this was really

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.990
interesting in the blog
post-- that it shows you

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.500
how arbitrary race actually is.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.910
Now, here's what's really cool.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.740
This experiment by "Rust"
is virtually unheard of.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.350
Obviously, I've talked a
lot about race in games

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.980
and how there is obviously
a lot of underrepresentation

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.777
on the side of game characters.

00:02:27.777 --> 00:02:29.360
And some of this is
technical, as I've

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.401
talked about in the past.

00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:32.780
Some of it has roots
in chiaroscuro,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.810
for example, in that black
characters are often placed

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.702
in the background and
lighter characters

00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:38.910
are placed in the foreground.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.060
That's a common thing
that's talked to artists

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.130
as part of art theory.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.754
And it's part of how we
understand Western art.

00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:46.920
Obviously, that's no excuse.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.320
But one of the other big
reasons why we don't see as much

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.143
of these kinds of experiments
is because it's rooted

00:02:51.143 --> 00:02:52.310
in the technology itself.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.510
So if you go back
to the original NES,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.309
it was only capable of spitting
out 54 different colors,

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:59.350
which really isn't a lot.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.285
I'll link to an interesting
post that David D'Angelo,

00:03:02.285 --> 00:03:04.670
the designer behind "Shovel
Knight," where he talked

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.530
about some of the constraints
that they had in terms

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.690
of trying to make a new
old game-- basically

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.070
a game that is made with modern
technology but is sort of

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.785
made to look like
an old NES game.

00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:16.743
And color's one of the
things that was actually

00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:18.570
really difficult
for them, particular

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.100
getting darker or darker tones.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.660
So then, after that,
there were also

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.010
these games that had character
generators as well so you

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.060
can choose what your race is.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.730
And that's certainly
a step forward.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.410
Again, it's nothing like
this experiment in "Rust."

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.210
And it's a step forward.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.970
However, there are a lot
of problems along the way.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.640
So like in "Fallout
3," for example,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.340
selecting a black
character would

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.440
result in these
gross green splotches

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.690
on a character's face.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.549
Or if you go in GTA online
and you go into a salon,

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.840
you'll find a list of possible
haircuts for the player.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.030
Yet there's only two that
have an afro texture.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.650
Or cornrows in "Dragon's
Age," for example,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.460
if you make a
dark-skinned character

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.380
like the noble
background, your parents

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.635
will be noticeably white,
which just sort of implies

00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:03.843
that the character isn't
actually black or is adopted

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:05.025
or whatever it might be.

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:06.650
There's an interesting
thread in Reddit

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.840
that I'll actually link to.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.750
And part of the problem is that
race is more than just skin

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.250
tone.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.930
It's more than just color.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.530
It's facial features as well.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.570
So it's not always
just enough to say, oh,

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.190
we're going to have a wide
variety of different skin

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.010
tones, but not have a
different facial structure.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.030
So for me, for example, I
have slightly high cheekbones,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.960
which comes from my
mother's side, which

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.699
is a total mix of Mexican,
Welsh, and English.

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.990
But then my hair is sort of
a mix of my mom and my dad.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.040
My dad is black.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.000
It's obviously a lot
tighter curls, a bit napier.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.680
My mom's is totally straight.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.070
She's very fair
for being Mexican.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.030
And so I end up with this kind
of amalgam of facial features.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.790
I guess you could just change
the skin tone or whatever.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.615
But that wouldn't really fully
capture my racial identity.

00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:54.990
What's interesting-- I always
try to look at these things

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.090
from an outside context.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.673
I think that this
experiment in "Rust"

00:04:57.673 --> 00:04:59.840
speaks to some
larger things that

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.640
are happening outside of
the world of game as well.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.700
One good antecedent to this idea
that a character's race, which

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.970
is what is arbitrary,
which is basically

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.840
what Garry Newman,
the developer said.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.309
He's like, it really
shows you, when you change

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:16.600
the character's race in "Rust."

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.860
It shows you how arbitrary
those distinctions are.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.320
One place where you're seeing
some of these experiments

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.410
is actually on
Broadway, where there's

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.840
this legacy of what's called
colorblind casting, right?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.350
So obviously, if
you have a play,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.770
for example, like Billy Elliot.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.370
That's a specific person.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.490
But on Broadway,
they've also try

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.940
to increase diversity by trying
to have nonwhite characters

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.590
play traditionally
what characters.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.665
For example, Keke Palmer
has been playing Cinderella.

00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:47.670
I mean, there's nothing
in Cinderella's story

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.710
that makes her white.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.480
It's just that it's how we know
her from the Disney movies,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.490
for example.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.740
So it's cool to see casting
directors experiment with that.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.700
Also, obviously, Idris Ebla in
"Thor," which obviously also

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.910
caused some backlash as well.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.410
But it's nice to see-- I
think that this experiment

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.994
by the developers of "Rust" is
a really, really important one.

00:06:07.994 --> 00:06:09.368
I don't think
they've been trying

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:11.564
to make a political statement
or anything like that.

00:06:11.564 --> 00:06:13.730
I think that they just
wanted to introduce diversity

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.690
into this world.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.070
And they thought it would
be really interesting is

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.500
if you took the choice away.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.810
Because, remember,
there's lots of games

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.810
in which the choice of who you
are is taken away from you.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.510
In fact, that's most games.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.880
There's a particular character.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.170
There's no custom character
creator or whatever.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.910
You're just sort of
given this person.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.730
So it should then
follow that it really

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.052
shouldn't be that controversial
to just make someone,

00:06:34.052 --> 00:06:35.510
when they sign up
to play the game,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.290
be a wide variety
of different things.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.950
So I think it's an
awesome experiment.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.860
And I hope they
continue with it.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.690
The game is obviously
still in development.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.960
I'll link to all
the different things

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.310
that I talked about
in the description.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.640
And I look forward
to your comments.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.598
I'll see you next week.
