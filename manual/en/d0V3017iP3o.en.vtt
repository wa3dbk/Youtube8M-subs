Hey everyone, Melissa here
from Accessory Geeks.

00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:10.967
What I have today is the Casio gZone Commando
C771 and the original Body Glove

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:13.900
Snap-On hard case with
adjustable kick stand.

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:16.967
So as you know this phone in itself is
pretty rugged and durable but it never

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.033
hurts to have the extra protection
of a Body Glove.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.900
So this case is really cool.
It has the ultimate custom fit for the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.467
maximum protection.
It's the original Body Glove case so it

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:33.233
has the velvety inside.
So you put your phone in there and you

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:40.767
put the top on, snap it into place, and it
has everything still totally accessible

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:47.567
including camera.
So not only is this a rotating belt clip

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:52.733
but it doubles as a kick stand.
So you just snap this part down and there

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:58.767
you go - you have a multifunctional kick
stand because you can put it however you

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:04.800
want and it still works.
But say you don't want a belt clip,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.833
you don't need it - Body Glove
has that taken care of.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:11.567
So not only is the case pretty easy to get
off because it has a coin slot feature

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:24.133
so you literally use a coin to get it open
- it's a little tough but that's what you

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:32.233
get with Body Glove.
And then once you get it off - so there's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.433
a little tab here - well first you
have to take this part off.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.833
So there's a little lever down here, you
push it -- that comes off, and then don't

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:44.267
drop it like me.
And then as you can see it has that so

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.800
you literally push that out.
So it comes with just a plain one that

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:58.067
you push into place - there you go, you
have your phone, you don't feel it

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:03.267
necessary to have the belt clip.
It's totally protected.

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:07.733
It has that nice textured glove material.
It's a great, great case from Body Glove.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:12.667
So this goes for $24.99 on accessorygeeks.com
where there's always

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:16.267
free shipping and don't forget
that you got it from a geek.
