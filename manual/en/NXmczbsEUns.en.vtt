00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.019
Joseph Cronin: "'Theory You' is a book designed for young
professionals who are looking for a source

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.790
and a guide to help them in the development
of their career, from day one all the way,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.740
hopefully, all the way into the corner office
when they become CEO. I was a former professor

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.470
at Northeastern University in Boston, and
having had a relationship with my students,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.039
I had a feeling, as they went into the marketplace
and found new positions for themselves, that

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.699
there was a lack of mentoring that existed.
And so, the book provides a mentoring type

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:43.829
of situation. One of the things that I've
discovered is that people who are not good

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.010
at managing others are also not good at managing
themselves. And so, if they can learn to manage

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.579
themselves, they can then turn around and
be able to manage others. And so, the book

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.120
starts with 'Here's how you can manage yourself,
and here's how you can learn and segway into

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.120
managing others.'"

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.359
Self-Publishing

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:09.410
"I felt that the process to go through traditional
publishers was going to be so time-consuming

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.690
that I didn't really want to use up all my
time in trying to find a publisher. I wanted

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.020
to get the book into the marketplace immediately,
because I knew the need existed, and I knew

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.090
there was nothing else like that, like my
book, in the market. So, it was timing more

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.400
than anything that I made the decision to
self-publish."

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.720
Choosing Xlibris

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.290
"I felt that Xlibris was the most well-known
and trusted brand that I could find. I have

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.950
to say that the Xlibris team has been extremely
personable, extremely helpful. We have never

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.500
missed a deadline. In fact we've gone the
other way, we've been early on some things.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.890
I got a little surprised. 'Oh, that's ready
already?' And I think all of the people that

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.370
I have dealt with so far have really delivered
on what I thought the brand would deliver."

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.260
Writing for a Cause

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.430
"If the book had not been published, then
a lot of young people would be searching in

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.280
their career, trying to make sense of, 'What
do I do in this situation? Am I making the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.330
right decisions? Am I going down the right
road? Do I have a good strategy for myself

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.860
or do I even have a strategy for myself?'
I saw something, a need that existed, and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.000
I think I have given people a potential solution
to that need."
