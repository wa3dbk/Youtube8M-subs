I'm Julia Szabo, also known as a Pet Reporter,
and I am the "Living with Dogs" columnist

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.420
for dogster.com.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.950
I've actually written 6 books and I'm hard
at work on my next one.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.760
It will be about about dogs -- that's as much
as I can say right now.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.950
I love dogs and I think nobody's life is complete
without one.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.270
So I'm here to tell you about a variety of
different dogs breeds that might suit your

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.270
lifestyle.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.920
I hope you'll adopt one soon.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.020
The French bulldog is an adorable little companion.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.640
So adorable in fact, that there are French
bulldog meet-up groups literally in every

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.050
city in America, pretty much.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.420
And these people take their dogs, and their
dog's social lives, so very seriously.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.000
They love getting together and just celebrating
every aspect of having, and living with, and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.290
loving a French bulldog.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.879
They're a classic example of what's called
in Latin "multim in parvo".

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.890
That's a big, sort of, dog fancier's term
which really means "a big dog in a small package".

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.580
I think that's probably the secret to the
popularity of the French bulldog; is that

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.100
it is a small dog but it's a tough little
dog.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.860
It's built like a mini-Mack truck, and has
a wide chest and a certain tough bully stance.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.200
And they're so sweet and cute.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.479
The only thing you have to remember with a
French bulldog is that they have what's called

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.110
a brachycephalic conformation, which means
they have a short pushed in face.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.439
And you know, that's exactly why we find them
so cute, because they look like little bats,

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.640
or little froggies.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.259
But that conformation actually makes it hard
for them to breath in very high temperatures.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.080
SO if it gets really hot outside in the summer,
you want to be sure to have air-conditioning

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080
for your Frenchie.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.060
You want to maybe not take her out at the
high-point of the day when it's like, 1 p.m.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.260
and, you know, 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the
shade.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.400
So just a few considerations for Frenchie,
and you can have just years of fun with this

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.200
little clown.
