00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:09.190
[Music]

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.700
Night vision is soooo 2013...2014 is all about
thermal. Thanks to Darren Rogers, better known

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.750
as the Prince of Darkness on our airgunning
programme AirHeads, bringing along his GUIDE

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.449
thermal unit we're producing some quite terrible
images -

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.990
Here are some unflattering shots of our foxers
tonight, starting with Roy Oompaloompa Lupton,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.510
Gary, the little-known seventh member of Village
People and David, looking like a Roy Orbison

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.409
tribute act from beyond the grave.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.829
Needless to say Darren remains the other side
of the thermal for this picture.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.900
As well as a superb spotting tool, thermal
also shows Roy's glow. Now, we know he has

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.100
a natural aura anyway, but today it is supercharged
thanks to a thermal waistcoat he's been sent

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.100
to test.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.459
I don't need a bigger one, it is perfect.
It is meant to be snug.

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:07.729
It's a snug fit and we'll see how it performs
later - Let's crack on with those foxes.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.520
After the other day when we came in here and
we squeaked the fox in but unfortunately David

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.031
was having trouble when he was doing his best
Mr Magoo impression and couldn't see the fox

00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:23.860
in front of his face. De big thing, with de
big pointy ears and long nose is foxy yes?

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.200
In front of you.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.740
We have a customer in the distance, but he
isn't budging - Roy uses mouth calls and the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.560
Western River too. The thermal picks up the
deer in the distance and a few rabbits but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.420
nothing fox-like appears.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.229
Our next field offers Darren a great chance.
He's using night vision tonight and the Nightmaster

00:01:47.229 --> 00:02:03.079
IR illuminator draws in the fox in like a
tractor beam. It's a done deal.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.270
I think David should have got that one on
camera, hopefully. So it was quite a large

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.630
fox he shouldn't have been able to miss it.
We shall see if we get any more. You are getting

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.940
some abuse tonight. Sorry mate. Hope I don't
miss, that isn't very nice is it. Why would

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.140
you say something like that. That really is
quite cruel isn't it. Let's go and get one.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.900
It's a beautiful evening with a clear sky
- and we're finding foxes. This next one is

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:37.819
a little shrewder. Giving us a bit of a runaround,
Roy has to get above it...

00:02:37.819 --> 00:03:10.370
Where is it going. In the process of coming
up we spooked it and it went down into the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.320
thicket there and was obviously making its
way through the bracken. We squeaked a little

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.480
bit more and got it to look back and put the
lamp on it again and it disappeared and we

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.080
just held the lamp above it so we could get
the scope somewhere near it and just as Darren

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.010
put the light down on it it just allowed me
enough time to get a shot. Second one in.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.060
Tonight Roy is using the Australian made Max
Box magnetic rifle rest from Pro Duck &amp; Goose

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.740
Hunting Supplies. It was actually meant for
Mr Crow, but as he's been giving the budgie

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.700
smugglers an airing in some hot climate he
hasn't been around to stop the Lupton nicking

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.189
the swag bags he has blagged.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.420
Ditch the bipod to give this a go and so far
I am very impressed with it. It holds the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.549
rifle really nicely and it is very easy to
just swing about it gives you a really steady

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.239
almost bench rest form of shooting. So for
long range shots I would have thought that

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.890
is going to be really good. It has also got
magnets in it which for the top of the gator,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.659
because we have got wooden tops is not going
to do much for us tonight, but if you were

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:15.990
shooting off the top of a pickup or whatever
else it would be superb, but so far I am impressed

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.990
with it.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.280
The fox is a large dog fox with impressive
canines...

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:28.290
After admiring the dentistry - Darren's back
in the chair.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.220
Roy's calling works again - and again we have
to manouevre to get ourselves in a position

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.480
with a suitable backstop..

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.170
We have got a full moon tonight so it is not
the ideal conditions. We are literally like

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:46.310
pimples on a back side. He ran down to the
hedgerow here and as we came down he was crossing

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.560
back in to come back into the thicker cover
back here and stopped perfectly right in the

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.420
middle so offering a fantastic opportunity.
We just pulled the gator and Darren got on

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.700
him, squeezed the shot and we are number three
for the evening.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.130
This time it's a vixen.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.630
Now as we're heading toward midnight the temperature
is falling but someone on the gator is feeling

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.800
warm and smug - sorry snug...

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.030
So you have got three different heat levels
so I am not that cold yet so I will leave

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.060
it on a medium. I will give it a warm up on
a nice two there and see what that does.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.160
How much does it take to cook a Lupton.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.240
Cook a Lupton, I don't know. Is it normally
15 to 20 minutes a lb for rare. We could be

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.570
here for a long time.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.150
We'll see how he's looking with the thermal
camera in a bit - back to the foxes and Roy

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.200
is in the saddle.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.881
To give his mouth a rest, the Western Rivers
call is blaring out the familiar tunes. Roy

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.510
has uploaded some of his own calls which have
been successful.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.430
So we have got one on the harmonica type from
Best Fox Call and we have got another one

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.460
on the Silver Fox and what we have done is
down loaded those onto MP3's and David has

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.270
sent them over to me and we have put them
on the caller there and it does work quite

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.220
well. So towards this end of the night when
your lips are feeling a bit puckered out you

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.160
can just sit back and play it on the machine
and you have got exactly the same effect if

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.810
you were mouth calling yourself.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.030
He's really having to coax these foxes out
tonight - but eventually he manages to get

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.300
one in a shootable position.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.500
Look at the size of you son.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:36.200
So four in the bag and, as Darren says, we've
had worse, especially given the entourage.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:43.520
What with two camera men, two rifles, someone
driving, moonlit night. I think we are doing

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520
quite well.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.850
He has got some daggers on him.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.240
This last dog fox is the biggest of the night.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.820
All that remains is to show just how toasty
Roy's been with his new waist coat and to

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.090
make some funny faces - some intentional - some
natural.
