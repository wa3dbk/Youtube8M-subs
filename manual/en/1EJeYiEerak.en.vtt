00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.700
Chart C is the only pattern – the only chart
that you’re actually going to need to keep

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.700
count on.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.110
You’ll want to use a row counter or little
tally marks on your pattern or whatever, because

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.700
it’s an eight row repeat, and every fifth
row is the cable twist.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.090
And I have this sample set up right now so
that I can show you how to work the cable

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.890
twist.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.030
Here we are at our work.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.809
I’ll slip the marker, and here are the stitches
in our big puffy cable.

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.760
For every other row except for row 5, you
just purl one, knit 8, purl one.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.841
And then do the opposite on the other side,
which is knit 1, purl 8, knit 1.

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:53.530
But right now I’m going to show you how
to work the cable twist.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.990
I lost my stitch marker.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.110
Okay, first up, purl the first stitch, then
you’ll need a cable needle.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.650
And you’ll slide 4 stitches on the cable
needle, and hold in the back of the work.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.230
You’ll just let it hang there and ignore
it.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:21.760
You knit the next 4 stitches off of the left
needle.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:31.970
And then go back to the cable needle, and
knit four stitches off of there.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.180
Then purl the last stitch.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.611
The purl stitches give us a background for
all the twists and turns going on with cable.

00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:46.030
So you see, I put a twist in the work.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.690
The interesting thing about cables is they
look twisted, because they are.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.800
The work is actually flip flopped and twisted
around to give this effect.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.000
Now again, all wrong side rows are the same.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.960
I’ll turn my work.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.330
It’s always knit one, purl 8, knit one.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.119
Always, always, always, that never changes.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.861
It’s only the fifth row on the right side
that changes every eigth row.

00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:19.230
And that’s Chart C.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.760
After you finish the blanket – you’ll
follow the pattern to see how all these things

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.880
line up, if you’re following along with
the pattern for the baby blanket that we’re

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.090
using here.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.340
After you finish the whole blanket and you
do a top border of the long moss stitch, then

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.950
you will definitely want to block this out
by giving it a full wet block in a sink of

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.130
wool wash, or you can probably get away with
steaming this, because the yarn that we’re

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.010
using is merino and really soft wool.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.870
But that is how you’ll get your cable – your
cable twists, Chart C, which we just did right

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.250
here, to lay out flat and be beautiful before
you present the baby blanket as a gift.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.250
Good luck.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.420
