00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.760
(battle cry)

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.440
(lightsaber sounds)

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.940
(electrical explosions)

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.380
The Force is with you, young Skywalker

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.460
But you are not a Jedi yet.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.660
Not until, you learn to count to 10!

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.020
(battle cry)

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.300
(electrical explosion)

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.320
(sound of using the Force)

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.940
Luke, I am your father...

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.460
and it is my duty to teach you how to count.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.260
Now, look over there.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.320
No, way.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.420
I'm not falling for that old trick, Vader.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.700
You're trying to distract me.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.620
No!  I'm trying to teach you.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.720
Now, look!

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.320
B - 17...

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.680
B - 17...

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.700
Bingo!

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.360
How many Stormtroopers do you see over there?

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.060
I don't know...

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.600
I'm not sure.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.000
Well...

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.760
If you're not sure.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.020
Then it's best that we count them.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.000
Are you ready?

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.220
1

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.360
2

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.360
3

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.540
4

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.540
5

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.600
6

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.540
7

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.640
8

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.580
9

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.520
10

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.100
There are 10 stormtroopers in the Bingo Hall.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.560
(battle cry)

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.560
(electrical explosion)

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.820
Luke!

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.580
You didn't count with me.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.280
Well...

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.100
I'm sort of busy, right now.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.120
(exhaling with frustration)

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.220
A Jedi always makes time to learn, my son.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600
(lightsaber sounds)

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.280
(electrical explosions)

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.600
Luke...

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.300
You're about to get another opportunity

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.340
to learn how to count

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.100
and thereby complete your Jedi training.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.180
Look over there!

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.540
(mouse droid noises)

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.960
Let's count the Mouse Droids together

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.140
as they scurry across the hallway.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.140
Ready?

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.580
Count with me.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.780
1

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.680
2

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.500
3

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.680
Luke, I don't hear you counting.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.080
(battle cry)

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.800
(rapid electrical explosions)

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.220
You're wasting your time, Vader.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.900
I'll never join you!

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.020
(massive electrical explosion)

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.020
(exhaling in frustration)

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.980
If I can't get him to count on his own

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.580
I'll use the Force and make him count.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.240
Vader:  1

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.380
Vader:  2

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.320
Vader:  3

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.740
Luke:  4

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.700
Luke:  5

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.620
Luke:  6

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.340
Luke:  7

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.520
Luke:  8

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.500
Luke:  9

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.420
Luke:  10!

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.260
(wink sound)

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.420
Excellent work, my son.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.700
Learning to count is your destiny.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.160
Maybe so...

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.460
That was fun!

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.420
You know what else would be fun count?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.460
Well, I'm sure you're referring to

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.480
my personal My Little Pony collection.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.460
Music:  My Little Pony,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.200
My Little Pony,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480
Ahhhhhhh!

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.280
You are referring to that aren't you?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.000
No.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.520
Vader:  Oh, that's awkward.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.660
It would be fun to count...

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.360
It would be fun to count...

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.940
How many more blows it will take to defeat you!

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.040
What!?

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.200
(battle cry)

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.980
1

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.900
2

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.680
3

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.620
4

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.480
5

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.360
6

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.060
7

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.800
8

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.700
9

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.920
Ok, you can stop now.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.340
You can stop anytime you want.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.580
10!

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.380
(melodramatic howl)

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.400
(lightsaber detracting)

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.880
(footsteps)

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.460
Oh, how you have shamed me.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.660
Shamed you?

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.040
You should be proud...

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.260
Thanks to you I can count to 10!

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.920
And...

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.320
I'm officially a Jedi now, right?

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.360
Uhhhhh....

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.960
Yeeaaah... right.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.740
Yes!

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.980
You are now an official Jedi.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.040
WooHoooo!!!

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.920
(awkward silence)

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.020
(clock ticking)

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.280
(crickets chirping)

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.600
(long airy breath)

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.120
Uhhh...

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.100
Hey, dad?

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.580
Can we go get some ice cream, now?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.280
Sure, son...

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.820
You've earned it.
