00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.660
Right before our juice evaporates from all
of our broccoli I am going to add this celery

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.269
and I am adding celery last because I want
to give our vegetables just a little bit of

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:22.409
crunch because our chicken is going to be
very soft so we'll stir this around. We have

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:28.679
our sauce here and if you remember we didn't
add anything spicier than black pepper to

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:36.550
it but it will have just a little bit of spice
to it, just a little bit of kick. Alright

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:48.269
we are going to take our cinnamon rice, the
liquid has absorbed so we'll plate this on

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:56.109
and it should be just a little bit sticky
with the sugar that we added and we'll give

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:04.440
our vegetables one last stir so I'm going
to put these kind of in layers so that we

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:14.280
get some of the broccoli and then with the
mushrooms and the celery over them and then

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.680
some bright green broccoli on that and if
you have any of that juice left you are going

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:30.640
to want to dribble that right over the top
of your broccoli. Alright now we will give

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.270
our chicken a final stir and we will try to
give our chicken a final stir and we will

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:49.219
try to get a nice scoop of all the colors,
the reds, the greens and the browns

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:55.899
and we will try to make sure that we get a
piece of basil over the top so that can be

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:06.170
here. So here we are our Thai Style Basil
with Cinnamon Rice and our Soy and Ginger

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.659
Broccoli.
