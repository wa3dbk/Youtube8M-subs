00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.849
OK, so things haven't really gone your way dentally. Sorry to hear that.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.779
Once your teeth aren't an option you
still have options. First thing you need

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.889
to do is you need to ask yourself,

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.160
'Am I okay with relegated myself to
wearing a full denture?'

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.840
A full denture is going to have

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.640
extra mobility to it. You're going to have to learn
how to keep it in place

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.390
and you're gonna have limited functional
abilities with it.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.960
You're also going to find that you have

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.230
more limited taste sensation

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.080
and texture of food.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.840
These might be things you're not willing
to live with.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.240
Maybe,  you are willing to live with
them?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.510
We can take impression and
measurements,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.000
send it out to the lab

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.010
and the day that we take your teeth out

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.980
we can put the full denture in right away.
It's called an immediate denture.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.550
It's a great option.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.600
You're never without teeth

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.330
and you're gonna be a little sore. You're going to
have limited

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.220
functional abilities both chewing and
talking for a couple weeks until you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.120
start getting settled in.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.200
Once you get settled in over the course
of a couple months will keep 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.520
refitting it. The whole process can take
maybe six months to a year

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.920
And you can see if that really is the
right fit for you.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.720
If, however, you think that's not your best
option,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.880
what we can do is we can go ahead and
explore the option of having 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.860
dental implants placed.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.300
What we would do is we would send you out to a specialist

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.800
and we do some specialized radiographs, a Cone Beam CT Scan.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.060
It will give us the three-dimensional image
of your skull.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.630
It'll let us know

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.570
the best places,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.010
where we can put the implants how many implants we can put it and I'll let you

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.880
know what your options are.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.159
What type of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.970
piece we can make for you from there.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.580
In many cases the best-looking, functioning,
and feeling option

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.760
is having bridge work could actually
screws directly onto the dental implants.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.050
A huge advantage is that you never have to
take the piece out.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.530
It's gonna be the most natural feeling
option that you have. It's the most complex.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.370
It's going to take the longest to complete but
the final results are just great! It's what

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.309
most people dream of when they think
about having implant supported teeth.

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:13.929
All of these options

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.359
are yours to choose from.

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.879
If you start with one option and at any
point you start feeling like it's not

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.199
the right option for you we can usually
switch to another one.

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.099
You may have heard of 'Teeth in a Day' or
'All-on-Four'.  These are all options that

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.239
allow us to start using the dental
implants, to have the piece that

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.349
 is supported

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.279
from the day you have your teeth taken
out. So, you are never without teeth,  They're great

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.109
options. There's a lot of options to
choose from,

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.889
a lot of stuff to think about.

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.029
I'd be happy to you decide which option
feels right for you. I hope

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:44.279
all of this information helps.
