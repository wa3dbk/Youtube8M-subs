00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.100
I like those Italian renaissances

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.900
Very important, like them ninja turtles

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.900

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.900
What is this?

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.500
It's a drawing of mine

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700
It's called "Proud and Prejudicial"

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.800
Proud and Prejudicial

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.500

You know it's my first show right?

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.500
Yeah I know. I wrote it, so...

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.900
How'd you like that ninja turtle joke?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.400
Really can't hear anything back here, so...

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.500

You know what I always wanted to know Peter?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.800
What's that?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800
How'd you get that last name: Ferarri?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.300
It's just my dad's name

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.390
I was just thinking, I'm a dad myself

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.000
Oh you have kids?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.400
No, I got a show

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.800

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.400

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.000
