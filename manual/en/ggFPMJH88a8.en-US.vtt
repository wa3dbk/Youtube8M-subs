Hi, this is Sara, nice to meet you ^^*

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.480
Today I’m going to talk to you about Twinkle Nails 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.200
Let me show you how the Twinkle nail patch is used in art~^^*

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.040
Let’s start~?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.560
First start on the etching to in increase the contact force Then use the dust brush to clean off the dust 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.940
This is the point material, the twinkle nail patch for the art I’m going to show you

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.960
And you will see the light come off of the yellow area

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.600
You can either cut the patch without harming the main circuit Or you can cut it after you stick it to your nails

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.180
Carefully remove the patch by using the tweezers and attach it so that you can see the light 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:37.880
After you attached the patch well Coat with the base gel and cure it under the lamp for 30 seconds 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.080
After curing is done, put the base gel once again to fill in the gaps 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.700
And you know to cure it again for 30 seconds, right?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.880
I’m going to show you ‘See-through’ black design with the base color

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:04.020
Use one of the brushes you have ad mix the black and base gel in 1:1 ratio

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.640
Put the first coat on and cure it for 30 seconds

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.460
Don’t forget you need the lamp to dry the gel~

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:26.560
While your nail is curing, pour black, white, and gold on the pallet

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.280
After the curing is over, the real art begins

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.920
First, use the line brush and the black gel And divide the yellow area in half 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.040
Then draw a line around the main circuit And draw a polygon around the eyes 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.840
What do you think? It’s not that hard, right? You can already see the eyes of the bat!

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.600
Finally draw a line around the right and the left wings

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.280
Once you finish, fill in the line with the colors

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.680
Color the stomach, then the wings You can express the ears here 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.520
Once you are done up to here, cure for 30 seconds

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.440
To reveal the colors more, we are going to put the black gel once more Make sure you do this well 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.480
When you are done, cure for 30 seconds 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.680
Fill in the bat’s eyes with the gold on the pallet

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.120
And cure it for 30 seconds again

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.800
Once you are done curing, take the white gel And draw the line 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.880
With a line brush, make sure the line is not too think

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.320
Draw the line around the bat’s golden eyes as well Then use the black gel

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:12.440
And make it look like the bat is moving, then cure it for 30 seconds

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:20.040
Okay, this is the final step! You know the last step is the most important one!

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.080
All right. Put on nail surface thoroughly using a topjel brush

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.720
Then do your final 30 seconds curing

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.120
Pour some gel cleanser on a cotton ball and clean up some gels

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:49.600
Tada! The twinkle bat nail is done!

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.880
Put your twinkle nail behind the NFC active cell phone And the nails will twinkle! 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.360
I’ll see you guys later! Bye~
