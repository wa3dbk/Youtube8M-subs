00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:03.974
- Have you ever wondered how you learned

00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:05.833
to interact with people?

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.596
Well, it is through a
process called socialization,

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:11.673
and socialization is a
life-long process where

00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:14.296
we learn about social
expectations and how to

00:00:14.296 --> 00:00:15.991
interact with others.

00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:19.358
So everything we consider
to be normal is actually

00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:21.400
learned through socialization.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.477
This is where we learn to
walk, talk and feed ourselves.

00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:27.054
It's all through socialization,
and we also learn the

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:30.236
behavioral norms that help us fit in.

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:32.279
So let's look at some
of the most important

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.334
agents of socialization.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:37.955
So agents of socialization
are what is used to transmit

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:40.149
culture and really pass it around.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.619
So agents include people,
organizations and institutions

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:47.173
that help us learn about our social world.

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:49.775
So let's look at a few different examples.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:53.175
Family is usually considered
to be the most important

00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:54.952
agent of socialization.

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:57.599
So when you are born, and you are a baby,

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.734
you are completely dependent
on others to survive.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.090
So your parents are those who are playing

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.111
the important role.

00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:06.573
They teach you how to care for yourself.

00:01:06.573 --> 00:01:09.951
They also teach you how
close relationships work.

00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:13.410
They also teach you their
values, beliefs and norms.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.244
So an example of how family
plays an important role

00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:20.806
in socialization come from
Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers.

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:23.882
He looks at how wealthy
parents with white collar jobs

00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:25.844
raise their children, and
then he also looks at how

00:01:25.844 --> 00:01:28.619
less fortunate parents
raise their children.

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.243
So one specific example that he uses is

00:01:31.243 --> 00:01:33.065
a trip to the doctor's office.

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:35.562
So the children of the wealthy
parents were encouraged

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:38.104
to ask questions when visiting the doctor,

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:41.065
while the kids of the less
fortunate, they were less likely

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:43.782
to criticize or even question the doctor.

00:01:43.782 --> 00:01:46.684
So the less fortunate children
were more likely to just

00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:48.819
accept what the doctor
says without voicing

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.597
their concerns at all.

00:01:50.597 --> 00:01:54.194
So this example shows
us how kids are raised,

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:56.865
and really how they're
raised affects how they

00:01:56.865 --> 00:02:00.441
interact with others, and
in this case, authority.

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.622
So the wealthy kids were
encouraged to challenge authority

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:06.281
and to think independently,
while the less wealthy kids

00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.483
were taught to submit to authority.

00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:13.583
Schools are also another
important agent of socialization.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:15.822
So in addition to teaching
about different subjects

00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:18.784
like science and math, or
the standard reading, writing

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:22.301
and arithmetic, schools teach life skills.

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:24.762
So students do not just learn from their

00:02:24.762 --> 00:02:27.804
academic curriculum, but
they learn social skills from

00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:30.626
interactions with teachers
and other students.

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:34.594
For example, we learn the
importance of obeying authority,

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:37.870
and that to be successful
we must learn to be quiet,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.039
we must learn to wait,
and to even act interested

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.816
when we are not interested at all.

00:02:42.816 --> 00:02:46.495
So this is part of what is
called the hidden curriculum,

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:49.375
which is just standard
behaviors, and they are really

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:50.860
what is deemed acceptable.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.937
And they are subtly taught by teachers.

00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:56.711
Peers help us develop our social behavior.

00:02:56.711 --> 00:03:00.019
There are moments in life
where our friends values

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.723
and behavior, they contradict
the values of our families.

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:07.405
So it's really up to you to
decide which norms and values

00:03:07.405 --> 00:03:09.622
to keep, and which to get rid of.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.664
So peer pressure is an example
of how peers influence us,

00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:16.709
and many times teens are pressured
to drink and to do drugs.

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.890
So peers during our teenage
years also influence

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.630
what movies we watch, or
even the music we listen to.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.251
Mass media includes things like
television, internet, radio,

00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.492
movies, books and magazines.

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:32.208
So when children are young
they learn things through

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:34.392
mass media that their
parents, really they would

00:03:34.392 --> 00:03:35.715
not even approve of.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.768
So today children are exposed
to a lot of content that is

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:40.846
intended for mature audiences,

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.434
like violent TV shows, for example.

00:03:43.434 --> 00:03:46.123
So sometimes mass media
even enforces gender and

00:03:46.123 --> 00:03:47.564
other stereotypes.

00:03:47.564 --> 00:03:49.885
So one great example of
how mass media is an agent

00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:52.799
of socialization is children's books.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.864
So I remember reading one
called Amelia Bedelia,

00:03:55.864 --> 00:03:58.615
and in this story Amelia
Bedelia, she's a maid,

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:01.298
and she's doing a lot of
different chores around the house.

00:04:01.298 --> 00:04:04.501
So in the story, it's a funny
book because she's taking

00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:06.481
commands from her employer literally.

00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:09.227
So for example, at the
end of one of her tasks,

00:04:09.227 --> 00:04:12.343
one of her tasks is to dress
a turkey, and I think she

00:04:12.343 --> 00:04:15.072
literally puts clothes on the turkey.

00:04:15.072 --> 00:04:17.858
But in the children's book
she was doing a lot of chores,

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:21.115
so she was doing the laundry,
and she was dusting the couch.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:23.380
And the point is to show
you how children's books

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.038
play an important role in socialization.

00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:29.195
So this book was written in the
1960's, and during this time

00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:31.437
women were expected to
stay at home, and they were

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.293
expected to do chores and have children

00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:34.780
and just be housewives.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.414
So this just shows you how mass
media, although it may just

00:04:38.414 --> 00:04:41.177
seem to be there, it plays a
big role in teaching us about

00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:43.861
our social expectations.
