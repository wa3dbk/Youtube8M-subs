00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.469
How to install your Automatic Watering System
Thanks for your recent purchase of our Raindrip

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.660
Automatic Watering Kit. Installation of this
kit should take about 20 minutes. We have

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.090
also provided a link here that shows you how
to program the timer if you need help. Let’s

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.760
get started on the installation.
Getting Started

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.960
The timer that comes in this kit functions
using water pressure greater than 25PSI. That

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.110
means, you cannot use this timer to control
water flow from, say a rain barrel. Additionally,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.180
this timer must be installed on an above ground
hose bib – do not install it on a hose or

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.390
location where the timer will be laying on
the ground.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.890
STEP 1: CONNECT
First you need to locate the hose bib that

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.391
is near the landscape area you want to water.
Next, take the timer and hold it up to the

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:04.449
hose bib with the metal collar in line with
the bottom of the hose bib. Hand tighten the

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.110
collar onto the hose bib until the timer is
securely connected. Do not over tighten the

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.101
collar.
This kit also comes with a Wye splitter. The

00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:18.140
purpose of a Wye splitter is to allow usage
of your hose bib while the hose bib is connected

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.799
to the timer. You can also use it to water
in 2 different directions off the same timer

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.009
but it will require an additional purchase
of supply line and feeder lines.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.100
Now that the timer is in place, screw on the
filter regulator and attach the supply line.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.289
STEP 2: SUPPLY
This may look like a lot of parts, but you

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.630
will only really need the supply line. The
other parts are provided to help you tee off

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.759
the tubing, turn corners or cap off a cut
end. Now that your supply line is connected

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.840
to the timer, lay out the supply line throughout
your landscape in a way that will allow the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.670
tubing to run in the middle of the landscape.
STEP 3: WATER

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:10.410
Once your supply line is laid out, position
each of the 10 feeder lines at intervals that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.110
will allow the “dripper head” to water
the base of each flower, shrub or tree. Drippers

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.819
are made to emit 2 gallons of water per hour
so there is plenty of water for multiple plants

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.459
in your landscape. Once you have positioned
the feeder lines, grasp the supply line and

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.819
one of your Clamp and Pierce feeder lines
in the manner shown. Firmly press on the fitting

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.040
to puncture the supply line and ensure the
fitting has wrapped itself fully around the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:41.890
supply line. Do this for the remaining feeder
lines.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:56.459
Additional Accessories
Sometimes you may need more supply line or

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.560
feeder lines, you can find those by visiting
store.raindrip.com

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.069
We have also provided a quick watering guide
that can help you select the right number

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.409
of feeder lines for each plant type.
