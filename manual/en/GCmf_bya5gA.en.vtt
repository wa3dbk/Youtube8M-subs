My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I am going to show you how

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.170
to make a real French baguette. So it has
been ten minutes so I am going to turn my

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:19.580
oven up to 450 degrees. That is really hot.
Now let's take a lot of bread and work with

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.609
it a little more and get it ready to go in
although we are having pizza. Let's bring

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.790
our bread out again for our final look. You
can see it has risen quite a bit. When I put

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.330
this in it was half this size. So what I am
going to do now is take the ring off again.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:50.690
I have already washed my hands so I am just
going to punch this down. Take my hands like

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.450
this and knock all the air out of it because
we don't want the big huge holes while it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.730
is baking. I am just going to take my fists,
smash this down, flip my bowl over and it

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.229
should fall right out and it does. The thing
is that this side with the oil on it is going

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.009
to be kind of sticky so we are going to make
sure that we have our flour here which we

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:24.509
do and we are going to lay that side down
on the flour. Now what we need to do is we

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.429
need to knead this just enough, see this side
has kind of a leathery dry skin about it so

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.659
we want to roll the dough back over on top
of it. We want to get that inside and get

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.139
the nice soft part on the outside. Roll those
pieces over like this, roll this piece in

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:52.479
like this, roll this piece in like this. Also
what we are going to do is we are going to

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:02.149
try to work all of that air out of our dough
by kneading it. You can see that now it is

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:12.000
really nice and really smooth and really great
looking bread dough. Now our next step is

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.840
going to involve us shaping it and getting
it ready to go.
