MATT SENATORE: Hi. This is Matt Senatore on
behalf of Expert Village, and today we're

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.519
going to learn how to make my Italian stuffed
shell appetizer. So what we're going to need

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:22.640
here is a baking pan with some tin foil on
it. We have our pasta here, we have our filling,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:31.079
a small teaspoon, and just a wet napkin to
wipe off the--you know, if we get in the filling

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.820
on the outside of the shell just to wipe it
off so it looks nice. So, we're going to take

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.769
one of our shells. This one didn't break.
I'm going to take our sausage filling, we're

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:48.781
just going to put it inside the shell like
so, just little scoops because you want to

00:00:48.781 --> 00:01:02.469
make nice and neat, just like that, and then
kinda squeeze it a little and place it on

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.870
your baking pan and you take the next shell,
get some more sausage filling, and just kinda

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.040
fill it up so we got a little on the outside
so I'm going to wipe that clean with the napkin.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:33.290
Just kinda get it in nicely like so, and then
this one squeeze it and take the napkin here

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:42.110
and just wipe off the side of the shell just
so it looks good and we'll place that on the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:53.260
baking pan. We'll do a couple with the beef
filling. Take a little bit here, place it

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.390
inside the actual shell, try to keep it propped
open with your thumb if you possibly can 'cause

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:11.269
it's a little soft and wet, just get our beef
filling, fill it up nicely, spread it around,

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.751
and then just give it a little squeeze, place
on the other side of the pan. So we're going

00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:21.250
to have our sausage, our sausage stuffed shells
here, and we're going to have our beef stuffed

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:30.019
shells here. Spread it around make sure its
full, then kinda squeeze it, and we have a

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:37.560
little extra on the side here so let's take
a little off here, it's a little bit too much,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.579
and then with a damp napkin, just kinda wipe
the sides and place it neatly on the tray.

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.860
So, I'm going to finish these and then I'll
show you how to dress the shells.
