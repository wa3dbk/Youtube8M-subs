00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.490
Well, we are going to take a look at Black
Diamond's Trail Pro Shock trekking poles.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.610
Got the men's version, also comes in a women's
version.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.719
Really nice all around options.

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.510
You have got anti shock built into the poles.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.051
You have got user friendly external flick
locks and three part adjustability, really

00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:26.090
nice options for year round back country use.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.790
As I mentioned there these are there part
adjustable poles, which means you have got

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.340
two flick locks.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.010
These are flick lock pro mechanisms on the
Trail Pro Shock.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.190
So it is a really nice metal construction
on these, nice hardware as well, just whether

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.470
you are wearing gloves or you have got bare
hands, these just... they are so user friendly.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.339
On the men's poles you have got adjustability
from 27 inches to 55 inches.

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.269
On the women's poles they are a little shorter
so you are starting at 24 inches and going

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.930
out to 49 inches in length.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.280
You have got durable but light weight aluminum
construction on these poles.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.140
The men's the pair comes in at 20 ounces for
the pair, the women's an ounce lighter at

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.770
19 ounces for the pair.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.710
You want to take a look at these grips, because
they are unique.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.900
As the name would sug-gest, you do have an
anti shock mechanism on these poles.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.080
It is not down in the shaft.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.540
It is actually in the grip itself.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.550
So you can see that give.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.790
It is pretty passive.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.790
It is not springy.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.820
It is not going to be bouncing on you, but
when you need it, when you are really bearing

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.860
down on the pole it will have some give.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.380
There is vibration whenever you are using
trek-king poles.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.790
You strike the ground, that vibration makes
its way up the poles, it is going to hit that

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.430
last solid piece which happens to be your
wrist.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.690
This will dampen that.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.300
So it takes some of the repetitive strain
during long days on the trail.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.960
You can see nice contoured foam grips here
as well as an extended length beneath that

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.479
shock mechanism.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.250
That would enable you when you are side hilling
or back and forth on switch backs, you wouldn't

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.850
necessarily have to readjust the poles each
time.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.620
You could change it where you are holding
them or grabbing them.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.090
It also gives you another place to hold it
when you are making adjustments.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.290
So that extended length has some nice benefit
there.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.489
You can see integrated padded wrist straps.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:39.170
There is also full adjustability on those
to really dial in that fit.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.469
At the bottom of the poles you have got Black
Diamond's flex tech tips.

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.319
So you can see this portion here on the poles.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.560
It is actually designed should you have a
catastrophic in-stance and maybe you put the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.969
poles down in between two rocks and your weight
bears down on them, rather than snapping the

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.379
poles, this can actually break away.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.560
It doesn't sound like a good thing, but this
is a replaceable part, while broken shafts

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.430
is a different story.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.529
You can see this small disk here.

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:09.529
This is called a basket.

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:13.389
It is a very low profile basket that comes
with these poles.

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.209
For on trail usage that is sufficient.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.569
Winter comes along you may be looking for
a broader diameter basket that keeps the poles

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.349
from driving too deeply into the snow or even
in mud, for that matter.

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.299
There are broader diameter baskets that can
be purchased separately and threaded into

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.129
place on the pole.

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:40.090
At the very end you can see a carbide tip,
perfect for on trail usage and dirt and mud,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.669
un-improved surfaces.

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.970
If you are going to be using them on improved
surfaces or in certain cases even on rocks,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.970
something a bit more solid that might eat
up the carbide tip, these will screw out.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.780
You can purchase separately rubber tech tips
that will screw into place.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.110
And that is better on those surfaces.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.719
Also sold separately are caps, tip protectors,
a press fit design that will go over the tips

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:05.719
themselves.

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.140
And that is a nice piece also for travel.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.540
It keeps these from coming into con-tact with
clothes or other items.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.799
Again, just a great combined feature set on
these poles and a good price for what you

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.799
are getting as well.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.280
You have got that anti shock.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.629
You have got that broad range of adjusta-bility,
full featured grip.

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:30.389
It really makes the Black Diamond Trail Pro
Shock poles ideal for year round use in varying

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:30.620
conditions.
