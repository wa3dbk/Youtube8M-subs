00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.300
So recently, there's an article on the news about

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.060
a computer which had sold for 200,000 dollars.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.840
The computer itself, an Apple 1,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.840
built by Steve Wozniak back in the seventies,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.340
had originally only sold for 666 dollars.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.340
But, a woman had taken it to a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.960
recycling center, and effectively thrown it away.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.960
The company's now trying to attract the woman,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.960
so they can share the profits they've made from

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.240
selling it.  But just why was this computer

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.240
so special?  And what was it made of?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.100
So, the story of the Apple 1 takes us back

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.220
to the [U.S.] West Coast in the mid seventies.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.780
Steve Wozniak was happily working at HP

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.780
designing calculators, and he went along

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780
to one of the early meetings of the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.220
Homebrew Computer Club, where he

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.220
thought he was going to talk about

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.080
TV terminals and being able to connect

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.080
to the ARPAnet for a TV,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.080
but actually, everyone was talking about

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.000
the cover of Popular Electronics,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.260
where the MITS Altair 8800

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.140
had just appeared on the cover.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.140
It was probably the first computer that used

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.580
a microprocessor as its CPU,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.960
rather than building it discretely out of logic chips.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960
If you want to know more about it, click here,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.680
where Jason at the Centre for Computing History in Cambridge

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.520
will explain theirs, they have the serial number 3.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.020
Wozniak hadn't even heard of these CPUs at the time,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.340
but was interested, and he was given a data sheet

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.860
for the 8080, which was at the heart

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100
of the machine, and took it home,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.680
and began to look over it.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.020
And he realized that it was very similar to a computer

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.020
he'd built previously out of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.020
discrete logic components,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.020
which he called "the cream soda computer"

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.020
because he'd built it out of cream soda cans

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.660
for the case.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.280
So he started looking at this, and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.220
very quickly realized that he could design

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.160
a computer based around this,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.580
using very few chips in the CPU,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.240
some RAM, some ROM

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.240
and put it together to build a complete computer

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.860
for much less than the cost of the Altair.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.860
He then realized that he could link it in

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.860
to a terminal he'd built.  And the terminal

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.520
was just a machine that you could use to connect

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.760
to ARPAnet through a normal television;

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.700
which he'd done there. Now, ARPAnet was the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.880
forerunner, in those days, of the Internet;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.880
and so he'd built this system that could connect to it

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.480
through a cheap domestic television set.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.580
Rather than having to use lots and lots of lights

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.700
on the front of your Altair to communicate with it,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.480
just use a television screen; it'd be much easier

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.480
to communicate through that.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.840
And you could put a proper typewriter keyboard in it,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.060
and produce a system.  So he worked out these things.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.020
He reused his circuit for his television terminal,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.940
connected that up to the logic

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.140
inside his CP -- his computer he'd designed,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.120
put it together with a keyboard; and he'd managed to design --

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.260
he hadn't built it at that point -- a complete computer.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.020
He then looked at the design, and someone he was working with

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.560
suggested he look at a different CPU called the 6800

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.560
because it was considerably cheaper and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.560
you could get one, as an HP employee,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.560
for about 40 dollars.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.320
So he redesigned the system using that,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.660
and he also looked at RAM; and he'd originally considered

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.660
using what was called static RAM,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.660
but then decided, because it was cheaper again,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.420
to use what's called dynamic RAM,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.420
and he'd managed to get a good deal on some

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.900
dynamic RAM as well.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.100
So he'd redesigned his circuit.  And then,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.800
he'd heard about a new chip, which was the 6502.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.960
This chip is used in lots and lots of computer systems,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960
right through to the mid-eighties;

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.720
things like the BBC Micro, the Commodore 64,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.720
and so on.  So, he redesigned the circuit

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.720
again around this, although it was just basically

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.720
plugging in the new chip.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720
And he then went off to build

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.460
the computer.  Normally,

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.460
something like the Altair, and other computers

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.460
at that time, you would program them

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.460
by having switches on the front to

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.460
type in the memory locations and

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.100
the data that you wanted to store there.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.940
What Wozniak realized, because he was working with

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.940
calculators at the time, at HP, is that

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.940
calculators were effectively computers

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.940
to some extent.  They had programs,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.680
they had processors - they did things,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.800
you'd put input.  But the calculators started up

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800
straightaway because the program was burnt

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800
into the ROM inside it, so

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.800
he programmed his initial program

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.800
for the, what became the Apple 1,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.800
into some ROM, and put that

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.660
into a system so his computer

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.660
would start up straightaway with what he called his

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.660
monitor program, so the user could see the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.800
data on the TV screen, and they could

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.180
input the data using a standard keyboard.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.960
And it's perhaps this

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.340
that made the difference between the Apple 1

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.340
and everything that followed it,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.340
and what had come before in terms of [units?].

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.340
Because before, yep, you could plug

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.340
a keyboard in; yep, you could plug

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.620
a video display in.  But actually, most of the time,

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.620
you're entering the data, to get it started

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.960
at least, via the toggles on the front.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.960
What Steve Wozniak's genius moment was,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.960
was that he actually replaced that

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.400
with a small bit of program built into the system

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.400
and a VDU display,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.400
using a typical telly, and a

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400
keyboard for entry.  So you went from being

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.400
something that only hardware hackers

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400
were perhaps comfortable with, to the forerunner of

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.400
the PC that we know today.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400
So Steve Wozniak built the, uh,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.400
the Apple - what became the Apple 1

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.160
for himself, and he took it to the

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
Homebrew Computer Club and started showing it

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160
around to the other people there.  And of course,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160
he showed it to his friend, Steve Jobs.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
And Steve Jobs realized that while

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
other people in the computer club were

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160
taking copies of the schematics, they weren't

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
actually building it themselves.  And

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.780
so he said to Wozniak,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.780
"Why don't we make up some circuit boards

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.920
ourselves, and actually sell them to people?"

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.920
They could make the boards for 20 dollars,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.920
sell the kits for 40 dollars including all the

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.680
components, and still make profit.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.680
People would see them as a deal, because they were getting

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680
all the parts.  And,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680
Wozniak wasn't perhaps sure at first, but he -

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.680
Steve Jobs turned to him and said, "Look,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.920
whatever happens, if we fail,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.920
we can at least have got a company

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.920
to our name.  We'll have made a company."

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.920
And Wozniak liked this idea.  And so together,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.920
they started a small company called Apple.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.000
So, if you want to find out more

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.240
about the history of the Apple 1 and Apple itself,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.300
I can recommend two books.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.440
Steve Wozniak's biography iWoz

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.000
goes into the details about

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.900
how he created it,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.180
and what he was doing at the time.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.140
Great read.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.880
And also, if you're interested in the

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.960
technical side of it,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.600
there's this book, The Apple I Replica Creation,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.460
where Tom Owad

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.940
goes into how you can actually build your own

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.100
Apple 1; goes through how to program it, and so on.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.940
Looks at the hardware inside it.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.920
Both great reads and available from your all usual bookshops.
