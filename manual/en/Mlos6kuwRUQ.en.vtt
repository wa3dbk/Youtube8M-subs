00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.059
What you do is get yourself a tray, put it
on the hob, get it reasonably hot, you want

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.060
a sloosh of extra virgin olive oil and I've
got some lovely pancetta.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.270
Just lay this pancetta straight onto the stray
and as soon as it's reasonably crisp and golden.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.520
We can pull ti out.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.090
Now to go with it, what I've done here is
just taken out the stalks, so what I want

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.320
to do is just scald.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.390
You know how you put tomatoes in water to
blanch it, 40 seconds, skin comes off.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.910
I'm going to do that without water but in
the oven.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.890
I'm going to get some herbs, bay leaves, some
oregano, off the stick and then rosemary I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.940
want to get these tomatoes sit them on top
of the oil.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.940
Brilliant.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.940
Once we've done that.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.230
That can go straight back into the oven.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.430
This will just sort of blister the tomatoes.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.689
Now I've got these lovely sausages here and
just get a little bit of olive oil and just

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.610
rub it all around your sausage.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.610
Lovely.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.530
Right you can hear by now the tomatoes have
had a fair bit of action, three, four minutes

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.290
in this oven.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.350
What you can do now, let them cool down and
use tongs.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.330
but just pinch off the skins, so literally
just pull them off.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.560
Then just, with a spoon, just mix it up and
then these sausage which have just been sort

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.510
of tossed in the oil.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.880
Can then be dangled in and around and you
want to just push them in between your tomatoes.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.509
All I want to do is just get a little bit
of garlic.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:54.310
I'm not going to peel them, just put them
in and around and then just a little seasoning

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.750
with some salt and pepper the best bit of
the dish now is the slow cooking.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.329
So I'm going to put that in at about 180 Celsius,
about 350 Fahrenheit.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:13.790
And I'll turn the sausages maybe once or twice
in that time and it will be delish.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.959
Come on!

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.209
Fantastic, we definitely need something to
mop up all those juices, it could be polenta

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.180
it could be rice but I think this.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.970
Get a nice bit of bread, cut it up like that.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:41.959
Give it a nice rip up and then get the lovely
tomatoes in on top of that bread, like that.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.359
Get a few nice sausages, Look at that all
that nice juice at the bottom.

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:51.389
To finish it, a little bit of balsamic vinegar
just a few little drips around the sauce.

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.489
And that is going to mix in a real treat.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:21.329
That is a cracker, an absolute cracker.
