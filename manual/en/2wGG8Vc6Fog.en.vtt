Glamour Lighting Setups

00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:07.587
Starring Model Sasha

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:10.624
Vertical Lighting Sandwich

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.493
Hey fellow photographer!

00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:14.582
In this video, you will learn a lighting setup

00:00:14.582 --> 00:00:17.481
which makes the human body looking very artistic.

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.687
We will do a light which shows the basic shape of a body,

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.794
or the basic shape of a pose,

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:25.900
but it doesn’t show so much detail.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.002
This is often helpful when you

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.104
want to shoot posh artistic things.

00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:31.933
Today we have got model Sasha

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.762
who is a real sports person.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:37.122
Yeah, she is a real sports person.

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:41.315
Oh….oh….oh…Now I’m afraid. Let’s do a little zen thing

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:44.164
The Zen Thing – My Doctor said it’s good!

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:45.558
Okay, now it is good again.

00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:49.288
Alright, so she will do some really artistic poses

00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:51.084
on the ground, and jumps and stuff

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:55.171
And we will illuminate it a little bit from the front

00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:57.426
with an umbrella, with front umbrella

00:00:57.426 --> 00:00:59.461
and we will through much more light

00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:01.537
into the background with such back umbrella.

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:04.518
The other side will have the same setup,

00:01:04.518 --> 00:01:06.271
one umbrella front, one umbrella to the back

00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:09.894
and this will make our light really sing.

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:12.001
So, let’s try that out!

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.536
So how do you shoot the scene?

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:15.614
It’s pretty easy.

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:19.060
You use a big white sweep, a big white seamless backdrop.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.887
You use something for the reflection

00:01:20.887 --> 00:01:23.046
like a glass plate in the front,

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:25.475
and you position the model

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:27.904
at the back edge of this glass plate,

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:31.185
so that the reflection is pretty much in the front.

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:34.880
Then you compose the actual lighting sandwich,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.549
with a left bun and right bun

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.742
and the model sandwiched in the middle.

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:41.109
For that, of course you use speedlights,

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.351
two speedlights on each side,

00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.719
one speedlight pointing to the model’s side

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.787
and another speedlight pointing into the background,

00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:52.237
throwing a lot of light into the background.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:56.721
You go with shoot-though umbrellas for all the speedlights.

00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:01.719
The camera controls are like this:

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.067
I choose f/11, you could choose f/16 or something,

00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:06.899
but I wanted to blur the background a little bit

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.731
away because it was so dirty.

00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:11.425
And this is also the reason

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:14.652
why I choose to overexpose

00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:17.880
the back speedlights by 3 f-stops.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.227
I had them on +3.

00:02:19.227 --> 00:02:21.469
Usually we would get away with +1

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.382
to have a white background really coming out white

00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:25.414
and not neutral gray,

00:02:25.414 --> 00:02:27.905
but this background, it was so dirty,

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.023
so incredibly dirty, that I said,

00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:33.718
go to +3, burn it away as good as possible,

00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:36.417
then I don’t have to clean it up so much in Photoshop.

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:38.410
Okay, that’s already it,

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.666
pretty simple, pretty straight forward.

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:51.454
Your Feedback: Please Comment Below!

00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:55.216
Now let’s use a top secret

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:58.024
Hollywood action movie imaging trick.

00:02:58.024 --> 00:03:00.770
You are asking your model to jump

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.970
right through the center of your lighting sandwich

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:06.189
and then there is a secret function

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.058
in Hollywood, uh, in Photoshop,

00:03:08.058 --> 00:03:12.633
in  Edit &gt; Transform &gt; Rotate 90 Degrees.

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:13.954
Boom!

00:03:13.954 --> 00:03:16.404
Now she is falling into, uh… into nowhere.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.895
You add a little bit gradient to the background.

00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:20.266
Now she is falling into the light.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.508
Ain’t that a bit spectacular?

00:03:22.508 --> 00:03:25.125
Just keep it between the two of us.

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:27.679
Don’t tell anybody that you know it

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.537
and we have ever did it, all right?

00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:32.230
Alright, so this worked very well.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.920
I think the big take-away, two big take-aways are

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.800
Point A: When you reverse the lighting context,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.314
when you put your subject into shade

00:03:42.314 --> 00:03:43.768
and the background into light,

00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:45.930
it grabs the viewers’ attention.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.380
And the other big take-away is,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.830
if you are silhouetting your subject,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.642
you communicate the shape,

00:03:51.642 --> 00:03:54.107
rather than some detail.

00:03:54.107 --> 00:03:55.729
Alright, I hope this is helpful

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.862
and you can use it and hope to see you in next video.

00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:02.798
Good light!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
