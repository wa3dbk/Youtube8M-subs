00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.880
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: People
love definitive answers.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.900
We really want to have a clear
understanding of everything

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.680
we see, art historians
especially so.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.480
But people also
love to make things.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.770
We love to make art.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.210
And one of the oldest
works of art in the world

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.430
yet found, is a small
female figurine that's

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.620
sometimes simply
called Female Nude,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.420
but is still universally known
as the Venus of Willendorf,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.030
a name that makes
no sense whatsoever,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.457
but really speaks to the lens
that our culture looks through.

00:00:32.457 --> 00:00:34.290
DR. BETH HARRIS: She
acquired the name Venus

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.620
when she was found in 1908, in
a village in Austria, called

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.680
Willendorf.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.210
She's only about 11
centimeters high,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.470
and she dates from
about 25,000 years ago.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.480
So she's really old.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.800
And, in the museum in Vienna
where we we're looking at her,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.430
in the Natural History
Museum, they've

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.220
shrouded her in
darkness, in a glass

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.520
case, illuminated from above.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.100
The outside looks
like a great temple,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.544
and on it, it says
"Venus of Willendorf."

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:06.460
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: And
in fact, in the temple,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.800
there's a little button
because, remember,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.841
this is a science museum.

00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:12.820
Lots of kids, and kids love to
push buttons, and when they do,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.780
the white light on the
figurine turns red,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.320
and a little flute music starts.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.180
Now of course we have no idea if
these people listened to music,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.510
what that music would've been.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.080
It's really an attempt
to fill in all the gaps.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.110
We know almost
nothing about her.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.740
We don't know why she
was made, who made her.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.300
What we have is the figure,
and virtually no context.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.680
It is in some ways an
anthropological object,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.146
rather than an art object.

00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:38.770
DR. BETH HARRIS: By
giving her the name

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.500
of an ancient Greek goddess,
the goddess of love Venus,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.640
we were assigning
meaning to her.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.110
A meaning of her being
a goddess figure,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.942
and somehow associated
with fertility.

00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:52.650
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
Now, we have no reason

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.230
to believe any of that is true.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.520
I suppose we do have a
little bit more context,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.890
and that is, this is only
one of quite a number

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.370
of female figures that have
been found from this era.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.290
This is during the
last ice age, and it's

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.716
some of the first figural
sculpture that we've seen.

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:08.090
What's interesting is that
almost all the sculptures that

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.115
have been found have
been female figures.

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:12.240
DR. BETH HARRIS: We should
say all the figures that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.600
have been found so far
are female figures,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.940
and they're nude.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.750
But they're of different shapes.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.300
Some exaggerate the
breasts and buttocks.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.580
But others are thin.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.520
But maybe in 10
years, or 100 years,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.210
art historians
and archaeologists

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.951
will find male figures.

00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:31.950
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: So,
all of this is guesswork.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.240
All we've got to look
at is the figure itself.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.670
Let's take a close look.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.420
DR. BETH HARRIS: She has
no feet, and very thin

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.700
arms, which she rests
high up on her breasts.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.534
And she has no facial features.

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:46.700
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: That's
consistent with almost all

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.180
the figures from this
period that have been found.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.100
There is a careful rendering
of the hair, or perhaps

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.070
a woven hat that's on her head.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.705
Some archaeologists
have suggested

00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:59.217
that this might be a
reed hat that she wears.

00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:00.050
DR. BETH HARRIS: Oh.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.370
There's the music
and the red light.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.244
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER: That's
right, a small girl

00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:04.570
has just pushed the button.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.230
The hands are articulated
ever so slightly,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.420
defining the fingers.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.485
And archaeologists who have
looked at this carefully

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:16.790
have suggested that perhaps the
exaggeration of the stomach,

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.630
and of the breasts, and of
the head-- those are bulbous

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.650
shapes throughout--
are partially

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.670
a result of natural
shape of the stone.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.330
This is a limestone object.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.362
She's symmetrical,
and it's clearly

00:03:27.362 --> 00:03:29.070
not something that
was meant to stand up.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.950
As you mentioned,
there were no feet.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.640
But this is a figure that
would easily fill a hand,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.430
and you have the
sense that this is

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.080
something that was
meant to be held.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.047
DR. BETH HARRIS: Carried
in a pocket, perhaps.

00:03:39.047 --> 00:03:39.880
Something like that.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.150
She does fit
comfortably in a hand.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.900
We know that she was
originally painted

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.660
with ochre paint, a
kind of red paint.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.139
Beyond that, it's really
hard to say much more.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.680
DR. STEVEN ZUCKER:
So, we'll continue

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.220
to be fascinated by it.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.930
Art historians will continue
to try to find answers.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.740
And in some ways,
I'm sure we'll always

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.750
fall into the trap of
reflecting our own interests,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.960
and our own needs, as we try
to understand this object.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.420
I'm not sure that we'll ever
fully understand it or be

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.334
able to retrieve its
original meanings.

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:09.250
DR. BETH HARRIS: Nope.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:19.202
