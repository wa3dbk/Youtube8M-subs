Hi and welcome to the Lowes shop class.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.900
This
time I'm making an entertainment center

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.090
for my television and other A/V equipment
and

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.769
if you'd like to make one too.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.670
Well come on in the shop and let's get
started.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.080
Now this time we'll be looking at the
plywood pieces that make up a

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.640
lot of the components of our
entertainment center.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.640
Let's start

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.470
by looking at our plans we've got the
top and bottom, the ends, two dividers, four

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.000
shelves, and two back panels.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.770
Now we have a
lot of matching pieces so here's a tip

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.440
to save you some cutting time.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.070
Take two pieces of plywood, sandwich them
together and secure them with screws.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.070
That

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.300
way we can cut two pieces at once but
I'll start by marking all of my parts on

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200
the top layer and that'll show me where
my waist is.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200
That's where I put the screws so

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.820
I don't mar anything I'll use later.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.080
Now at this point you're probably looking
at this full sheet of plywood saying how do

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.700
I get this to the table saw?

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.470
Well you
don't have to because we're going to use a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.570
circular saw

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.510
to cut oversized blanks and then we'll take
those

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.230
blanks to the table saw for a good

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.399
smooth cut but I'll start by making a
circular saw guide and to do this I'll

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.060
measure from the edge of the circular saw
base to the blade then I can cut two

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.120
scrape pieces to that size that I
can use whenever I want.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.590
But remember anytime you use power tools
always wear eye protection and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.909
hearing protection.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.390
I'll use these guides to find the right
placement for my fence which in this

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.650
case is going to be a 1x4 that
I clamp to my plywood.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.330
Then I'll just run the circular saw
up the edge of that fence.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.979
Once my first cut is done, I can reposition
the guide

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.700
and the fence and make the rest of my

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700
cuts.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.479
After all of your oversized blanks are
cut you can take them to the table saw

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.400
for their final trims.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.710
Once you have your top, your bottom and
your ends cut.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.470
Take the length of one of your ends and
subtract the thickness of two pieces of

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.310
plywood, that gives you the length of
your dividers.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.310
Mark your dividers and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.549
cut them on the table saw.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.230
And those are all of our plywood
pieces.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.300
Now before you do anything else

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.100
this is a great time to mark them all so you
can

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.430
keep everything straight.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.540
Now the top, the bottom, and the center
shelf all have pocket holes.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.600
And I'll use a

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.659
pocket hole jig to make those.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.210
I'm going to use
this smaller version because it's easier

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.570
on larger pieces like this.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.750
I'm also going to use this iron on veneer
for our plywood pieces.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.899
It'll help to cover up the rough exposed
edge and give it a cleaner look.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.810
Now for each edge I'll measure the length
and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.379
I'll cut a veneer one inch

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.209
longer than that measurement.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.159
Then I can attach it using a standard
household iron.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.170
Just remember to keep the iron moving
down the length of the veneer.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.319
Once it's ironed on I can use utility knife
to

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.200
cut it to the exact length.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.980
Now as a final step I'm going to sand all
of our plywood pieces with some 220

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.980
grit sandpaper.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.980
Just to

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.980
smooth things out.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.939
I'm using a random
Orbit sander and with these sanders it's

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.900
important to remember to keep it flat
against your work surface

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.739
and go lightly on the veneer.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.499
Finally remember to feel things with your
hand to find any rough spots

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.120
you may have missed.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.540
So join me next time for video two when
we put all of these pieces together

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.870
and I create the doors.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.930
I'll see you then.
