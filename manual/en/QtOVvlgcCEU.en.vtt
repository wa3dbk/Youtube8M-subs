What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:16.670
Today I want to talk to you about the difference
between 2 words we hear a lot about. Flexibility

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.289
and Mobility.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.689
They are 2 different words, obviously, but
they have 2 very different meanings when it

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.390
comes to getting your body ready to train
your best.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.710
The difference guys between flexibility and
mobility is that flexibility is going to deal

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.730
mostly with tissue length.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.760
And mobility is going to deal mostly with
tissue temperature or how warm your body is

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.269
and how loose you feel.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.170
So, let me show you exactly what the difference
is with a couple of examples. First of all,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.309
let's deal with flexibility.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.760
When we talk about flexibility, you guys have
heard me talk about dynamic and static flexibility.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.809
And we want to make sure that we're doing
most of our static flexibility and static

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.309
stretching before we go to bed at night.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.459
As we heal, our muscles will tend to heal
shorter. We want to make sure that we do that

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:05.239
and we do that over the course of time

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.570
because a consistent effort on our static
flexibility will produce increases in length.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.570
So, if you have a muscle that runs from A
to B here, the person that has the muscle

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.210
that runs from A to B here, has a more flexible
muscle.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.259
The muscle length is longer. It's literally
longer. It's more flexible. That is what you're

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.460
working on when you do those types of static
stretching drills.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.179
You're trying to get the muscle to slowly
but surely increase its length so you have

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.890
more available range of motion. That is flexibility.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.229
When we talk about mobility, we're really
talking about the temperature of the joint.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.219
So, if you have a joint that has the flexibility
from here to here,

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:01.170
and another person has a flexibility from
here to here, but his person is mobile, and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.950
this person is immobile.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.060
Ok, we'll deal with that. Those are extreme
ranges of motion, but this person may not

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.910
move this far. He may have the length that
this guy has here at the muscle belly,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.569
but he can't express that because he doesn't
have the mobility in the surrounding joint

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.730
to express the full flexibility.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.959
So, perfect example, so he might wind up being
more like this functionally. So, a good example

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.819
of that would be with your lats, ok.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.159
I might have the flexibility in my lats to
get all the way up through here, up to vertical

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.680
and beyond with my arm.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.430
But I may not have the mobility in my shoulder
to get up to this point. So, my mobility is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.019
limiting my potential flexibility.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.360
And until I work on my mobility, I'm never
going to realize or fully express the flexibility

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.750
that I actually have.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.220
So, where's mobility fit in with your training?
Mobility is something that you could do before

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.280
your workouts. It's a great thing to do before
your workouts.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.799
And our dynamic stretching is a form of mobility
work because you don't just have mobility

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:11.220
in joints.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.579
*** [3:15}You activate the tissue temperature
or the warmth of the joint the more it starts

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.709
to feel like you're working through your mobility
issues, the looser you feel.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.370
Remember, another differentiation between
flexibility and mobility is going to be, what

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.099
is our exact objective measurement, where
another one is more of a subjective feeling.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.819
A flexibility deficit is going to show up
in inches or centimeters, whereas a mobility

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.730
deficit will feel like stiffness.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.709
Did you ever hear or feel like you know you
have great flexibility through your arms and

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.010
through your shoulders, but you feel stiff?

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.890
That feeling of stiffness regardless of what
your flexibility is, is something that usually

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.409
comes with the mobility issues.

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.650
So, if you're finding yourself feeling very
stiff that you can work through as you warm

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.860
up, you've got more mobility work that you
have to do.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.829
And again, you could do that before your workout.
Here's my one last example.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.359
What I did was I took 2 bands because I want
to show you that mobility doesn't just isolate

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.500
itself to joints.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.689
It definitely applies. There's a mobility
component to tissue as well, to muscle tissue

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.930
as well. This band here is a regular ATHLEANX
XTREME Band.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.989
This band is actually starting to thaw out,
but this one was in the freezer for awhile.So,

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.190
this is a lot colder band.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.560
This one, nice and warm. I could take it and
stretch it very easily. You know, there's

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.220
some good motion here through this band.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.440
I've got some good movement. Whereas this
cold band, I definitely am pulling, you know,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.340
harder to get almost as much as I can.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.760
I still feel like I don't get as much as I
had on the other band. Matter of fact, this

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.970
band is even fraying as I do this.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.600
An ice cold band is actually starting to fray
on its edges. You can't really see it from

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.540
there, but the edges are actually starting
to come up and fray.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.450
So, you can see that trying to take a cold
muscle and work with it can be a bad idea.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.410
So, you want to make sure that you're properly
warm,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.910
mobile, before you get into some of your lifting
exercises and some of your other activities

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.250
whether it be professional sports or just
recreational sports.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.350
Mobility/Flexibility, 2 very different things.
Mobility and flexibility are 2 things that

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.340
you're going to need if you want to perform
at your highest level.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.490
Guys, the cool thing here with ATHLEANX is,
there's other ways to work on your mobility.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.660
We're getting you more and more of these mobility
type videos that we do

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.610
so that you guys can learn from them, but
at the same time properly written and properly

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.370
devised exercise program, we'll work on your
mobility

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.690
because it's going to take you through ranges
of motion you may not be used to going through.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.550
And by going through those ranges of motion,
either during the warm up or during the actual

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.880
exercise itself,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.890
you're going to be improving your mobility
which will have an effect of improving your

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.460
flexibility

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.800
because if you have good flexibility, you're
finally going to be able to express it by

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.260
having a more mobile joint that these muscles
cross.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.970
So, I hope that makes sense, If you guys found
that helpful, make sure you leave a comment

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.050
and a thumb's up below.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.130
And if you want a program that takes you through
the nececssary ranges of motion to work on

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.150
your mobility while you're training so you're
getting the benefits of both at the same time,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.160
then head to ATHLEANX.COM right now and grab
our 90-Day TrainingProgram. And as I said,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.120
leave your comments.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.600
Whatever else you'd like to see me cover,
I'll make sure I do it here in these upcoming

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.660
videos.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.930
Alright guys. Thanks a lot.
