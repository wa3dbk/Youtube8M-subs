00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.870
The shop gets some love, reign of gaming summoner
forum icons, ready check dodge penalty and

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.870
jayce changes.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.410
All that and a riot point giveaway right now
on the league update.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.020
The shop is getting some sweet updates including
new item icons, and a new item.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.770
It's call Moonflair Spellblade and it's going
to be ranged only I wish I could tell you

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.000
more but I can't right now the stats on it
are placeholder.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.750
But you know what isn't placeholder these
sweet item icons.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.410
Thornmail, Hextech Revolver, Deathfire Grasp,
Vampiric Scepter, Abyssal Scepter, Catalyst

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.710
the Protector and Glacial Shroud have all
had their item icons improved.. well for the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.710
most part.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.110
I can safely say that I liked the old deathfire
and abyssal specter better.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.330
But that's ok because they finally added my
#1 most needed feature - a sell back button!

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.990
That's right if accidentally buy a hunter'
machete and then remember that you're the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.549
support you can actually sell it back and
buy wards or whatever it is support players

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.549
buy.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.520
If I had a nickel for everytime I have bought
the wrong item I would have at least a dollar

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.140
but thanks the magic of patches I don't have
to worry about that problem anymore.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.520
Our good friends over at reign of gaming have
add a nifty new tool for their forum going

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.520
community.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.979
The ability to link your reign of gaming account
with your league of legends account, and more

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.100
over if you are ranked bronze,silver,gold,platinum
or even diamond you can show off your elo

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.210
teir in a sweet forum icon.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.509
Additionally a new subforum has been launch
that can only be posted in by gold players

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.810
or higher, but don't worry us baddies can
still read what our golden overlords are chatting

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.939
about we just can't contribute to the conversation
at all.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:42.939
Hooray elitism!

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.890
Next up Jayce is getting some changes, and
as is always the case with xypherous' bible

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.960
story posts it was really ***** difficult
to figure out what exactly they are doing

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.960
to him.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.799
But thanks to the magic of an hour of reading
I finally got the skinny.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.119
And here it is:

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.329
You will no longer need to put points into
transform as it will scale automagically with

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.329
your level.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.969
This means that each of your other abilities
will now have 6 ranks.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.680
static field is getting nerfed and his Q in
hammer stance to the skies will now scale

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.760
off of ability power and deal magic damage.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760
Wait why?

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.260
everything else except static field scales
off of attack damage.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.629
If the spell is to powerful nerf it but don't
make me build hybrid.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.080
CAN I GET AN A MEN?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.540
No seriously if you think that changing to
the skies to magic damage is stupid tell me

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.659
in the comments, and if you think it's amazing
tell me in the comments.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.720
The most convincing argument will receive
2800 riot points.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.940
Finally a ready check dodge penalty is being
implemented.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.730
That's right the tool that made sure you were
ready to go to champion select so that you

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.950
didn't get a dodge timer is getting a dodge
timer.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.709
actually this isn't a bad idea, nothing is
more infuriating that 9 of ten people hitting

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.439
accept and the last one afking and the worst
that will happen is a short lock out from

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:57.489
the queue.

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.349
That does it for this week, if you enjoyed
