-Hey, good morning again.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.530
We're going to film our
second hairdo this morning.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.710
It's called triple
twist ponytail,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.890
or you can call it
twisted ponytail.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.990
Many of you guys have asked
me, who's behind the camera.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.560
So I would like to show you
who's behind the camera.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.530
-Hello.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.720
-This is my husband, Sean, and
he would like to remind you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.432
that if you like our videos, you
can join our Facebook page at--

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.520
-OK.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.840
Now on to the filming.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.010
OK.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.840
I've already done her
hair into a ponytail

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.820
and secured it
with a rubber band.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.529
And I just parted it on the side
wherever her natural part is.

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:46.070
So for this hairdo, you're going
to divide your ponytail hair

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.340
into two, two pieces.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.190
I'm going to take one piece and
kind of set it out of the way.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.010
Just hold on to that for me.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.770
And then with the
piece that I now have,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.560
I'm going to divide
it in half again.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.290
OK, now you're just going to
do a basic twist with these two

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.170
pieces, and as you can
see I twist to the right.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.510
It doesn't matter which
way you twist, just

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.950
make sure you keep track
of which way you're going.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.590
So mine is going
to go to the right.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.900
Hang on to that, please.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.890
I'm going to divide this
side into two pieces

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.340
and twist it as well, again
going to the same direction.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.630
So if you went left on this
one, go left on the second one.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.140
If you went right
on the first one,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.300
go right on the second one.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.060
Now you have your
two pieces, and they

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.790
are both twisted to the right.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.760
Now you're going to
twist them together,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.690
but you're going to go
the opposite direction

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.680
from what you were doing before.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.780
So now I'm going to
twist to the left.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.790
Do you have the
elastic, sweetie?

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.270
And then when you're done,
just secure with a rubber band.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.270
By twisting them one direction
and then the opposite

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.535
when they're twisted
together, it secures the twist

00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:57.870
and keeps it from untwisting
when you put the elastic in.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:08.509
So there you have-- I'm going
to add a little flower to hers--

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.350
the triple twisted ponytail.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.530
And it's going to
stay in really tight.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.200
It's one of my faves,
it's super fast,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.610
and people comment
on it all the time

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.200
because it looks a lot more
complicated than it really is.
