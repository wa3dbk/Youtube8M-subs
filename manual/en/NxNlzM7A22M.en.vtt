&gt;&gt;The robust art program at the University of Wisconsin Stout allows
students to earn a coveted bachelor of fine
arts degree in one of five accredited programs.

00:00:15.406 --> 00:00:21.936
Including studio art, multimedia or entertainment design,
interior design, industrial design and graphic design.

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:25.586
Students create high level work and benefit from high placement rank.

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:30.106
A new Master of Fine Arts program also
speaks to the quality of the Art program.

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:35.506
&gt;&gt; The strength of our program here at Stout,
I would have to say there are a few things.

00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:40.236
One, I think I'm going to start by reflecting
back to what students tell me.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:54.276
The class size and the ability to have real relationships with their
instructors and the amount the instructors care about them and
their career and building them as designers and as whole people.

00:00:54.586 --> 00:00:58.926
I think another strength we have where
we offer BFA, Bachelor of Fine Arts.

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:15.916
As part of a BFA and the big difference between a BS in design is that
they have more studio art, or fine art class work and some more art
history and so what that gives them are
more opportunities to problem solve.

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:34.416
&gt;&gt; The cool thing I can do with art and technology and that's where I
kind of found Stout to kind of provide me that access to explore the
options of combining both computers and
what I have always loved which was drawing.

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:46.886
I had hoped to work in the entertainment industry doing
concept art or concept design illustrations for game or movies.

00:01:47.846 --> 00:02:00.756
&gt;&gt; When I visited the campus I was very impressed by the career
services and the focus on really helping students have
that industry focus as their going through school.

00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:05.876
And that's something that I had been missing
in my previous liberal arts education.

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:14.316
We really work to help connect students who are interested
in pursuing internships with those opportunities.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:26.266
So our students are getting out there, not just with regional or local
internship opportunities on both coasts
as well as internationally now.

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:31.016
We're really trying to have creative push
there with international experiences.

00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:33.026
&gt;&gt; That's how I got my internship in Singapore.

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:37.836
I had to look it up where that was before
I left because I had no idea.

00:02:38.146 --> 00:02:52.136
So I decided to intern with them and got a chance to see designs for
one of their sub brands internet speaker
radio and learned a lot about electronics.

00:02:52.846 --> 00:03:00.346
And Southeast Asia was amazing, it was a very
different experience also very beneficial.

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:19.546
&gt;&gt; This past summer I had the opportunity to study in London, exposure
to a new and different culture really helped
refine me and define me as an artist and designer.

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:27.266
&gt;&gt; At Stout we offer students five different
opportunities within the art and design disciplines.

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:39.116
Placement rates are quite high for our graduates, in the 90s, 90
percentile range, very high it's very extraordinary
in terms of getting jobs in their field.

00:03:39.826 --> 00:04:01.006
&gt;&gt;The experience here is different from other
Universities and I really, really love it, I just love it.
