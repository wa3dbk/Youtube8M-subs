00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.680
The Crocells robots sticks to the steel walls
using magnetic adhesion, it has an array of

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.380
permanent magnets rear earth magnets mounted
on the underside which stick the robot to

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.000
the wall. It is wirelessly controlled.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.000
 It has a floor detector on it which gathers ultrasonic

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.350
data and transmits that back wirelessly to
a laptop. So the operator can sit safe on

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.510
the ground and operate this robot and collect
the data.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.400
There are other applications, other industrial
tasks where the climbing surface is not ferrous

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.000
so you cannot use magnets. For example if
you want to inspect a dam to look for cracks

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.650
or to inspect a building to see if there are
any cracks appearing in the panels or in the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.510
brickwork then you need a robot that can stick
to non ferrous surfaces. We built a robot

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.030
called vortex which is like your vacuum cleaner.
There is a spinning motor, it creates a negative

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.030
pressure and this robot can climb on brick
surfaces, on plaster, on concrete even on

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.640
metal, aluminium, on aircraft fuselage and
wings.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.680
The Vortex robot can be used for surveillance
because it can climb buildings, so it will

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.680
be very helpful to security services to look
at situations inside a building by climbing

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.970
up and looking through a window.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.190
It can be equipped with a light weight camera
very easily and handsets useful for that purpose.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.940
Another inspection task that we addressed
with climbing robots is that of inspecting

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.459
wind turbine blades. Wind turbines are being
constructed in big numbers now and they're

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.290
mostly out at sea, it is difficult to inspect
these blades while they are out there. Only

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.340
way to inspect them is to remove the blade
bring it to the mainland and then to carry

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.709
out the inspection. That's very expensive.
If we can build a robot that can climb the

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.660
windtower reach that blade and then use X-rays
to look at the blade completely then you would

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.319
save a huge amount of expense.
Thatâ€™s what we have done, we have built

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.319
this robot called the Concept robot which
climbs the windtower, it can climb straight

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.520
up or it can spiral around the tower or it
can even rotate at the same spot. It climbs

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.440
the tower and the deploys the X-rays to use
a technique called computed x-ray tomography

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.470
to have a complete assessment of the blade.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.700
One of the most efficient ways to carry product

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:22.789
things like gas/oil is by using pipelines
and there are hundreds of kilometres of pipelines

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.919
around the world in Europe which need to be
inspected. These pipelines are buried so the

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.499
only way to inspect them is to go inside the
pipeline and then to see if there are any

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:41.279
cracks in the pipeline or if there some part
has collapsed. This is being done with what

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:46.800
are called Smartpigs, these are hugely expensive
machines costing about a million pounds each

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.770
which go down the pipeline and look for these
defects. We are building robots that can go

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.360
into those pipelines which are considered
unpiggable because their diameter changes

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.689
or maybe they have restrictions such as valves
which prevent the bigger smarter Pigs from

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:05.529
going down there.
