Hi, my name's Melissa and I work for Virgin Media.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.570
Today, I'm going to give you some hints and tips on how to get the best out of your mobile phone.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.650
Today, I'm going to give you some hints and tips on how to get the best out of your mobile phone.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.679
First thing we're going to do, is a hard reboot.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.619
It helps you with most of your network issues, things like calls dropping,

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.990
or text messages not being received.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.990
So firstly, whilst your phone is switched on, you just want to remove the back cover.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.949
Then what you want to do is remove the battery. If you're struggling with it

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.680
turn it upside down in your hand and pop it out.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, when the phone is switched off, we're just going to replace the battery.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now we're going to put the back cover back on.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.030
Then switch it back on using the on and off key,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.380
and that's a hard reboot!

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.920
The second thing I'm going to show you is how to swap your sim card.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.790
Again, just take off the back cover

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.290
and now you're just going to slide the sim card out  that's already in

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.720
and replace it with another sim card from the same network.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.720
Just remove the battery for a few seconds just to reset the phone,

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.229
and then put the back cover back on.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.170
Again switch it back on using the on and off key. If the sim card swap doesn't fix your issue, then it might tell you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.259
the problem is with the mobile phone.  Lastly, what we're going to do is

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.580
a software update.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.720
Now all handsets are different

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.619
but i'm using a Samsung today so if
you've got a Samsung too you just need

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.670
to go on to the Samsung website and download Samsung Kies.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.800
Now, I've already downloaded it so I'm just going to load it up,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.039
and there are a number of different ways
you can connect your phone now I always

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.610
find that the easiest way is using the
usb cable that came with your handset.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.469
All you need to do is plug it in

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.399
and the other into your mobile,

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:26.229
making sure its fully switched on and charged up.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.969
Samsung Kies will now tell you what software you're actually running on your

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.889
mobile phone,

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.129
and what the latest update is.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.609
So you just click on 'update'

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.369
and then start 'update'.

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.639
In a few seconds you're phone will have the latest update. The importance of having the latest

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.379
software on your phone is to make sure that your phone is running at the best performance.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.579
software on your phone is to make sure that your phone is running at the best performance.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.230
I hope these hints and tips have helped you, and don't forget,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.199
you can use them more then once.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.569
Thanks for watching.
