Hello, I'm John-Henry from Better Music and today we're going to talk about some of the

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.180
Bach Stradivarius trumpets that we have here. So we have a range of trumpets, we have the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.100
Bach Stradivarius 37, we have the Bach Stradivarius 43, we have the Bach Stradivarius 72, and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.900
finally we have the Bach Artisan models.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.800
A little later on we'll be joined by a good
friend of mine, Zach Raffan, who is formally of the Canberra Symphony 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.800
and he's going to give us a bit of a demonstration on what these models can do and what they can offer.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:10.800
Okay, so first up we have the Bach Stradivarius 37. This is pretty much your go-to trumpet

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.940
as far as the advanced, the beginner, the intermediate player, through to professionals. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.700
Basically, this is where you want to start, if you're not sure about what sort of style you want

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.590
to play, if you want to mix, if you want to
play some classical or some jazz, then this

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.600
is the one for you.
They come with a standard 7C mouthpiece.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.750
What we've got here is the standard lead pipe and
we've got the standard 37 bell.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.700
This instrument is very good for intonation, it's accuracy
of pitch. It's what I play...

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.000
and it's just an all round good, reliable horn.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.200
Next up, we have the Bach Stradivarius 43.
Now this particular model is basically the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.600
same as the 37, but it has a slightly wider
taper on the bell. This is a really great

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.800
horn for projection, if you want to just cut
through a little bit, because of the shape

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.380
of the bell you are going to get a bit more
volume, a bit of a darker tone, it's also

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.130
available in a heavy weight, what we've got
here is a standard weight. This is a really

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.410
nice horn for the classical player or the
jazz player, it's got a really rich sound

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.400
and a great centre of pitch. Beautiful dark
tonality.
