00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.900
The air is filled with smoke.
Live rounds fired from tanks have set parts

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.960
of the forest ablaze. These US soldiers must
proceed carefully as they launch an attack

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.270
with tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopters
and even a fighter jet all firing live ammunition

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.750
around them.
"Roger, can I get distance, direction, location?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.140
This is the culminating battle of exercise
Combined Resolve II. Over a period of six

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.760
week some 4,000 participants from 15 NATO
and partner nations have been learning to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.200
operate together at the US Army's training
areas in Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels in southeastern

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
Germany.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.840
"Hurry up and get out of the road, they're
coming! Push across!"

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.190
"Fairly soon we're going to have aircraft
from German airforce will fly in and they

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.489
will drop ordnance called in from a US tactical
air controller. We will have partner nations,

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.400
light infantry from Georgia come seize key
terrain, key villages with live ammunition

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.430
and they will pass through a Romanian tank
battalion that will continue to engage targets

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.380
[inaudible] downrange. And simultaneously
a US tank battalion will do a mine-clearing

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.860
breach and attack from a flank from the west
and be able to hit targets, so the enemy is

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.120
going to be caught between two flanking fires
of two very lethal formations, so I don't

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.490
think it's going to be a good day for the
enemy."

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.399
In this live-fire portion of the training
the enemy is of course simulated.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.590
These pop-up targets are precisely calibrated
to fall over only when directly hit. Grafenwoehr

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.869
is the most technologically advanced training
area in Europe.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.829
This training of US forces and the prepositioning
of equipment show America's continued commitment

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.659
to its NATO Allies and partners.
"Yes we did lose our armoured units here in

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.840
Europe, but now we're back with our armour
sets, so we have tanks and Bradleys and brigade

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.530
communications equipment and artillery paladins
that are here and will stay right here in

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.620
Grafenwoehr. So when the units come over to
train we don't have that enormous cost of

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.060
shipping equipment and material across the
Atlantic - it's all already here. It can be

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.069
used for training and it can be used for operational
requirement if called upon by NATO."

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.790
This green environment poses new challenges
to soldiers more used to operating in the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.540
barren landscape of Afghanistan with far fewer
ways to hide.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.660
The Romanians see themselves at a natural
advantage with their forest camouflage, but

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.959
it's one they're keen to share.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:01.150
"We surprised the coalition forces by our
camouflage. It was one of the points we can

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.239
share, we can discuss after the exercise and
I think all of us learn from each other."
