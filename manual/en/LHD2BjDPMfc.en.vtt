00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:10.180
This is a unipressure machine. What we have
here is, we have a shirt in our wet box, and

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.410
we press the shirts while they're wet 'cause
it gives it a lot better feeling. So, what

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.289
she's going to do, is she's going to pull
the shirt out of the wet box and what we're

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.679
going to be doing here is pressing the cuffs
and collars. So what we're doing here is we're

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.280
pressing the cuff and collars. And this is
a really nice machine 'cause it presses the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:45.870
cuff and it also pleats it at the same time.
Now this machine here, this is all metal.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:57.329
It's like a regular iron, so what you're doing
is you're using the heat from the machine

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:06.490
to dry your shirt while it's wet. So what
it's doing right now is it's pushing up against

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:15.619
the hot metal here and we have a pad underneath
the cuff and collars which kind of gives it

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.640
some leeway so we don't break the buttons
off and stuff. So, and later on when we go

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.549
through the other process I'll show you how
to check the buttons and stuff because sometimes

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:39.430
this machine will break the top button off.
But we replace that for free anyways, so....So

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.219
now what we have is a finished cuff and collar,
makes it real nice. This is what we call a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:58.590
buck, or a shirt form, and what she's going
to do here, is we're going to put the shirt

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.580
over and around it, and we put up the - we
hold the collar down. And this shirt machine

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.500
uses a vacuum to hold the shirt to it. Some
machines have a little metal bar right here

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:15.170
and they're going to leave a mark, which is
just extra work in the future. So what it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.950
does is it extends the sleeves so you still
got a really nice cuff and collar on here,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.950
and what's going to happen is the shirt machine's
going to go inside here and there's two hot

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.270
metal plates that exactly the form of this
form. So what it's going to do, we're going

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:39.540
to go in, and what it does is it blows steam
through the sleeve and then air and drys your

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.930
sleeve out. And like the same thing as this,
'cause you have two hot metal plates that

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:53.830
are pushing against the shirt, and it's drying
it with the heat from the plate. All right.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:08.850
When the shirt comes out, we have some imperfections
that we'll touch up later. But other than

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.360
that we get a pretty perfect shirt out here.
