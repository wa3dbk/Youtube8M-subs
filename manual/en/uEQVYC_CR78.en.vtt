00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.510
set factors that might

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.680
be causing the sagging

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.740

expect are tight and firm

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.500
skin, so it will get

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.630

It will rejuvenate your skin

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.960
add moisture to your

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.290
skin other lotions that

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.920
were used to using

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.550
on a daily basis.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.640
and one of the reasons

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.450
why we'll do that

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.270

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.270
your skin to

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.290
promote a healthy skin all

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.540
over your body.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.030
first of all

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.590
this product contains and

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:01.950
improved essity it also contains oil.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.720
And the oil is going to

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.020
help with the moisture

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.870
that our body needs.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.980
nice firm and tight.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.570
This lotion also contains rich

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.010
Omega complex, which is going

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.900
to help with renewed skin cell development.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.980
So very quickly I just want

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.900
to go ahead and show that all of you

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.930
have I have incorporated this

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.850
Where lotion every time

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.220
after I'm out of the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.540
shower because that's when End

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.530
up with force and

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.150
you are allowing tightness twice a day.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.410
If you want to use it more then twice a day, you can go ahead and do that.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.810
I use it twice a day, I like to do it after I shower.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.830
And I either do it in the mornings or at night.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.200
So the second time when I

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.510
use it, it depends on whether,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.180
you know, when I find time throughout the day to do it.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.060
Anyway that's all for this

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.100
review, I hope all of you

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.880
enjoyed reading about this amazing skin

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.530
