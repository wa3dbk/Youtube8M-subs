I'm Bill Elzey with Showplace Lawns. How to
till a garden. Well first of all you must

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.670
ask why do you want to till it? Is it to cultivate
the weeds, get rid of them? Then you need

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.420
to be careful that you don't break off roots
because the roots will stay and form new weeds

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.430
and come back up. If you are tilling it for
an installation I would suggest that first

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.360
you use a shovel and dig it up, then come
back with the tiller such as this and run

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.460
the tiller over it. That will break everything
up, level it out and make it easier to work

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.980
with the rake to get a nice bed going. The
other reason that you want to till it is you

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.680
want to incorporate all the soil together
and loosen it to where you can have something

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.640
to work with at a depth that the plant's root
will grow. You want to be careful when doing

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.851
that depending on where you choose to put
your garden there may be rocks. As you are

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:17.751
tilling and you come to a rock area just simply
lift it up and you'll be fine. Tilling a garden

00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:24.000
is something that doesn't need to be done
all the time. Basically in the construction

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.460
phase to get it going once it is planted then
simply keep it cultivated with a hoe or a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.979
smaller tiller but keep in mind one thing
too as far as tilling a garden is concerned,

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.040
with the droughts that we have had across
the country we need to think of ways of keeping

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.310
as much moisture in the soil as possible.
When we run a tiller across the surface we

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.450
are opening that ground up and the carbon
dioxide and stuff is coming out and what that

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.080
does tend to do is dry the soil. So if you
are going to till the garden till it in the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:13.569
beginning stages, till it when you redo it
later on, but not do it as a constant activity

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.189
in the garden.
