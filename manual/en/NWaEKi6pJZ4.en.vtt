00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.076
Hello to all my PinturaFacil’s friends

00:00:01.076 --> 00:00:04.247
stay with me because today we’ll show

00:00:04.247 --> 00:00:11.247
some tricks for watercolor projects

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:23.627
I want to show you some tricks that some of our friends asked

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:24.466
a simple thing

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:29.626
that we can do when painting watercolors

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:35.727
I’m showing here many of the projects we have made in our web

00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:41.887
painted with watercolor or watercolour pencils

00:00:41.887 --> 00:00:43.827
what I think I’m going to do

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:50.747
to make clickable every card of these, so when you’ll see this video

00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:51.737
I just think that every card will be clickable

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:58.616
so if you click here, you’ll see the video of this little fish card

00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:03.787
or the stars video or the mistletoe one, ok?

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:06.987
But before continuing with the watercolor tricks

00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:09.667
I want to share with you a channel

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.257
called “Haz Regalos” (Make Gifts)

00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:18.007
where you can find a lot of beautiful crafts

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:22.067
On today I want to show you some of them like

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:27.037
like this card called “slide card”

00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:32.347
they teach you how to do this moving card that is a very ingenious thing!!

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:35.366
There is also another one that is named  “cascade”

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:40.606
so when you open it you can see lots of images that move

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:49.037
It’s super duper!! and they give you ideas of colorful images to use

00:01:49.037 --> 00:01:54.417
and there is another beautiful card I want to share with you

00:01:54.417 --> 00:01:59.726
Apart from that it seems to be a kind of our patchwork projects....

00:01:59.726 --> 00:02:01.067
It’s a card called “roulette”

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:06.377
and you start filling it with messages 

00:02:06.377 --> 00:02:11.927
and the best of all is that it is reversible!!! I like it very much!!

00:02:11.927 --> 00:02:16.866
So go and visit this “HazRegalos” channel, watch those wonderful videos

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:18.487
and subscribe

00:02:18.487 --> 00:02:23.386
to start receiving nice craft tutorials

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:29.346
So now, let’s return to our watercolor tricks

00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:30.886
so I wanted

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:33.756
to answer to some questions

00:02:33.756 --> 00:02:36.157
of how

00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:39.376
to get this flat watercolor cards

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:44.156
because watercolor tends to deform the paper slightly

00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:49.117
In this case i have this pigeon card (it’ll also be clickable)

00:02:49.117 --> 00:02:50.117
jejeje :)

00:02:50.117 --> 00:02:54.396
In this case this little pigeon that I just painted for a video

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:57.327
and see how it moves

00:02:57.327 --> 00:03:00.416
I’m going to take off the other

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:03.276
to show you this one

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:04.466
so

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:07.186
as you can see it moves

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:10.407
because the paper is curved

00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:11.866
here you can see

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:13.277
it is curved

00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:18.776
while drying

00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:23.366
I’m going to show an easely trick

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:28.366
that you can do at home

00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:31.666
so, you’ll need 

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:34.166
a wood board

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:38.136
it can be the same us when you paint on fabric

00:03:39.016 --> 00:03:42.486
or a rigid surface

00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:47.466
I really recommend you a wood board that is natural 

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:51.656
and withstands heat that we’ll use now

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:55.696
so put your watercolor on top

00:03:55.696 --> 00:04:00.096
and protect it with a piece of paper towel

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:04.726
don’t worry about these materials... 

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:08.146
you can reuse them many times, we won’t waste anything

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:10.786
you can see that it is here

00:04:10.786 --> 00:04:17.296
and we’ll apply heat

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:24.217
using the iron

00:04:24.217 --> 00:04:29.217
we have to be carefull

00:04:29.217 --> 00:04:31.187
with heat

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:34.807
right now I have it in off

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:37.376
What I did was to heat the iron

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:41.617
then turn it off

00:04:41.617 --> 00:04:45.956
to apply it on the watercolor. If I remove the iron I can see that it still lifts

00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:51.006
so I’m going to leave it a little bit more. This way we’re not using electricity

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:59.296
and we take care of not burn the paper

00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:00.617
because the iron can always burn things

00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:01.826
this way

00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:06.296
iron is getting cold

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:08.066
so the paper

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:17.326
will become flat with heat and the weight of the iron

00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:20.927
You have to do this once you have

00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:23.886
all your little cards done

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:29.166
to not consume much time and electricity

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:35.117
and use the heat once

00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:37.596
for many little cards

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:39.486
or many watercolor projects

00:05:39.486 --> 00:05:41.467
as you can see

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:45.126
it is almost done

00:05:45.126 --> 00:05:50.426
the towel paper is perfect, I can use it again

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:54.087
I can leave it a little bit more
0:05:57.020,0:03:03.289
but it is done

00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:04.606
or you can leave it there to be sure

00:06:04.606 --> 00:06:06.486
until it is cold

00:06:06.486 --> 00:06:19.196
and you’ll see it is completely flat and it won’t curved later

00:06:19.196 --> 00:06:23.596
this is why you should use a wood board

00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:25.816
because it brooks very well the heat

00:06:25.816 --> 00:06:32.816
it transmits it, it doesn’t burn and it is hard

00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:35.247
so

00:06:35.247 --> 00:06:42.247
the watercolor paper can take the form

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:45.406
and you can see it very well … and hot!!

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:47.106
but very nice

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:53.087
ok?

00:06:53.087 --> 00:06:58.046
so this is the way you can flat the watercolor projects

00:06:58.046 --> 00:07:00.456
to have them perfect

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:05.967
to have a good finishing for them

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:09.907
you’ll have the links for any of these projects

00:07:09.907 --> 00:07:10.826
because

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:14.286
you want to watch any of them

00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:16.117
by making click

00:07:16.117 --> 00:07:17.166
over it

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:19.897
and go to watch it

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:21.777
ok?

00:07:21.777 --> 00:07:26.367
So thanks again for the questions and comments

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:28.456
because I did think before somebody didn’t know 

00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:33.847
that at the end of this work we had to flat it

00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:37.906
because of the curves

00:07:37.906 --> 00:07:41.766
so thanks again for your questions

00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:43.726
because it can help many people

00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:45.586
to make this finishes

00:07:45.586 --> 00:07:48.906
A big kiss to everyone and see you next time
