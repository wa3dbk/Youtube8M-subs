Phil: Welcome to my bedroom.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.700
If you haven't picked up my free online organic
gardening course you can do that right on

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.920
the home page of Smilinggardener.com.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.159
Today we're talking about starting plants
from seeds.

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:22.009
I like going right into something like this
that has the trays and then you can grow the

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.230
plants individually and then you pull them
right out of here and put them into the garden.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.150
So this has holes in it for drainage, then
I can plop it into this guy which doesn't

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.110
have holes in it, and that can capture the
water - so that's how that works!

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.610
In terms of what kind of potting mix you use
if you get a conventional potting mix it's

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.930
usually going to have chemicals or fertilizers
in it, or peat moss in it.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.980
Now chemical fertilizers, I'm not really a
big fan of for a number of reasons.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.140
The peat moss I'm not a huge fan of, it's
something that basically is not that sustainable

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.310
- we should be leaving those peat bogs where
they are.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.600
They have a really important role to play
in our ecosystem.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.670
That being said, it can be beneficial in seed
starting there's even research showing that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.420
if you don't have peat moss in there the process
doesn't work quite as well, it still has always

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.430
worked okay for me.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.720
So I'm not really sure what to say about that.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.049
I don't tend to use peat moss, but a little
bit maybe is okay.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.289
Can I leave it at that for now?

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:11.299
Because I want to keep the video short.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.450
What I recommend most people do is go and
buy an organic potting mix, a seed starting

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.590
mix or a potting mix that's OMRI listed - that
means you know it's organic.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.549
It probably is going to have peat moss in
there, it's going to have some compost in

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.549
there.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.609
Maybe a bit of lime, but that's something
that's really easy to get going with.

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.030
If you have a really nice big window you can
just put your seeds right there.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.020
They really need at least eight hour of sun
a day, and what I always find is even if I

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.150
have a nice big window it can be difficult
to get enough sun because your overhang of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.170
your roof and the walls block some of that
sun from coming in.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.439
And what happens is the plants can start leaning
to the sun and get kind of lanky.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.959
So what you have to do in that case is turn
the plants regularly.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.020
That's kind of unnatural actually to have
to be turned like that all the time but that's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.399
what you need to do.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.209
On the other hand what I like to do is have
a little bit of supplemental lighting.

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.549
So here is a fluorescent light - it's in the
six thousand calvin range so look for that

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.549
when you're buying it.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.969
I'll turn it on so you can see it, and what
I do is I have it propped up about four to

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.410
six inches above wherever my plants are.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.940
So occasionally I need to raise it up a bit.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.520
And I just put it on top of whatever I have,
today I have it on top of my book.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.780
That's usually where it kind of starts out
at.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.950
And I just set it there like that.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.980
What I do is I'll just leave this on for twelve
to fourteen hours a day so then the plants

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.980
are getting a lot more light and they can
grow more efficiently, they're going to grow

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.090
straight up instead of pointing out towards
the window.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.200
I still often put it by a window anyway, I
don't know why I kind of like having that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200
natural light there.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.370
Now the other thing we can do to really improve
this process is to have a heat matt to provide

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.880
some heat because a lot of these plants really
want to have nice warm soil and you know,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.660
we want things to happen fairly quickly.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.750
And so that's where a heat matt comes in - it
plugs right into the wall, you set it right

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.540
under the tray just like this, and you've
got our heat!

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.460
Seeds can take a while to get germinating
and get going and we really want to help them

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.530
along with that process so what I do is I
soak them for six to twelve hours.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.290
That's why I have them sitting in this bowl
instead of in a seed packet.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.930
So there's a couple of reasons we do this.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.570
One is just having them in water is going
to get them nice and full of water of course

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.140
they need water to get germinating and so
it really helps them kind of swell up and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.970
get going, it really starts that germination
process.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.460
The other reason is the water allows me to
coat them in some other things that I've talked

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.460
about before.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.040
Liquid kelp which has lots of different minerals
and natural growth hormones that really help

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.780
that germination process along.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.180
So it's a main one that is often used in soaking
seeds.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.870
It should say on the label hopefully, but
just half a teaspoon per five hundred milliliters

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.870
of water.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.560
The same amount of sea minerals, which is
full of minerals and other bioactive substances

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.290
and you could use either of these or you could
use both of them.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.500
Now I'm starting something that I've never
bothered starting before and that is corn,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.460
and that's kind of a weird thing to start
because you can just put corn out there and

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.460
it works fine.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.130
But I just kind of wanted to see what happens
when you start corn so I thought I'm going

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.130
to start corn today.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.350
The next thing I do once I've poured that
off is I take my mycorrizzhal fungi, because

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.120
corn LOVES these mycorrizzhal fungi and I
just sprinkle on the tiniest little bit over

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.120
the seeds.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120
Ta Da!

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.120
I have some potting mix in here now.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.370
And I actually have a good tip for you, after
you get your potting mix in there then you

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.130
can water in it before you've done your seeding
and it's just a little bit easier to get things

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.050
wet before hand I find.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.630
When I do that, you know, I put my biostimulants
and my EM in there as well, it's just a habit

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.530
of mine whenever I'm watering something like
this - I'm using those biostimulants.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.320
Often when you do something like this it make
sense to seed two seeds into each spot and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.000
then what happens is when they come up you
can basically cut out the weakest seedling

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.820
that means you're always selecting for a stronger
seedling.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.340
So in this case since I'm planting corn and
since they're so big and since I know they're

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.030
going to germinate pretty well, or I HOPE
they're going to germinate pretty well I'm

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.030
only going to plant one.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.530
Do you guys think it's kind of weird to start
corn from seed?

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.590
I think it's kind of weird to start corn from
seed, but it's also really fun to try stuff

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.630
like this.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.160
Who knows what will happen??

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.900
Here's how we do it...go like that...and just
make sure it's covered!

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.030
Some seeds will come up in a few days, some
will take a couple of weeks.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.400
A lot of the vegetable seeds we do will take
less than a week.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.660
You want to keep it moist in there and until
they've germinated an easy way to do that

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.970
without really aggravating the seeds with
the watering can is to use a spray bottle.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.669
Once I'm done seeding I'll put this on top
to keep the moisture in there, and then once

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.180
those have germinated and come up I'm going
to want to take that off or at least remove

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.510
it partly to get some more air circulation
going on in there.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.710
Then eventually I'll take it right off.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.690
Through the magic of time travel we now have
corn!

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.410
It's actually been about a week and things
are looking really good and there's only problem

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.460
is that I'm heading out of town tomorrow for
three weeks, so I have to plant this corn

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.460
today!

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.060
Ideally what I would want to do is let in
be in here for probably another week or so

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.410
to establish a stronger root system, but I
can't do that so we'll see how well it works

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.950
but at least we have a nice example here of
starting from seed.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.100
If you have any questions about starting plans
from seeds you can ask them down below and

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.100
I will answer.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.950
