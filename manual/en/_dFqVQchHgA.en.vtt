00:00:00.846 --> 00:00:06.966
We all know the Biblical tale of Moses upon the fiery mountain.

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:14.196
The one about the cities of the plain destroyed in a fiery hailstorm whose description could refer to a volcanic eruption.

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:23.186
The fact that many Biblical texts clearly refer to volcanic activity has been well known to historians for a long time.

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:27.546
The word Zion is widely known; theologians interpret it as "pillar".

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:33.006
Identifying Zion as Sinai and Horeb is common in both theology and Bible studies.

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:42.486
Hieronymus in particular noted that: "it appears that the same mountain is called by two different names, Sinai and Horeb".

00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:58.366
The believers believe everything the Bible tells them without questioning, whereas the vehement atheists renounce everything the book has to say as nonsense, absurdity and malignant spells used for enslaving the people and keeping it obedient and ignorant.

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:03.046
The rational person shall however try to think of what the ancient author could really be referring to?

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:03.436
Volcanoes?

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:14.926
But there aren't any active volcanoes anywhere in the Middle East - nor Northern Africa, nor most of continental Europe, for that matter.

00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:20.736
However, there is an exception - Italy and the famous Vesuvius.

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:25.716
It is at a considerable distance from Palestine, granted.

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:52.656
But let us sit down for a second, draw our breath and make the heretical presumption that the real events that became reflected in the book we know as the Bible really took place elsewhere, despite of what the illustrations in the modern bibles are telling us.

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:56.056
This book will change your entire perception of History forever!

00:01:56.056 --> 00:02:01.526
What if Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt were invented during Renaissance?

00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:11.696
What if the Old Testament was a rendition of events in the Middle Ages What if Jesus Christ was born in 1053 and crucified in 1086 AD?

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:12.936
Sounds Unbelievable?

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:16.376
Not after you've read "History: Fiction or Science?"

00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:22.656
by Anatoly Fomenko, the leading mathematician of our time.

00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:27.496
Modern maps place the East on the right, and the West on the left.

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:38.506
However, we find that the opposite is true for many mediaeval maps - all of the sea charts of the alleged 14th century had the East on the left, and the West on the right.

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:45.636
These charts may have been used by either traders or the military fleet.

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:52.676
Why did the old maps, and sea charts in particular, have the East on their left, and the West on their right?

00:02:52.676 --> 00:03:05.586
The reason may have been that the first seafarers of Europe would sail forth from the seaports located on the European coast of the Mediterranean, as well as the Black and Azov seas, and so they had to move from the North to the South.

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:10.376
The South was therefore in front, and the Northern coast behind them.

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:16.446
A ship captain sailing into the Mediterranean from the Bosporus would look at the approaching African coast.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:24.826
Thus, the East was on the left, and the West was on the right.

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:39.366
This is why the first sea charts of both the traders and the military put the East on the left.

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:43.696
It made sense to put that which lay in front on the top of the map.

00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:49.616
Thus, the way one looks at the map corresponds with the direction of one's movement.

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:52.926
This book will change your entire perception of History forever!

00:03:52.926 --> 00:03:56.576
What if Ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt were invented during Renaissance?

00:03:56.576 --> 00:04:06.206
What if the Old Testament was a rendition of events in the Middle Ages What if Jesus Christ was born in 1053 and crucified in 1086 AD?

00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:06.746
Sounds Unbelievable?

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:07.946
