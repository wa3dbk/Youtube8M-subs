The coming week is an important one for Australia
-- it's a week that will boost jobs and help

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.410
families.Tomorrow, Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe will visit our country. During

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.830
his visit, we will sign the historic Economic
Partnership Agreement with Japan.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.310
 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.820
Japan is Australia's second biggest trading partner
-- with almost $70 billion in two-way trade

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.820
every year.Australia is a trading nation -- and
more trade means more jobs.This agreement

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:46.879
is important for our farming sector -- with
better access to Japan for our beef, cheese,

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.879
horticulture and wine.And consumers will benefit
from less expensive household appliances and

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.879
electronics.As well, this week the Government's
legislation to scrap the carbon tax is expected

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:08.609
to be voted on in the Senate.You have already
voted to scrap the carbon tax -- and now it's

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.150
up to the Senate to do the same.The Coalition
has fought hard to scrap this toxic tax -- we

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.850
know it hurts jobs, it hurts families and
it does nothing at all for the environment.We're

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.660
voting to scrap it because that is the best
way to take pressure off families as well

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.660
as help the economy. Scraping the carbon tax
will save families, on average, $550 a year.Every

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.000
single one of the Coalition's Senators will
vote to scrap the carbon tax -- but every

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
single Labor Senator will vote to keep it.Lowering
the tax burden and opening up Australia to

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.800
more trade are part of the Government's Economic
Action Strategy to build a strong, prosperous

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.930
economy for a safe and secure Australia.
