00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.960
Manuka honey is simply honey which has only
been made from the manuka tree, which is native

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.580
to New zeland.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.940
Manuka honey differs from generic honey because
it is significantly higher in an antibacterial

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.400
compound called methylglyoxal.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.580
This compound is known to promote the health
of the digestive system and help wounds heal.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.970
Manuka honey also contains a number of other
anti-bacterial bioactive components, which,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.030
when combined with methylglyoxal, give manuka
honey very powerful antibacterial properties.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.579
Because many of these compounds are sensitive
to farming methods, heat and light, the quantity

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.920
of these compounds can vary dramatically from
one source of manuka honey to the other.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.050
The Unique Manuka Factor (or UMF) represents
the total antibacterial power of a batch manuka

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.050
honey.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.420
The higher the UMF value indicates greater
antibacterial abilities.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.030
The UMF factor is often displayed on the jar,
and is considered to be a reliable medical

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.949
measure of its antibacterial properties.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.040
As most manuka honey producers heat the honey
to process it, many abio-active compounds

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.570
are destroyed in processing.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.350
Raw honey can be made from any plants, and
is simply honey which has not been heated.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.799
This means that the any heat sensitive bioactive
compounds are not destroyed in processing.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.680
Examples of these bio-active compounds are:

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.560
Bee-defensin, which is a powerful antibacterial
agent which is known to promote digestion

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.979
health.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.219
Caffeic acid – a phenolic compound which
is a powerful antioxidant.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.270
Catechins – Another phenolic compound, which
is also found in green tea.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.079
Catechins are also powerful antioxidants,
and are associated with protecting the cardiovascular

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.109
system.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.289
Due to natural variation in honey, there is
no guarantee how much of these compounds are

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.240
present in each jar of raw honey.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.670
This makes its potency less reliable than
manuka honey.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.890
So in short, Manuka honey is a powerful antibacterial
agent, which is tested for potency, whereas

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:15.950
raw honey has many more beneficial compounds
in but the quantity is not measured.
