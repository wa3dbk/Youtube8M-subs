Hi everyone, I'm Becky from TalkBeckyTalk.
Now over a third of you have said that your

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.740
biggest beauty questions are all to do with
hair, so I wanted to create a soft, textured

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.520
half up do that is so easy to do. The first
thing that you're going to need to do is make

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.210
sure that your hair is nice and clean. So
I'm using my Herbal Essences Clearly Naked

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.500
Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner. I've been
using Herbal Essences since I was a teenager

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.480
so I know that I love these shampoos and conditioners.
These are actually free from a lot of the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.350
chemicals you often find in shampoos and conditioners.
You'll see that my roots are really bad at

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.370
the moment, I'm actually giving my hair a
bit of a break from colour and this shampoo

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.290
and conditioner is really going to put that
moisture back in my hair, it helps with my

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.540
dry ends and it smells of mint, it smells
so, so beautiful and leaves my hair just so

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.330
soft. Next up I'm going to use my Head &amp; Shoulders
thick &amp; strong extra thickening treatment.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.440
This is one of my favourite scalp treatments,
I raved about this all last year because I

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.420
used to use a lot of high end ones really
similar to this. This is Â£9.99 and such a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.140
good dupe, it does just a good a job. You
massage this into your scalp, it's really

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.630
nice and cooling when you put it on which
I love because I know it's actually working.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.620
It is actually strengthening your roots as
well but what I love about the product it

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.750
gives me so much volume when I blow dry it
which is exactly what I want for this look.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.250
Then I'm going to use my Aussie Aussome Volume
Miracle Recharge lightweight conditioning

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.120
spray. I do not even need to go on enough
about how much I love Aussie products. I'm

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.730
a massive fan of their 3 minute miracle conditioner.
This one is really good if you, again like

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.000
me, have dry ends because this is really good
from mid length downward to the ends just

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.659
to give you a little bit of conditioning.
You can put it in wet or dry hair and literally

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.500
just comb it through and blow dry it out and
it's really going to help to soften and smooth

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.750
the end which is exactly what I need. I want
this look, I don't want any kind of split

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.780
ends showing in my hair. Ok and now to the
hairstyle, so you're going to need to part

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.870
your hair at the side, just above your ear,
take a section of hair round the back of your

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.450
ear a couple of inches thick and then brush
that to make sure it's really nice and neat

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.480
so you've got all the hair in there. And then
you're just going to do a simple plait with

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.290
that hair. Obviously the more hair you have,
the thicker your plait is going to be. Now

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.170
I wanted to do a hairstyle that's just very
easy wearable so don't worry about this being

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.969
too neat. It's designed to be a little bit
of a messier kind of half up do. And then

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.420
just take the bits of the plaits and pull
slightly to make the plait nice and chunky

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.090
and give you some extra volume. Take it over
to the other side and then you're going to

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.260
grip that in place with a couple of pins and
do exactly the same with the other side as

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.029
well. Then you're going to get a section at
the back and comb it and then back comb it

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.829
just to give you a little bit of volume. Take
that hair at the back, twist it a couple of

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.650
times and then you're going to pin that in
place as well. This is just giving you a little

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.439
bit of volume and neatening it up at the back.
So put that in place again with a couple of

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.230
grips. Then I'm going to use my Sebastian
Trilliant Heat Protection Spray, shake this

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.659
really well before you put it on and then
just spray that on. I am going to put hot

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:11.079
irons on my hair, so I don't want it to burn.
And then I'm using my Jose Eber curling wand,

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:17.469
this is a 35mm barrel, nice and big, just
to give me a couple of curls at the front

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:23.120
as well. Then I'm going to take my Caviar
working hair spray just to keep this all in

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.959
place and again you're going to do the same
thing to the other side. I actually take a

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.719
few of the curls and pin it back and then
with the bit of hair at the back that you've

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:35.779
got left you want to curl that bit too. It's
so adaptable and so easy. Don't forget to
