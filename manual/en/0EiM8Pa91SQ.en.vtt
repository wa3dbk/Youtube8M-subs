How about if I sing out of tune?

It can't take any more!

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.940
[screaming continues]

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.892

That was crazy.
-You're telling me.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.172
If I had ears, they'd be bleeding.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.055
-Phew! Thank goodness it's over.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.519
