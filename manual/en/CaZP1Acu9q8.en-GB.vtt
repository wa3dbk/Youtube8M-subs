00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.970
The modern day MINI, it's been in production
at the Oxford plant since 2001 with a new

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.480
generation coming out in 2006. Now in its
3rd generation you would be forgiven if you

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.240
assumed there had been no changes, but never
assume! Don't go anywhere, stay with me so

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.089
I can show you what is new about this new
new MINI

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.550
These headlights and big front grille stick
out more prominently, the body panels have

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.710
more styling lines, this plastic trim does
a good job of protecting this trendy car from

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:42.719
car park dings and these big tail lights are
a modern take on the original 1959 model.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.540
a previous criticism of the MINI has always
been a lack of user friendly controls, but

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.609
now there is a proper Connected Drive controller
for the infotainment system [demo go through

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.699
some of the features] which is much easier
to navigate - it's optional, but really intuitive

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.320
and well worth the extra cash.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.689
MINI hasn't done away with the retro toggle
switches though and has modernised it further

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:15.710
with a really cool colour changing LED ring
around the centre console - which changes

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.250
depending on what function you select.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.350
Further changes include the plectrum-style
starter button, which has moved from beside

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.590
the steering wheel to the centre console,
while the central speedo is replaced by a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.200
conventional speedo and rev counter mounted
ahead of the steering wheel.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:48.079
The new MINI has a 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.840
great choice of engines ranging from an entry
level 1.2 petrol in the MINI One that returns

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:04.759
61.4 miles to the gallon and emits just 108g/km
of CO2. The MINI Cooper gets a new 1.5 3 cylinder

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:14.090
petrol with more power yet achieves slightly
better fuel economy at 62.7 miles to the gallon

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.610
and 105 g/km of CO2. Even the top-of-the-range
MINI Cooper S returns almost 50 and doesn't

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.760
break the bank with horrendous road tax costs
like the first MINI Cooper S did in 2001.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.370
The real economy stars though are the diesels,
which return over 80 miles to the gallon and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.909
are free to tax! The manual gearbox is the
cleanest and links nicely into each gear,

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:49.040
although the clever automatic has a coasting
function to improve fuel economy

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.240
this car is bigger and safer than ever before,
with improved crash protection and some really

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.540
clever tech including options such as rear
view camera, heads up display and a pop up

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.230
bonnet incase you are unfortunate enough to
hit a pedestrian plus plenty of airbags to

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.940
keep you safe in the event of an accident.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.560
there is also an all new suspension set up
that makes this MINI just as fun to drive

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.189
as the original. The sport mode even likens
the handling to that of a go-kart -- LOOK

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.960
- There's very little roll in the corners
and this MINI is without doubt one of the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.590
most fun hatchbacks currently on the market.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.300
the seats are more supportive and the driving
position lends itself to this enhanced driving

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.220
experience. However, I must say it will be
a little too firm for some, making long journeys

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.330
a bit of a drag, and that brings me onto a
few complaints about the new MINI. That brilliant

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.860
handling might be a bit too grown up for playful
drivers who liked the movement of the previous

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.340
generation...and by the time you've added
all that fantastic tech it makes the price

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.540
tag a bit steep. A Citroen DS3 does offer
better value.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:10.230
Stop and walk to back seats and get in partly
adlibbing and then cut to back seats

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.080
and despite the extra dimensions and more
room for passengers...

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.710
the back seats are still a bit of a squish,
especially if Mat is driving and you want

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.440
to sit in the back, so probably best that
I drive and Mat sits in the back

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.860
I know technically that's the same thing but
it might be a good trick into the driver's

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.860
seat.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:42.670
Anyway, boot space, yes it's better! BUT it's
still small - both the Audi A1 and Citroen

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.350
DS3 are bigger.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.330
But size isn't everything, good things come
in small packages. Yes I know what you're

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.390
thinking, this MINI isn't actually that small...but
hey it's still the coolest kid in town and

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.790
that doesn't necessarily mean it ticks all
the other boxes. You buy a MINI because you

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.900
want a stylish small car, not because you
need a big boot. Overall on closer inspection

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.571
it is massively improved over the previous
generation and there's no denying that they

00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:14.480
hold their value well in the used market.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.800

A1 video here and the Citroen DS3 video here
