00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:43.680
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.820
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:03.640
To save us all from Satanâ€™s power
When we were gone astray

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:18.540
O tidings of comfort and joy

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.380
Oh

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.540
So to the Lord sing praises

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.660
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:06.420
Each other now embrace, embrace
This holy tide of Christmas

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:22.940
All others doth deface
O tidings of comfort and joy, joy, joy
