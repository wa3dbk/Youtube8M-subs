00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.230
The Secrets of the Chef Factory

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:09.727
Today at the Chef Factory

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:14.005
we are pleased to welcome our
former student, the chef Joseph Viola

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.030
Hello Chef

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.870
Hello Madam Director

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.790
Isn't he well behaved?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.963
As you taught me, Madam

00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:21.175
Of course

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.175
Chef Viola is very modest

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.080
but one should know he is
"MOF" which stands for

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.475
Best Craftsman of France
(Meilleur Ouvrier de France)

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.080
And the President of the Association
of Lyon Boules (Petanque)

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.958
No, not at all

00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:35.775
President of the Association
of Lyon's "Bouchons" (cork)

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.997
I'm confused

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:38.980
at "the last but not least"

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.839
Joseph won a world champion title,
world champion of...

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.260
Of pâté in pastry

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.440
Of thrower of pâté in pastry!

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:49.280
How far can one throw a pâté in pastry?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.799
Well, for a start between
the plate and mouth

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.490
And farthest it lands in the stomach!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.330
That's true

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.235
Well today, we are not in pâté

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.508
We are in...

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.175
Quenelle

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.235
"La quenelle" is the emblem of Lyon

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.672
Who says Lyon, says quenelle
Who says quenelle, says Lyon!

00:01:02.697 --> 00:01:05.390
Isn't that a song from a 60s nun?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.449
Yes, Yes. Who says Lyon, says "la quenelle"
Who says "la quenelle", says Lyon!

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.200
No, I don't think so.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.029
Today is very technical as
you are going to show us

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.969
how to shape a quenelle correctly.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.839
The correct form of quenelle? My form!

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.545
In fact there are as many different forms
as there are people making quenelles!

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.137
Yes, exactly

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:20.700
So there isn't a definitive form?

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.150
No

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.460
Ok

00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:22.929
But they are called "la quenelle"

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.451
Well a quenelle is

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:25.676
Pike (a freshwater white fish)

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.175
flour, eggs, butter,
salt, pepper and nutmeg

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.040
That's the base

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:32.535
And we also need

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.675
a pot

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.600
with water at 65° C

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.811
And we mustn't forget one thing
to keep the spoon wet

00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:40.836
In the hot water

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.195
Then

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.475
we gather a large amount

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.180
of the quenelle mixture

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.034
And we turn and turn

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.714
like this

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.375
Oh, it's like when you make ice creams!

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.375
Are there quenelle ice creams?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.018
No there aren't quenelle ice creams but
there are ice creams in form of quenelle.

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:01.775
Yes there are ice creams in that shape

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.600
This quenelle shape

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:03.675
Yes, ok

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.575
We are going to make one

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.760
Can I try?

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.152
Go on

00:02:08.777 --> 00:02:10.105
In fact, everything is in the gesture

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.550
Everything is in the gesture, yes

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.575
But you should warm up a little before?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.275
In the long run! Arrrgh!

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.175
One needs to warm up, but have
you ever ridden a motorbike?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.975
No, no

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.180
I once sat in a side-car,
like in the Aristocats

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.680
But who was steering?

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.775
I don't remember... it was a cat

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.849
Because you see on the motorbike you
roll your wrist

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.480
Yes, ok

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.980
You accelerate

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.475
Ok, it's not obvious

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.243
But yes, turn

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:34.260
turn, turn...

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.940
No, not like that

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:37.585
I can't do it, it's hard!

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.870
No it isn't!

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:40.375
You've got two left hands

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.875
Are you telling off the
Director now, am I dreaming!

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.899
Well that is awful, that's not a
quenelle that! It's a big mess, leave it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.680
What's the next step?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.929
It's not important, we
now have to poach it.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.099
Let's poach, poach, poach!

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.768
I'll poach it.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.444
After 20 minutes...

00:02:56.545 --> 00:02:57.833
Is it poached?

00:02:57.858 --> 00:03:01.983
Yes, it's poached, at 65° C
for 20 minutes

00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:03.375
So now chef what do we do?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.053
We take it out of the water

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.229
and place it delicately on the side

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.936
and we will complete the
cooking in the steam oven.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.116
Now we only need to cover it

00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.580
But what's he saying, it's not a sofa
it's a quenelle

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:22.543
I mean cover it with sauce

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.349
She's a little strange, the Director

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.212
Here a Nantua sauce, a crayfish sauce

00:03:28.237 --> 00:03:32.020
Oh, I had imagined it pinker than that.
I lined up a blouse in case of stains

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.648
Well that does stand out

00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:35.775
Oh dear, it'll make a print

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800
There

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.109
Thank you chef Joseph Viola

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.747
This is Lyonnaise cooking, a well-formed
quenelle all while riding a motorbike

00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:46.719
Have I understood?

00:03:46.744 --> 00:03:49.056
Yes, you have.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.370
Joseph, you are a MOF without a cap

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.059
Yes with the medal

00:03:58.084 --> 00:03:59.786
Wow!

00:04:00.364 --> 00:04:03.659
Well you see, you are a MOF
but I am a MILF

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.380
A MILF?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.706
A MILF, is a woman who while no longer
young, young, young

00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:11.962
is still attractive, and doesn't
resist the odd quenelle!
