00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.330
...Like I've said, just do something, Rinnosuke!

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.540
Do something? Like what?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.480
I liked TewiKourin.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.790
Oh, Tewi huh? That wasn't bad!

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.470
Do it again.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.210
I don't want to! I still have trauma from that, not to mention I went bankrupt.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.140
Alright, let's do it this way. Let's make duos and have a small manzai contest.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.360
Ooh, what's the prize?

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.980
*A magatama is curved stone pendant,
like a single side of a yin-yang.
How about this magatama?

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.340
I'll do it, I'll do it!
That's amazing!

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.790
Alright, l-let's do it! K-Kourin, let's do it!

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.960
Eh? With you, Marisa-san?
Alright, l-let's do it! K-Kourin, let's do it!

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.900
Eh? With you, Marisa-san?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.890
Ok, everyone listen up! We're going to do manzai!

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.940
Hello everyone! We're KourinSpark!

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.550
Hello!

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.470
Nice to meet you.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.920
Yes, nice to meet you.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.170
Yep, just the other day our duo stirred up a drug incident...
Yes, nice to meet you.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.170
Yep, just the other day our duo stirred up a drug incident...

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.010
No no no!
Yep, just the other day our duo stirred up a drug incident...

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.660
No no no!

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.730
That never happened!

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.120
We're going to keep working hard from now on, and we ask for your best regards.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.590
Uh-huh.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.290
Wow, because it's the Touhou M-1, there sure are a lot of people!

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.850
That's true.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.960
But Rinnosuke-san...
That's true.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.730
But Rinnosuke-san...

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.670
Yes, what is it?

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.940
There sure are a lot of attractive patrons today.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.840
There sure are a lot.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.210
Today especially, there's a bunch of them!

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.220
A bunch, indeed! Shall we take a look at them?

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.310
Let's take a look at them!

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.630
Beautiful person, beautiful person... skip one, and another beautiful person!

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.520
You can't just skip a person! Cut it out!

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.420
...Really now!

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.250
Er, I guess so.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.500
Seriously! You can't just skip them.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.590
You're right, I can't just skip them.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800
It's strange if you skip them! Rude, too!

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.860
Y-you're right, it's rude.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.310
After they've voluntarily come to watch us, too!

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.590
You're right. Continuing... Beautiful person, beautiful person... go back one and another beautiful person.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.930
You can't just go back! I can't keep doing this with you!

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.310
...Really now!

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.170
We've got to do it properly! It's rude, since everyone stopped drinking sakÃ© just to watch us.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.280
Y-you're absolutely right. T-they won't listen if we don't.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.430
Right, you can't be rude to them.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.380
Okay, let's do it correctly now.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.180
Yes, for the last one, correctly.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.450
Let's do the final one, then. Let's take a look, shall we?

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.880
"Toppinshan" means a winner, as in a lottery ticket or a correct answer. Sounds a lot like "Beppinsan", beautiful person.
Winner, winner, winner, winner!

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.500
What do you mean by a winner? I'm going to have to ask you to stop!

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.980
...Really now!

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.070
Rinnosuke-san?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.060
Yeah... don't you think it's a bit weird?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.590
Huh? What is?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.300
I've already finished setting up three jokes!

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.110
Seriously?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.020
This next one is going to be the fourth set up!

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.220
The fourth set up? I can't stand already doing the fourth set up, cut it out!

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.070
...Really now!

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.040
If you're going to end it, just end it!

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.720
Thank you very much!

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:22.260
Hey, that was good. Rinnosuke and Marisa, you're good! NExt up let's have... Reimu and Nazrin.
