[SOUND]

00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:15.544
[MUSIC]

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:18.909
So, at this point of the build,
our main focus is gonna be keeping the,

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:20.211
the dirt off of this fence.

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:23.230
So, we are gonna do a dry
stack retaining wall.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.800
I do wanna address the word retaining wall,
cuz I know it sounds scary to some people.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.010
It's really simple.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.560
We don't have to do any crazy footings or
rebar or concrete.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.480
We're gonna do a simple dry
stack retaining wall, and

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.860
you can pick up the materials at
your local home and garden center.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.970
Before I get started in the process and
show you exactly how to do it,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.820
I wanna cover some of the commonly made
mistakes that we see out in the field.

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:49.730
All right, a common made mistake that
I see all the time is a waterfall that

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.830
looks unnatural,
kind of protruding out of the ground.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.470
I'll show you how to not make that mistake.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.960
If you put your, your retaining wall, or your
garden wall, in, in a nice tight horseshoe,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.068
then the waterfall just looks like
it's popping out of the ground.

00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:05.310
What we're gonna do is this
waterfall's about 30 inches up, so

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.870
we're gonna come out about five and
a half feet.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.810
I'll give you an example here.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.870
Our dirt and our wall is gonna
come in at about this height.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.520
If you had a type horseshoe,
it would be sticking up like this.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.930
You can see the difference in the angle.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.810
It's not, not so natural.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.520
So if you're up 30 inches,
come out about five and a half feet.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.950
If you don't have five and a half feet,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.050
then consider reducing the height of the
waterfall so it looks natural in the yard.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.980
We're ready to start setting the blocks.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.160
We're gonna get the tampers over here and
some tools,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.400
some levels and we're gonna show
you how to do the garden wall.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.720
Which side of the waterfall do you start on?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.650
It's actually an important question.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.740
We wanna start on the low point of the yard.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.240
This particular yard we're working
in is kind of tilted this way.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.140
So we're gonna start on my right.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.230
What happens is, you wanna set that
first block level, on the low point, and

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.850
then you carve into the earth and compact it
as you set the next courses in, in place.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.070
If you start on the high point and
you're coming around and you're adding soil

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.180
underneath to make that first course level,
and it's not as strong that way.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.680
So, what I'm gonna do right now
is I'm gonna set this first block

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.630
right in line with the face
of this waterfall.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.910
If I set the waterfall back too much, the
liner comes in, you have a chance at leaks.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.400
So we want the block wall to
come back just a little bit

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.530
farther past the face of the waterfall.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.510
That way your liner has this curve and
it contains all the water inside the pond.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.356
So let's spray paint this out.

00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:35.356
[NOISE].

00:03:16.106 --> 00:03:19.080
The first course is the most important.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.600
You wanna take your time,
have a level, compact it as you go.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.400
As soon as you finish this
step all the way around,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.545
the whole wall's gonna snap
together in just minutes.

00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:37.155
[NOISE]

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.278
It's in decline, gotta go down more.

00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:47.837
[NOISE] Give me some on the back.

00:03:47.837 --> 00:03:51.657
A little bit more.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.820
[NOISE] This side's

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.113
gotta come down, then up.

00:04:04.113 --> 00:04:14.113
[NOISE]

00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:27.335
Okay, next piece 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.738
[NOISE] Okay, we have the first course set.

00:04:33.738 --> 00:04:35.860
It's nice and level.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.970
We're ready to start stacking all the way up.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.670
Before we do that, I wanna take a second
to show you the material that we're using.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.929
They call it interlocking block because
of this strip of concrete right here.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.345
Now when we set it into place and pull it
tight to the next part of the wall and

00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:54.260
compact soil next to it,
it makes it nice and, and strong.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.310
So one thing I wanna point out is,
when you do the next course the,

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.950
the blocks are gonna overlap the joints.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.110
For example, this guy right here,
we're gonna set this one on.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.122
And overlaps the joint, and we wanna
follow this pattern all the way around.

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:13.380
That's a wrap on the garden
wall construction.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.750
We'll have this finished up in
the next couple of minutes and

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.860
the next process we can do is excavation.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.520
In the next video we are gonna show
you some excavation tips and tricks.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.100
You know, we wanna make sure it doesn't
look like your pond's out of balance and

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.260
out of level like the water's
gonna come spilling out.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.690
We'll show you how not to make
those mistakes in the next video.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.110
Listen, if you have any
questions on the garden wall and

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.950
you are nervous about anything, please leave
your questions in the comments section.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:37.920
I'll get to every question.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.105
I'll answer every them so you know how
to do everything right the first time.

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:42.661
I'm Eric Triplett, The Pond Digger.

00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:43.903
Thanks for watching.
