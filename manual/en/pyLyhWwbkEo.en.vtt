Hello I'm simon with Quality Foundation
Repair and in this video I want to talk to you

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.070
little bit about the things you can do
to prevent the need for foundation

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.959
repair

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.490
and here in Central Texas the main
thing that causes pier and beams and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.660
slab foundations to shift

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.029
is the moisture content in the soil.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.259
And the best way to control the moisture
content of the soil is to keep the water

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.739
away from the house.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.329
So it here on this home we did our 
foundation repair the homeowner

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.560
invested in some nice gutters with downspout extensions here at the bottom.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.500
So it's all very well having gutters but
if the water dumped out directly next to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.260
the house here and pooled, it would sink
in to the ground next to the footers

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.180
causing the clay-based soil to expand. Then
when it stops raining, it will dry out,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.030
contract, and the shifting

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.160
constantly would cause the
foundation to move.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.420
The gutter extensions help to get all
of that rain water

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.980
away from the house which is very
important.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.460
Then another thing is the skirting.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.450
When we did this skirting, we put in
what's called a moisture barrier

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.380
so there's a very
thick black polyurethane that actually goes

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.540
down a foot and a half below the soil
level here.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.400
and comes after the jag so any water
that does sink in next to the house would

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.100
not penetrate towards the footers and
into the cold space.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.450
But all soil has a natural level of 
moisture so we want to make sure that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.200
the cold space has adequate
venting and the air can pass through

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.830
underneath the house. And to do that we
installed these vents which

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.450
helps just do exactly that like
catch the breeze from outside and then

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.670
circulate the air underneath the house so you don't get that moldy smell when you open up your

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.310
closets that smell coming up from the
cold space. So there are a bunch of other

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.760
things you can do. Should you like to find out
about them, you can call us directly at
