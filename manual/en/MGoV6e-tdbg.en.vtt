00:00:00.076 --> 00:00:03.094
Ok, so today we're going to be making a Moleskine wallet

00:00:03.094 --> 00:00:06.027
out of this brand new Moleskine Diary

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:10.010
with the week on the side, and lined paper on the other side

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:12.095
..for 2012

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.035
I did something similar last year,

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:19.085
with a section for cards, and then a section for money and train tickets

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.040
or whatever you need...

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.033
First thing, stick the quality control sticker on the back pocket file,

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.068
whoa, there's something in there, what is this?

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:34.021
What? this is new

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.027
there's some icons, emoticon stickers, that's interesting

00:00:40.027 --> 00:00:41.004
hehehe~

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.035
I'll just shove this under here.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:51.001
For all your cards, you can use this solid piece of paper/ cardboard at the back

00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:55.099
you can sticky tape the edges together and then cut some incisions here

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:58.025
for the cards to go inside,

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.089
even though, my old one...

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.074
the last page was actually a solid piece of cardboard,

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:18.077
yeah, it's definitely more papery this year 2012

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.011
hmmh, that's a bit dodgy,

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.054
but um, it will still work I guess...

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:23.097
What I did last year,

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:25.038
it may not be a problem straight away,

00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:28.042
but - my file pocket, when I put coins in there,

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:31.036
I always try to get rid of all my coins,

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:35.012
and keep them in a money jar,

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:38.022
because they're heavy and annoying...

00:01:38.068 --> 00:01:42.067
yeah, well last year, my file pocket started falling apart...

00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:45.060
(is there anything in there)

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.057
so I put some duck tape on there to keep it closed

00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:54.001
the sides were completely fine,

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.008
just this whole part started coming off so I sticky taped that,

00:01:57.008 --> 00:01:58.057
same with this part,

00:01:58.057 --> 00:02:03.009
but I guess if you just start off with strongly sticky taped together section for the cards,

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.002
it should stay together,

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.082
and this was also a book which was 18 months,

00:02:07.082 --> 00:02:13.010
where as this is one year, so I won't have this one for quite as long as this one

00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:16.096
the cards will fit in something like this,

00:02:16.096 --> 00:02:22.007
make some markings of where the card should be inserted into the file,

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:24.017
where you need to cut,

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:25.049
and you want to leave some space in between

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.091
so you can sticky tape this

00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:30.048
I will just make some lines,

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:32.001
and make some incisions

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:35.025
making sure that they don't cut through the whole thing

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:48.000
make sure your knife is sharp or else it could start ripping the paper

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.083
you can sticky tape this top bit into here.

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:14.016
You can try to cover this incision of the paper here,

00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.000
just so it doesn't keep ripping off

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.049
something like this

00:03:24.097 --> 00:03:29.062
just this middle bit, so that the card doesn't rip all the way through

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.065
There we have it

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:40.018
