00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.980
Today I will be making dahi baingan.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.280
Sauteed eggplant with yogurt.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.020
This classic eggplant dish is very sophisticated but very simple to make.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.220
It is always amazing to see

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.420
how a few simple ingredients can make such a satisfying dish.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.220
My husband who doesnâ€™t like eggplant
fell in love with this dish.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900
Dahi baingan is simply delicious.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.840
This can be served with plain rice or roti.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.680
This recipe will serve 4.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.000
To make dahi baingan we will need:

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.520
1 eggplant cut into 1/4 inch thick pieces.
And that will makes about 4 cups.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.740
3 tablespoons oil

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.020
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seed (jeera)

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.200
1/8 teaspoon of asafoetida (hing)

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.080
2 teaspoons of besan (gram flour)

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.760
1 cup yogurt (curd)

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.020
1 teaspoon crushed saunf (fennel seed)

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.860
2 teaspoons coriander powder

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.140
1 teaspoon thinly sliced ginger

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.800
1 teaspoon salt

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.940
1 teaspoon red chili powder.
You can adjust to your taste.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.520
1/4 teaspoon of turmeric (haldi)

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.360
About 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.740
I am ready to make dahi baingan.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.140
I am using the flat pan.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.480
Heat is on, medium.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.920
So I will add the oil.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.820
Oil should be moderately hot

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.340
before I will add the cumin seed.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.600
So oil should be hot enough.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.100
So when I put the cumin seeds they should
crack right away.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.900
Asafoetida

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.120
Ginger

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.220
Just stir for few seconds.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.440
And add the eggplants.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.820
And just stir it one time.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.560
Reduce the heat to low medium.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.300
And now sprinkle the salt.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.440
And don't mix it, just leave it.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.740
Cover the pan.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.460
And let it cook for about 3 minutes before we will check.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.680
So while eggplants are cooking

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.600
we will mix the yogurt

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.180
and add the besan

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.740
and cilantro.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.380
And mix it well.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.900
And yogurt is looking thick.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.940
So I am going to just add couple of spoons of water.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.680
And just keep this aside.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.700
So this has been about 3 minutes.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.060
So let's check it.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.220
I did open one time in between just to make sure they don't burn.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.780
And now let's turn them over.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.640
And they have nice color.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.680
And I wanted to have the eggplant some roasted color.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.860
So just cover for another

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.620
about 1.5 minutes.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.360
So this has been about a minute.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.800
Let's check it again.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.800
Turn it.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.400
Eggplant looks they are cooked very soft and tender.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.840
So I am going to add the spices.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.720
Coriander powder

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.060
Red chilli powder

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.380
Fennel seed

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.920
And turmeric.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.980
Just mix it well.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.120
Just make sure all the eggplants have coated with
these spices really well.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.920
And they are looking really reallly nice.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.560
So it's time to add the yougurt.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.320
I have mixed.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.880
I have added some besan in the yogurt.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.820
That prevents yogurt to break.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.240
This looks really really good.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.680
So just now let it cook.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.020
After it comes to boil.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.220
Then we should let it cook for another 2 minutes.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.120
Dahi baingan are looking good.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.120
So they are ready.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.980
So turn off the heat.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.480
They have a very nice aroma of fennel seed.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.100
So looks like dahi baingan is ready to serve.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.640
Dahi baingan is looking fantastic.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.740
Today I will be serving this with paratha.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.760
Enjoy.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.800
