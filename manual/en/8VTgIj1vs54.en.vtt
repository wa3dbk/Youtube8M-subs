00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.150
You should have acted.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.170
They're already here.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.080
The Elder Scrolls told of their return.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.250
Their defeat was merely delay

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.470
Till the time after Oblivion opened,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.070
When the sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.980
But no one wanted to believe.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.430
Believe they even existed.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.410
And when the truth finally dawns...

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.840
It dawns in fire.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.720
But,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.330
There's one they fear.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.320
In their tongue, he's DOVahKiiN...

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.290
Dragonborn!

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.150
Force, Balance, Push!!!
Fus, Ro, Dah!!!

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.040

When they hear triumph's shout
