00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.310
After struggling to find a sense of identity
for what they wanted the ‘adiPure 11pro’

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.590
to be, we can’t be the only ones relieved
to see adidas finally create a solid entry

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.140
to the series with last year’s model.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.710
And now the Three Stripes seem to have built
up a bit more faith in the range as they ditch

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.070
the ‘adiPure’ side of the name to bring
us the 2015 version of the 11pro - which,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.130
whilst no longer adiPure by name - certainly
had a feature list that players craving a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.780
solid, heritage inspired release can get behind.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.510
First off, there’s a return to a K-Leather
Upper after previous editions used Calf and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.510
Goleo.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.620
Not that they were bad boots at all, but there’s
an unmistakably softer, more premium feel

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.160
to the upper of the boot on this new model.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.149
Running all the way around the boot, this
isn’t a single-piece upper, and is stitched

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.469
at certain points, here on the flanks of the
boot amongst the iconic Three Stripes and

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:12.260
- perhaps most interestingly - on either side
of this synthetic stripe that runs down the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.780
middle of the boot.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.580
This extra anchoring is presumably to help
fully integrate the Engineered Support Skeleton;

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.280
a brand new feature from adidas football that’s
designed to solve some of the intrinsic problems

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.420
with working with leather, to deliver a boot
that performs like a sportscar, but handles

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.710
like a classic.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.909
Starting with the most obvious, the Support
Skeleton reduces stretching from the force

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.740
of the foot against the leather, helping to
deliver a consistent fit.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.670
This synthetic inner liner also creates engineered
support, flex and bend points across the forefoot

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.170
which replace the stitching of the last model,
resulting in a purer contact zone for the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.369
foot to meet the ball.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.920
adidas have also made sure that comfort is
a high priority for the latest entry into

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.560
their heritage-inspired silo, with memory
foam used to deliver a tongue that is thinner,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.480
but more comfortable and some under-heel cushioning
that boosts step-in comfort just that little

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.480
bit more.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.500
Under foot, the outsole of the boot remains
largely unchanged from the last model, baring

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.150
the stud size being trimmed down slightly
to improve traction and ground penetration.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.560
Those in the know will recognise this as adidas’
ComfortFrame stud plate; a meeting point between

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.450
the classic 12-stud outsole you’ll find
on a boot like the Copa Mundial and something

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.650
more lightweight and modern, adidas designed
the ComfortFrame with appendages attached

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.670
to the studs to distribute pressure, boosting
comfort by distributing weight further.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.310
Finally, we were lucky enough to snag our
pair in White / Black / Solar Blue as part

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.060
of the #ThereWillBeHaters drop, and we’re
largely sure you’ll all agree that this

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.970
is a stunning looking release.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.720
The combo of adidas’ Three Stripes in Black
against a White leather upper is always a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.890
winner, whilst the Solar Blue stripe breaks
up the layout and prevents things from becoming

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.420
too by-the-numbers.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.980
