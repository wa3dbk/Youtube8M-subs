00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.380
One player is using two racquets, the other player is using a weighted racquet.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.100
The idea is to swing relaxed and fast and feel how the racquet swishes through the air.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.020
The players should

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.309
work one forehands, backhands,

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.489
serve,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.420
always swinging nice and relaxed and trying to get the racket to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:08.189
move fast through the air with minimum effort.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.480
Both players hold the racquet with three fingers

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.760
and are going to swing normally.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.160
The idea of the drill is to teach the players that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.100
they don't really need to press on the grip.
That if they hold the racket nice and relaxed

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.460
the racket head

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.540
will move the way it should move.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.900
players should try forehands, backhands, serve

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.080
holding the racquet with three fingers

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.120
and letting the racquet head swing relaxed.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.740
Players will usually 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.900
surprise themselves at how little

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.740
effort it is required to move the racquet through the air.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.420
Usually when the players try to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.550
hit the ball harder they tend to muscle

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.920
the ball. This exercise

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.450
teaches the players to swing relaxed

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.970
and to think about swinging fast instead of

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.360
hard.  The idea is to try to swing

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.660
the three swings

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.950
with the same amount of effort
