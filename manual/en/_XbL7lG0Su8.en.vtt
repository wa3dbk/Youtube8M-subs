Denis, I know that some in our audience
don't know the finer points of hockey.

00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:49.144
Could you tell them,
for example, what is icing?

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:53.355
Well, icing happen when
the puck come down, bang, you know,

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.317
before the other guys,
nobody there, you know.

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:59.737
My arm go comes out,
then the game stop then start up.

00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:03.116
I see. What is high-sticking?

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:07.703
High-sticking happen when the guy take
the stick, you know, and he go like that.

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:10.748
You don't do that. Oh, no. Never, never.

00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:13.125
- Why not?
- Against the rules.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.253

some English pig with no brains...

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:18.797

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:21.925
Slashing is like that, you know?

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:26.053
Mm-hm. And there's a penalty for that?

00:01:26.137 --> 00:01:29.974
- Yeah. And for trip also, you know.
- Oh?

00:01:30.058 --> 00:01:32.351
Like that. And for hook like this.

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:35.105
- And for spear, you know, like that.
- Mm-hm.

00:01:35.188 --> 00:01:40.150
All bad. You do that,
you go to the box, you know.

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:44.655
Two minutes by yourself,
and you feel shame, you know.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.990
