Frontside Buttbounce 360 to Feet by Igor Catatau

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:43.000
Hey Guys, my name is Igor Thiago, from Caraguatatuba, 20 years old, slackliner for 2 years and today I'm gonna teach you the Frontside Buttbounce 360 to Feet

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:52.000
It's not very difficult, but you have to be patient, because your whole body should be in harmony to land it correctly

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:16.000
To do this trick, you have to be on the line and do a couple of buttbounces to feet and get the time you use to do it 

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:26.000
When you master it, you have to do the buttbounce and jump up standing on the same place and twist a 360

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:34.000
That's exactly it, When you throw your arms, you will look on the fixed spots on both side 

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:38.000
Look there, spin, look there, spin, land on your feet

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.000
It's very simple, I'm gonna show it once more ... 

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.000
All right?
