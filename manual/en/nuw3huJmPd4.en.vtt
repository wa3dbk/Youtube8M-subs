Welcome back to another episode of Hardtraxx TV.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:24.350
Still going on with WiSH Outdoor. And today we will visit 2 guys who after spinning their hard sets only crawl homewards because they live just around the corner here.

00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:26.740
I'm talking about: The Geminizers.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.930
We're standing in front of the studio of The Geminizers. They are busy preparing for WiSH Outdoor. So we will take a look.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.840
Guys! Very busy.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:10.130
Fortunately The Geminizers made some time to talk with us. Busy with the preperations. Occasionally very hard ofcourse.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.590
But just to be short: Who are The Geminizers?

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.990
We are The Geminizers. I am Mark Thoonen and this is Joost van der Velden, and together we are the energetic duo: The Geminizers.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.100
How did The Geminizers get started?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:44.060
I know it like it was yesterday. It was 1862 and we met trough friends of our basketball club. Joost totally into hiphop, me into the heavy metal and it was clear we had something with music. We understand eachother in the music, though we had differtent taste.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:56.900
And so The Geminizers arise. We started with 'Music Maker Lenny Dee'. Epic shit! 12 kicks over eachother it sounded like nothing.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:09.930
For us it was like heaven with music. 'The sky is the limit'. And then we thought this is predestined. 'This is faith'. And now we're sitting here.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.330
Behind my microphone.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.700
Well...in front.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.490
Now behind.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:30.100
You recently released a track, with The Geminizers style. How do you describe The Geminizers style? In terms of spinning and producing.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:44.650
In terms of spinning we like to show we are from the DJ era that are mix technically strong and that we like to produce tracks to fill it in.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.750
We are no producers who are spinning tracks but DJ's who ocasionally make a track. That's the way you should see it.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.170
For a few years you are artists at The Magic Show. How did that  relationship started with The Magic Show and The Geminizers?

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:16.800
I think 2 years ago we started spinning tracks at a party. And by accident Michel (Titatovenaar) was there. He saw us spinning tracks and I think he thought: 'Those guys are doing great, they tear the whole club down.'

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:27.600
And so we started talking and thats how it all started. We started spinning for the radio and now with the label.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.000
For sure good progress.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.880
For The Magic Show you have already made some banging sets. How does it feel to make those sets and get feedback from that?

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:55.730
You already see it. I get a big smile on my face. Great to hear they appreciate it what we try to do, something unique, real mixing and creating something new with differend tracks. Let them hear something they won't hear elsewhere.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.880
And we get a lot of positive feedback from it. And thats awesome. Thanks guys!

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:17.500
And talking about feedback. You just said 'i get a big smile' from hearing the positive feedback. Last year also played on WiSH Outdoor. How did you experienced that?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:37.300
WiSH Outdoor is a home match for us and there is always a good atmosphere. Last year it was great. It was crowded, everybody partying. Can't really describe it

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:51.700
This year is awesome, it's our 5 year anniversary for WiSH Outdoor. We are here from around and we know WiSH Outdoor from the beginning. Did the closing set and made tunes for the DJ's.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:10.800
We've already done the mainstage and this year, just like last year, The Magic Show stage. Totally awesome! The atmosphere is indescribable. We as 'Brabanders' invite everybody to come and taste it.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:22.910
You've already talked about The Magic Show this year. This year the theme is 'The Dungeon'. When i say 'The Dungeon', what do you think?

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:48.280
The Dungeon... Dungeon, something obscure and a creepy atmosphere. But fun and an own community is there within the WiSH platform what is guaranteed for a full festival day with pounding music. Can't describe it better then this.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:06:00.630
It's an home match for you and a 5 year anniversary. Are you doing something special to make the best set ever?

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:13.850
We always try to make the best set but this year is going to be special, because we have more own tracks and this year playing at a good time. Playing hard!

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.350
And how are you going to experience that Joost?

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:31.100
I can't wait for the moment the audience will hear our tracks. It was alot of work and now we can finally show it. And there is no better place like now I think?

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.500
Going home crawling, we say here.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.000
Literally and figuratively.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:42.300
If I hear this we need to prepare ourselves for The Geminizers.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.960
How does the future of The Geminizers look like?

00:06:45.060 --> 00:07:05.100
Hopefully still good. We hope to make alot of progress with new stuff we are making, new tracks, new material. And we hope to play nice DJ sets give away some nice DJ sets. But that will be fine, the more you do it the better it is.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:19.100
Hopefully everything stays in an upward trend. And to keep doing the things we like to do. Music makes you happy. And that's wat we enjoy the most.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.810
And that's very important.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.230
For sure. Do what makes you happy.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:34.740
Thanks for your time. Now you need to get back to work because WiSH Outdoor is near. Do you have something to say to our viewers?

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:46.880
We hope everybody will come and see our set. And we would like to invite everybody, because you must experience this. And bring good shoes with you. Because we go hard.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.710
Come taste the atmosphere in Brabant and we will show you how it's done.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:57.400
Thanks for your time and I wish you all the luck with your set at WiSH Outdoor.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.960
Thanks! I want to say just one thing: Houdoe!
