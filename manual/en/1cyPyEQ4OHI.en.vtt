00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.570
They're one of the largest rodents in the
world, they're indisputably adorable, and

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.810
hey, Canada doesn't put just anyone on their
money.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.710
But the main reason you should appreciate
beavers is that they're second only to us

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.130
in their ability to completely transform the
environments they live in.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.279
Usually for the better, though.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.720
While we like to surround ourselves with warehouse
stores and hamburger restaurants, beavers

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.399
will turn a stream-fed meadow -- even a patch
of desert -- into a lush, watery habitat for

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.960
all sorts of wildlife, aquatic and land-lubber
alike.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.859
They do it, of course, by building dams.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.559
And darn, can these guys dam.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.429
Most beaver dams are 5 to 10 meters long and
form small ponds behind them.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.100
But sometimes these structures have been known
to turn into decades-long development projects.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.909
The biggest beaver dam in the world, in Canada's
Wood Buffalo National Park, is more than 850

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.860
meters long, forming a huge wetland that's
actually been photographed from space.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.340
It's been under construction since the 1970s,
with subsequent generations of beavers adding

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.950
to it, and it's getting bigger every year.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.210
Beavers go through all the trouble of dam-building
primarily for defense.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.820
Some build lodges made of sticks and mud in
the ponds that they create, while others burrow

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.980
into their muddy banks.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.690
Both are designed to be entered only underwater.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.500
By surrounding themselves with deep water,
beavers can protect their dens from predators

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.750
like wolves and wild cats, while creating
a habitat that supports the aquatic plants

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.890
they like most, like cattails, willows, pondweed
and aspen.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.720
The dams are usually started by single males
trying to attract a mate, or a young couple,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.140
which pair up for life.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.140
Adorable beaver love.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.150
But one thing that's a little less cute is
how completely serious these guys are about

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.150
their dams.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.190
Scientists call it instinctive behavior, but
it can end up looking kind of compulsive.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.660
Biologists believe that the sound of running
water actually triggers dam-building behavior

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.660
in beavers.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.950
Some theorize that beavers may even be able
to feel, or otherwise sense in the water,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.620
when a leak has sprung in a dam.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.170
Research has shown that little gaps intentionally
created in a beaver dam will cause the members

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.360
of a colony to drop everything to repair it,
regardless of whatever else needs to be done.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.200
Scientists — a little evil — have even
played audio recordings of running water near

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.260
beaver sites, and have returned in the morning
to find the speakers covered with sticks and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.260
mud.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.910
This obsessive engineering is all made possible
by beavers' trademark teeth.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.019
And you may have heard that their teeth continue
grow throughout their lifetimes, which is

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.739
true -- but only their big, curved front incisors.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.230
Beavers' voluminous tree-gnawing keeps their
teeth from growing too long, but they don't

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.040
actually eat through trees.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.599
They actually prefer to feast on non-woody
plants, like water lilies and cattails, in

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.599
the spring.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.969
In winter, they strip trees of their bark
and the layer of soft tissue underneath known

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:50.969
as cambium.

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.579
And, despite what cartoons have taught us,
beavers' famous front teeth aren't white,

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.610
they're ORANGE because their tooth enamel
contains iron, which makes them incredibly

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.739
strong and sharp -- even though it makes them
look like they have a two-pack-a-day habit.

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.959
And finally, a note about beaver butts.

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.090
They smell DELIGHTFUL!

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.980
Both male and female beavers have a pair of
anal scent glands that they use to mark their

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.980
territory.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.249
And the yellowish oil that they produce, called
castoreum, smells precisely like sweetened

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.249
vanilla ...

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:24.779
... so much so that for hundreds of years
it was used to flavor food and drinks and,

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:29.760
in some places, can still be found in perfumes
and processed foods under the ambiguous moniker

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.230
of "natural flavoring."

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.150
Other cultures have prized castoreum for its
medicinal properties.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.860
And that might be because one of beavers'
favorite snacks is the bark of willow trees,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.060
which contains the chemical salicin, which
people have used for centuries to make natural

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.060
pain-killers.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.329
But because beavers eat so much of the bark,
their sweet-smelling butt-oils can be chock

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.799
full of salicylic acid, which is the precursor
compound to aspirin.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.900
Now -- what other animal can you think of
that makes its habitat more livable, drops

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.279
everything to keep its neighborhood safe,
and has a bum that smells like dessert?

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:02.030
I can't come up with anything.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.349
