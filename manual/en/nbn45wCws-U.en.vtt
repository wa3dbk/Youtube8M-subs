Hi my name is Barry Osser from North Coast
Role Playing in Eureka, California and I’m

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.570
here today to talk to you about character
attributes in the Dungeon and Dragons role.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.029
There are 6 of them, there’s strength, wisdom,
intelligence, dexterity, constitution and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.390
charisma. These attributes represent your
character in the gaming world, they give you

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.561
an idea of how big, how strong, how fast,
and how smart, all of those things that you

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:30.030
need to know what you’re doing when you’re
taking on a persona and role playing. We’ll

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.040
start with strength, strength is your body
strength it’s your ability to lift, to bend,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.310
to break to do all the things with your body
that requires you to push, pull or any such

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.120
thing and strength is also the major attribute
when considering to run the character class

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.559
fighter. The next attribute is wisdom, wisdom
tends to be an odd one, but wisdom is your

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.800
common sense, your piety, your involvement
with religion, your just general sense of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.660
yourself, the general sense of your own intelligent
being. Wisdom also is the main attribute because

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.750
of that religious connection for you cleric.
Intelligence will be the next one I’ll cover

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.540
for you, that is the attribute that is most
pushed towards the wizard character class.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.970
Intelligence is your book smarts, your ability
to retain and learn things. So your ability

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.600
to read, your ability to use a library, your
ability to come up with information during

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.490
a game that you yourself as the player has
forgotten. The next one is going to be dexterity

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.081
and dexterity is both your hand and feet manipulative
powers. Dexterity is your ability to hit things

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:37.551
better, throw things fast-farther, in most
cases your own control of yourself, but it

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:43.690
also involves things like nimbleness, reflexes
those types. And because of that, your road

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.240
character class is going to want to be considered
when you have a high dexterity. The fifth

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.210
attribute that we’re going to cover is constitution;
constitution is your overall body makeup.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.659
It’s your ability to maintain damage, continue
functioning as you get hit and beat up in

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.170
this wonderful world that you’re playing
in. in addition to that a much less used attribute

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.899
portion of constitution is bigger, but what
you have is an attribute that tells you how

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.349
sick your character is going to be, how often
you’re going to be laid up and how long

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.019
you’re going to be laid up, it’s your
recuperative powers as well. And the final

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.469
attribute that is also overlooked but for
a gamer who’s going to really want to enjoy

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:27.969
things, charisma, the final attribute, is
your overall combination of looks and leadership

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.819
abilities. On the simple side, how pretty
is your character is part of you charisma,

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.430
but the other part is your ability to say
hey let’s go follow me and you’re going

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.239
to do it. Those are the 6 attributes you’re
going to use when playing Dungeons and Dragons.
