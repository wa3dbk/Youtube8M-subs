Welcome to Bachelor's Cooking

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.600
Today will make you teach "Paneer Sachezwan Frankie"

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.640
For this we have to prepare the stuffing of Paneer

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.760
so firstly will prepare the stuffing, so for this will take 1/2 spoon of Cumin seeds in a grinder

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:35.280
1 Clove, 1 Black Cardamom dd 1/4 inches of Cinanmon

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.375
And now add almost 10 Cloves of Garlic and almost 1 inches of Ginger

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:44.603
and add one medium sized chopped onion,put green chillies i have taken 2 green chillies

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.660
rest add 1/4 spoon of Turmeric Powder,1/2 spoon of  Coriander Powder,1/2 spoon of Red Chilli Powder

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.120
Now we have put in all the spices and now we have to grind it till finest paste

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:10.876
Now the masala is ready, so let us expedite the further process, so take almost 2 spoon of Oil in a pan

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:28.260
as soon the oil heat up and then we will add almost 1-1/2 fine chopped Onion

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.560
As you can see that they are brown

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.180
So, now we will add the masala which we have prepared

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.780
and then give it a fine mix

00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:53.231
as you can see the masala are roasted well now

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.640
now we will add the 2 tomatoes which we have grinded

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.180
Tomato puree....and give them a nice mix, land along with tomatoes only we will add Salt

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.380
and you can cover it and leave it for almost 1/2 minute

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.800
on the low flame for 1/2 minute so that tomatoes get cooked nicely

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.900
so almost 1/2 minute is passed and the tomatoes are cooked nicely... give them a mix

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:41.660
and now we will add almost 1/2 spoon of Garam Masala which we have prepared

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.520
and along with this we will add paneer

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.640
So,mix it carefully, and now add some dry fenugreek leaves 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.020
crush it with your hands and put it into the pan.. and give it a mix then

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:17.320
So the paneer is already mixed in the masals, just cover it and let it be for 1/2 minute and your paneer will be ready

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.340
so we have covered if for almost 1 minute

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.120
now the paneer is almost ready just mix it once

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.760
and add along with some coriander leaves for garnishing

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.200
so our stuffing is ready and cool down also, we have transfer it into another bowl

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.760
Now take 2 Chapati or Tortilla &amp; first of all

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.980
and take some butter &amp; spread it on the chapatis

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.340
and after that apply some green chutney

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.720
Coriander -mint Chutney so apply it on the chapati

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.240
Since it is Schezwan frankie so now will apply Schezwan sauce

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.820
Just apply and spread it nicely the Schezwan  sauce

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:35.660
after that put it on the side &amp; the stuffing which you have prepared, take some of the quantity in a plate

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:50.000
and have to crush or mash  with the hands. No too much but just to make it small pieces

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.700
So mash it and mix it this way

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.000
after mixing, put it into the center of the chapati

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.620
this way

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:23.260
so you have placed the stuffing and now we will put some finely chopped Onion

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.470
you can even put green chilies but we have already make the paneer spicy

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.800
so i don't think that we need green chillies here, so this way tightly 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.040
this way roll this and apply some butter on the top of that

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.560
apply some butter inside so that it get sealed nicely and apply on the outer side also

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:59.200
and after that if you want you can put it reverse side on the flat pan and get it cooked

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.640
I have this tortilla so will put it here

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.760
and will close it and will let it cooked for 2 minutes

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.994
till then it get crisp form all the sides, and after 2 minutes your paneer Frankie will be ready

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.720
So, almost 2 minutes has been passed and our Paneer Frankie is ready or not let me check.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.500
Yes, our Frankie is crisp completely and now take aluminum foil

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.840
and since it is very hot so carefully place it on the Aluminum Foil

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:46.260
and cover it &amp; then serve it along with Chutney

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.420
So, Your Sachezwan Paneer Frankie is ready
