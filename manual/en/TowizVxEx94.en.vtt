Hello viewer. In this video I will talk more
in depth about the barn.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.419
This building is very useful to tailors and
leatherworkers, because it can make you a

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:14.289
lot of leather and sumptuous fur, which replaces
cloth in this expansion.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.390
You can still farm these materials by killing
animals, but if you want to get these materials

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.759
while you sleep, or do other more interesting
stuff than grinding, this is the building

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.179
for you.
People who like to make feasts for raids or

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.739
just for fun can also use this building.
Finally the barn is the only way to get savage

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.250
blood, which is used for all the professions
that make equippable gear.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.680
It's not soulbound so you can also sell it
on the AH, but it does require you to trap

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.379
elite maxlevel animals, so early on it may
be a pain in the *** to farm solo, definitely

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.899
doable though.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.379
At level 1 you can trap several types of animals
for either fur or leather. Trapping is quite

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.469
easy, you get an item that lets you put down
a trap in front of you, like a hunter, but

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.880
instead of slowing or exploding it captures
the first low health animal that walks over

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.740
it. If you catch anything you get a new item
in your inventory which you can deliver at

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.229
the barn to make a work order for whatever
the animal provides. Talbuk and wolves give

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.140
fur, while clefthooves and elekk give leather.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.900
At level 2 the building also allows you to
capture riverbeasts and boars for meat. The

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.380
work orders from these provide you with a
feast, a must have for those who raid with

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.229
slackers who dont bring their own food.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.909
Finally at level 3 you can trap elite animals
for large work orders, that provide whatever

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.360
the animal type normally provides, and some
savage blood. This blood is crafting material

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.420
for all the craftable epix in this expansion.
Since it seems impossible to get the blood

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.460
any other way this is a great way to earn
some money in the AH, especially right after

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.840
launch. Once people start mythic raiding the
demand for this blood will likely drop, since

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.420
the itemlevel of the upgraded crafted gear
is lower than mythic itemlevel.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.270
At levels 2 and 3 you can also make a follower
with the skinning skill work in this building

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.330
to double the output per work order. And that's it for this video.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.300
Thanks for watching and see you later!
