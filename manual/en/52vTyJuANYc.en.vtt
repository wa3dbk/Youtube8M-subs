00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.670
Simon: Peter, Jillian.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.210
You're back for some more little betcha's
I can tell.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.130
You just can't keep away from me can you?

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.580
Well, lucky for you I've just learnt a new
one.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.250
This guy down at a bar in Greenwich Village
showed me fantastic little bet with matches.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.300
Jillian, let's see if you can work it out.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Jillian: Okay.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.790
Simon: See this little half match represents
an olive.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.030
I know it doesn't look much like an olive,
but let's pretend.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.030
Jillian: Okay.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.640
Simon: We're playing fantasy, as indeed I
often do.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.519
And I'm going to put a little glass around
it, just like this.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.250
This is not going to very artistic.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.810
So that represents the glass around the olive.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.810
Peter: Okay.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.810
Simon: And here's a little bet for you.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.510
Now Peter, you do realize there'll be a drink
on this.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.000
Peter: Okay, I love a drink.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.480
Simon: I'm happy to buy you one if you can
work it out.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.940
Peter: I'm still waiting for my drink.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.740
Simon: I know you are and how often have I
taken drinks off you, my friend?

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.240
Peter: Quite a bit.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.140
Simon: I want you to win this one.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.540
Peter: I want to, too.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.009
Simon: He's not going to.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.039
Here's the bet, my friend.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.820
You get to move two matches and two matches
only.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.460
You have to get the olive out of the glass,
but you have to leave the glass intact.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.880
In other words it still has to look like the
glass, but the olive has to be out of it.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.310
Peter: So I can only move two matches?

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.310
Simon: Only two.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.999
And I could have been crueler, I could have
said one, but I didn't.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.111
I'm giving you two matches, my friend.

00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:52.090
For just the price of a nice top shelf Scotch.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.079
Peter: There's always a price involved.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.659
Simon: There is with me, isn't there?

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:56.659
You know that.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.659
Peter: Nothing's for free.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.560
Simon: There are two kinds of people in this
world, my wee darling.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.409
Those who make money and those who take it.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.630
So away you go there, Pete.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.509
Let's see how badly you can mess this one
up.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.509
Peter: We'll see.

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:12.540
I think I can do it.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.150
Simon: He's got no chance at all.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.060
Peter: All right, two matches.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.230
Here we go.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.560
Simon: Here we go.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560
Stand back.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.830
There may be broken glass here.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.930
Peter: It's going to be...

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.900
Simon: Oh, this is good.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.570
Peter: I don't know.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.440
Simon: He's moving at the speed of the wounded
ferret here, my friends.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.170
Peter: I can't move any of them, because it'll
break the glass.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.170
That will break the glass.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.900
Simon: But I'm prepared to bet you a top shelf
drink I can do it.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.730
Peter: It can't be done, so I'll take it.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.950
Simon: You'll take the bet?

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.950
Peter: Yes.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.360
Simon: What do you think, Jillian?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.880
Jillian: I don't know.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880
Tell me.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.980
Simon: Okay, watch very close and learn, my
friend, because a lot of bar bets are all

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.510
about how you word the bar bet.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.459
I said "Leave the glass intact."

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.760
I didn't say which way up the glass had to
be.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.239
So here's how it's done.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.330
I'm going to move that little match over there.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.310
Then I'm going to take that match and put
it down there.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.040
The olive is out of the glass.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.650
I only moved two matches, but the glass is
upside down.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.920
I didn't say which way up the glass had to
be.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920
Peter: No, and it's still intact.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.920
Jillian: Yeah, that's still intact.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.070
Simon: And the olive, like Houdini from a
locked in tank full of water has pounced out

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.330
and said to the crowd, "You owe me a drink."
