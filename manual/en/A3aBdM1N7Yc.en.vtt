00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.199
So now I'm going to show you how to make a
hammer dangle component to hang off of your

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:11.699
chain.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:17.910
So basically we've made the basic unit with
the loop and I'm going to pick a place to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.330
put it on to the chain and so it's going to
look like this.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:37.840
And then I'm going to start wrapping, so with
this technique you can use a heavier wire

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.300
than you were using before or a thinner wire
of you want something a little bit more dainty

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.730
and like, finer looking.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:57.960
So basically, that's what I have and I'm going
to lay it on a metal block and basically when

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.210
you hammer the metal, you're flattening the
metal and also you are able to stretch it

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.710
in the direction that you want it to go.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.700
So, I'm going to look and see if I want this
to be, I want it to be shorter.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.670
Okay, so I think that's a good, just going
to trim the end and so now I'm going to hammer

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:31.470
it and when you flatten the metal, it's going
to reflect light differently than if it was

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.270
a round piece of wire.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.590
So I'm flattening the metal and I'm also kind
of stretching it in different directions so

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:48.310
of I go this way, it stretches it horizontally,
I'm kind of driving my hammer across the metal.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.240
So you would get something that looks like
this.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.850
Now you see how it kind of reflects light
completely differently than a round piece

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.610
of wire.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.350
Okay, so then you can look and decide if you
like the length of this dangle.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.510
I think I'm going to make it a little bit
shorter, so I'm just going to snip off the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.050
edge and I'm going to hold it.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.450
Just going to snip it off and then when you
snip it off, you lose that sort of organic

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.420
hammered edge, so I'm just going to lightly
hammer it, so then you get sort of that organic

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.190
finish on it.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.950
And that's how you make a dangle.
