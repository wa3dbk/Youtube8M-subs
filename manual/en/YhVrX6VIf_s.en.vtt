00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.490
Hello people of the internet!

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.740
Now that it is sunny outside and way hotter,
I decided it was time to lighten up my makeup

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.370
so I have this simple, super bronze summer
appropriate look, and if you want to learn

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.600
how to get this and how a few pointer here
and there to keep it on during the day, just

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.690
keep watching.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.240
So my makeup actually starts out with my skincare
routine.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.670
I personally start out with the Mario Badescu
Enzyme Cleansing Gel because I find that this

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.510
really helps to exfoliate away any dead skin
cells while actually cleaning my face at the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.510
same time.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.199
Then I move on to moisturizer.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.979
This Algenist one is just the one I happen
to be using right now.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.122
It's not really giving me any super good benefits
for this makeup tutorial, it's just the one

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:42.559
I had on hand.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.210
But even though I do have oily skin and I'm
prone to get oilier during the hotter times

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.100
of the year, it's still important to moisturize
cuz that will prevent overproduction of oil.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.789
And then moving on to facial sunscreen.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.960
It's really important to actually get one
formulated for your face, otherwise you run

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.549
the risk of it looking super greasy on your
face, plus body SPFs tend to be comedogenic,

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.140
which means that they will clog your pores
and most likely give you comedones, pimples,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.690
or a break out.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.660
So no bueno there.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.740
Moving on to my face.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.800
Instead of using a primer, I actually use
the Urban Decay De-Slick Makeup Setting Spray,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.430
which is an oil control spray.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.940
I just like having a thinner layer and less
layers to have on my skin.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.710
Oh, and tip number one for keeping your makeup
on during the hot heat; spray down your makeup

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.111
sponge, I'm using a Beauty Blender, with a
setting spray, and then apply all of your

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:33.270
makeup with it.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.640
I just happen to be using the Maybelline Dream
Pure BB Cream.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.650
This is one of my all time favorites.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.150
It has pretty decent coverage for being as
light weight as it is, and it literally feels

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.950
like I'm wearing nothing on my skin, especially
if I'm just using a beauty blender like I

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.460
am right now.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.260
Plus you're able to go in there with a second
layer and kind of cover up some trouble spots

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
as you can see with the post inflammatory
hyperpigmentation on the sides of my cheeks,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.340
and it doesn't look super cakey.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.360
Another benefit of this specific product is
that it has two percent salicylic acid, which

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.060
prevents acne and that is definitely something
that I am prone to the warmer months especially.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.349
I'm gonna level with you guys.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.390
I don't get a ton of sleep in the summer because
I wake up with the sun, which rises at about

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.530
five, so I'm using a really light weight concealer,
in this case the Maybelline Age Rewind, right

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.989
under neath my eyes, and then I'm using my
Beauty Blender to blend that out.

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.800
I just find that it gives it the most natural
finish possible.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.459
I'm gonna let you guys in on another secret
here... even though I'm going for a lighter

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.310
coverage, and a more natural looking foundation,
I'm still gonna be covering up the areas of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.889
my face which I'm most self conscious about,
which is my post inflammatory hyperpigmentation

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:41.889
marks.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.689
I'm just going in with the Urban Decay Naked
Skin, which is a pretty decent coverage and

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.629
light weight concealer, and blending that
back in with the Beauty Blender as well.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.930
I am gonna be setting my face with the Maybelline
Dream Matte Powder, which is sadly discontinued,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.310
and this ecotools brusch that I've had since,
like, my senior year of high school.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.629
And I'm gonna keep myself from looking cakey
by only packing it on my t-zone, and then

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.620
lightly whisking it over the other parts of
my face.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.150
I'm just using a really fine layer here.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.129
Yes, shine control is my primary reason for
powdering my face, but it also creates a little

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.609
bit of a barrier between the moist foundation
and the powder products that I'm using on

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.609
my cheeks right now.

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.790
I'm using my very favorite subtle, glowy bronzer.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.860
This is the Physicians Formula Happy Booster
Light Bronzer, and I'm just using the same

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.170
ecotools brush and I'm bronzing my face, meaning
I'm just hitting the high points of my face

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.989
like my temples, the tops of my cheek bones...

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.580
I'm running a little bit underneath my jaw
and down my neck just to blend it all in.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.169
This product has got to be one of my most
repurchased products because I love the way

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.169
that it makes my skin look.

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.700
It looks very healthy, very luminous, and
very bronzed at the same time.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.900
And I'm also running it along my nose just
so I can tie that into the whole "Hey, I'm

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900
tan" look.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.920
I am using the Benefit Rockateur Blush because
it ties in really well with the bronzer shade

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920
that I was using.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.909
I really like the little applicator that comes
in here, but I decided to still blend it away

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.720
with my ecotools brush.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.920
Moving on to eyes, which are painfully simple,
cuz honestly I don't wanna have to deal with

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.900
a bunch of different colors running together,
or smudging, or whatever.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.540
But I'm starting off with the Urban Decay
Primer Potion in the shade Sin, which is unfortunately

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.660
discontinued...

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.980
I am just a jerk like that, sorry guys, but
it's a nice champagne wash and it helps my

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.380
eyeshadow stick.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.720
I'm gonna be setting it with the Urban Decay
shadow in Half Baked, which is in basically

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.980
every single one of their palettes.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.590
It's just a nice bronzey gold shade, really.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.670
I'm packing that on my lid with a shader brush,
and then later fluffing it into my crease

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.630
with a fluffy blending brush just so I have
the nice, seamless transition between my mobile

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.830
lid and my crease.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.240
I'm actually switching out my brow mascara
with a brow liner this season because I want

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.390
to have more bold brows to contrast the super
simple eye.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.250
The product that I'm using is the Tarte Amazonian
Clay Tightlining Eyeliner, which I know it's

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.260
an eyeliner, but it really sucks as an eyeliner,
and is amazing as a brow pencil.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.130
It just gives me so much definition, and it
doesn't go anywhere, so hooray for repurposing

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.130
products.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.930
And even though I'm opting for the more bold
look, I've still gotta brush these puppies

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.540
out, so I'm doing so using this Morphe brush
eyelash separator tool.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.380
Oh, and speaking of lashes, it's time to apply
mascara.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.920
I'm curling first with this Tarte eyelash
curler, and I'm going to be using the Tarte

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.760
Lights, Camera, Lashes Mascara, which has
been one of my favorites for years.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.492
I'm going a little heavy with this because
I don't want to be using any eyeliner at this

00:05:32.492 --> 00:05:35.870
point because it will just run all over my
face.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.420
I have really oily and really watery eyes,
and they'll just spell bad news bears, so

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.930
I'm just generously coating my lashes with
Lights, Camera, Lashes and I'm calling it

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.930
a day.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.610
Also, why do I always go off camera when I'm
doing my lower lashes?

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.050
Moving on to lips.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.220
I'm just keeping it super simple.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.950
I am using a lip stain from Benefit, this
is the Benetint, which is a nice rosy shade.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.620
I'm applying it on my lips, and then I'm patting
it in with my finger to just kind of set it.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.430
I'm also going to be using this little brush
that comes with it to help define my lip line

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.420
a little bit more.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.570
It's a nice natural, subtle look, but it's
still a little more put together.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.540
And I am going to be topping that off with
a SPF lip balm, because I need to keep these

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.980
suckers hydrated.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.880
This one is from EOS and it tastes like lemons.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.800
My last little tip here to keep your makeup
looking fresh all day long is to use oil blotting

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.200
sheets instead of a powder because you can
get all the oil and excess stuff off your

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.920
face without disturbing any of the makeup
underneath as you can see here.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.650
They're honestly my favorite secret weapon.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.750
Anyways, that's the finished look.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.150
I'm gonna set it some more with my Urban Decay
Setting Spray, and I'm good to go.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.380
And this is me awkwardly kinda mugging, so
yeah!

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.510
We're done!

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.510
Yay!

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:59.430
So even though I'm sweating like a pig, welcome
to my June favorites, and there's a little

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.450
few extra things here just cuz I didn't have
the opportunity to do my May favorites, so

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.450
there's a lot of ground to cover.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.550
Let's go.
