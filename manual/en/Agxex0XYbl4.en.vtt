00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.400
My name is Amanda Bambrick, and I have a
bachelor of science degree in 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.959
agricultural environmental science from Dalhousie University 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:22.959
and I have a master's degree from McGill in natural resource sciences. 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.490
Right now I work as a strategic analyst
for the Government of Alberta.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.079
I work in Alberta Energy and my job is
to understand all of the priorities

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.730
within the government to know how they
connect.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.190
A lot of people when they're working on
a project

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.359
get so deep into the details

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.070
of what it is that they're interested in,
that they often forget to take a moment

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.140
to step back and think,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.220
'how do these connect? Why am I working on
this and what other factors can my work

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.440
effect that I'm not looking at right
now?'

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.250
And my job is to be able to step back
and be aware of that and connect to the right 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.470
people to talk about those issues.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.400
When I started out studying, I thought I
was on track to become a science

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.240
professor at a university.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.520
So for summer jobs, and I was doing
extra research projects on the side,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.730
environmental research projects, I was
working in an environmental research

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.640
lab for the federal government

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.909
and then I did my master's in natural
resource sciences.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.170
However, when I finished those studies, I came out to Alberta

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.360
and I started working as an
environmental consultant, and that was

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.700
really interesting because there was the
switch between

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.340
coming from pure science to applied 
science, to using it in industry

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.340
but I wanted to switch
to government, working climate change.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.190
A scientist is trained to pay
attention to the details in their work

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.480
and they're also trained to constantly
pay attention

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.050
to all of the outside factors beyond what
they're looking at that may impact 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.880
what's important to them right now in
this moment

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.650
and it's something that you think about
so much

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.650
in your role in science that it comes
naturally

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.680
and going out into the workforce, I've
realized that's not something that comes

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.889
naturally to a lot of people

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.159
so that's a great skill to bring.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.040
In my work, we call it systems thinking.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.189
We're not only thinking about this one
problem that we're talking about today.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.309
It's impacted by and impacting so many
different things out there and if

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.170
we're going to, as government for example,
and working

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.200
to make good policy, we need to have that
skill. So when you walk into a job

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.730
interview with a science degree, that's a 
skill that you're bringing that you're

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.839
not even thinking about normally, and
also something to remember,

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:47.589
and another thing is that scientists are
trained to be very detail-oriented people

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.129
who understand process. And so you
could go to a job interview saying, 'I

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.759
know how to do scientific experiments.'

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.089
That may not be very helpful to an employer,

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:03.609
but to go into a job interview and say, 
'I know how to work through a

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.310
complex problem to come out with a solution

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.920
and I have the grit to stick with it
until I walk out with a solution' --

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.829
is something that's very valuable.

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.580
Research has shown again and again

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.040
that people are the most engaged and the
most successful in their jobs whenever

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.019
they're working with their strengths

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.079
so you need to figure out what your
strengths are.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.539
Work on your weaknesses too, but find a
job and find the type of roles where you'll

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:37.539
be using your strengths everyday because
that's when you're going to be happy at work.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.119
The best advice that I've received
is to learn how to embrace change

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:48.309
in the workplace because someone who is
able to gracefully accept change and deal with it

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.449
both in their projects or their career
in general is someone who is heavily 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.559
sought after in the job market.

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.839
And also to help support that,

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.439
to help you learn how to embrace change.
Also be open to a lateral move

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.089
in your career. You don't always need to
move up.

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.989
Moving sideways and doing different types of
jobs can give you a broad

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.189
type of experience to help you A) find
the type of work that you really like

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.359
and B) bring 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.939
forth a whole bunch of skills that you
can take to any job

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.199
and be able to take on any
project.
