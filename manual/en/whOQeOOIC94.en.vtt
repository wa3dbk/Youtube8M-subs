00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.312
Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:08.826
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:19.598
Let’s prepare the vegetables.

00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:24.294
Use the outer layers of the onion to make the dish more presentable.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.116
Slice the onion into half inch slices 

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:32.381
and then cut them in half again.

00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:38.929
Cut the eringi mushroom or king oyster mushroom in half.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.728
Cut it lengthwise and then slice into quarter inch slices.

00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:52.404
Cut the lettuce leaves in half lengthwise 

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:56.976
and then chop them into half inch strips.

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:02.797
And now, let’s stir-fry the vegetables.

00:01:03.207 --> 00:01:05.707
Heat the olive oil in a pan.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:14.506
Drop in the onion and eringi mushroom and toss to coat with the oil.

00:01:17.303 --> 00:01:19.187
Sprinkle on the salt 

00:01:22.538 --> 00:01:24.841
and brown the vegetables.

00:01:29.274 --> 00:01:32.080
Finally, sprinkle on the pepper, 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.875
turn off the burner 

00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:38.883
and place the vegetables onto a plate.

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:50.474
On one side of the steak, sprinkle the salt 

00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:54.953
and the pepper.

00:01:56.172 --> 00:01:58.114
Turn on the burner 

00:02:00.473 --> 00:02:03.410
and heat the vegetable oil on medium heat.

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:11.491
Place the steak onto the pan with the seasoned side facing down.

00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:18.379
Occasionally shake the pan to help it brown evenly.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:23.630
With a pair of tongs, check the under side of the steak.

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:31.054
When it has browned thoroughly, flip the steak over.

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:37.941
Once both sides are browned, turn off the burner 

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:43.991
and place it onto a plate with the tongs.

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:52.854
Cover it with aluminum foil while preparing the next step.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:57.697
Now, let’s make the delicious onion ponzu sauce.

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:02.561
Remove the remaining oil in the pan with a paper towel.

00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:08.315
Add the sake and allow the alcohol to evaporate.

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:15.846
Turn on the burner 

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:19.586
and add the grated onion.

00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:26.603
Stir with a spatula and cook the onion until the pungent aroma softens.

00:03:28.143 --> 00:03:30.859
Add the citrus-based ponzu sauce, 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.161
grated garlic 

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:37.032
and butter.

00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:41.638
Continue stirring with the spatula and bring the sauce to a boil.

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:46.287
When the butter is completely melted, the sauce is ready.

00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:50.093
Pour it into a sauce boat.

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:55.562
Now, let’s make the beef steak donburi.

00:03:56.494 --> 00:04:00.373
Place the chopped lettuce onto a bowl of hot steamed rice.

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:06.601
Next, place the onion and mushroom along the edge of the bowl.

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.228
Remove the aluminum foil from the plate 

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:17.235
and place the steak onto a cutting board.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.509
Slice the beef using diagonal cuts.

00:04:27.346 --> 00:04:32.554
Line up the beef slices on the lettuce, presenting the pink cut surface.

00:04:33.737 --> 00:04:37.327
Finally, garnish with the watercress on top.

00:04:38.188 --> 00:04:46.329
Just before serving, pour a generous amount of the onion ponzu sauce onto the beef, onion and mushroom.

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:53.181
Wasabi also goes great with this recipe so try it out if you are feeling a little adventurous. 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.132
Cook the steak medium so that the beef is tender and the pink cuts are visually appealing.

00:05:03.132 --> 00:05:05.238
Good luck in the kitchen!
