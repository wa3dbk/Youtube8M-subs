Hello everyone!

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.400
It has been a while since I last made a video in Japanese

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.320
I got all these items from Harunouta.com

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:19.020
This web site is the Japanese version of bornprettystore.com. That's why I decided to do this video in Japanese.

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:29.073
I also have a 10% coupon code for Harunouta! So feel free to use it if you find something you like!

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:39.270
I linked all these items in the description box so feel free to check them out if you're interested!

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:49.400
I'm going to show you now what I got and then I'm going to show you a super easy nail design using one of these items.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:01.340
First I got these triangle studs. These studs are bigger than the ones I already own, I think they are super cute!

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:11.591
Next I got these light pink crystals! I'm in love with this color, so I'm super excited to use them!

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:27.980
Next I chose this foil from Harunouta. This is super metallic and I can't achieve this look with any nail polishes I own. That's why I wanted these!

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:47.140
There are a lot of ways to use them. I think it would be cute to paint the whole nail and add some flowers for example. Then I would cut some half moon shapes and add them in the cuticle area.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.280
Lastly, I chose these super cute pearls! There are also a lot of ways to use these!

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:02.900
For example: add them onto the middle of the nail and add some studs/ crystals! I think that would be cute!

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:10.359
Let's do a super simple &amp; cute nail design using these pearls!

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.920
I'm going to add a light pink onto this nail.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.360
I'm going to add a second coat.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.180
I used this German brand polish. I think that you can't get this one online!

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.400
Then I'm going to add white onto this nail.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.640
It's kinda hard to apply since I just cut my nails short.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.840
I used my favorite white! You can get this product online!

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.880
It look already  pretty good with one coat, but there are some (opaque) spots, so I'm going to add a second coat.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.160
Take a nail glue and add a little bit here.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.440
Then add the pearl.

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:23.573
Like this.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.820
I used this nail glue.

00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:31.934
Next I'm going to add some polka dots on this nail.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.640
Oops, I made a mistake...

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.140
I'm sorry if my sisters are loud (you can hear them in the background).

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.100
There are some imperfections, but they won't be that noticeable after I added top coat.

00:04:18.614 --> 00:04:20.614
The last step is to apply some top coat.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.940
I also apply it over the pearls. They last longer on your nails this way.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.240
To not smudge the polka dots: take a lot of top coat and glide the brush over the nail.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.140
So don't push the brush slowly onto your nails (that will smudge the design easier)!

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.780
I used an American top coat called Seche Vite. You can also get/ buy this in Japan.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.840
I also like the "Gel Volume" top coat by Canmake!

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.340
Lastly, I'm going to add this cuticle oil! I bought this one in Japan and I love it!

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.320
It smells so good! Like roses!

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.600
I always add some cuticle oil after my manicures, but I usually don't show this in my videos.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.720
I wanted to share this product since I truly love it!

00:05:35.914 --> 00:05:42.034
Then, I'm going to massage the product in using the other hand.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:49.603
This is the complete design! It's super easy and super cute in my opinion!

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.660
Thank you all for watching this video!

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.320
It has been a while since I last made a haul video in Japanese, so please share your thoughts in the comment section.

00:06:03.384 --> 00:06:10.144
I think the majority of my subscribers already know it, but I can't read Kanji! :(

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.500
That's why I would appreciate it if you comment using Hiragana &amp; Katakana!

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:24.409
My Japanese isn't perfect, so I'm sorry if I make some mistakes replying to your comments! :)

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.100
See you in the next video! Bye!
