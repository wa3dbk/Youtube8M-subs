Hi my name is Mike Sanders and I'm going to
show you how to wax your surfboard up. It

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.309
depends if you've got a short board or a long
board. You're not going to wax them the same.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.589
There's two things you've really got to think
about when you're getting some wax. How cold

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.020
is the water you're going to be surfing in.
Or warm, hopefully for you. And what kind

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.369
of wax is already on your board. Is there
any? Is there already some old stuff you might

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.289
need to take off? Some people get base coat
which is harder paraffin wax but it sticks

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.140
on the board easier. And so you usually want
to get a good base coat on. And then apply

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.721
your normal wax which there's different kinds.
There's tropic temperature, there's cold water,

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:40.300
freezing cold water, and that all depends,
that all tells you how gummy the wax is. How

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.400
well you're going to stick to it. If you're
in really warm water you don't need gummy

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.570
wax because it'll stay soft for you. But if
you're in freezing cold water up in Oregon

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.961
or something like that you might want some
really soft wax that'll stay on your board

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:54.780
and keep you there. You really don't want
any wax up your nose. You're feet aren't going

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.502
to be up here that often. You really want
wax back here where this pad is. Or a pad,

00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:04.439
which is quite convenient, you don't have
to keep waxing. And really you only want the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.409
wax where your front foot is going to be.
So if I stood on it like this. You can see

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.920
my back foot is right over the pad, over the
fins and my front foot is somewhere up here

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.780
where my belly lays and I can pivot to keep
control. So you don't really want to wax all

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.200
over, wax up in the nose, you'll look like
a kook when you're out there in the water.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.820
But for long boards it's a bit different.
You really want to get it all the way back

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.439
over the fin because this is where you're
going to be turning off of when you've got

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.149
to make hard turns. All the way up to the
middle. Now when you're beginning you wont

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.439
really need anything above up on the nose
part of the board. But once you get more comfortable

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.299
with it, you can feel like you can walk up
and down, then you've got to get the whole

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.520
thing. And waxing it's really simple. It's
just like the karate kid. Wax on. Wax off.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.609
Except it doesn't come off. It sticks on there.
Go in circular patterns. Apply good pressure

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:58.420
down and you put on a nice coat of wax where
you think you need it. So that should give

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.239
you a good idea how to wax your board. Thanks.
