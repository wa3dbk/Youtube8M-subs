00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This video has no musik, either listen to the sound of the trains or turn something on.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in this vid you see my br01,br86 and br628 on my under construction modelltrain

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Please appologize some mistakes

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
some rails aren't associated and sometimes the trains derail

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I try do correct all "dangerous rail parts"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the edge is already accident-proofed

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Br 01 with carriages

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
were are the carriages!? 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
here they are!

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Now my Br 628 and Br 01

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
