00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.926
NARRATOR: The Porsche IMSA GT3
Cup Challenge by Yokohama is a

00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:02.886
Development Series.

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:05.476
All of Porsche's factory drivers
have come from series

00:00:05.476 --> 00:00:06.376
just like this.

00:00:06.376 --> 00:00:07.506
But what is it?

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:10.096
Well, this is what
it's all about.

00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:12.466
For rounds seven and eight, the
Development Series makes

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.236
its way to Canadian Tire
Motorsports Park.

00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:19.336
Pole sitter, 17-year-old veteran
of the class, Madison

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:23.711
Snow, led the first 16 minutes
of the 45-minute encounter

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:26.316
with Angel Benitez, Jr.
sliding through

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:28.360
in an awesome move.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.645
ANNOUNCER 1: There's still
time, says Jeremy.

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:31.696
Oh, he's the bucket--

00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:32.696
BOTH ANNOUNCERS:
On the inside!

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:36.254
ANNOUNCER 1: Oh, that is a
marvelous maneuver into turn

00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:37.646
number four!

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:40.876
I'm not sure that that was
really on at any stage there.

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:43.716
But you can't fault Angel
Benitez, Jr., or, indeed,

00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:45.336
Madison Snow.

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:48.506
NARRATOR: But the race wasn't
over at that point, not by any

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.256
stretch of the imagination.

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:53.916
And the last 2 and 1/2 miles
played out like this.

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:57.906
ANNOUNCER 1: There is the white
flag, one lap to go.

00:00:57.906 --> 00:00:58.136
Three.

00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:03.506
At 2 and 1/2 miles, rather,
to decide the 20 points.

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:05.246
Will it be Benitez, Jr?

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:06.766
Will it be Madison Snow?

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.276
Whatever happens, even if it
finishes like this, Madison

00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:11.836
Snow will lead the championship
at the end of

00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:15.396
this seventh round of the IMSA
GT3 Cup Challenge by Yokohama.

00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:17.696
And Sandberg has dragged
his way back

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:18.966
after that little incident.

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:22.506
He's not really close enough
at the moment, but he's so

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:25.486
quick through two, three, four,
and five that he might

00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:27.686
be somewhere near by the
next time we see

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.336
them on the back straight.

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:31.806
Now, the leaders now are keeping
to that uphill braking

00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:34.056
area and last corner.

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:38.261
And Benitez knows he's got
probably just about a mile and

00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:41.786
a half at the moment to hold
this off and take another

00:01:41.786 --> 00:01:43.596
victory in this year's
championship.

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:45.316
And this will be really
important.

00:01:45.316 --> 00:01:50.396
It will vault him over the
unfortunate Ashley Freiberg,

00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:53.986
and it will take some points
away from what will be the new

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:56.206
champion leader, even if
it stays like this.

00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:57.396
ANNOUNCER 2: We've got an
eight-wheeled Porsche coming

00:01:57.396 --> 00:01:57.886
up the hill.

00:01:57.886 --> 00:01:59.936
It's at turn eight, John.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.982
ANNOUNCER 1: Well,
it certainly was.

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:03.251
I thought there was
a tool bar.

00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:05.874
Apparently, it was his car that
was there for a moment,

00:02:05.874 --> 00:02:06.806
and it was just dragging
through.

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:08.206
Down to the last corner
for the last time.

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:09.246
It's round seven.

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.614
It all comes down to this!

00:02:10.614 --> 00:02:12.048
Benitez, Jr. goes in deep!

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:12.526
He's gone wide!

00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:15.872
He spins from the back end of
the Yokohama as they go across

00:02:15.872 --> 00:02:17.316
the line absolutely together!

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:18.196
I think--

00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:18.966
I think that's Snow.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:19.306
ANNOUNCER 2: Yes.

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:20.791
ANNOUNCER 1: I think
it's Snow!

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:24.256
Got it by just about the width
of a number plate!

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:27.226
Here's the battle for third, and
here's the same maneuver!

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:28.486
Down the inside.

00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:30.240
Does Sloan Urry make
the same mistake?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.836
No, he does not.

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:32.816
He holds his line.

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:34.026
That's smooth driving.

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:36.376
And he'll hold on
to third place.

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:37.348
It was that much.

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:39.606
You saw from the official.

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:40.926
I'm not even sure it
was that much.

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:42.946
I think it was about
half an inch.

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:46.956
The timing's come through now,
and Madison Snow has turned in

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:48.266
the victory.

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:54.246
By eye, I knew it was close,
but 0.011 of a second, and

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:57.896
that is a veteran move by one
of the youngest Porsche

00:02:57.896 --> 00:02:59.876
drivers around.

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:03.866
And Madison Snow gets the
elusive victory, his fifth

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:07.216
visit north of the border in
Porsches, his first time on

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:08.466
the top step of the podium.
