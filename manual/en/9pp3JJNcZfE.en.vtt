00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:13.369
What is a Weather-Ready Nation? It’s a nation
in which society is prepared for and responds

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:20.369
to weather-dependent events. And it’s the
vision of the National Weather Service.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.289
April 20, 2010: The Deepwater Horizon oil
rig explodes in the Gulf of Mexico, creating

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.059
an ecological disaster of unprecedented proportions.
From the beginning NOAA’s National Weather

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.729
Service was ready with specialized forecasts
and decision support services. And when it

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:44.260
came time to make critical decisions, like
when to cap the well, National Incident Commander

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.070
Admiral Thad Allen turned to NOAA’s National
Weather Service for support, telling reporters

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.369
that the break in the weather NWS forecasters
identified "presents a significant opportunity

00:00:54.369 --> 00:01:00.850
for us to accelerate the process of capping."

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.790
September 2010: Hurricane Earl takes aim at
the East Coast of the U.S., threatening millions

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.860
of people preparing for Labor Day weekend.
From Puerto Rico to Maine NOAA’s National

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.280
Weather Service was ready, providing on-site
decision support services at three FEMA regional

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.170
headquarters and increasing staffing at Weather
Forecast Offices along the coast. Upper-air

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.370
stations also performed supplemental weather
balloon launches to gain a better picture

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.659
of the environment in which Earl would develop
as it moved up the coast.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.659
September 16, 2010 [EAS Warning Tone]

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.560
"The National Weather Service in Upton, New
York, has issued a tornado warning for Queens

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.030
County in southeast New York..."

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.030
Two tornadoes touchdown in New York City,
causing widespread damage in the nation’s

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.479
largest metropolitan area. NOAA’s National
Weather Service was ready, warning residents

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.850
ahead of time and working with city officials
to assess the damage both on the ground and

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.509
in the air.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.739
December 26, 2010: A massive blizzard strikes
the Northeast, dumping as much as 30 inches

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.540
of snow and producing what officials in Massachusetts
called "the worst coastal flooding since 1991."

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.090
NOAA’s National Weather Service was ready,
briefing governors and emergency managers

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.950
in affected states and providing aviation
and storm impact briefings for major air traffic

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.029
hubs from Washington, D.C., to Boston during
the busy holiday travel season.

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:44.689
Working 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week,
NOAA’s National Weather Service is building

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.919
a Weather-Ready Nation in which society is
prepared for and responds to weather-dependent

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:55.389
events. Learn more at www.weather.gov.
