00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.860
Hey guys, welcome back to another restore
my sneakers dot come video.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.660
In this episode, I’ll be comparing the 2003
retro with the 2011 retro of the Air Jordan

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.360
Retro 3 in the white cement, grey colorway.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.430
First thing we’re going to start off on
are the sock liners, better known as insoles.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.660
The tone of red on the 2003, which I have
on the top, is darker than the 2011 which

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.790
is on the bottom.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.269
And on the back side, the 2003 is black, while
the 2011 is white.

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.530
However, both materials on the insoles are
made of durapontex.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.469
According to the card, durapontex sock liner,
provides a supportive, comfortable lining

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.800
for the foot, while minimizing heat buildup.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.550
The material underneath the insoles of the
2003 and the 2011 are both made out of a woven

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.840
fabric.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.420
On the inside of the 2011, you have numbers
stamped on the inside, as well as gold stitching.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.310
On the 2003, you have white stitching.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.360
The next thing I want to point out is the
placement of the straps that hold the tongue

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.960
down.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.820
On the 2003, it’s placed over here in this
area.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.950
On the 2011, it’s placed towards the middle.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.600
The next thing I want to talk about are the
tongues.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.270
The 2011 uses a really soft tumble leather,
while the 2003 it doesn’t.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:59.689
Also, the 2003 has a much wider tongue compared
to the 2011.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:09.770
Now the base on the 2003 tongue is tumble
leather, while the 2011 is not.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.500
Now on the top of the 2003 tongue, the material
behind the tongue is actually tucked in, whereas

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.110
the 2011 is not.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:30.281
Now, the stars on the soles of the 2011 version
actually stick out a lot more than the 2003

00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:33.080
version.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:42.330
The word jordan on the 2003 is filled in with
red, whereas the 2011 is just on the outside

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.290
as well as the name jordan.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:55.800
The elephant print on the 2003 version appears
to be bolder than the 2011 version.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.090
Now the inspiration for the updated Jordan
hand tag, actually comes from the Nike Air

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.540
hand tag that the originals had.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.090
One of the things that they added with the
2011 retro is a pamphlet that gives you information

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.090
about the shoe.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.120
This is something that they use to do that
back in the day.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.360
Lastly, you have this box, which pays tribute
the original 1988 release.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:33.320
It has your elephant print paper, you removal
top, and on your bottom half, this elephant

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.360
print detail.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.780
So there you have it, the 2003 retro and the
2011 retro of the Air Jordan 3 in the white

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.520
cement grey color way.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.500
Hope you guys enjoyed this video, and be sure
to stay tuned for our next episode.
