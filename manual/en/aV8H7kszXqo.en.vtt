00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.000
I've got a lot of apologies to make.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.600
Nothing has been the same since New York.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.400
You experience things, and then they're over.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.900
I can't sleep.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300
And when I do, I have nightmares.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
Honestly, there's a hundred people who wanna kill me.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.900
I hope I can protect the one thing I can't live without.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Ladies.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.700
Children.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.900
Sheep.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Some people call me a terrorist.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.900
I consider myself a teacher.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.300
Lesson number one.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
Heroes ... there is no such thing.
