00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.610
Hi.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.369
My name is Rinav Mehta, mathematics instructor
at Central Piedmont Community College.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.720
In this video, we’re going to look at the
ACCUPLACER Review for Arithmetic.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.380
Here we’re going to look at whole numbers
and fractions.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.470
The topic we’re going to focus on in this
video is addition and subtraction.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
The procedures for adding and subtracting
fractions are very similar, where we first

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.020
need to find the least common denominators
of both terms and write equivalent fractions.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.860
So our example is going to be subtraction.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.370
But what we want to do is find the LCM or
LCD, least common denominator or sometimes

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.489
it’s called least common multiple.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.340
And then in our case we’re looking for a
5 and 10.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.190
Well the least common multiple or again least
common denominator is of course 10.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.320
So both of our fractions need to have a denominator
of 10.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.530
Our second fraction already has a denominator
of 10, so we just need to worry about writing

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.500
and equivalent fraction for the numerator.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.240
So we have to multiply this fraction by 2
over 2.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.030
So, we rewrite the whole part, so there’s
our 12, and then we’re going to take 2 times

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.770
2, so that is 4, all over 10.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.050
Now we’re going to bring our second fraction
over so that is our 3 and 7/10.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.190
All right.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.610
But, we have a problem.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.940
We can’t take 4 minus 7.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.189
So just like with whole numbers we need to
borrow.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.690
However, the process is different when it
comes to fractions.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.490
Well we’re going to borrow from the 12,
so that’s going to make the 12 and 11, and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.890
we’re going to give it to that fraction.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.680
So there’s the 12, but we’re giving it
to the fraction so here’s the 4 tenths.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.560
And then what we want to do is rewrite our
11, and then we created a mixed number by

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.390
putting a 1 in front of the 4 tenths and now
we want to write that as an improper fraction.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.540
So we’re going to take 10 times 1 plus 4.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:29.349
So again we’re going to take 10 times 1
which is 10, plus 4, and have 14, all over

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.030
10.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.580
So we created a mixed number with an improper
part but that’s our borrowing.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:43.810
So now we can bring the denominator--the second
fraction over, which is our 3 and 7/10.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.510
And now we’re set to subtract.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.540
So 14 minus 7 of course is 7, all over 10,
and then when we subtract the whole part,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.629
11 minus 3 is 8.

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.659
This fraction does not reduce anymore, so
we are done.
