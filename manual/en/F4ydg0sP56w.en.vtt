00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:11.730
Hello boys and girls, this is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you, called "Prison Praises"

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.390
Today's memory verse is from 2nd Corinthians, chapter 8, verse 21.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.880
It says, “Do what is right.”

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.810
The message for today's story is: "We share Jesus by doing what is right."

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.510
Paul and Silas were in jail.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.300
They could easily have grumbled and complained,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.320
but they loved Jesus and did some things very differently.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.840
Let’s see how they shared Jesus.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.690
"These men are servants of the Most High God!"

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.800
"They are telling you how you can be saved!”

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.140
Paul and Silas spun around.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.220
A girl with an evil spirit followed them.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.830
Her masters made money by listening to this evil spirit and then telling people what was going to happen to them.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.430
For days the girl followed and shouted the same message after Paul and Silas.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.950
"These men are servants of the Most High God!"

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.180
"They are telling you how you can be saved!”

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.290
Even though what the girl was saying was right,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.630
it was not good for people to think that Christians had anything to do with evil spirits.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.860
So Paul finally turned to the girl and ordered the evil spirit,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.990
“By the power of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!”

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.340
The evil spirit left the girl immediately,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340
 and she became quiet.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.820
The servant girl’s masters became very, very angry.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.370
They dragged Paul and Silas to the city rulers.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.560
“These men are Jews, and they are making trouble!” they shouted.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.550
“They are teaching things that are unlawful for us to practice!”

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.520
Soon an angry crowd gathered,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.100
and they began to beat Paul and Silas with big sticks!

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.560
So the rulers threw Paul and Silas into jail.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.790
Although they were in pain,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.570
Paul and Silas began to pray and sing praises to God at night.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.600
Around midnight, the ground suddenly shook so hard
Paul and Silas began to pray and sing praises to God at night.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.210
Around midnight, the ground suddenly shook so hard

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.610
that the doors of the jail fell open!

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.050
And the chains fell off the prisoners.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.050
It was an earthquake!

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.650
The jailer was sure all the prisoners had escaped.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.650
But just then, Paul shouted.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.260
"We are all here!"

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.720
“Bring me a light!” the jailer called to a servant.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.220
He ran to look for himself.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.360
Not one prisoner had run away!

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.970
The jailer took Paul and Silas to his own home

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.160
There he fed them and listened as they told him about Jesus.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.070
“Men,” he said, “what must I do to be saved?”

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.070
Paul and Silas smiled.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.560
“Just believe!” they said.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.160
“Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.”

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.830
Before the night was over, Paul and Silas baptized the jailer and all his family.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.990
Paul and Silas praised God when bad things happened to them.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.220
They showed the jailer about Jesus’ love.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.450
You can share about Jesus too, by doing what is right!
