00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.480
The prostate is a walnut-size exocrine gland
of the male reproductive system. It is located

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.920
just below the urinary bladder where it wraps
around the first part of the male urethra.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.840
Prostate gland produces a milky fluid that
is expelled into the urethra to mix with spermatozoa

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.840
during ejaculation. The fluid serves as a
lubricant and nutrition for the sperms.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, also
called benign prostatic hypertrophy or enlarged

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.320
prostate, is a condition in which the size
of the prostate gland is increased. It is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.399
considered "benign" because it's not a cancer,
and it does not increase the risk of cancer.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.750
However, when it becomes sufficiently large,
the prostate tissue may compress the urethra

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.750
and block the urine flow causing a number
of urination problems and urinary tract infection.

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:14.139
BPH is very common in aging men: about 50%
of men have some degree of BPH by the age

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.740
of 60, with half of them demonstrating clinically
significant symptoms. BPH is a result of hormonal

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.450
changes and is considered a normal part of
male aging. In aging prostate tissue, the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.530
rate of cell proliferation induced by male
hormones somehow exceeds the rate of programmed

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.530
cell death or apoptosis. This results in increased
number of cells and enlargement of the prostate.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.090
There are two main classes of medication for
BPH treatment:

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.380
- alpha-blockers: these drugs relax smooth
muscle in the prostate and the bladder neck,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.380
thus relieving the blockage of urine flow.
- 5-alpha reductase inhibitors: these inhibit

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:11.149
local production of Dihydrotestosterone or
DHT- the hormone that is responsible for prostate

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.530
enlargement.
For those who do not respond to medication,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.540
minimally invasive treatments are available.
These non-surgical therapies use heat to cause

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.690
cell death or necrosis in prostate tissue.
The heat is delivered in small amount and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.510
to a specific location to minimize unwanted
damage. Different procedures differ mainly

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.520
in the type of energy used.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.200
Transurethral resection of the prostate is

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.540
a surgical procedure for removal of prostate
tissue through the urethra. This procedure

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.690
has been around for a long time and is still
considered gold standard for treatment of severe BPH.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.220
Nowadays, it is usually performed
when medications and less invasive methods fail.
