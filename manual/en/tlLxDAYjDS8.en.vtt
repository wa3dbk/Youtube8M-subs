00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.920
If I had to give you tips on muckbangs,

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.746
to the people who watches my show

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.640
and have dreams to have muckbangs

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:21.274
I'll tell you a tip

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.588
When you eat, the sounds need to be good

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:26.326
With chips,

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.926
Rather than the sound of eating one chip,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.560
It's better if you're chewing a few more

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.360
Like this

00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:52.773
The sound is better when you're chewing more

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.220
And how you look when you eat,

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:03.714
When you're eating cheese sticks,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920
The cheese is supposed to stretch but it normally doesn't it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.734
You can't just bite it off

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.406
Don't eat the cheese sticks like that

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.340
There's the cheese inside and the batter outside, right?

00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.535
Bite the batter slightly

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:29.417
Don't bite in to the whole thing, bite slightly

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.140
And pull it

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:37.989
And it will stretch off naturally

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.760
You have to eat it like that

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.320
That way, it looks like you're eating something good

00:01:47.317 --> 00:01:49.317
Every food you eat,

00:01:49.317 --> 00:01:51.099
Fill your mouth with the food

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.530
Why won't it open?

00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:28.138
Oh, this smells really good

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280
The fragrance, really

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640
Smell it.

00:02:41.034 --> 00:02:43.034
I should eat the honey butter chip later?

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:43.994
No, it's okay.

00:02:47.407 --> 00:02:49.407
I have one here

00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:58.916
I have some more there

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.360
I have five more, someone gave them to me

00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:09.006
You can buy honey butter chips easily now?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.540
No you can't,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.160
Our suburb doesn't have them yet,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.240
"Did your cereal diet end?"

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.220
Yeah, it's finished

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.570
The video will be up soon

00:03:36.187 --> 00:03:38.187
There seem to be a lot of honey tong tong

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.540
But honey butter chips are still hard to find

00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:57.025
And everyone, I need to tell you that

00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:00.977
I'm not a food fighter

00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:01.871
I eat a little

00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:04.301
I eat small meals frequently

00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:06.275
I'm hungry every hour

00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:09.328
I eat small meals frequently

00:04:20.288 --> 00:04:22.288
"Have your tried soon hari?" (a very popular alcoholic beverage)

00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:24.251
Yes, I've tried it

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.820
It was good

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.660
"What do you mean by squid?"

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.600
One squid and spicy rice cake,

00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:02.208
"What are you eating?"

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.320
You want to eat this, right? Honey butter chip~

00:05:06.628 --> 00:05:08.628
I have tonnes of this!

00:05:08.628 --> 00:05:09.388
You want this~?

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.190
You want this~?

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.980
I got them as a present

00:05:30.803 --> 00:05:32.803
"You look the same from before you lost weight."

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.840
I didn't lose any weight,
