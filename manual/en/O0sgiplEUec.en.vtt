Leather Tools for Knife Sheath Making Leatherworking and Leathercraft Tutorial

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.220
You know I like to kinda share with you
some

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.270
leather tools to get started making your

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.910
handmade knife sheaths

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.849
the easiest and best way to get started
with

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.189
just a few minimal hand tools

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.199
sewing awls and leather knives and you can get in the leathercraft business

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.510
and you can add to your leather tool collection as you go

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.220
keep it simple to start with buy yourself a hide of leather

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.579
make some knife sheath patterns

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.780
I think you can be successful with your leathercraft and knife sheath making

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.040
let's take a look at some leatherworking tools

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:51.810
I would recommend

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.680
these are C.S. Osborne saddlers awls

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.270
small and a large and I have polished

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.860
tips on those...and this is a C.S. Osborne six inch wing divider

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.100
wing dividers made by C.S. Osborne &amp; Company made in Harrison N.J.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.140
right here is a hand scife that skives leather (safety beveler) from Tandy Leather Factory

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.170
there's a couple different brands and
I'll tell you about that in the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.030
description that uses the injector
blades

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.300
and you can easily change the blades out

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.320
there is a leather craftsman leather trimming knife (trim knife)

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.410
that have interchangeable blades

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.630
here are three saddlers awl and hafts made by C.S. Osborne

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.740
haft and different length awls

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.600
in the haft handles there

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.860
and a rivet set (actually a snap set) for setting belt snaps and baby durable snaps as well as the bigger durable snaps

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.060
belt snaps or the baby durables are
the big durable snaps

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.229
A snaps set like that is really good

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.250
up here that sharp pointed knife is called a point knife

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.690
that's what it's called a point knife

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.400
it's is made by C.S. Osborne and you can
get rough with it because it tough and durable

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.720
they sharpen easy and use it as a utility knife

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.690
there is a round knife made by C.S. Osborne &amp; Company

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.200
you don't necessarily have to have one to start with but they a good to use and you can always get one later

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.080
you can

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.650
get one later

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.730
maker mark stamp I will have the information on that also my description

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.220
you and you'll need some

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.190
harness needles

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.250
variety of hand sewing threads I use polyester and nylon

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.310
braided nylon and then the flat nylon lacing tape

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.370
nylon lacing tape

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.440
like I've done demo's on so

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.570
