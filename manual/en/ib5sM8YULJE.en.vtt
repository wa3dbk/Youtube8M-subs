00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.790
jay leno love and now the at the
eleventh eleven thirty p_m_ time slot

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.470
uh...

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.160
that's what it was one of the things
getting we don't know if that happened

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.039
conan o'brien

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:20.039
the cancer now your personal view
daughters festival in but it is moving

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.289
ten o'clock o'connor's separate from a
t_v_ perspective you know what do you do

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.470
with the show's at work a lot

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.970
and i've got the red is likely someone
is impressive but i think

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.199
with this one issue

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.329
uh... it's just kinsey reporting it spot
set in stone right to n_b_c_ has an

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.730
announcer anything but they seem very
confident about it

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.470
uh... and if that's true it's signals
several things that uh... co

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.230
consequences here one

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.580
uh... that kind of like experiment will
officially be considered a gigantic

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.080
failure which is a shame i kinda wanted
to work

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.860
uh... and when the reason for that is
all the philly it's like they were

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.560
killing their eleven o'clock news

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.100
because the ten o'clock it n_b_c_ didn't
mind having lower ratings for the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.510
company's letter cost them last friday

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.490
so the n_b_c_ salted mind of the things
were getting hammered

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.120
because to lower ratings might lead to
lower ratings for the news which is

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.360
where they make most their money

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.040
so there was a rebellion and it looks
like finally they had to put out the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.369
rebellion

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.220
uh... moving let on that slot and i was
gonna say hey it's coming yesterday

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.020
because we had a story that we didn't
get to that analysts like that we didn't

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.230
get to a college hipolito start

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.900
cup of n_b_c_ wearing like a huge swill
pilots

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.690
and ordered all those pilots unless
figure to refill the ten o'clock consul

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.810
right project

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.020
use that's how you see riding on the
wall

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.420
so now

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.350
if they move leno back alder hosing
conan o'brien

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.320
yes about for calling

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.840
look at it like you know one of them
packing them both point

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.579
but independence that like many of them
and got caught in doing is out there

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.890
enough but at the bottom of the has is
also stated that i could tell you

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.830
last it talk about that but that's what
does all things that i wanted to get

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.679
that came in the polio experience

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.090
that's not right that in a right
thirty-page so that you're a like idol

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.920
of either one of them i have nothing
against you the right but i just don't

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.659
have a watching too much and a lot of
people of color and it's not like that

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.430
so for me is that principles just if he
had a feel for the elephant now wisdom

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.219
make him feel alright

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:31.449
is the huge amount of money they get
back on track

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.369
okay unless he screwed up the contract

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.829
or they didn't have to pay him a lot of
money to step down

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.789
and that this is consequence the birth
rate

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:45.019
he's a free agent entities floating out
there somebody's one hundred gonna wanna

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:45.899
grab 'em

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:51.079
so right now the most nervous man in
hollywood is jimmy kimmel

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.399
project is like

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.559
goes out there

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:56.269
i think that

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.870
that's my guess as my hip

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.329
but he could go a hundred different ways
they could knock out the a_t_c_ could

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.099
knock out nightline which they've been
dying to do even though nightline and

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.809
beating of the late show

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:10.119
by direct philip nellie bailout would
fly out of the mother ratings

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:14.269
uh... but apparently for whatever reason
the bait that's a possibility they don't

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.759
like nightline or they have it in the
past

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.159
they could go out for camel

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.099
or

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.259
fox construction but i don't think color
of eyes and said out there for too long

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:24.570
before somebody grabs

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.989
because if you are you got a built-in
audience

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.219
people take that

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:33.079
you know he's got all yes and as willing
to travel with so

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.379
probably to go to somewhere where there
is no radio a talk show but of all the

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.299
talk show host the one guy who's got a
bit nervous as jim

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.979
and keeping a real that's that's how
this whole thing plays out this story is

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:45.559
true

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.759
why can't let o_j_'s let go away

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:53.729
how do you understand that he retired
and he that'd human not-so-good p yeah

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:57.939
uh... he uh... this is like but problems
should stuff but i'm getting the analogy

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.499
i like that now you two things that one
leno's a workaholic sought a personal

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:07.299
level here lies with the whole the it's
pretty busy with the tickets

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.329
woody with the force of the petitions
that he sits at home in plains georgia

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.939
so you think you'd be a better show but
have you

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.949
texaco he was that you realize that
retirements crazy what was i think you

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:18.740
had a lot of attack

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.799
anette n_b_c_ realizes

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.229
hey you know what that demographic for
the tonight show his alter and the like

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.539
leno more they didn't quite get used to
call in

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.460
so if you bring leno back to his old
slot that's pretty much a guaranteed

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.289
winner

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.159
so what we messing with a guaranteed
winner for this a lot of money on the

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.940
line

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.410
so that's why they're gonna burst leno
back

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.709
again if the story if d_n_c_'s writing
stories for

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:47.029
so we'll see how plays out as you know
i'm certainly interested so i'll give

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.750
you although updates whether you want to
burn up
