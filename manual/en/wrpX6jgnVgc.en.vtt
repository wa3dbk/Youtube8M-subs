00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.250
Now remember, I don't want too much graphite.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.890
I'm just experimenting with this.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.120
If I had to lighten up graphite I could tap
some of it off and use more of the brown or

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.950
whatever's going to accomplish it.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.250
I don't want there to be some gaudy color
in there unless you're doing some stylized

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.330
thing and interpretation.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:27.960
Let's take this around now.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.400
Okay.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.399
I'm going to integrate the brown in there
a little bit, warm it up and make sure that

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.660
we don't just have something that looks like
it's out of place by having graphite come

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.069
up to a sudden change to brown.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.550
So I'm warming up the graphite and I don't
want to bring the graphite out too far.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.810
I want to make sure and this is just my experiment
right now, but I want to make sure that I

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.399
don't muddy up my color.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:07.260
I keep it as fresh as I can and the graphite
will kill it if you're not careful.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.190
That's why we kept the eyes clean until we
are ready to put the color in.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:22.640
Looked kind of interesting to have those whiter
areas where the color was going to be.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.490
And I can keep working on this and every once
in a while come in there and maybe sharpen

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.780
up one thing.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.710
I usually don't like to go along and do a
whole edge.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.200
I like to come in and just maybe do one here,
one there.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.280
So it's a little bit more natural.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.950
I have an opportunity to avoid doing a saw-toothed
edge or something like that where everything

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:56.050
is incremental, just-- and it's really easy
to get in that mode when you're drawing.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.120
I think if some of you look at your drawings
you'll see that that might be one of the things

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:16.280
that you might want to address on your-- on
your cat.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.900
Now I've got a curved face here.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.909
Remember, we've got this curving under and
into that shadow.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.909
So I really want to show that this is a little
maybe just showing subtle curving and it's

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:29.909
a little darker.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.400
That's how I'm going to do it rather than
this or this.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:44.690
It's just I want-- I don't want to forget
that I've got a curved muzzle, a curved head.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.329
So I can maintain this detail and still just
feather in a little value to suggest it's

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.189
going round and under.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.159
And I can also take some off to show some
of the variations.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.459
You'll-- you can see some those variations
here and show some texture and interest in

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.069
there instead of just making it all flat in
one color.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:24.620
Kind of little layers, you know, there's these
almost like a terrace going backwards almost,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:36.209
but-- I also don't want to just-- these--
this is a short-haired cat, so I could really

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.400
easily start thinking well I'll just keep
drawing that line that comes out, you know,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.549
from the edge of the nose and keep that up,
but I like to make them short.

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:55.309
So I end up by, you know, kind of cutting
them off almost like a crisscross and that

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.459
keeps it from looking like it's just one long
hair.

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.419
But I want to be careful I don't get too dark,
but as I've said before too sometimes it's

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:08.950
nice to develop something and it may turn
a little darker but, you know, you can tap

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.350
it off overall, you have your detail then
and then you can tap back the values so it

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.870
maintains that texture and you can regulate
how dark it is.
