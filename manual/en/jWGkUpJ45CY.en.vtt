00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:08.609
Lets come back!

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:13.400
I was saying as soon as blood pressure goes
down, carotid sinus through the sinus nerve,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.400
right?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.929
This is through the vagus?

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.810
9th nerve glossopharyngeal nerve.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.810
Right?

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.790
This message is given to the central nervous
system that blood pressure is going down.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.270
As soon as central nervous system senses that
blood pressure is going down it will stimulate

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.570
the sympathetic outflow through the vasomotor
center in the medulla.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.230
So from the medulla fibers will come down,
neuronal connections will come down and stimulate

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.900
what thing out?

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.200
Stimulate sympathetic outflow.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.510
This sympathetic outflow which is going out,
suppose these are preganglionic sympathetic

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.540
neurons, and here are postganglionic sympathetic
neurons.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.620
I will not go to detail of all sympathetic
fibers, right now we are concerned only with

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.130
those sympathetic fibers which are coming
to juxtaglomerular apparatus.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:18.600
These are sympathetic neurons which are coming
to juxtraglomerular apparatus.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.470
Actually as soon as blood pressure starts
going down, vasomotor center is stimulated,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.630
lots of sympathetic outflow come.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:34.229
Some of the sympathetic fibers come to juxtaglomerular
apparatus, and what they will release there?

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.540
They will release....neurons will release....neurons
will release norepinephrine.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.240
Right? and these cells have receptors for
norepinephrine.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.010
These are Beta-1 adrenergic receptors.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.130
What are these receptors?

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.100
Beta-1 adrenergic receptor.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.090
You must know there are beta-1 adrenergic
receptors present on juxtraglomerular apparatus

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.640
beause beta blocker block them also and help
us in hypertension management.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.420
So there are beta-1 adrenergic receptors present
over here.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.009
So sympathetic outflow stimulates these beta-1
receptors and when beta-1 receptors are stimulated

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.830
here, more release of renin, according to
Mr. Hadayat speculations.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.480
More release of "Renin".

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.950
So how many mechanism are there to release
the renin from here?

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.040
Two local and one systemic.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.180
Intra renal mechanism is, low blood pressure
in the afferent arteriole and low sodium concentration

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.180
to the macula densa.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.780
Both of them release renin, these two are
intrarenal mechanism of release of renin.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.370
Extrarenal mechanism of release of renin is,
most important sympathetic fibers connected

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.450
with that.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.450
Is that right?

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.590
So we see this juxtaglomerular apparatus can
measure the pressure directly, can measure

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.209
the sodium concentration directly and in every
emergency whenever sympathetic nervous system

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.129
will fire renin will come.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.079
Now what this renin will do?

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.420
Lets see what this renin is going to do.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:13.500
This renin is going to the general circulation,
the renin will go to the general circulation.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.550
Now renin has come to the systemic circulation.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.280
Right? through the renal veins.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.430
Now what renin will do here?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.930
I told you renin is an enzyme.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.080
Right? and every enzyme works on special type
of substrate.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.989
It will also work on some special type of
substrate.

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.129
Before we go for that...

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.910
You know liver has lots of hepatocytes.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.010
Hepatocytes produce lots of protein, Normally,
you know they produce albumins than globulins

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.830
and alpha globulins, beta globulins but not
gamma globulins because gamma globulins are

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.750
immuno globulins, antibodies which come from
plasma cells, B cells.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.160
Most of the proteins other than the gamma
globulins, most not all, but most of the proteins

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.590
are produced by liver cells.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:09.750
Liver cells produce one very special type
of protein normally, and this protein is called

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.130
"Angiotensinogen".

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.510
Angiotensinogen.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.889
Right?

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:24.320
Angiotensinogen, ok i will write it in small
way, this is angiotensinogen.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.219
Right?

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.369
From where it is coming?

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:33.960
It is coming from Liver and it is not coming
only during crisis it is produced by the liver

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960
all the time.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.339
Right now all of you have in your blood angiotensinogen.

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:48.669
As soon as renin comes it will work on angiotensinogen,
it will work on, angiotensinogen and convert

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:56.240
the angiotensinogen into angiotensin I.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.990
It is angiotensin I.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.050
So what is the function of renin?

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.050
Renin is an enzyme which can convert angiotensinogen
into angiotensin I.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.050
Is that right?

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.770
Now all of you know it, that when angiotensin
I passes through the lungs, it converts into

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.990
angiotensin II.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.069
That is the crust of understanding.

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.830
That angiotensin I when it is passing through
the lungs it converts into angiotensin II.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.379
It means in the lungs there should be some
enzyme which converts angiotensin 1 into angiotensin

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:34.759
II and that enzyme is called angiotensin converting
enzyme.

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:42.310
Again, when angiotensin I passes through the
lungs it converts into angiotensin II.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.770
Angiotensin II.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.000
Right?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.819
When angiotensin passes through the lungs
it converts into angiotensin II.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.430
This is large protein molecule.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.729
It is decapeptide, I mean 10 amino acid then
there is enzyme in the lungs which breaks

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.999
down two more amino acids and this product
is octapeptide only 8 amino acids.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:14.190
I want to know one thing, angiotensin converting
enzyme, on which so many drugs work, angiotensin

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.369
converting enzyme are present in which part
of the lungs?

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:19.789
Are they present in bronchioles?

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.270
Are they present in alveoli?

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.719
Are they present in capillaries?

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:25.789
Are they present "where" ? :D

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:30.120
Where in the lungs angiotensin converting
enzyme is present?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.399
All of you know there are many drugs that
inhibit that enzyme, we must know where is

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:34.479
that enzyme.

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.580
Yes, we talk to abbas.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.129
No idea? :O

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:40.129
Jamie?

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:41.689
Same? :O

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:45.800
Yes hadayat ullah? :D

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.180
You are with the majority or you will try
to guess something?

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.759
In the lungs everyone has heard, there is
enzyme called angiotensin converting enzyme.

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.089
Have you heard of it or not?

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:57.559
Mashallah you have heart of it :D.

00:06:57.559 --> 00:06:58.949
Where exactly is it present?

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:00.610
No idea?

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.270
No idea?

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.270
Jamie?

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.490
Just guess it.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.330
WILD GUESS!

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.460
You don't want to even guess? :D

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.360
Maybe it is present on the plura.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.360
Yes?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.900
Any "Wild Guess"?

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.900
Alveoli.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.080
What do you think?

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.080
Pneumocytes.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080
Ok!

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.219
Right it down on the book and put a "VERY
BIG" Cross on it :D.

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:22.219
You know why?

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:27.810
If it is present in alveoli then tell me one
thing it means your blood has to pass through

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.810
alveoli :D

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.880
Alveoli are blood flow system or air flow
system?

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.599
They are air pockets or blood pockets?

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:36.919
Yes?

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:38.240
No!

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.610
Alveoli are air pockets and pulmonary capillaries
are attached with them but pulmonary capillaries

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.539
are not alveoli themselves.

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:47.539
Right?

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:51.959
So, one thing is sure alveoli should not have
the enzyme otherwise there will be tragedy.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:56.719
Blood has to jump into alveoli so that angiotensin
I should convert into angiotensin II.

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:57.909
Ok let me explain.

00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:59.129
Actually here is alveoli.

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:06.699
Lets suppose this is air way, and these are
suppose alveolar system, these are air pockets,

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:09.029
of course blood should not enter there.

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:10.619
Is that right?
