00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:02.045
- Welcome back.

00:00:02.045 --> 00:00:03.791
Now that we've completed the wash routine,

00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:05.904
we can move on to the styling routine.

00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:07.932
One important thing I wanted to point out

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:09.839
is that when I exit the shower,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.504
I do not towel-dry my hair.

00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:13.336
I used to but I just stopped doing that

00:00:13.336 --> 00:00:16.502
because I find that
when you apply products

00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:20.400
to wet, soaking hair it gives
the best curl definition.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.591
And that's why you can see my sweater has

00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:24.376
wet spots all over it.

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:26.267
Kind of embarrassing, I didn't realize

00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:28.584
they were there until
now, but that is why.

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.792
(soft, jazzy music)

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:32.250
So, I'm going to switch over to voiceover

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.167
so this video doesn't get too long.

00:00:36.474 --> 00:00:38.955
The first product I apply is from Alterna.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:42.606
It's the Caviar Clinical
Daily Root &amp; Scalp Stimulator.

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:44.801
This is a leave-in treatment
that I apply to my scalp

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:46.586
to help with hair growth.

00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:48.980
It has red clover growth
complex to help improve

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.372
blood circulation, soothe irritated skin

00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:53.892
and eliminate the build-up of toxins.

00:00:53.892 --> 00:00:57.309
I also apply this on my scalp at bedtime.

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:01.643
(soft, jazzy music)

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:03.713
Next I apply my Lavish Curls Moisturizer

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:05.703
as a leave-in all over my curls.

00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:08.143
This smells really good
and my fingers slip

00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:10.810
right through all those tangles.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.101
I then apply a dollop of Samy
Fat Hair Thickening Creme

00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:20.557
to my hair.

00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:22.784
I apply the majority of
this to my head flipped over

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:25.054
so that it doesn't
weigh down the top half.

00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:26.596
Whatever is left on my hands gets applied

00:01:26.596 --> 00:01:27.929
to the top half.

00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:36.536
Lastly I apply the Curls Creme Brule

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:38.730
Whipped Curl Creme to the back of my hair.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.023
And again, using whatever
product is left on the top half.

00:01:42.023 --> 00:01:45.023
(soft, jazzy music)

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:01.660
Now, I just scrunch my curls until they're

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.580
nice and springy,
especially with my bangs.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.580
(soft, jazzy music)

00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:25.169
At this point, when your hair is styled

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:26.346
do not touch it.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.513
Just let it air dry for about an hour.

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:33.856
After about an hour, my
ends are normally dry

00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:35.520
but my roots are still damp.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.445
So I continue scrunching, but
I focus mainly on the ends.

00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:41.445
(soft, jazzy music)

00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:53.185
I like a little frizz, but not too much.

00:02:53.185 --> 00:02:54.323
So, I'm going to wait another hour

00:02:54.323 --> 00:02:56.156
to shake out my roots.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.848
Now that my hair is completely dried,

00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:01.349
I do a combination of scrunching

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.950
and shaking out my curls with my hands.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.950
(soft, jazzy music)

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:18.654
This can be your last
step, but if you want

00:03:18.654 --> 00:03:22.404
bigger hair, you've
gotta bust out that pick.

00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:27.374
(soft, jazzy music)

00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:47.311
Now, shake it out.
