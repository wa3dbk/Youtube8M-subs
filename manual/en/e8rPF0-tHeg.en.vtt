00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.638 align:end position:100%
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS WAS ALL ABOUT?

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.073 align:start position:0%
THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU?

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.174 align:start size:34% position:66%
WHAT? TH--

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.409 align:start position:0%
HUH.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.112 align:start size:66% position:34%
THEY--THEY TOLD YOU?

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.446 align:start position:0%
ONCE SHE TURNED ME OUT,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.848 size:84% position:42%
IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG
TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.683 size:56% position:28%
BUT ALL I COULD DO
WAS WATCH

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.385 align:start position:0%
AND WAIT FOR HER
TO MAKE HER MOVE.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.953 size:56% position:72%
HARD TO BELIEVE
SHE WAS A TRAITOR.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.588 align:start size:59% position:41%
IT WAS ALL AN ACT.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.758 size:88% position:44%
LANGLEY THINKS SHE MAY HAVE
BEEN A FORMER K.G.B. SLEEPER

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.626 size:81% position:41%
SET ADRIFT WHEN
THE SOVIET UNION BROKE UP.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.462
STAYED WITH THE COMPANY BECAUSE
SHE HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.097 size:59% position:70%
TILL A BETTER OFFER
CAME ALONG.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.133
DID YOU EVER FIND OUT
WHO SHE WAS WORKING FOR,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.334
WHO WAS BEHIND PANDORA?

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.370 align:start position:0%
NO, AND EVEN IF I DID,
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.972 align:start size:53% position:47%
AGENT DANBERG...

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.642 align:start size:72% position:28%
SOPHIA SAID SOMETHING,

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:46.112 size:78% position:61%
SOMETHING ABOUT MY FATHER
BEING IN THE CIA.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.648 size:69% position:66%
WOULD YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.483 align:start position:0%
I'M AFRAID I DON'T.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
SORRY.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.586 size:81% position:41%
OH, UH, DETECTIVE BECKETT.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.654 align:start position:0%
HERE.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:55.855
(jangles keys)

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.091 size:69% position:34%
I HAD OUR GUYS, UH,
TAKE CARE OF YOUR CAR.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.859 align:start size:56% position:44%
YOU PULLED MY CAR
OUT OF THE RIVER?

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.529
YEP. I THINK YOU WILL FIND IT
BETTER THAN NEW.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.729 align:start size:34% position:66%
THANK YOU.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.166 size:53% position:27%
IT'S THE LEAST
THAT WE COULD DO.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.367 align:start position:0%
TAKE CARE.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.038
(door opens)

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.546
(sets cup down)

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.448 align:start size:56% position:44%
YOU THINK SHE WAS
TELLING THE TRUTH

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.749 align:start size:53% position:47%
ABOUT MY FATHER?

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.317 size:88% position:56%
I MEAN, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.820 size:72% position:64%
WHY HE
COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.588 align:start position:0%
I...

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.825 size:75% position:38%
I THINK THAT SOPHIA TOLD
A LOT OF LIES.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.763 align:start position:0%
MUST BE TOUGH,

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.099 size:66% position:33%
FINDING OUT
THAT SHE'S A TRAITOR,

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:42.435 size:88% position:44%
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU BASED
CLARA STRIKE ON HER AND ALL.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.939 align:start size:41% position:59%
HMM. WELL...

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.842 align:start size:56% position:44%
CLARA STARTED OFF
AS SOPHIA, BUT...

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.711 size:78% position:61%
SHE ENDED UP BEING
MORE LIKE YOU, YOU KNOW--

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:55.281 align:start size:66% position:34%
SMART, FIERCE, KIND.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.118
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF
THE REASONS I WAS DRAWN TO YOU

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.519 align:start size:34% position:66%
AS A MUSE.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.789 size:75% position:63%
YOU THINK
DR. BLAKELY WAS RIGHT...

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.224 align:start size:63% position:38%
ABOUT THE LINCHPIN?

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.960 size:81% position:59%
DO YOU THINK WE ACTUALLY
SAVED THE WORLD?

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.896 align:start position:0%
I THINK THAT WE SAVED
A LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE,

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.965 size:78% position:39%
AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.
