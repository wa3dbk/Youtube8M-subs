00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.370
Given that Tetris has already made an appearance
on almost every format under the sun - including

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.480
iPhone - you might expect an iOS re-release
to adorned with an abundance of new knobs

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.420
and bobs to sweeten the deal.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.450
If the early App Store reviews are anything
to go by, however, it would appear a host

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.130
of new in-app purchases and a subscription-based
service weren't entirely what most Tetris

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.970
fans had in mind.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.539
In terms of pre-launch hype and hysteria,
Tetris's new T-Club – available for £1.99

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.150
for a month, or £20.99 for an entire year
– has been the game's headline new feature.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.350
In reality, it plays a small role.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.380
Indeed, you'd be forgiven for not spotting
it at all.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.870
Instead, what stands out it EA's new One Touch
mode.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.480
One Touch does exactly what it sounds like,
swapping a control method that doesn't always

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.010
work well on touchscreens for a simplified
approach.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.170
Essentially, when the shapes drop into play
from the top, Tetris gives you four suitable

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.400
options as to where they can be placed.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.280
As in all forms of the game, the idea is to
form solid horizontal lines of squares to

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.860
be cleared from the board.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.460
One Touch places a silhouette of the shape
in question in each of the four positions

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.930
available, giving you just a few seconds to
make your choice with a tap.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.540
While there are times when the four slots
open to you don't cover every position in

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.850
which your shape could fit, in the majority
of cases all options are covered, and One

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.540
Touch leads to the kind of hectic contests
that have always been Tetris's signature.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.950
It's a control method EA has also employed
in Galaxy – effectively the game's challenge

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.950
mode.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.910
Here the placement options are the same, but
the aim is to drop the shapes into a predetermined

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.970
structure.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.590
As such, things are far more black and white:
it's possible to pick the 'wrong' option,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.270
breaking the game's intended flow and building
up the shapes rather than breaking them down.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.550
Brevity is the main aim, with Tetris rating
your efficiency out of five at the end of

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.550
each stage.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.730
The fewer moves you make, the higher you score
and the more Touch Coins you pick up – currency

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.770
that, whether earned through play or paid
for, enables you to unlock additional content.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.310
This content currently appears to be missing,
however, and like the aforementioned T-Club

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.979
– which also claims to give access to exclusive
bonuses – its presence makes very little

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.200
difference to the bulk of play.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.039
Indeed, T-Club's only noticeable bonus for
many will be that it enables you to rank up

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.230
more quickly – a perk that will only really
appeal to those desperate enough to top Tetris's

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.459
global league tables.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.169
For the rest of us, what EA's refreshed Tetris
represents is just that – a solid but slight

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:25.439
refinement of the game that will make it more
digestible to newcomers and offer even old

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.099
skool players a fresh take on a favourite.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.189
For those just looking for a slice of Tetris
as it was, EA has also wrapped up the standard

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.019
Marathon mode, bereft of any new control method
or revised take on the rules.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.879
Don't be fooled by the new weapons in Tetris's
arsenal: it's the same old game, with some

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.489
touchscreen-friendly tweaks.
