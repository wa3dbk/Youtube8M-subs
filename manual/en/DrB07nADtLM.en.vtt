Howdy folks, Jules here with my
favorite by Park update of the season.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.599
I'm standing on P.B.R. right now and this is
the update where I get to tell you

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.849
that Stevens Pass by Park is opening for
the season

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.790
this Friday June 27th! Oooooh!

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.220
That's right, the cherry on top of it all
is that we will be opening in full

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.810
operation with all the trails with currently have built:

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.560
That's Rock Crusher, Lichen It, Luvin' It, Slingshot Wookie,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.429
and P.B.R. it's going to be awesome!

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.110
I took a little walk along on some other
trails earlier to ascertain the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.140
condition so

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.340
let's take a quick look at that right
now.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.510
The last time I took a look at the top of
Slingshot Wookie it was covered in about

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.080
six feet of snow and looking super
gnarly

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.620
so here we are a couple weeks later it
is looking primo!

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.910
Granted, they're probably gonna be a
couple areas that'll be a little moist

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.470
so would recommend wearing a white
t-shirt.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.770
The top of Lichen It is all melted out there
still some snow surrounding the trail

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.890
but I think it is going to be pretty
darn good.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.660
Since Rock Crusher gets the most sun, it
is looking the most dried out,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.590
so might be able to escape that one
without too many mud splatters.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.960
but I personally don't see the fun
in finishing a day of mountain biking without a

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.130
little bit mud splatter!

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.120
I was super stoked to see that the condition of P.B.R.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.400
is looking fantastic.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.520
Granted, I'm sure there will be a couple areas where get alittle moist

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.120
but once again this early in the season its
exceeding my expectations.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.110
So there you have it folks, once again
opening weekend starts this Friday, June

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.720
27th it's gonna be a fantastic time

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.049
grab your friends, grab your friends'
friends, come out ride with me

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.080
and everyone that wants to have an
awesome time at an awesome bike park.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.710
Hope to see you soon; let's ride!
