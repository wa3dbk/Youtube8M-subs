00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.080
&gt;&gt; DAN SULLIVAN: I lived a really good life,
doing a lot of travelling, a lot of sailing,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.080
having fun.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.080
That’s me.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.540
At the steering wheel.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.050

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.460
Then I had a heart attack out at sea on a
boat.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.650
The hospital said ‘it’s too late, he’s
pretty much a goner.’

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.929
Then a week and a half later, I came out of
the coma.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.249
They started calling me the miracle man,

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.989

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:35.330
I spent most of last year in the hospital
or confined to my bed.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.969
&gt;&gt; LINDA SULLIVAN: He couldn’t be left alone
because he couldn’t get out of bed without

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:40.969
support.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:41.969
It was that serious.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.699
&gt;&gt; DAN SULLIVAN: They didn’t think I’d
survive an open heart surgery.

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.719
Then Linda, my wife, found this study that
was under way for repairing heart valves without

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.780
open heart surgery and there were only a few
hospitals in the country that were doing it.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.559
We thought for sure one of the hospitals in
Boston would be doing it, but they weren’t.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.189
The closet one was Maine Medical Center.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.189

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. BUD KELLETT: There was no other site
in New England.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.140
And so, having a site in New England meant
there was access for patients closer to home.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.570
Maine Med has a long history of a very active
valve surgery program.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.100
Getting this study was very important to us
in our vision of being a full service valve

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.100
center.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.640
The MitraClip device is designed to treat
a leaky mitral valve.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.579
For all valves, we’re looking for ways to
do it less-invasively, with lower risk to

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:34.579
patients.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.280
We’re able to treat people who we used to
look at and say, ‘you’re too sick.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.630
You could never recover from an open heart
operation.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.060
&gt;&gt; DAN SULLIVAN: On December 26-th, they did
the procedure.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.310
It was absolutely the best Christmas present
I’ve ever had.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.450
The people up there, they make you feel as
though you’re the most important person

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.450
on earth.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.450
I spent one night there after the procedure,
so it was just in and out.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.130
Almost immediately, I began to feel better.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.749
I could get out of bed, I could walk up stairs.

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.799
&gt;&gt; LINDA SULLIVAN: People will come up to
us, no matter where we are, and they can’t

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:07.799
believe it’s the same man.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.039
&gt;&gt; DAN SULLIVAN: This is what I do to try
to stay in shape.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.560
&gt;&gt; LINDA SULLIVAN: Last year, he never talked
about the future.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.560
There was no future.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.030
And now he talks about, he wants to race,
he wants to travel.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.340
&gt;&gt; DAN SULLIVAN: I just bought a new little
sail boat so I could race and I haven’t

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.230
raced in years.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.420
My life is coming back.
