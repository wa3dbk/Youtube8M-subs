00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.429
according to a survey released this week
by Consumer Reports

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:06.920
the the word natural on food products

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.800
actually means nothing literally nothing
that's right so we've got some findings

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.440
from the study

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.830
so two-thirds of Americans think that
the word natural on the label on the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.449
package

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.810
or processed food means that it contains
no artificial ingredients pesticides

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.730
or genetically engineered organisms that
is just simply not true

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.490
when consumers see the word on meat or
poultry seventy percent

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.520
think it means no growth hormones were
used to get the animal

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.140
in the animals feed and sixty percent
think the animals got no antibiotics or

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.550
other drugs in their feed that is also
not true

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.270
both the FDA and the US Department of
Agriculture allow food producers to use

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.809
the word natural on labels

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.960
as long as nothing artificial or
synthetic has been added

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.280
that would not normally be expected in
the food

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.670
under an informal policy the FDA put
into place back in 1983

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.329
and the arguments been made that the
prohibition up the word natural wood

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.789
restrict free speech so we we do a lot
of stuff

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.210
on the show about natural foods in GM
owes and all the crazy additives and the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.010
shoulder is the night but does corn
syrup and all that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.930
jacqueline I'm gonna let you start here
is someone with a little science behind

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.540
it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.960
I am we love words right we just love
words its own natural I need people

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.710
think

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.729
Wenger I mean it says right there that

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.229
it's just what you put in our to expect
to be in the votes or something

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.770
unnatural is being added to your food
but it's something that they normally

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.829
and

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.240
they're allowed to use the word natural
and put that label on the food and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.619
people I'm sorry but like

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.850
I do honestly think that they have the
right to do that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.369
people being gullible was not their
fault I mean people exploit that type of

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.970
thing all the time politicians do it

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.490
markers do it so it kinda up to the
consumer to do a little better work in a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.170
little bit of research to figure out
what is in there for good and what is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.329
healthy and what's not

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.170
and hand hygiene thing to people get
excited they've seen on GM 0

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.079
on a phone now by I've seen on Geo on
salt yeah I mean that an inorganic

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.829
yeah there's no g2/m yeah I know I don't
understand why people just a few words

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.110
that are pretty and

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.180
they think that they're doing something
good by going after that it breaks to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.250
your kinda given the FDA little

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.270
a little each year to people around
because you wanted to ultimately come

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.390
back to the people who have the biggest
manipulative and I wish that it wouldn't

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.050
happen

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.280
but I mean that are the world world we
live in

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.030
as far as like the money is concerned
hit the ball the money if this is gonna

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.510
make operations more money

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.530
no one's going to stop them the a so I
am short with you cuz I believe in the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.080
personal responsibility thing but if
this many people are getting duped

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.370
perhaps the FDA

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.530
needs the do something more more
transparent to raise the standards I i

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.220
hurt you

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.769
you tell me if this is cracking I heard
that apparently there's a certain

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.280
like percentage on insects that are
allowed in peanut butter and it's like a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.440
.5

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.330
situation just simply because in the
quantity %uh mass production

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.519
that you have to allow that just
marginal toxicity

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.830
in your for there's a certain amount a
bone that allowed to be in the mid 90

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.900
me is a because because I'm just the
byline so that the permit that but what

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.390
I am shocked by is just how low the bars
&amp; Sat words like all Naturals not

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.209
they're like I'll this doesn't have
formaldehyde and you know

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.819
rap poisoned so yes it's on actual for
its intense it's about incident

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.260
on after being about what is it's now
about what it's not

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.650
they're like oh well more doesn't have
tar and yes couple on natural

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.069
ray do you think so if they changed it
to be a little more honest

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.560
would the company's the food companies
just figure out other ways

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.860
the manipulating people and they do I
mean that's not the only thing i've seen

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.540
you know as far as manipulation goes I
mean I've seen people you know

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.959
who are concerned animal rights give no
mind to

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.200
factory farming because it's at a
factory farming they say farm fresh

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.739
and technically it's a farm too far they
can say farm fresh in own bat an eye at

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.930
that I mean

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.330
it's no secret that 50 percent the
antibiotics and you know that are being

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.769
used

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.110
go into the food that you're consuming
and instead of

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.280
and serve you know marking like that of
a you know do to advance farming

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.099
techniques we've taken advanced

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.000
veterinary measures you know and and
people see that and I like how that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.959
sounds great

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.310
break but they have no idea that Assange
were pumping approval that a bad right

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.470
so is that part about that especially in
America cuz a lot of the stuff that we

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.989
allowing our food in america is not
allowed in Europe

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.770
is a party that we just love stamps on
things we love like a logo that says

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.080
sup you know just some catch phrase or
authorized by

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.710
errors certified by and we don't do any
of the work

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.850
when you when you go shopping do you
look for those things even if you're not

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.139
even sure what they mean

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.100
you know just the stamp on the thing
that says it depends on when is I think

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.770
I feel like I was raised a pretty
healthy and so i'm looking i little

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.880
brown eggs I look for you know

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.009
pettit like there certain out things
that I do look at but

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.570
I feel like ninety percent on the
grocery store contains all these

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.490
chemicals at the Smarties quoting don't
remember bye and bye and baby how can

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.169
you avoid

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.190
II china shop around outside premier get
the fresh

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.620
management cheese and lettuce and what
what have you there's the

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.320
a but I did answer question though I do
believe that America is addicted to

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.610
brands and labels for sure

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.940
wrong you know it's it's all about
status it's all about

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.729
you now II honest I think the whole
vegan gluten free movement and really

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.350
pushed push that kinda obsession when it
comes to

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.160
one's own I initially restaurant I and
gluten free and if the clear that to the

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.680
restaurant so that everyone knows yeah

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.039
which actually a now there's been study
saying that good most people unless you

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.280
have silly actin there's basically no
such thing as being good gluten

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.389
intolerant when I'm sure they'll be
another 30

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.750
and rivers that next week anyway so just
be kinda a little more aware

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.080
what you plannin in your body because
this packaging clearly isn't telling the

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.330
truth
