00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.580
Do you know what would happen if a Pitbull fought a Kangal?

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.880
Do you already have the winner?

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.980
Welcome to the ListaAnimal versus

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.880
Since friday, june 26th and all fridays at 15 hrs Argentina

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.520
Pitbull vs Kangal

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.180
We know the difference in size is obvious

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.640
While on one hand the pitbull is very aggressive and has a fight dog mind

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.240
And the Kangal is much bigger

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.660
Therefore has greater power and knows the danger, since he faces it daily

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.740
Let´s meet the features and abilities of each breed

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.360
And so, choose a single winner

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860
First, we will talk about the Pitbull

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.620
He is listed as one of the most aggressive dogs in the world

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.160
Being very dangerous for being furious at most times

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.180
And also, he knows where to attack

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.920
He has the muscles and at the same time a very powerful jaw

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.880
That does great harm

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.900
He grows to a maximum of 20 inches and has a weight ranging from 30 to 60 pounds

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.780
The Pitbull would have undoubtedly disadvantage in this battle

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.500
As he is much smaller than the Kangal

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.840
Besides also having a lower weight

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:13.995
Now, let´s talk about the Kangal

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.640
He is one of the tallest dogs in the world

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.740
Reaching a 35 inches height as maximum

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.120
And reaching a weight of 145 pounds

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.620
Features that really matter in a fight

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.700
These are sheep dogs, dedicated to guard and protect the sheep

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.860
So they are aggressive with all wild animals who get close

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.920
Such as wolves or bears

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.860
So he knows very well of battles

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.800
His biggest advantage is that he´s very strong for being big and heavy

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.500
Besides he would be very hard to attack

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.860
As you can see, one of them is very muscular and furious

00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:48.494
While the other one is bigger and heavier

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.360
Which are very well valued features in fights

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.760
So in this case, we will name the Kangal the winner

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.900
Since he has almost twice the size and weight in comparison to the pitbull

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340
Therefore, the Kangal would be the winner

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.260
