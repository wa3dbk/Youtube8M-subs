00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.610
When Brian was born with Cerebral Palsey
the physician walked up to

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.910
Brian's parents and said you have a choice. You can put him in an institution

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.419
and never see him again  or you can struggle with him as a child
your whole life.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.960
his parents, stubborn Irish family - faith filled people that they are 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.390
said no that's not how Brian will be raised

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.390
everything in that young man's life at the time was upstream

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.320
it was - the first to attend regular school. The first to do the regular 
things that a person like that was told they could not do.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:58.470
when I first went to High School 
the kids used to say "shhhh" don't tell him he doesn't know he's disabled.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.909
and...so I guess I never saw myself as having a disability.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:01:07.420
His family always wanted Brian to be like everyone else

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.250
to push himself as hard as everyone else was expected to push

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.520
Brian was the first student at this University - it's hard to believe

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.220
with a severe disability. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.270
Syracuse University gave him the chance.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.210
When he enrolled at Syracuse - there were many schools that would not have accepted

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.230
all the issues associated with the disabled student

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.160
He had to fight to raise the consciousness of the administrators and the school

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.800
to make it easier for the disadvantaged

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.799
getting around campus was really, really tough

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.740
and Brian was an ambitious student and he

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.380
wanted to take classes that he wanted and if they happened to be on the third floor

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.080
of the Hall of Languages, well somehow 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.770
I needed to get him up to the third floor of the Hall of Langauages

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.990
I'm not so sure that Syracuse didn't choose me, but I had an opportunity
to be involved in many many things

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.300
not only basketball but the Daily Orange

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.020
WAER, with the Newman Center

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.460
with Alpha Phi Omega

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.479
I even ended up managing rock bands.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.930
There is nothing he loves more than the University. But when it came time for the Dome to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.970
to provide access for people with challenges Brian was on the leading end.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.170
Nothing stops him because I really believe his parents told him nothing
should stop you. You should just be what you want to be.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.890
When I was coaching Basketball it was about game plans, it was about winning and losing

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.040
and logistics. And then I decided to get out of coaching

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.360
I got into the big bad world of government and politics

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.540
again,that was the world of winning and losing

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.940
you either got your bill passed or you didn't get your bill passed

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.990
he aligned and he collaborated and he got people to do what he deemed to be impossible

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.960
back during the Cuomo administration, Brian sat

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.649
on the New York State Developmental Disabilities Planning Council

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:09.429
that counsel really did shape the way services are being developed

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.450
Brian was listened to on that counsel, and they really gave out money and helped to support

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.859
the programs that are in fact the programs we are now
0:03:18:860, 0:03:21:860
reaping the great benefits of
0:03:21:860, 0:03:23:860
He had a responsibility in the State Education Department
0:03:23:860, 0:03:28:860
when we were raising questions about how institutions of higher education
0:03:28:860, 0:03:31:860
in the state were going to be dealing with persons with disabilities 
0:03:31:860, 0:03:38:860
he had a special impact there but he had an impact on so many
issue areas while he was there - he was a leader
0:03:38:860, 0:03:42:860
a lot of people who feel the world owe them
0:03:42:860, 0:03:46:860
you know because they have a disability, and that's not true
0:03:46:860, 0:03:53:860
we do owe you the opportunity to level the playing field to make sure 
that you have
0:03:53:860, 0:03:54:860
an equal amount of opportunity to compete
0:03:54:860, 0:03:18:860
he fought for those who had disabilities he had to remove barriers
0:03:59:860, 0:04:02:860
obstacles, and impediments and barriers for their better life.
0:04:02:860, 0:04:11:860
Brian McLean is continuing to fight the good fight on behalf of all the 54 million 
disabled people 
0:04:11:860, 0:04:12:860
who are striving for their independence
0:04:12:860, 0:04:17:860
Brian puts himself last, she is working on a thousand things to help a thousand people
0:04:17:860, 0:04:19:860
and thats who he is.
0:04:19:860, 0:04:24:860
Anytime you're seeing someone who is dedicated as Brian McLane who is focused to get things done
0:04:24:860, 0:04:27:860
somebody who lets nothing bother him there is no handicap.
0:04:28:860, 0:04:32:860
There is nothing stops Brian McLane. I think that's a good example for all of us.
0:04:32:860, 0:04:38:860
We want Syracuse University to become a destination point
0:04:38:860, 0:04:44:860
that kids to go to high school with their goal to go to Syracuse University
0:04:44:860, 0:04:48:860
Just like back in the '60's - you come and then we'll make it happen
0:04:48:860, 0:04:53:860
History isn't something that happens to us - we make it history
0:04:53:860, 0:04:56:860
and if you look at Brian's career, with the Town of Cicero and with the State of New York
0:04:56:860, 0:05:00:860
and with Syracuse University - he has made history
0:05:00:860, 0:05:05:860
It doesn't take too much consciousness to admire somebody who overcomes
0:05:05:860, 0:05:10:860
the adversity he has to accomplish what he has accomplished in life
0:05:10:860, 0:05:16:860
I see a role model, I see a man of inspiration, I see a man who challenges 
complacency
0:05:16:860, 0:05:18:860
and overcomes insurmountable odds
0:05:18:860, 0:05:23:860
I see a man that enables anyone around him to jump over a bar higher than they thought they could 
0:05:23:860, 0:05:26:860
and I see a man that encourages people's hearts
0:05:26:860, 0:05:31:860
you know my father used to always say you live in the world the way it is
0:05:31:860, 0:05:35:860
and you have to figure it out. He said so your advocacy is
0:05:35:860, 0:05:37:860
for the people coming up behind you 
0:05:37:860, 0:05:41:860
so that their life experience is a little different than yours
