Hi guys my name is J and I'm talking on behalf
of Expert Village. I'm going to talk to you

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.770
guys on how to cut your tomato for your pico
de gallo. First thing is first you want to

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:16.730
wash off the outside skin of you tomato. You
want to come in close so you can see. Cut

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:34.239
the top part off, turn that around and cut
that off and you want to deseed your tomato.

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.300
Going all around it and come over here and
drop that inner part into there and squeeze

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.070
any of that juice in there that you can get
out. Same thing with this side you want to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.500
go ahead and cut that just like that, cut
that out and get all that nasty seeds out

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:03.559
of there.
Now I like my salsa pretty chunky so I'm going

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:13.410
to cut it in chunks you want to put the inner
side down this time. Cut it into slits and

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:29.890
you want to cut your tomatoes in slices like
that and dice them the opposite way. Let me

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:41.390
show you once again cut it in strips like
that and go t he opposite way. You can use

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.920
your food processor if you like and make this
is a really thin pico de gallo but like I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.090
said I like my pico de gallo nice and chunky.
Let me show you one cool thing I got this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.420
nice cutting board it slides all of your stuff
into your bowl like that and that is cutting

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.910
your tomato for your mango pico de gallo.
Thank you.
