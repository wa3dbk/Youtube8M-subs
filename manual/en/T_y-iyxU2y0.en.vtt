00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.430
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure in order to remove

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.120
and replace a broken CV joint also known as
a drive shaft on a front-wheel drive vehicle.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.180
In this step, we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure for jacking your

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.640
vehicle off the ground and setting your jack
stands. What I'm going to do is roll my jack

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.779
underneath the front of the vehicle. Now what
I'm shooting for with my jack is a large piece

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.620
of super structure or an engine cradle. You're
going to note that the radiator is in the

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.699
front of the vehicle, you're not going to
want to jack up on the bottom of your radiator.

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.070
That will bend and destroy it. So you're looking
for a portion like I said, super structure

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.820
or engine frame or other very sturdy component.
What we're going to do is tighten the tension

00:00:48.820 --> 00:01:15.710
down on my jack and begin raising it. Once
we've made contact, go ahead and jack it off

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:34.740
the ground. Once you have the vehicle high
enough to work on comfortably, you can go

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.840
ahead and place your jack stands. And again,
you are looking for a large piece of super

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.300
structure or engine cradle to set your stand.
Take and adjust it up to the appropriate location.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm going to take and set the other side on
an identical component. Once you have your

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.990
jack stands in place, it?s ok to go ahead
and release the tension on your hydraulic

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.090
floor jack. You're going to want to let the
tension off slowly so the vehicle settles

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:15.480
down onto the receiving cups of your jack
stands. Release the pressure by rotating the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.040
handle in a counterclockwise motion just like
so. What that will do is open the release

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.980
valve and you can take and speed it up by
pushing down on the jacking boom itself.
