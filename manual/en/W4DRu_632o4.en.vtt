How to Make Lollipop Sugar Cookies
and Cookie Decorating Ideas

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.340
Sugar cookies are a classic treat that
everyone loves, and they're a blank

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.080
canvas for decorating.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.340
We're going to show you unique and fun
ideas to add flair to sugar cookies.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.010
Hi, I'm Cricket Azima.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.920
We're going to start with an adorable
recipe called pop art cookies.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.350
Preheat your oven to 375.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.350
Start with a sugar cookie mix.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.800
Add softened butter or margarine, egg,
and for cut out cookies, add flour.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.150
Stir until a dough is formed.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.590
Now you're going to lightly
flour your surface.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.010
Place your dough on your cutting board,
and you're ready to roll.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.720
Roll out the dough until it's
about a quarter inch thick.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.900
Using a three inch circle cookie
cutter, I'm going to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.270
press out my cookies.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.390
Before you put the cookies into the
oven, you're going to take a rounded

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.840
wooden stick and insert into the
side of each cookie so it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.780
looks like a lollipop.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.550
Once you have a stick into each cookie,
you're going to bake the

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.930
cookies for nine to eleven minutes.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.850
Once cooled, it's time
to have fun frosting.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.450
I used some white frosting and
added food coloring to

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.050
make these fun colors.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.690
Now it's time to make the
pop art on your cookies.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.970
I'm going to use some orange frosting,
and I'm going to cover the circle

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.330
completely.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.830
Then I'm going to add some of these
cute blue sprinkles, some yellow.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.020
Ta-dah!

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.900
Isn't that adorable?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.530
To make them extra cute, you can serve
the pop art cookies in color

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.740
coordinated glasses filled
with jelly beans.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.390
Or you can even stick them into cupcakes
and write letters on them.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.760
Spell out a name.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.450
Have fun with your pop art cookies.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.810
The next fun sugar cookie recipe
combines one of my favorite cookies

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.190
with one of my favorite breakfast
foods, cinnamon rolls.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.510
These cinna-spin cookies are really fun
to make an even more fun to eat.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.820
Preheat your oven to 375.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.110
Once again, we'll use the same sugar
cookie dough we've been using.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.870
Add softened butter or margarine,
egg, and cinnamon.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.300
After your dough is made, you're going
to roll about a tablespoon of dough

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.330
into a long rope about
five inches long.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.940
Just simply dip into
a line of cinnamon.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.970
Then you're going to carefully roll
your cookie so it looks like a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.470
cinnamon roll.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.960
You'll place each cookie on a cookie
sheet about two inches apart.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.630
Then you'll put them in the oven
and bake them for about

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.430
seven to ten minutes.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.900
I've made a glaze with some powdered
sugar and milk, and I'm drizzling the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.140
cookies until they look even
more like cinnamon rolls.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.300
So that's it--

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.210
fun, easy, new ways to reinvent
the classic sugar cookie.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.610

ideas from Betty Crocker with Howdini.
