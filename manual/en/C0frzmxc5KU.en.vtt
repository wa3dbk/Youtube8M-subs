00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.190
SAL KHAN: This is Sal here.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.606
And I'm at Stanford
Medical School

00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:05.160
with Dr. Andy Connolly,
who's a pathologist here.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.040
And this is the
second in our series

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.683
on looking at some
of these slides.

00:00:08.683 --> 00:00:09.516
ANDY CONNOLLY: Yeah.

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:12.780
So we left off last time,
Sal, looking at this piece

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.660
here, which is normal colon.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.730
We had said this is an
example of what you'd

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.006
see at the edge of a specimen
released for colon cancer.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:22.880
Now I'm going to click
to the next one, which

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.856
is a slightly more
worrisome area if you're

00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:27.880
a pathologist looking
through the colon.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.070
And so I'm going to zoom
in just a little bit here

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
to take a look at these.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.582
SAL KHAN: Looks very worrisome
compared to the last one.

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:37.040
ANDY CONNOLLY: And
so what we don't

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.340
like about it is
we saw before this

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.470
is what the normal
gland looks like.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.020
It's a test tube
shape and down, and it

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.750
has these cells
which are normal.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.480
Now all of a sudden it
looks a little thicker here,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.070
and what catches our eye
also is these aren't just

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.300
straight test tubes anymore.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.800
They divide.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.160
They kind of go in
and out like that.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.250
SAL KHAN: But they
still are test tubes.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.530
Following up what we
said in the last video

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.460
is that they just look
like circles as opposed

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.239
to test tubes because we're
taking a cross-section,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.430
because they're kind of popping
out of the two dimensions.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.770
ANDY CONNOLLY: That's right.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.970
But although, when you
come from the surface here

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.234
and you go down, they
normally should never branch.

00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:11.900
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.858
ANDY CONNOLLY: And so
these ones are branching,

00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:14.860
and that's always bad.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.446
And then you can
see the way-- when

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:19.070
you're putting a
cross-section, there's

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.830
normally just a little
hole in the middle.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.830
And that's where the
mucin-- you can even see it

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.754
spilling out there.

00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:25.337
SAL KHAN: Wow.

00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:26.020
You can.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.270
ANDY CONNOLLY: So you
can see it just kind

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.610
of coming right out of there.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.040
This one here looks different.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.880
And what it is, it's piled up.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.790
And so it's a little
bit bigger around.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.690
And in order for these
cells, more cells--

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.350
they're going to be all
piled up and going like this,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.680
and they even branch.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.400
And so what this
is, is that we look

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.140
a little more closely
at this piece.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.820
And we say, hmm, I
wonder if that's cancer.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.500
Could it be pre-cancer,
or is this just

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.230
an area of irritation?

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.070
And a common response of
the body to irritation

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.940
is some sort of change.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.772
And like we were saying before,
epithelium is the top layer.

00:02:01.772 --> 00:02:02.730
SAL KHAN: Right, right.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.150
The stuff that's facing
the outside world.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.990
ANDY CONNOLLY: Facing
the outside world.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.281
So if it's irritated, often
the epithelium will change.

00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:10.404
And in this case, it's changing
by undergoing more growth.

00:02:10.404 --> 00:02:12.570
SAL KHAN: Is it always--
even if it's non-cancerous,

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.574
is it going to be a higher
likelihood that it's

00:02:14.574 --> 00:02:16.240
going to become
cancerous in the future?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.073
ANDY CONNOLLY: A lot
of cancers, it appears,

00:02:18.073 --> 00:02:21.870
in the body come from parts
of the body that are either

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.755
irritated or have some sort
of environmental challenges

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:26.792
that are constantly at them.

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:29.250
And part of that is because
there's a lot of cell division.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.560
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.351
ANDY CONNOLLY: If you
keep dividing a cell,

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.190
you might have
errors in the DNA.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.514
SAL KHAN: So that's why
skin cells, bowel cells--

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:36.680
ANDY CONNOLLY: That's right.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.804
And even things like liver.

00:02:37.804 --> 00:02:39.400
If you keep damaging
your liver, you

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.080
might have ongoing
things and liver cancer.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.150
So when you're looking
here, the pathologist

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.980
would look at this area
and say, well, it's

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.880
a dividing gland that's kind
of thrown up in these areas.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.480
But largely, they're
still making mucin

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.350
or they're this type here,
which looks like it's tall

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.634
and probably absorbing water.

00:02:57.634 --> 00:02:58.300
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.840
So even within these
test tubes-- well,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.090
they're not really test tubes.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.700
But inside of these
vessels, there

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.394
are also still the
absorptive cells as well.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:07.560
ANDY CONNOLLY: That's right.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.694
So here, we would sign
this off as hyperplasia.

00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:12.610
SAL KHAN: Hyperplasia.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.280
So hyper, like too
much of something.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.620
ANDY CONNOLLY: Yes.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.670
SAL KHAN: And plasia?

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.590
ANDY CONNOLLY: Growth.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.800
SAL KHAN: See.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.758
ANDY CONNOLLY: And so
plasia just means growth.

00:03:18.758 --> 00:03:21.420
And so hyperplasia
means too much growth.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.320
But the important thing is if
you took away the irritant,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.644
it wouldn't do this.

00:03:25.644 --> 00:03:26.310
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.180
ANDY CONNOLLY: So
if you took away

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.600
whatever the irritant
is for the hyperplasia,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.254
it would go back
to being normal.

00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:31.920
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.280
I see.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.170
And that's just
something we know.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.730
ANDY CONNOLLY: That's right.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.229
SAL KHAN: There's
some stimulus that

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:37.234
was causing these
cells to do that.

00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:39.525
It might have been diet,
might have been some chemical.

00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:41.040
It could have been just--

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.730
ANDY CONNOLLY: We're
never really sure

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.271
what, because so
much of it is things

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.280
that just float on through.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.740
So it's really hard to know.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.635
But, yeah, this is probably
too much growth in response

00:03:49.635 --> 00:03:50.260
to an irritant.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.630
SAL KHAN: So it's
possible that it just

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.900
happened to be when this section
of the colon was taken out.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.720
If this was done
a day later maybe,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.930
then maybe this might
have not been there?

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.096
ANDY CONNOLLY: Yeah, probably
take longer than that.

00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:02.290
A couple weeks.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.980
SAL KHAN: A couple
weeks, but it's--

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.540
ANDY CONNOLLY:
Because what happens

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.370
is that the cells
come from the bottom,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.790
and they work their
way up towards the top.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.960
And so eventually the
top would behave--

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.955
SAL KHAN: And so the way
the body works here--

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:13.330
and it's kind of like the
skin-- is this as constant.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.204
These cells are being
used up, because things

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:16.700
are kind of scraping by them.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.001
And they get a lot of use.

00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:18.959
ANDY CONNOLLY: They do.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.250
And in fact, there's a lot
known now about stem cells.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.121
And the stem cells for the
intestine are these guys.

00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:25.870
SAL KHAN: Oh, wow.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.915
So how do you differentiate
the stem cell versus--

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:31.290
ANDY CONNOLLY: At the very
bottom, the bottom hemisphere,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.742
there are going
to be cells there

00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:34.200
that do not have
the open chromatin

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.474
and kind of elongated.

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:36.140
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.723
ANDY CONNOLLY: There
may be ones which

00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:40.546
are endocrine cells, meaning
they release hormones.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.420
And so they may have
hormone-releasing cells.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.192
But in this bottom
hemisphere, that

00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:46.150
turns out to be where
the intestine keeps them.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.515
And these guys are
probably the stem cells.

00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:49.180
SAL KHAN: And stem
cells are cells

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.810
that haven't picked
their jobs yet.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.030
ANDY CONNOLLY: They
haven't, and so there's

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.190
all kinds of stem cells.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.652
There's the stem cell that
can make a whole body, being.

00:04:57.652 --> 00:04:59.110
But then there's
also the kind that

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.594
can make the rest of the colon.

00:05:00.594 --> 00:05:01.260
SAL KHAN: I see.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.010
ANDY CONNOLLY: And so
this one is probably

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.400
the stem cell they can make
the rest of the epithelium,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.650
but these two different kinds.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.610
SAL KHAN: The two
different types, right.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.180
ANDY CONNOLLY: So they're
down here at the bottom.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.880
That's about where
you'd want them.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.090
SAL KHAN: Exactly.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.590
Right.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.670
ANDY CONNOLLY: So
that makes sense.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.090
So down there are your stem
cells, and it grows like that.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.650
So this is a hyperplasia.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.260
So I'd like to show you
next the next step, which

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.220
is a pre-cancer legion.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.650
Should we do that
in another videos?

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.700
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.500
Let's do that in another video.
