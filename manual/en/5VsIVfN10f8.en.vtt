00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.430
The star of the Audi display at the Auto Expo
2014 had to be the A3 sedan for the sheer

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.100
amount of interest it generated.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.579
The A3 was displayed in two options -- the
sedan and the cabriolet, with a 1.8 litre

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.149
turbo-petrol engine and Quattro all-wheel
drive, although that may not be an option

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.190
in the Indian market.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.609
The A3 sedan shares the MQB platform with
the Skoda Octavia, and hence levels of space

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.399
are similar, but fit and finish are top-notch.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.999
It will have 1.8 turbo petrol and 2 litre
diesel engine options when launched later

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.860
this year with a 7-speed dual clutch automatic.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.200
It will be Audi's cheapest sedan in India,
while the open-top cabriolet version will

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.140
appeal to buyers looking for that exclusivity.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.679
Speaking of exclusivity, we got a sneak peek
at the Audi A8L.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.250
This car was not for public display in keeping
it with its exclusivity, but was showcased

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.430
to select clientele with gizmos that can rival
any James Bond flick.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.359
Audi also had the Sport Quattro Concept, a
petrol-electric plug-in hybrid sports car

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.420
that puts out 690 bhp of power combined.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.270
Also on display was the Audi R8 V10 Plus,
one of its most road-friendly sports cars.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.810
In addition, the rest of the sporty Audi range
was on display such as the RS7 sportback which

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.710
is among the more powerful road going sports
sedans that can do 0 to 100 in 3.9 seconds.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.520
The Q Series SUVs were also on display dominated
by the massive Q7.
