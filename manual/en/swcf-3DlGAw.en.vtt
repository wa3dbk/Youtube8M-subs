00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.679
Fujitsu Toshiba IS12T.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.719
Expected September 2011.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.840
Billed as the world's first Windows Phone
7.5 (codenamed "Mango") handset, the Fujitsu

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.800
Toshiba IS12T is heading exclusively to Japan,
but offers a glimpse of what next-generation

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.289
Windows Phones might look like.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.250
Sales of Windows Phone 7 devices so far have
not been a huge success, but then neither

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.500
have they been an absolute disaster. Despite
the "7" in the name, this operating system

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.540
is a complete rewrite from the ground up,
and is effectively at version 1. Although

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.570
version 7.5 is based on the same operating
system, the indications are that this is a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.630
significant improvement. Nokia too are on
board with Windows Phone 7.5, so there's a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.690
good chance that sales will start to pick
up.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.980
Windows Phone 7.5 can view and edit Microsoft
Office documents, it comes with Internet Explorer

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.200
9, can share data through Microsoft's "cloud"
service (Windows Live Skydrive) and the whole

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.229
user interface has been reworked. There's
a smallish but growing application library

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.469
available for Windows Phone 7 too.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.630
Not only is the operating system new, but
the brand on the phones is pretty new too.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.420
Fujitsu Toshiba is (unsurprisingly) a merger
of the mobile phone businesses of Toshiba

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.549
and Fujitsu, although Fujitsu is by far the
largest partner. Fujitsu Toshiba aim to be

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.799
the biggest vendor of mobile handsets in Japan.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.630
Back to the phone itself, this is a pretty
standard slabby affair to look at, although

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.869
if comes in several colours other than black
(including magenta and citrus). On the front

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.419
is a 3.7" 480 x 800 pixel display, on the
back is an impressively high-resolution 13.2

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:03.500
megapixel camera. The IS12T is dustproof and
waterproof, a feature that is common in Japanese

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.630
phones but pretty rare elsewhere. The Fujitsu
Toshiba IS12T supports both CDMA/EVDO and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.719
GSM connectivity, plus WiFi and Bluetooth
2.1.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:24.950
The IS12T weighs about 113 grams and measures
118 x 59 x 11mm. Talktime is about 6 hours

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.569
with up to 11 days standby time. Internal
flash memory is 32GB.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.040
Even more so than Android phones, Windows
Phone 7 (and 7.5) devices are very similar.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.909
So although you won't be able to buy this
handset in Europe or North America, you can

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:47.879
bet that the upcoming crop of WinPho 7.5 smartphones
will not be very different.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.709
The Fujitsu Toshiba IS12T will be available
on the KDDI network in Japan from September

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.239
onwards.
