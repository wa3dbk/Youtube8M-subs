00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.580
Ok in this segment we are going to cover installing
the carpet part two. We already got the passenger

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.260
side in the front pretty well located where
we want it, we just want to make sure this

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.060
side is the same. And remember we've got a
big duct that comes through here, creating

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:20.590
that bulge, check there's my first pivot point
where the snap goes in. There's the second

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.270
you see where the foot pad for your foot rest
goes there. And if you feel around over here,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:35.190
pull it up tight and we got our latch mechanism
for the gasoline door cover and the rear latch.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.440
We go ahead and pull up and clip in the side
rails, if everything lines up good. We've

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:49.750
got our four spots for the seat here, the
wiring is up for the, that be the lock muzzle

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.899
assembly. Some cars would be equipped with
a two wires on your seatbelt. And that's for

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.399
the seatbelt warning light. If your vehicle
has that, locate that wire and pull it through

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:10.409
the necessary hole and have it in place. Everything
lines up around the brake, there's our back

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.940
seat belt on that side, seat belt on this
side, and all we have left do now is just

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.940
make sure the back fastened down or put down
in a crimped position and that's where the

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.409
seat is going to cover it up. So we're just
about there on installing the carpet. When

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.250
it comes to the back, let's get the seat belt
out of the way. Just kind of knock it down

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.610
into place and it's going to be kind of rigid
at first and if you can do this in a real

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.439
warm environment and it will help the carpet
to lay in there and sink and soften up easier

00:01:45.439 --> 00:02:02.619
and faster. Then you come over and clip down
your rails on the doors.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.619
Ok now you got the carpet fastened down on
the back, what we are going to do is follow

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.151
the same chronological order we did taking
everything out. And then putting it back in

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:16.680
in reverse order, so watch our next segment
and we'll cover installing the lock module

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.140
and the release lever handles and the cover
assembly.
