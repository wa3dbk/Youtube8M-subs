music intro

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.819
music intro

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.650
music intro

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.919
So what I'm gonna do first of all is show you the basic way

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.300
that I think, just makes good squash absolutely rock and roll. Take the seeds 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.359
out

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.710
cut these

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.970
into nice little boats, that can go into there.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.250
A little bit of salt and pepper

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.760
I want to get a pestle and mortar and I want a little teaspoon of coriander seeds

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.120
that'll be enough

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.800
little bit of red chilli 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.280
and then I want some cinnamon, cinnamon's really good, little bit of olive oil

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.260
and once all this is smashed up

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.100
just sprinkle that, straight in an oven at about a hundred and eighty celsius for about forty five minutes

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.300
now in here I've got some duck

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.380
rub it over all over, inside and out with salt and pepper put it in the oven for

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.840
two hours and in exactly the same temperature 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.640
for the dressing squeeze in 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.380
the juice of a lime, I'm going to cut that with about

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.370
fifty percent oil, I'm going to hit that oil with a few little 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.860
drips, about a teaspoon of sesame oil and instead of seasoning it with salt

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.170
what I want to do is put

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.720
soy sauce in there and then a teaspoon of unrefined sugar 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.860
I want to grate

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.000
some chilli

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.680
you get a slightly different flavour for
some peculiar reason and also it stops

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.650
all the seeds here and then on the grater again I want about half a garlic

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.470
I've got some nice spring onions here, only about four or five

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.200
slice that up, that goes in the dressing.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810
With this coriander, 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.810
really chunkily chop 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.460
the first half and you can push that to the side and then this lot

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.620
I'm gonna finely slice.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.760
So, once you've chopped it off, get that into the bowl like that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.260
stir it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.580
get everything mix up, pick up 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.080
some of this duck

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.350
like this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.390
put a few of the seeds in here 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.580
put a few of the squash in here

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.330
a handful of the mint

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.520
and coriander and half of that spring onion, lightly dress it with some of these beautiful

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.760
zingy fragrant asian style dressing

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.409
with the tips of your fingers just toss it up, look at that beautiful 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:24.400
I like to squeeze into the plate like that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.309
few nice bits of meat

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.649
and another bit of pumpkin just to big it up because it is all about pumpkin

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:31.489
after all

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.399
few little bits of mint

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:35.639
coriander

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:41.619
spring onions

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.279
and that 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.739
is a really really nice

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.299
asian style 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:49.870
pumpkin warm salad
