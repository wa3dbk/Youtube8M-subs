00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.510
Today on this 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan we're
going to do a test fit of part number RX5079282

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.760
from Rain-X.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.280
This is the latitude windshield wiper blade.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.110
To start off our test fit we're going to go
ahead and remove the original wiper blade.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.349
There's a small tab we have to push then we
can go ahead and slide it off the arm.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.749
Once we have the wiper blade away from the
arm we can see that this is a J style.

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.680
Now there are two kinds of J style arms.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.410
The larger and a smaller one.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.859
This is the larger of the two.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.260
Before we install the new blade we have to
install a new adapter for it.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:01:36.390
The original adapter is for the 
smaller 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.390
J arm.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:51.000
To remove it is easy.
