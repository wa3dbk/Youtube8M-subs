Michael Smith in Maine has an
interesting tattoo

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.830
it's attached to a handgun that appears
to be I in his

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.889
pants are more holstered in his pants

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.570
and I got into a little bit a trouble so
one morning he heard a bunch up city

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.529
workers cutting down trees in his
neighborhood

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.800
it will come up and you didn't like that
so we went outside to confront them and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.029
tell them to basically took tone it down
a little bit

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.150
arm and they immediately called the cops
because they thought that his had to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.609
was a real gun so the authority showed
up

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.540
and they had like assault rifles they
were ready to go when

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.660
up so the main police officers were at
his front door and troopers with

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.809
semi-automatic rifles

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.860
were in his driveway think it no I don't
blame anybody here

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.410
actually blame the guy with it had two
more than anything else like they

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.440
cops get a call if there's a guy with a
gun was being hot stuff

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.980
what do they know it's a tad too they
don't know it yet to offer to come in

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.149
and then hey listen dude if you don't

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.530
shirtless

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.590
what you gonna get by the way the guy
still shirtless when the cop show up

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.890
that's why we have the picture above

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.060
he's incredibly lucky you can get shot
that to looks like he's just so there's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.920
but other cops responded to I I actually
don't win the cops either I mean who

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.320
knows maybe they were they really
thought that was a gun right

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.619
but that tattoo looks like like he's
ready to shoot is decaf

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.710
I like it doesn't bother bro yeah it's
not a particularly clever talk to if you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.340

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.590
big-league put a shirt on before you
confront the authorities

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.840
about anything you thought this guy was
you know top was class

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.460
class act this guy I well-liked is
threatening the workers with the workers

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.430
do whatever

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.610
well dole although I know we're that he
got himself in trouble

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.349
it was up by the way was a tree removal
company so might not have been the state

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.709
workers but nonetheless people cutting
down trees he wasn't a fan

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.120
and my ass for saying he's not a class
act with the gun tattoo is

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.470
Council I known never judge a book by
its cover look I'm

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.220
I immediately think about how you get
discriminated against when you wanna

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.450
play basketball on people think you're
not good enough just by looking at you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.140
breakthrough funny that you're yeah it's
a little mean to

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.300
judge someone based on the way they look
but yeah I mean first impressions

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.620
happened and my first impression is that
he's not

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.000
the classes gentleman this it's not just
the gun

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.330
look at his left arm okay it looks like
there's some pseudo

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.500
I can't tell if that's alright dog eagle
or not

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.800
you see what i'm saying and then there
is some sort of cross there that might

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.409
look like a German cross to

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.510
so this guy and catalase issues UK

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.940
is tattoos and then there's different
kinds it happens
