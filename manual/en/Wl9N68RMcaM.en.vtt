00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.330
Today on this 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix GXP
we are going to install part number MF16726

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.020
from MagnaFlow.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.571
The first thing you do is get underneath the
vehicle and we will spray down the bolts that

00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:26.590
are on the exhaust with some penetrant and
that should hopefully loosen them up.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.380
When a car is a few years, these fasteners
will be rusted pretty well so you may end

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.380
up breaking them.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.080
So be prepared to just replace the fasteners.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.300
Now we are going to leave this nut partially
on for now because we need to hold it up while

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.380
we disassemble the rest of the exhaust.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.010
So we will move on down towards the back of
the vehicle and we will add a strap to help

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.500
hold up the exhaust while we remove the rubber
isolators.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.690
Ok, we are going to spray down the rubber
isolators with some penetrant and go ahead

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.690
and remove them.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.040
It looks like we have them all done on the
passenger side.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.130
Now we will move over to the driver side and
remove those.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.720
1:00
Now we will get an extra set of hands and

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.190
we will go ahead and remove that one bolt
by the catalytic converter and lower everything.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.869
We have our existing exhaust system lying
out.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.920
We will go ahead and lay the pieces to the
MagnaFlow system next to it so we can see

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.130
how everything fits together.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.320
Let us go ahead and start putting the new
stuff up.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.600
We will start off with the resonator.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.340
However, it does not have any reassembled
studs in here.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.210
So we are just going to get new hardware and
just bolt it in place.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.561
Now I am going to keep everything loose for
now.

00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.770
Now we will go ahead and move on to the next
one.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.620
Alright, we will move on to our next piece
right here.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.830
We will go ahead and slide on the isolator
from the old exhaust.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.630
Get a clamp and put it into place.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.140
Now I will move to the T-pipe assembly.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.770
We will start on the muffler now on the passenger
side.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:20.670
We are leaving everything loose for now so
we can make our final 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:35.299
adjustments later.

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:49.159
1:56
