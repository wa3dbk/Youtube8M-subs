“Antioxidant Vitamin Supplements”

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.290
In my 2007 annual review,
I went nuts over nuts.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.629
Cuts our risk of dying from the
#1 killer disease in half, with,

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.250
what, some new expensive miracle drug?

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.080
No, with a handful of nuts every day.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.590
Now, scientists suspect that the
healthfulness of nuts is, in part,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.410
because of their Vitamin E content.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.809
So why not just forget the nuts,
and take the Vitamin E directly?

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.320
Who thinks scientists discovered
that this is a bad idea?

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.719
Who thinks, well, it probably won’t hurt,
but probably won’t help either?

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.170
And who thinks Vitamin E
supplements are a good idea?

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.039
According to this landmark review

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.249
in the Journal of the
American Medical Association,

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.239
Vitamin E supplements
increase all-cause mortality,

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.379
meaning if you take
Vitamin E supplements,

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.630
you live, on average, a shorter life.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.970
We’re in effect paying
to live a shorter life.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.970
Same study, but this time Vitamin A.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.250
Who says Vitamin A supplements
decrease your lifespan?

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.470
How many say they don’t really
affect it one way or another?

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.970
And how many say they
make you live longer?

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.490
Vitamin A supplements
decrease your lifespan.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.550
Ever since Arctic explorers started dying
from Vitamin A overdoses after eating

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.400
the livers of polar bears,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.800
the safe upper limit of intake
has continued to drop,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.960
and indeed, those taking Vitamin A
supplements also live shorter lives.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.570
What about the plant-based source
of Vitamin A—beta carotene?

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.269
Who says shorter life?

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.120
Neither makes it shorter nor longer?

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.420
Makes you live longer?

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.740
And the answer is, shorter life.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.010
With two notable exceptions,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.090
we should try to get our nutrients
from produce, not pills.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.790
The only brand of multivitamin I recommend
is this one [image of vegetables].
