00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.380
Hello everyone it's Ben from Printerbase and
in this video we'll taking a look at the Brother

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.770
MFC-870DW. This is a feature packed colour
inkjet multifunction printer, designed for

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.140
home users, and small offices, giving up to
1,200 pages per month. It's an inkjet printer,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.950
so there's no waiting around for anything
to warm up like there is with a laser printer,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.220
this machine just gets to work. You can print
up to 33ppm on this machine, but it's not

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.570
the performance that impresses me, it's the
sheer number of ways you can connect to it.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.430
USB, ethernet cable, built in Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi
Direct, direct printing from flash storage,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.360
NFC, along with AirPrint, Cortado, Google
Cloud Print and Brother's iPrint and Scan

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.039
support, all in a device that's sensibly priced,
and provides brilliant quality prints. At

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.610
the top of the machine there's a 20 sheet
automatic document feeder that folds away

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.950
nicely into the lid of the flatbed scanner.
Under that there's a touch screen interface

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.130
that allows you to easily access the printer's
functions, and next to that there's a numeric

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.580
keypad, for the printers faxing abilities.
Below that there's the output tray, and a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.950
100 sheet paper tray, good for media weighing
up to 220 grams per square meter. On the left

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.240
there's a panel that comes away to reveal
the USB port for direct printing, as well

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.461
as an NFC chip reader. On the right, a panel
comes away to reveal the ink cartridges. The

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:40.200
starter cartridges that come with this machine
are rated at 300 pages, and there are high

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.650
yield cartridges available, giving up to 600
pages, for cyan, magenta, yellow and black.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.150
We here at printer base always recommend the
high yield cartridges as they give you a low

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.009
cost per page, and an overall lower total
cost of ownership. Another feature this printer

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.590
offers is disk print, where you can print
directly onto printable disks. Either CDs,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.380
DVDs or Blu-rays, perfect for labelling you
photo slide shows, or home movies. If you'd

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.590
like to know anymore just click the logo at
the bottom of the screen, or give has a call.
