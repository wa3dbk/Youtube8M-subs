andy's claiming that the academic of
soldiers suicides

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.810
that has been baffling

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.160
i mean the nation's brightest sar
psychologist at the end so i really am

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.819
what

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.300
is the exact issue 'cause truthfully
there is no issue

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.510
exactly as you know one issue

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.390
they may be the fact that more of them
for the first time since vietnam we have

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.940
tons of people returning from there if
it was o'neill speeches like i said i

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.829
remember yes yeah but there's a lot of
factors there

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.739
exactly b_s_e_ of stuff but basically
ted nugent like psychologist american

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.589
you know that

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.010
she knows why soldiers are committing
suicide

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.630
and that reason is

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.430
because all bottle violates the
constitution

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.220
tigers instead

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.580
i'm sure the leftist blogs are gonna
attack me

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.410

podcast loss was acting on the left this

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.450
youtube video and that was the video
networks yes

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.500
gidget continues

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.729
but i'll tell you

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.830
why more and more warrior heroes of the
military are killing themselves

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.120
because they are an absolute frustration
heartbreak

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.220
at their boss

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.620
their commander in chief

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.900
violates the constitution that that

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.500
the constitution that he has made all
tht u

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.640

through the same competition at the
present

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.880
the vice president and the attorney
general violate

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760
well mister nugent

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.409
i have to say uh... thank you for it not
citing any specific of our any hope of

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.490
obama specific policies

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.390
um...

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.399
we also like to add uh... discussion
about story and raw story added that i

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.060
did not

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.400
military suicides

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.619
began

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.900
uh... setting the annual bc sitting on a
records before about was that the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.899
president

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:19.759
and i did not sell slowed our subsided
even though the iraq war was ended

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:20.609
and uh...

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.659
the national center for veterans that he
is

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.839
i have has interviewed soldiers and
uh...

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.089
busy soldiers who suicide attempts
failed

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.989
the national center veteran studies
found that each individual has a complex

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.459
set of reasons for wanting to end their
life

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.359
um... there's more than ten different
shows doctors in their personal lives

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.299
and the suicide rate was highest among
soldiers who were divorced or separated

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.519
i mean these soldiers go off to war

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.619
they're gone for for years

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:52.389
they come back and the life that they
left is no longer there they also are

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.090
financially protected

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.950
at all

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.099
co yes of course

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.239
are there are recent research points the
potential links between suicide and

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.829
dramatic brain injuries

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.930
caused by exposed on the battlefield

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.109
this we also see a not sports figures
right so he like uh... sia says a lot of

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.580
research behind this

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.930
um...

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.929
another major stress for veterans in
military families

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:20.219
the backlogged for disability claims at
department of veterans affairs

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.419
hundreds of thousands of claims a year
sickly dressed

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.989
as soldiers go without needed supporting
here

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.999
uh... to still hansel and on the top
uh... different uh... bills they try to

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.159
uh...

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.469
be passed to help out

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:35.979
veterans financially

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.709
uh... so i found this article from the
delhi codes that may sixteen th

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.290
twenty twelve so this is

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.739
just lower last year

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.329
and they've listed seven bills that the
g_o_p_ specifically voted against

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.189
that came to help veterans

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.529

republicans

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.829

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:01.629
um...

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.969
this bill will provide job security for
veterans

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.040
who are receiving medical treatment for
injuries suffered while fighting in

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.840
defense

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.989
of their country

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.090
uh... h_r_ one one six eight

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.789
that better to sharing at

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.230
this bill will provide

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.200
assistance to help veterans hook on the
unemployed for their expenses well

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.469
retraining for the car and job market

and placement services

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:36.020

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.930
requiring list of the a websites
organization providing scholarships for

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.770
veterans

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.680
as we basically do nothing more than buy
back the department of better affairs to

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.550
include information about scholarships
for veterans

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.509
the g_o_p_ did not even wanna provide
information

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:51.550
to these veterans

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.360
to help them find out about scholarships
they could receive

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.850
police continues h_r_ one two nine three
disabled veterans home improvement and

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.080
structural alteration greg increase of
act of two thousand nine

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.909
this act

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.570
we've basically supported those who
fought for their country bypassing

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.550
which package passed the house democrats

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.120
was blocked by becoming law by
republicans

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.960
it basically would increase the amount
paid by the v_a_ for disabled out a

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.099
disabled veterans

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.600
for necessary home structural
improvements

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.020
from four thousand one hundred to six
thousand

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.259
eight hundred dollars

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.539

who are for those who are less than
fifty percent disabled

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.080
on basically the veteran lost their land
use of legs in service to the country

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.100
that guy that we would have paid

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.450
for their wheelchair ramp so they can
live at home right widget weakening get

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.720
the public all these people that do din
supports voted against all these things

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.270
than just a had really quickly dead
nugent snorted crystal meth boiled

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.370
himself to keep out of the war in
vietnam out if we had serious gun

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.000
control

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.720
we have less suicide i was alleges that
that's your money bill hartley got his

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.449
morning jog or a dot the rate of
veterans business center a

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.289
which basically would have set up a
veterans business center program within

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.999
the small business administration

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:10.960
which would specialize in such programs
ads grants for service disabled veterans

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.750
which would help them develop business
plans

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.399
and strabismus opportunities

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:18.380
and other words it would basically
create jobs an offer opportunities

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.659
for those who defended our country

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:22.580
and then finally on this list

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.439
is a_t_r_ one one six e the veterans
retraining ac

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:31.040
uh... which would basically have um...

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.740
which basically would had on starting at
the wrong one

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.020
h_r_ two three five two i read the last
week already a charwoman sexy or horny

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.849
it's hard to turn it back to you

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.339
the job creation entrepreneurship that

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:44.759
which would have basically

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.899
combine a number of other bills that
republicans have already blocked

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:49.909
an added a few elements such as

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.629
establishing a veterans business center
program establish a military

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:55.400
entrepreneurship program

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.860
these were all of those basically from
the first half of twenty twelve

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.690
since then there's been a few more bills

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.580
one from jess september

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.039
and republicans block that as well

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.009
um...

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.539
midget

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.680
it's not a bomb a

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.800
committee out there was no bomb is
disregard for the constitution it's

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.930
making me so does become heartbroken by
over the constitution

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.289
not that it's a number of issues

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.459
actually if obama's bills one through
would save soldiers' lives in scumbag

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:27.169
degenerate
