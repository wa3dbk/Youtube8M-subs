00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:11.301
Hi there. Today we are at the Buddy factory because The minister of Transportation is coming to have a look at the new model

00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:13.235
But we have taken a little sneak peek.

00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:45.638
This is like very very secret isn't it ? 

00:00:45.638 --> 00:00:47.438
It's very secret

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:53.220
You can go in first if you like

00:00:58.573 --> 00:01:03.740
I think this is very positive and we at the department is very focused on the electrification of the transportation sector.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.474
As you know we have done a lot in terms of consumer incentives with the taxation system,

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:19.784
free road toll, free ferries transport and the company car taxation that has been reduced by 50% 

00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:22.808
So in that regard the incentives are getting very good.

00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:29.942
And also now we are getting the infrastructure in place with charging spots that people can apply for funds

00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:35.176
to establish from the 1. of June.

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:38.615
But.. 

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.543
The most importat thing is that there are cars available
- Exactly

00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:49.944
It is very interesting that Norway can lead the charge in this sector and we have noticed in the last 6 months

00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:52.445
that it is an enormous interest for it

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.111
Yes

00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:59.179
It is also a huge interest out there what Norway is doing to promote electric cars.

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:05.046
Specially when it comes what we can do to promote it in an industrial sense,

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:09.813
that this is something we can do in Norway, with production and development like we do. 

00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:16.255
To put industry incentives in place can be very interesting going ahead and it will be a thing that can benefit Norway

00:02:16.255 --> 00:02:19.314
Absolutely

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:23.548
I agree 100% and I think what you are doing here is very good.

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:27.848
And we are very proud as well, that Norway can take the lead / be ahead in this sector 

00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:34.682
and when I meet with my colleagues it is clear that this is something that a lot of countries is very focused on

00:02:34.682 --> 00:02:39.216
A lot of these countries will soon ramp up their own productions

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:44.183
and that makes it even more important for Norway to charge ahead to maintain its lead.

00:02:44.183 --> 00:02:48.117
 Both in a production sense and with incentive mechanisms

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:50.650
And we do have all this wonderful hydroelectric power in this country

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.584
and if we can use it to heat our homes, it can also be used in the transportation sector.

00:02:57.584 --> 00:02:59.818
Shall we have a look? 

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:00.851
Yes

00:03:02.462 --> 00:03:08.285
Wow! and it's green!

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.286
Congratulations

00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:18.153
We are very proud

00:03:18.153 --> 00:03:23.387
That I can understand and you have all the reason to. 
Very good

00:03:23.387 --> 00:03:27.054
Can I take a closer look?
-Be my guest

00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:34.988
Is something you have to push to open it here? 
Ah like that

00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:43.822
Let's see
Oh and its quite roomy

00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:47.356
Everything is designed so that it is ready for mass production.

00:03:47.356 --> 00:03:54.223
 So this car can be made in a higher volume than now with a very rational type of production.

00:03:54.223 --> 00:04:03.158
 It is module based that makes it easy to maintain production in Norway.

00:04:03.158 --> 00:04:06.925
So the plan is that we continue our production in Norway

00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:13.025
and if there are any incentives put in place for the industry it makes it even more interesting and viable.

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:23.460
It has a value that the production is kept in Norway in regards to exporting the vehicles to other countries in the E.U

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.142
Then we have to pay attention to how you are doing and we may have to talk again if there are things that we should be.. 

00:04:29.142 --> 00:04:36.132
Yes absolutely and we would very much like to have a good dialogue with you so that we can develop this together.

00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:42.331
Because we believe that this is larger than just our own company since there are others who make EV's in Norway

00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:42.828
Yes

00:04:42.828 --> 00:04:44.528
We look at it from the bigger picture

00:04:44.528 --> 00:04:46.495
Yes when talking about new incentives it will be for everybody in the industry

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:49.696
Yes and it will give Norway the possibility to continue their position in the sector

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:53.500
Absolutely. Very good
