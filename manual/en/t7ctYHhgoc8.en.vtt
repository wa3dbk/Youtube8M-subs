00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.200
My name is Guy Shield 
and I am a professional illustrator.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.740
I am based in Melbourne, 
where I was born and raised.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.180
I work in a small studio 
above an ice-cream shop.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.420
There is something beautiful 
in the most mundane of situations

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.840
If I can find a way to translate that to a page in an interesting composition, then it’s a real thrill for me.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.300
I began drawing as soon 
as I could hold a crayon in my little hand.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.609
I have not really stopped since.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.640
It has always been a big passion of my life.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.069
During long car trips or in exercise books in school, 
I filled up the blank pages with my imagination.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.560
Working could be stressful. 
But as soon as I get to my drawing board,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.500
or if I’m coloring in Photoshop using the Wacom tablet, 
I have a very peaceful mindset.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.160
My style is inspired by graphic novels.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.940
But I also apply fine art techniques, 
with focus on color and depth.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.720
I’ve always been a technical enthusiast.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.000
And technology has really helped me 
to evolve my workflow over many years.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.700
I have been able to try new things out.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.860
I found out what can be achieved with control over color and pen pressure and how to manipulate an image.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.120
For artists we are in a luxury era, technology-wise, 
to be able to play around so much.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.740
We learn how to push things, but also have restraint and really control our pace.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.040
I like having a real physical presence of light, 
whether it’s a ray of light or a diffused background.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.880
There is a relation: everyone gets a sense of warmth or it just pleases people.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.200
I wanted light and color to play a big part in this piece.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000
The eye travels through the composition 
and down the center perspective.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.340
I’ve focused on getting it a little bit lighter and brighter.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:36.160
And I’ve presented a light patch of sun coming through as the main focus, even though there’s so much activity going on around it.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.160
In terms of what’s next for me, 
I’m not 100% sure and I’m OK with that.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.100
As I grow a little bit older, 
I like to tackle new subjects and content.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.820
And I feel like that’s constantly changing. 
My interest is constantly growing and evolving.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.180
I get some really lovely emails from time to time, 
from strangers about artwork they’ve seen.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.760
And they write how they have related to it.
That’s really nice!

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.340
It pleases me to know, that the things I get so much joy out of are enjoyed so much by other people, too.
