00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
is a arrow on their showing you which is

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.580
the top part and which is the bottom

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.620
part so that you don't put in backwards

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.040
so look real close for the partner says

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.550
tub and are either up and right here

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.670
where measure the height of the shower

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.519
head itself the standard height should

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.970
be six foot six and in this case this

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.239
one is shorter so we will have to bring

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.010
the shower head up to bring it up to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:53.880
today's standard

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.360
and six-foot-six it's just about right

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.900
here so when we do reassemble the new

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.990
char valve we will allow for the extra

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.680
riser for the shower head itself and its

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:42.320
people inches

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.880
now before we get started I usually like

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.890
to just kind of lay some of my material

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.310
out and just get some pre pieces that up

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.990
you know just random pieces that are

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.940
already there that I could use and clean

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.369
the valve itself and fittings flex it

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.369
yeah solder this is the local road flux

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:23.680
that I like to use number five

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.540
and usually the street the best solder

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.069
jobs or when you clean the XS flux off

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.129
the outside of the fittings at the pipe

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.739
because we have flux everywhere the flux

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.290
solder will follow all the flux just

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.290
make a message so just clean them and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.640
wipe it down nice the solder joint

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.060
we have our every cloth what i like to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:30.610
use is the fiberglass cloth

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.180
see how easy that just slid right out of

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.720
there

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.550
I usually like to use a little trick

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.430
with the talent players that kind of x8

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.460
be copper tubing so this way i push it

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.560
up to the whole by bx8 will sit sit nice

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.880
and firm and it won't pull out is easy

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.660
so we are working on a vertical solder

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.340
you don't worry have to worry about the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.990
fallout see
