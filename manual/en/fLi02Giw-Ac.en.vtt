00:00:00.432 --> 00:00:03.313
Elidio, Andy e Rabin
will play "Quick Change".

00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:06.044
Every time I say 'change', they
will change the last thing they said.

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:11.757
Today I will also say 'more' to get things
bigger, and 'less' to get things smaller.

00:00:11.757 --> 00:00:17.166
And when I say 'rhyme', you must
rhyme with the last thing you said.

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:22.838
I'll ask a suggestion to the couples
in the audience. Raise your hands...

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:29.041
- How do you call each other?
- He calls me 'boring', I call him 'little wolf'.

00:00:29.403 --> 00:00:32.854
Little wolf? He calls her 'boring',
but I liked "little wolf",

00:00:32.854 --> 00:00:38.995
that's "Quick Change", with 'more',
'less' and 'rhyme', starting now!

00:00:38.995 --> 00:00:42.877
Honey... What time is it?

00:00:44.654 --> 00:00:47.215
- Four forty.
- Change!

00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:48.865
- Four forty-one.
- Change!

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:50.745
- Four forty-two.
- Change!

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:53.295
I don't have my watch, honey.

00:00:53.295 --> 00:00:56.976
- This is very serious...
- Of course it's serious.

00:00:56.976 --> 00:01:00.927
You know that after midnight,
I... I have a transformation.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.248
Full moon...

00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:08.699
- Geraldo...
- Less!

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:11.571
Less!

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.620
Less!

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.610
Geraldo, I hate it when you turn
into wolf, there's fur all over the house,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.650
I told you I don't want
you shedding around here!

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.330
- Then you start to bite the
goddamn chair legs... - Change!

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.810
- Bite the bed legs...
- Change!

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.290
- Bit my leg last time...
- Change!

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.500
- Bit my other leg last time...
- Change!

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.300
- You bit all over our son, you know?
- Change!

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.660
You keep biting your own tail!
Stop it, Geraldo!

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.860
It didn't work last time!

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.460
More!

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.060
More!

00:01:55.362 --> 00:01:58.203
Geraldo, you're pathetic!

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.546
You're such a pain, Geraldo!

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:10.387
- My God! The legends are true!
- Rhyme!

00:02:10.527 --> 00:02:14.049
- My God! I didn't have a clue!
- Rhyme!

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.461
Oh, my God!
A werewolf appeared out of the blue!

00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.441
In São Paulo!

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:28.345
- Suelen! I can't restrain myself!
- So go not restrain yourself outside, okay?

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:31.737
I've had it with all this fur!

00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:33.887
The creature is leaving!

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.399
Who's this four-eyes?

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.099
Four-eyes?
Geraldo, that's a window!

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.170
- It can see me from two miles away!
- There's nothing there, Geraldo.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.540
- That's intriguing!
- I have a sight beyond reach, Suelen!

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.504
- Geraldo, your nails!
- Suelen!

00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:54.702
Less!

00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:56.753
- Suelen!
- Less!

00:02:56.753 --> 00:03:01.615
- Su-su...
- What is it, Geraldo...

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:05.114
- I'll make the apprehension...
- Rhyme!

00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:09.848
- I better pay attention!
- Rhyme!

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:12.699
Oh, the tension!

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.790
- Geraldo, stop that...
- Suelen...

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.602
Maybe we should
make good use of these claws...

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:23.702
- The door is open...
- I'm sick of you, Suelen!

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:25.773
- What?
- Change!

00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:28.054
- How?
- Change!

00:03:28.054 --> 00:03:30.975
- You dog!
- Suelen!

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:36.116
Excuse me! Ma'am, you don't
know what kind of creature...

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:39.507
You have no idea, son,
I'm married to it...

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:43.697
- You're married to the creature?
- Oh, yes, dear Lord...

00:03:43.697 --> 00:03:48.242
- Oh, ma'am... This is a great
discovery for science! - More!

00:03:48.242 --> 00:03:52.890
- Oh, ma'am! This will
change mankind! - More!

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.933
Oh, ma'am! That's the first time
we discover this on the moon,

00:03:56.933 --> 00:04:01.235
ever since man first travelled
from Earth to the moon!

00:04:05.048 --> 00:04:07.317
He does that all the time!

00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.420
You're aware that no one
forced you to do that, right?

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.853
- I know... In desperate times,
we do... - Desperate...

00:04:27.853 --> 00:04:30.233
So many times we had to do
that on this job, right, Bruno?

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:34.103
By the way, I have a question for
the Barbixas. So many years together,

00:04:34.103 --> 00:04:37.925
how many times have you sniffed
each other's private parts?

00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:39.165
- On stage?
- On stage.

00:04:39.165 --> 00:04:41.186
- Just a few on stage...
- And off stage?

00:04:42.137 --> 00:04:45.337
CIA. BARBIXAS DE HUMOR
presented

00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:52.438
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.
