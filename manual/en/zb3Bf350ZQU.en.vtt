00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.849
hello namaste

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.320
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.350
Vahrehvah.com. Today I'm going to show
you

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.980
Masaladar mix pakoda usually i call this Jaldi pakora but looking at all these

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.519
ingredients some of you may say this is
not a quick pakora it's going to take

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.869
some more time but trust me it is a
quick and awesome pakoda

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.680
here I've got some coriander seeds and
the fennel seeds this is going to be our

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.469
very nice flavoring for this pakoda and
then you put this coriander seeds and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.410
fennel seeds in a bowl. In this

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.870
add some of carom seeds for all our
pakoras we love to add carom seeds and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.379
then add besan that is chickpea flour  in
this add salt and add some oil mix it

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.910
See by mixing and making it crumble like
this your pakodas will come crispy

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
huh look at this me trying to use whisk for my pakoda

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.520
huh it's not working out so use your
hands and then this crumble is so that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.000
all this oil gets nicely distributed in
this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
now we're going to add a lot of
ingredients this is kasuri methi

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.869
that is fenugreek leaves

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.650
see i'm going to add a lot of vegetables
even if you have a few of them also

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.090
this is going to work but make sure you
cut the potatoes into juliennes very thin

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.610
juliennes cut all of the vegetable the
same way

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.360
this is bell pepper you know basically I
have raided my refrigerator

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.479
whatever i found i pull them out carrot
even eggplant green chill spinach

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.920
you know i love to use methi leaves in
this since i don't have methi leaves I've

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.090
used the dry

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.750
kasuri methi, spring onion, regular onion, paneer

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.939
just whatever is there in the fridge
will go in this chopped coriander add

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.670
some chili powder and then just mix all
of this and keep it aside for around

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.140
five minutes and after five minutes of
resting

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.590
you know some of the moisture will be
released out by the vegetables but you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.929
know you may need to add some more water
and then just make this into a kind of

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.390
a

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.860
dough that will be good enough to make
our pakodas and then these are ready to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.760
go into the oil

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.780
a lot of people what they do they add more water and make into balls and fry

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.850
after that they remove them out and
press them and then refry see that way

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.470
the pakodas will be a lot more oily so
I always whenever possible whenever I'm

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.459
cooking at home

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.990
I never do double frying when we do for
big parties when we have to fry a lot

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.920
of pakoras we half fry pakoras and then
we refry. But at home

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.340
try and avoid refrying as much as
possible because you don't want your

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.840
pakoras to be a little bit oily

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.370
now you know drop them little bit
thinner and flatter donot make them roundels

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.390
these pakoras

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.230
look at this very nice and when they're
done they'll be nice and crispy

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.519
Dear Friends

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:01.150
look at this also mixed vegetable jaldi
pakora you know it's very easy to get rid

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.290
of all the leftover vegetables and
especially you know when you make this

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.160
even if some of the vegetables are not
so crispy and fresh

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.260
you can still convert them into one of
the delicious preparation by making them

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.260
into these pakoras and

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.290
if you follow this recipe

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:33.260

crispy like this and always have one

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.540
