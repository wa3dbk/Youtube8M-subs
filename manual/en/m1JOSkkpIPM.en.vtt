Hey kids thank you for joining

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.250
today I am learning all about teenage
numbers the last time I saw you we learn

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.599
all about the tens and ones placed

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.660
but I'm having a hard time with numbers
above ten

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.760
would you help me learn more about
teenage numbers

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.849
Awesome! Let's go over to the teacher's
desk

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.009
here on the desk we have some numbers
they start with 11

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.619
and end with 19, these are the numbers
between 10 and 20

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.350
we call these teenage numbers can you
read the numbers with me

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.880
11 12

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.200
13 14 15

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.600
16 17 18

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.510
19

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.120
take a minute and tell me how all these
numbers are alike or what is the same

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.800
about

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.470
all these numbers

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.270
each one of these numbers has the number
one in the front of the two digit number

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.650
what does the number one mean in front
of the two digit number

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.640
it means that there is a 10 inside that
number

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.299
the other number represents how many
ones are leftover

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.990
after the 10

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.409
to better understand this let's take a
look at one of these numbers

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.289
here is the number fourteen and in the
number fourteen we have a one in the

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.229
tens place

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.859
and a four in the ones place.  Another way
to think of this is one ten

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.640
and four extra ones after the 10

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.900
teenage numbers all have a 10 and some
extra ones on the side

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.040
you can see that in the tens place
there's one group of 10

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.730
and in the ones place there are four
extra ones

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.740
there's also another really cool way to
look at these numbers when they expand

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.300
let me show you an awesome way to look
at teenage numbers

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.800
here's the number fourteen you will
notice the tens place is one color

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.810
and the ones place is another color but
watch what happens now

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.380
Wow the number 10 was hiding in the
number fourteen

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.670
in all teenage numbers there will be a 10
hiding in the number

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.390
let's look at

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.860
one more teenage number

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.880
what number is this

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.950
this is the number

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.790
18 and if we find the 10 hiding we will
see

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.080
10 and 8 extra ones

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.770
so the number eighteen is a 10 and 8
ones left over

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.600
great job

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.990
kids you can even make your own cards
just like this one

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.110
we learned today that teenage numbers
are 11 through 19

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.830
and each one of the numbers are made up
of a 10 and ones left over

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.290
so a number like 13 is made up of a ten

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.660
and three ones. These teenage numbers are

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.760
awesome I hope you learned a lot about
teenage numbers like I did.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.330
take care and we will see you next time
goodbye
