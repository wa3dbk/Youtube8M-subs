Hey this is Daniel for an Adorama.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.179
I'm here in the world headquarters in
New York City with the new Lytro ILLUM.

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.809
Whats great about this cameras is it’s got this new technology where the micro lenses

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.800
on the sensor allow you to pick up not just
light, but also depth.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.369
So essentially you can create images where the focal point can change. So you can create

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.310
kind of like a live

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.880
image. Essentially when this things on the
web people can choose

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.260
to click on a foreground object in
your image or background object, and 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.840
the image will actually shift.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.239
So even though it’s got very shallow depth of field, which creates a really beautiful image,

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.520
let’s say on a portrait. I can then click
behind the subject and see what's behind.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.530
Let's say their

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.210
art that they produce or a collection on
the wall. So it's going to be a great

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.980
tool for let’s say editorial portraits 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.379
and those kind of things. So when a lot of
people hear about this technology, the

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.480
first thing they're thinking is,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.760
oh well I don't have to focus anymore. But
that's not really the case. What

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.489
your actually doing is making multiple choices. You’re choosing to focus on certain items within

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.329
your scene, that your

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.230
then you're then going to draw the
viewer through later. It's almost like

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.960
you're shooting a very very short movie.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.850
Not only is this camera gonna be great for
portraiture, where you can get more the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.250
environment in on your subject

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.890
and the shallow depth of field people love,
but also great for still life photographers, 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.130
food photographers. Things where you want to focus on certain point but also the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.350
whole environment is important.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.119
This also can be a great tool for 3D
photographers and people that shoot

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.320
landscapes and wanna show just a huge
depth.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.909
The camera has 8x optical zoom, which is a 30 to 250 millimetre equivalent 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.729
at a constant f/2 aperture. It has 1-3
macro capabilities.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.920
It’s a drive by wire zoom and focus.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.210
There’s also real time depth assistance 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.990
and dynamic focus range histogram. So you figure out where your depth of

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.950
focus is going to be.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.159
You can compose, render and refocus

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.419
for the perfect result.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.840
It has an auto exposure lock, autofocus ISO,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.240
shutter speed and white balance control. You can also program

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.939
the functions of certain dials and
buttons. It has a hot shoe for external flash.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.640
Built in Wi-Fi. It uses SD cards

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.270
and USB3. The image can be posted to social networks

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.340
and the the Lytro online community or

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.610
embedded into HTML 5 in web GL
compatible

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.550
sites and blogs. So I'd like to thank
Lytro for letting us use ILLUM.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.410
