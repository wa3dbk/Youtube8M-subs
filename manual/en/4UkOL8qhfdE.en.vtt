00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.867
(Lydia Lanni) What
are we going to do?

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:02.900
(Darron Gibson) Is that
what we're going to do.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.767
Whoa!

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:05.467
(Lydia Lanni) I don't know!
I got to sit down.

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:06.433
(Darron Gibson) Me too.

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:08.266
(Lydia Lanni) Cass Community
they have a green gym,

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.066
and in those gyms
they have bikes.

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.867
While you're pedaling,
you are creating energy.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.967
(Stacy Leigh) What they are
essentially doing in this room

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:18.266
will help power the machines in
the mud mat room, operated by

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.667
homeless guys who are part of
a vocational training program.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:25.333
(Faith Fowler) The second room
is a document destruction or

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.967
shredding room where we employ
50 developmentally disabled

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:33.600
people to sort and shred paper
and cardboard and X-rays.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.066
I'm Faith Fowler,
senior pastor at

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.800
Cass Community United Methodist
Church and executive director

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.533
at Cass Community Social
Services in Detroit.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.667
At least three groups of people
pedal the bikes here at the

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.967
green gym; some are residents,
people formally living on the

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:51.934
streets and now living in
our transitional shelter.

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:54.533
(Darron Gibson) Well when
I'm working out it's
really a lot of fun.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.333
It's keeping me working
on my cardiovascular.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.567
It's a dual purpose.

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:03.433
(Marcellus Sabra) I work in the
mud mat assembly room,

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:07.100
where we actually take tires,
used tires out of the community,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.400
and we bring them back here and
we make mud mats out of them,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.767
like door mats.

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:14.667
(Faith Fowler) So the fact that
Cass is able to pick up the

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.834
tires at no cost to the
city, 17,000 so far,

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:22.934
and actually turn that into jobs
and keep them out the landfill

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.734
is a terrific proposition.

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:26.834
The second group is
the staff of Cass.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.633
Very often they come over on
lunch hours or after work

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:30.834
or before work.

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:34.066
♪ (music) ♪

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.934
The last group of people
are all volunteers.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:39.934
We see 5,000 volunteers
a year here.

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.066
(Lydia Lanni) The cool
thing about this part of

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.233
Cass' ministry-- it's building
pride for people.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:48.333
It's not about giving a hand
out; it's about helping

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.934
and building up people.

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:56.300
(Delano Gayles) I dream to start
my own family and have my own

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.066
house, you know be
on my own one day.

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:05.667
(Andre Jones) You know since
I have been here I have been

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.367
learning how to become a man.

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:10.734
So it's giving my
integrity back, my dignity
back and pride back.

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:13.767
(Marcellus Sabra) They put me in
a place where I can sit down

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:17.200
and actually evaluate
my situation in life.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.834
I feel I'm on the right track
and I feel like I just need to

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:21.567
stay on that same track.

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:23.900
(Stacy Leigh) Most of
my guys, two years ago

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.300
they were on the streets,
they were probably using.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.600
They were probably suffering
from untreated mental illness

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.867
and today these guys are
on the front lines of the

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:36.233
green revolution, and
they're also learning skills

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:37.867
that make them employable.
