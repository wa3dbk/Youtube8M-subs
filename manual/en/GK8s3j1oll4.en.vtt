00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.492
(light pop music)

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.007
- [Announcer] When you send
your child to Waterloo Schools,

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:11.674
you get limitless opportunities.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.015
- When I look at other
communities in Northeast Iowa,

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:18.120
I think there's no doubt in my mind

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.321
that the Waterloo Schools
are on the cutting edge

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.331
for education and doing
what's best for our students.

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:27.884
- The Career Academies with our kids

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:32.326
being naturally interested
in Math and Sciences and Art,

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:34.951
it's been a very positive
experience for them.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.118
It's very been, very supportive
of their natural abilities.

00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:44.551
- Waterloo Schools really
prepared them for the life

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.398
after they graduated from high school.

00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:48.867
They prepared them to go on to AP classes

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:50.895
whatever their first choice
was to get into college,

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:52.478
they got into them.

00:00:55.044 --> 00:00:58.749
- What I really like is it
prepares them for college

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.156
in a way that I think is
gonna make them competitive

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:07.470
with students from not
just other parts of Iowa

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.637
but all other parts of the
United States and the world.

00:01:14.068 --> 00:01:16.866
- I know that STEM is
something that is going

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.542
to be important for any
child as they prepare

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:22.129
for a future career, and
it really is it's more

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:24.204
than just Science and technology.

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:26.082
It's about developing
critical thinking skills

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:27.499
for our children.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.448
- Basketball, golf, tennis.

00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:35.681
- [Sally] Starting with Lego
leagues and Science clubs,

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:38.107
we have one of the
strongest music programs

00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:38.940
around the state.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.485
Iowa is known for having
strong music programs,

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:46.073
but this area particularly
has excellent vocal and band.

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:48.653
And we've been very pleased
that our boys have stepped

00:01:48.653 --> 00:01:50.337
into leadership positions
and have been given

00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:53.087
an opportunity to try things out.

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.824
- The teachers are very much
in touch with how they're doing

00:01:57.824 --> 00:01:59.399
and really addressing the needs

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.176
of each student individually.

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:03.637
- We got a phone call and ...

00:02:03.637 --> 00:02:05.538
It was kind of cool because
she just said I just want

00:02:05.538 --> 00:02:08.222
to let you guys know how much fun it is

00:02:08.222 --> 00:02:10.362
to have Isaac in class.

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:14.324
- I have received emails from
them with their concerns or,

00:02:14.324 --> 00:02:16.343
or their praises as well.

00:02:16.343 --> 00:02:19.234
And that back and forth
that easy communication

00:02:19.234 --> 00:02:21.940
is just critical when you're raising kids.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.581
- It's good to have that support.

00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:27.124
The same support that they
receive from my wife and I,

00:02:27.124 --> 00:02:31.291
they receive from many other
teachers in high school.

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:34.873
- They're close to home,
being able to walk to school,

00:02:34.873 --> 00:02:36.722
being a safe environment.

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:38.228
- You really get to know
the teachers pretty well

00:02:38.228 --> 00:02:40.835
and even year after year
as your kids move on,

00:02:40.835 --> 00:02:43.584
they remember you and you
know it's first name basis

00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:44.545
with a lot of them.

00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:46.097
- I've always felt very welcomed.

00:02:46.097 --> 00:02:47.997
I've felt like all schools
that we've been involved

00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:50.213
with have been very open-doored.

00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:52.819
They would welcome me in
even if I were just wanting

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.819
to observe my own child.

00:02:55.702 --> 00:02:58.410
- School really encourages
parental involvement

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.638
either through the Parent
Teacher Association or

00:03:02.638 --> 00:03:04.971
through just direct
volunteering in the classroom,

00:03:04.971 --> 00:03:07.362
accompanying the school
on field trips, you know,

00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:08.783
however you want to get involved.

00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:10.013
You're encouraged to do so.

00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:13.133
- Part of his education have
been a big part of that.

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:15.152
Very supportive group of people to try

00:03:15.152 --> 00:03:17.236
to help the teachers and the students.

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:20.478
- The changes in the school
facilities have been amazing,

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:23.108
and it's a dramatic improvement over

00:03:23.108 --> 00:03:24.877
what's been there for many years.

00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:26.994
And it really compliments
the other great things

00:03:26.994 --> 00:03:30.049
that are happening in the
community like with the Downtown,

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.312
the Riverfront.

00:03:31.312 --> 00:03:33.061
Reinvesting into a more livable community

00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:35.061
is what's going on here.

00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:40.273
- I think they've exposed
the children to diversity

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:41.968
because they come from different areas

00:03:41.968 --> 00:03:44.194
and different backgrounds.

00:03:44.194 --> 00:03:47.593
- The diversity of the student
body is really important

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:50.558
to us, and I think that adds something

00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:54.616
to the educational experience
that can't be gained

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:55.783
through books.

00:03:56.983 --> 00:03:58.566
It can't be taught.

00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:01.117
It has to be experienced.

00:04:01.117 --> 00:04:05.703
- Iowans generally value
education very highly.

00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:08.539
We wanna make sure that our
kids are prepared for life

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.081
with, you know, the
best education possible.

00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:14.307
- The one thing that I know
for a fact is that we want

00:04:14.307 --> 00:04:16.733
to produce global citizens.

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:19.028
That diversity is so important because

00:04:19.028 --> 00:04:22.212
in the 21st century people
are going to have to work

00:04:22.212 --> 00:04:24.809
with people from different backgrounds.

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:26.813
- It's just been all positive
all around so we've had,

00:04:26.813 --> 00:04:28.478
we've had great teachers.

00:04:28.478 --> 00:04:29.906
We've had great experiences.

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:32.355
- We are very grateful for
the Waterloo School System.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.747
They taught them the lessons of life.

00:04:34.747 --> 00:04:37.401
- [Announcer] With more
educational opportunities

00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:41.568
and supportive, personal
relationships, the choice is clear.

00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:45.412
Waterloo Community Schools.

00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:48.564
Global thinking, limitless choices.
