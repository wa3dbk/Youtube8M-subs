00:00:00.103 --> 00:00:01.063
- Hey what's up everyone.

00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:02.119
My name is Motoki.

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:03.115
How you guys doing?

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:06.792
Today you guys are joining me in my room.

00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:09.738
Yeah, I have one of those.

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:11.099
The room that I usually film in

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.664
is actually my guest bedroom,

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:15.082
but nobody cares.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.605
Cool. Let's move on.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:19.165
For this video I'm gonna
be talking about school.

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:23.635
Hmm hmm, so much fun.

00:00:23.635 --> 00:00:24.854
Let's be real for a second.

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:26.215
OK, school sucks.

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:28.491
Like, a lot.

00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:29.852
But there are some things about school

00:00:29.852 --> 00:00:32.453
that are not so bad.

00:00:32.453 --> 00:00:33.915
Just to make it clear though,

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:36.557
reasons to hate school,
reasons to like school.

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:38.934
But let's be positive thinkers.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.254
Right now I'm a senior in high school,

00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:41.717
so I've had a lot of years,

00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:43.282
I've had a lot of experience,

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:44.826
I'm basically the principal.

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:45.801
You know, whatever.

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:46.857
People that have already graduated

00:00:46.857 --> 00:00:49.113
always tell them that
school goes by super fast

00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:50.860
and to enjoy it while I can.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.688
So, let's do that.

00:00:52.688 --> 00:00:53.745
I'm gonna be listing off some things

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:55.634
that make school not so bad,

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:57.585
and things to remember
throughout the school year.

00:00:57.585 --> 00:00:58.357
What is that?

00:00:58.357 --> 00:00:59.413
What are you doing?

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:00.002
Get off me.

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:00.774
Get off me.

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:02.359
(tsks and sighs)

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.538
Alright, so something to keep in mind

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:06.890
is that school is great
because it helps us learn.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.353
Now I know that's obvious, OK,

00:01:08.353 --> 00:01:09.856
but seriously, without it,

00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:11.421
we would be idiots.

00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:12.762
We all hate stupid people.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.159
Just imagine how worse it
would be without school.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.211
Ah, no thank you.

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:19.019
Now I get that some classes
that we have to take

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.258
are super unnecessary.

00:01:20.258 --> 00:01:22.879
Like no one needs to know
about the quadratic formula,

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:26.476
or the periodic table of
elephants, or whatever.

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:28.731
But really, school is a
huge learning experience

00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:30.864
for a lot of things,
not just academically,

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:31.941
but socially too.

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:32.672
During the school year,

00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:33.912
try your best to take advantage of all

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:35.781
the extra-curricular
activities that you can.

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:38.178
So I'm talking theater, speech, clubs,

00:01:38.178 --> 00:01:40.616
football, soccer, volleyball.

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:41.673
Even if you're not in them,

00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:43.440
I personally think it's
still fun to go watch

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.700
and support whenever I can.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.431
Get involved.

00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:46.549
Make friends.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.316
Don't be afraid to just get in there.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.775
Just get in there, you.

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:52.603
Get in there, you.

00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:53.558
(laughs)

00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:55.204
I think the biggest
reason why school is fun

00:01:55.204 --> 00:01:56.890
is because of the friends
that you have there.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.353
Unless you don't have friends,

00:01:58.353 --> 00:02:00.913
in which case, loser.

00:02:00.913 --> 00:02:01.766
No, I'm joking.

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:02.843
School lets you chill with friends

00:02:02.843 --> 00:02:03.960
that you might not see as often

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.484
because of everyone's different schedules.

00:02:05.484 --> 00:02:07.267
Something I wish someone
would have told me earlier

00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:09.318
is that you shouldn't worry
about your grades too much.

00:02:09.318 --> 00:02:10.497
They matter, of course.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:11.676
Do as well as you can,

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.342
but don't stress over it.

00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:15.455
I had straight A's my first
two years of high school,

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:18.868
and then my third year I got a B.

00:02:18.868 --> 00:02:19.803
(gasps)

00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:22.281
And of course my mom
thought my life was over.

00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:23.703
I should drop out of high school.

00:02:23.703 --> 00:02:25.146
Blah, blah, blah.

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:27.503
But honestly, I couldn't
have been happier.

00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:29.981
I didn't have to worry about
keeping straight A's anymore.

00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:31.568
Just remember, if you
didn't get the grades

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.742
that you wanted, it's
not the end of the world.

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:35.855
The best advice that I can
give to anyone watching

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.760
is to stop caring so much.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.873
Don't sweat the small
stuff like popularity

00:02:40.873 --> 00:02:42.702
or being liked by everyone.

00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:44.002
It doesn't matter.

00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:46.440
Seriously, school is way too short

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.797
for you to be paranoid about
what people think of you.

00:02:48.797 --> 00:02:50.889
Now I'm not saying it's OK
for you to be an asshole

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.169
and hate everyone.

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.176
I'm saying just don't act
differently for anyone but you.

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:56.030
Wear what you want.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.553
Don't feel pressured to wear something

00:02:57.553 --> 00:02:59.037
because other people are wearing it.

00:02:59.037 --> 00:03:00.438
You do what you wanna do.

00:03:00.438 --> 00:03:03.283
If you wanna wear sweat pants
everyday, wear sweat pants.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:06.412
If you wanna wear yoga
pants, wear yoga pants.

00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:08.362
I hear they're super comfy.

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:09.845
Not that I would know.

00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:12.324
I never worn them before.

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:14.437
What? Huh?

00:03:14.437 --> 00:03:15.981
I can't stress enough for you to do you,

00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:18.581
and to not let other people's
opinions hold you back.

00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:20.491
For example, school dances.

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:22.647
My favorite thing ever, by the way.

00:03:22.647 --> 00:03:25.306
Most people are just standing
around doing nothing,

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:27.054
but me, I'm up in the center

00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:29.898
just busting out my moves.

00:03:29.898 --> 00:03:31.748
(making dance sound effects)

00:03:31.748 --> 00:03:32.336
I don't...

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:33.313
What am I doing?

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.203
Always have fun, be out going,

00:03:35.203 --> 00:03:36.929
try not to be so self-conscious.

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:38.310
If you're ever afraid of looking dumb

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.078
in front of other people, don't,

00:03:40.078 --> 00:03:41.989
because those people are probably too busy

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.268
worrying about looking
dumb in front of you.

00:03:44.884 --> 00:03:46.376
Does that make sense?

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:47.472
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:03:47.472 --> 00:03:48.510
You know what I'm saying.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.463
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:50.174
You know what I'm talking about.

00:03:50.174 --> 00:03:51.332
A pretty important thing to do every day

00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:53.040
is to keep a positive outlook on school

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.278
because if you go in to each day

00:03:54.278 --> 00:03:56.005
thinking about how much you hate school,

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:57.896
you're gonna hate school.

00:03:57.896 --> 00:03:58.769
I'm really bad at that,

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.211
so this year I've been
trying to think about

00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:01.979
how school isn't so bad.

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:05.128
And so far I still hate school.

00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:06.001
So never mind.

00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:07.058
That one doesn't work.

00:04:07.058 --> 00:04:08.785
Maybe it'll work for you though.

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:10.552
Doesn't hurt to try.

00:04:10.552 --> 00:04:12.383
Alright so, that's all that I have.

00:04:12.383 --> 00:04:16.586
Hopefully school will
now suck less for you.

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:18.577
Just do your best to not
let school get you down.

00:04:18.577 --> 00:04:19.899
Think about the good stuff.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:20.935
Ignore everything else.

00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:22.316
OK, so if you enjoyed the video,

00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:24.388
please give me a thumbs
up and leave me a comment

00:04:24.388 --> 00:04:26.319
because I read all of them.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.204
Honestly, I have nothing
else better to do.

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:30.747
Also, don't forget to add me on Snap Chat,

00:04:30.747 --> 00:04:33.105
Twitter, Instagram, all that stuff.

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:34.161
Links in the description.

00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:37.697
We can talk, be friends, and stuff.

00:04:37.697 --> 00:04:39.160
Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.119
I'll see you guys soon.

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:45.119
(calm pop music)

00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:49.792
Just do you best to not
let school get you down.

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:50.950
Think about the good stuff.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.189
Ignore everything else.

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:53.530
Especially the basic (bleep).

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.546
(Bleep) those guys.

00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:55.643
(laughs)

00:04:55.643 --> 00:04:56.289
What?

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:57.000
