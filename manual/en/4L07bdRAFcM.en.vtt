In this video I will talk about black Friday 
What is black Friday When is black Friday how 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:23.033
is black Friday and why 
Black Friday is known as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season.  It has routinely 

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:27.933
been the busiest shopping day of the year 
Black Friday is not a federal holiday 
Some states observe The Day after 

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:43.266
Thanksgiving" as a holiday for state government employees,
 Many non-retail employees and schools have 

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:52.999
both Thanksgiving and the day after off, followed by a weekend, thereby increasing the number of potential shoppers.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.033
Black Friday is the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States
(The fourth Thursday of November), 

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:12.733
For large retail chains like Walmart, their net income is positive starting from January 1, and Black Friday can boost 

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.999
their year to date net profit 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.233
So the name came from the standard accounting practice of using red ink to denote negative values, especially a net loss and use 

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:36.399
black ink to record net profit
Black Friday, under this theory, is the beginning of the period when retailers would no longer have 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:45.400
losses (the red) and instead take in the year's profits (the black) 
Black Friday shopping is known for attracting 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:58.466
aggressive crowds, very long queue with annual reports of assaults, shootings, in an attempt to get the best deal on a product before supplies 

00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:07.599
run out
For many years, it was common for retailers to open at 6:00 a.m., but recent many had crept to 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:23.333
5:00 or even 4:00. This was taken to a new extreme in 2011, when several retailers opened at midnight for the first time. In 2012, Walmart 

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:36.599
and several other retailers announced that they would open most of their stores at 8:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day (except in states where 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:46.366
opening on Thanksgiving is prohibited due to blue laws
And offered promotional sales to kick off the 

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:51.332
holiday shopping season
