Welcome to starting a poster collection. Today
we're going to talk about care and storing

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.870
of your item. Care and storage of your poster
is the most important thing by far. Hands

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.360
down. To maintain it's value and to make sure
that it's value grows over time. The first

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.630
example we're going to use is this Utopia
poster which I showed you earlier. And where

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.640
you can see the damage in it. And basically
this was some form of bug or some, something

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.260
just basically chewed at the corner of this
and this poster deteriorated. It's not like

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.250
somebody could have actually ripped this poster
in this fashion. It's just, this poster was

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.079
not stored well. As you can see on the back
by it's stains it just wasn't stored well.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.440
I myself have a wonderful story of stupidity.
I was smart enough to put my favorite posters

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.421
of mine when I was in school on the wall and
I put them in this gorgeous collage and it

00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:06.620
was absolutely fabulous and it always made
me happy. I would come home and I would look

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:15.010
at this great collage and give homage to what
gave me joy. And of course somebody was in

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.830
my room and they were shaking up something
that was carbonated and of course it went

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.170
everywhere. So all over all of my good quality
posters is, I hate to say it, beer stains.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.320
When you get a good, something that you perceive
to be a good or a great poster, what you should

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.310
do is you should decide how you want to display
it. They have the standard frames out there.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.670
They're very cheap. They usually come with
some form of either glass or Plexiglas or

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.670
something inside that you can use to protect
the face of it. And you can put it up on your

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.190
wall. I would tell you if you're going to
frame it and you truly love it this is something

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.990
you should not do. You get what you pay for.
They're cheap. If you go to the next level

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.390
what you do is you frame your item. And when
you frame your item if you take it to a quality

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.530
framer they give you a lot of choices as to
what you want to do. Do I want a wood frame?

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.640
Do I want a metal frame? How do I want it
framed? Then they'll ask you do you want to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.350
matte it. And what a matte is, is it's basically
a border around the item. And it really just

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.570
brings out the visual of the poster that you're
trying to show off. I mean this is a great

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.920
pride to you. You want to show it off. So
I always like things matted.
