Hi! I'm Nate Savage and welcome to the Blues
Guitar Quick-Start Series. The Blues is an

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.570
incredibly important style of music to learn
really well, especially if you're a guitarist.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.539
It is important on its own and it’s an important
part of other styles of music like country,

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.550
jazz, rock, metal, all of these different
kinds of music.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.889
Think about it, many of the most famous guitar
gods of all time were heavily influenced by

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:52.449
the blues. Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Stevie
Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, you get the idea.

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.210
The blues is kind of a hybrid between a major
tonality and a minor tonality. So, it’s

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.350
really a tone little world and one of the
best things about the blues is you can learn

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.869
just a couple of little things and jump in
and start expressing yourself.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.469
If you learn the blues really well, you're
going to have a really awesome tool and a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.500
color to use in your playing and you can pull
it up in the other styles of music that you

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.600
play whenever it’s appropriate.
There are some things that would be really

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.380
good if you knew before you started this series.
And we're going to be going through everything

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.259
step by step detail, but it would be really
good if you knew your basic bar chords, your

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.049
basic power cords, your shuffle rhythm, note
subdivisions and hammer-ons and pull-offs.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.009
If you need to get up to speed on any of those
things that I mentioned you can check out

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.920
some of my other lessons. It doesn't matter
if you're playing acoustic or electric for

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.820
this series. Everything that we're going to
cover in this series is going to be equally

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.799
important for both.
The goal of this series is going to be to

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.200
get you familiar with the most important things
you're going to need for both blues rhythm

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.259
guitar and blues lead guitar. We're going
to start off by going through the 12-bar blues

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.950
progression, getting you familiar with that
and then we're going to learn some dominant

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.990
seventh chords and how to apply those dominant
seventh chords to the standard 12-bar blues

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.450
progression. From there, we're going to dress
things up a little bit, you're going to learn

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.479
a couple of riffs, rhythm blues riffs to apply
to your 12-bar blues progression too.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.310
With the things you're going to learn in this
series a possibility is for your rhythm blues

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.830
guitar are really going to be limited by the
amount of effort you put in and your own creativity.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.030
Once we get the basics for blues rhythm guitar
that we're going to switch and focus on blues

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.420
lead guitar. We're going to start about learning
the blues scale, and if you know your minor

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.150
pentatonic scales can be pretty easy for you.
All you have to do is add one extra note.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.170
Once you get familiar with the blues scale,
I'm going to teach you how to start choosing

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.350
your notes a little bit better instead of
just randomly playing to the blues scale shape.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.140
After that, I'm going to teach you what turnaround
licks are and how you can incorporate them

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.350
into your playing. And finally, we're going
to start learning how to interject blues lead

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.930
licks into your 12-bar blues riffs that you learned. And of course, just like all the other series

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.730
I do, we're going to have jam tracks for you along the way because it's really important to apply

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.860
everything we are working on to real music.
This is a lot of information and it's really

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.790
up to you to decide how far you want to take
it. The blues to me is probably the style

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.630
of music that crosses the most musical boundaries.
So it’s really important for you to get

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.560
down really well. And the better you get at
the blues, it's going to be awesome because

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.690
not only is your blues playing going to get
better, but all your other playing is going

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.000
to get better too regardless of the style.
In the next lesson we're going to get things

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.340
started by learning the standard 12-bar blues
progression. If you have any questions, you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.520
can leave here in the comments, I'll get back to you. Also, you can e-mail me nate@guitarsystem.com.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.280
See you!
