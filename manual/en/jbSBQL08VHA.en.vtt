Hi I'm Evan from Gregg's Cycles and today
we are going to cover how to remedy a mis-shifting

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.510
derailer or poorly shifting bicycle. The first
thing you want to do is give a general check

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.270
of your gears, just kind of run through them
and see where it's skipping if it's skipping

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.349
at all. It looks like it is not really going
around quite all the way there. One of the

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:31.581
main reasons that your derailer will mis-shift
is due to lack of cable tension. If you can

00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:37.370
pull your cable down that far the easiest
thing to do is just add a little cable tension.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.190
The first thing that you can do is use your
barrel adjuster which is here on your shifter

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.579
or many times will be here on your derailer
and turning the barrel adjuster clockwise

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.519
will add cable tension so you can continue
to add cable tension until the bicycle shifts

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.579
appropriately or however you would like it
so I'll give that a shot and it looks like

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.320
that is a little bit too high now. So you
can turn the barrel counterclockwise to release

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:18.280
some cable tension and that looks good right
there. Many times what can also cause a derailer

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.340
to shift improperly is a bent derailer hanger
which we will cover later. Again another thing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.040
which would cause your derailer to shift improperly
would be too short length of cable housing

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.630
or also too long. If it is way out and curvy
and a lot of cable has to pull through there

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.780
it can get hung up inside there and not shift
properly and also if it is too short then

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.740
the cable will be kind of trying to pull itself
out of the derailer because it is so short.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.860
Another quick fix that you can do is also
if your bike is little bit older it may or

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.400
may not have barrel adjusters so if you can't
seem to find one of those either on the handle

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:04.590
bar or at the derailer, just take your 5 mm
Allen and you would loosen your derailer cable

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.860
anchor screw there and then just pull the
cable through taut with your hand and then

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.390
lock that screw down again and then do the
same task, give it a little more or a little

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:27.050
less based on how well the bike is shifting.
It looks like a little bit too much so give

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:44.660
it just a little bit less.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.340
Great that looks good and that is how you
adjust an improperly shifting derail.
