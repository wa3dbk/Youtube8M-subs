00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:04.899
Hi everyone.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:05.899
Scot Lewis here for Wirefly.

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.570
Today I'm here to unbox the brand new Samsung
Galaxy S4 mini.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.360
Let's go ahead and take a tour around the
box real quick.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.519
It's a nice wood grain box.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.539
Shows what we got there.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.570
We've got the UPCs on the bottom.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.990
That's pretty much it so we'll slide the sleeve
off.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.029
Go ahead and open up our Galaxy S4 mini.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.710
Right off the bat we have the phone.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.950
Take that plastic off.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.460
Inside the box, as always, you have your start
guides and user manuals.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.650
We don't need those.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.830
Looks like a nice, long micro USB charge cable
and Sync cable.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.200
This is your charge block.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.360
It plugs in on the side there.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.509
Then the battery for the Galaxy S4 mini.

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.170
Move the box out of the way.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.180
We'll unpack the battery.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.030
Our battery is a 1,900 milli amp battery.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.040
We'll go ahead and peel this plastic off.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.700
The Galaxy S4 mini, it looks identical to
the Galaxy S4.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.640
This is the regular Galaxy S4, this is the
S4 mini, obviously you can see it's considerably

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.100
smaller and it looks to be about the same
thickness, just in a smaller package.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.200
Let's go ahead and install our battery.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.659
It does have a removable back cover just like
the regular S4.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.299
You have your spot for your micro sim card
as well as a micro SD card.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.340
The micro SD card can be up to a 64 gigabyte
card.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.940
The S4 mini has 16 gigabytes of on-board storage
so you can expand that.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.511
Like I said with up to a 64 gigabyte micro
SD card.

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:10.840
Go ahead and put the battery in, close it
back up.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.739
Charging up the S4 mini is micro USB charge
port here on the bottom.

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.400
The power and sleep button here on the right
side, then on the left side we have the volume

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.439
up and down rocker switch, then up on top
is your standard 3.5 millimeter headphone

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.439
jack.

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.569
Let's go ahead and power it on.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.639
Navigation buttons are down here at the bottom.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.060
Obviously you have your physical key and then
your 2 virtual keys, so back key and your

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.659
menu key, as well as your home button.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:46.019
On the front is a 1.9 megapixel front facing
camera.

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.989
The back camera is an 8 megapixel camera so
it is different than the regular galaxy S4's,

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.019
I believe, 13 megapixel primary camera so
it is slightly smaller.

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.590
But as we all know it's not really about megapixel
count, it's about the quality of the picture

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.590
and a lot of that has to do with the software
the phone is running.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.989
The Galaxy S4 mini is running the Android
4.2.2 our of the box, so Android jellybean.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.510
It's also layered with Samsung's touch wiz
user interface.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.129
If you're a fan of touch wiz you're absolutely
going to be a fan of the Galaxy S4 mini.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.739
Let's get passed all this stuff so we can
go ahead and take a look at what the homescreen

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.819
looks like.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.060
Here we are, it's the homescreen on the Galaxy
S4 mini.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.069
The screen size is a 4.3 inch super AMOLED
display with screen resolution of 540 by 960,

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.400
giving it a pixel density of 256 pix per inch.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.230
It's slightly off from the Galaxy S4's high
definition display.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.629
The S4 mini doesn't quite have a high definition
display but it is still very crisp and very

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.150
clear.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.279
Powering the S4 mini is a Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor.

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:55.819
Which once again is different from the Galaxy
S4 so almost every spec or piece of hardware

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.760
inside the S4 mini is slightly reduced from
the regular S4.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.930
But it is a lower priced phone as well as
a physically smaller phone.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.669
That's a quick look and unboxing for the Galaxy
S4 mini.

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:15.599
We'll be doing some reviews and probably put
the Galaxy S4 mini up against the HTC One

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.760
mini in a smartphone Wirefly smackdown.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.209
We look forward to giving that to you here.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.620
