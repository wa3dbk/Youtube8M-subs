00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
How to Teach the Basics of Treibball with Lucy &amp; Jessie

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:09.001
This new sport involves 8 balls, 2 goal posts and your dog.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:13.002
Dogs are only allowed to move the ball with their nose or shoulders towards the goal.

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:17.453
Each skill needs to be taught separately before being taught together.

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.454
Start by Teaching a Nose Target on Your Hand.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:25.455
Add a verbal cue.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.356
Click and treat only closed mouth touches.

00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:34.357
To Increase the Amount of Pressure for Pushing, Teach Your Dog to Shut a Door

00:00:35.358 --> 00:00:37.358
Click and reward only nose touches.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.359
The tape helps her focus where you want her to touch.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.360
Fade the verbal cue once she has the idea.

00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:56.361
Remove, the tape, a  visual prompt, a little later.

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:04.362
Add a new cue "Push" once she is putting pressure on her nose.

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:08.363
This is the new cue she will use to push the ball.

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:12.364
She wants to use her front foot, so I will be watching for that and not click and treat if she does.

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:17.365
Meanwhile, Teach other Ball Handling Skills: 'go around', 'wait'

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:23.366
If your dog get excited about the sight of the ball, start with something less exciting about the same size.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:27.367
That way, she can learn the new behavior without becoming overexcited.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:35.368
The 'wait' will be changed to 'push' later but I want her to get the idea she needs to stop with the object between us, ideally facing me.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.849
She is also learning to watch for body cues.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.370
Brace the Ball Between Your Legs and Shape a 'Push' Low on the Ball

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:46.371
Shape low pushes separately from hard pushes before combining them.

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:50.222
Using wait time before you click will often get a lower push or a harder push-or both.

00:01:50.223 --> 00:01:54.223
From above you can see how much pressure Lucy nudges the ball with.

00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:55.774
Slow motion

00:01:57.035 --> 00:02:02.535
Since the finished behavior needs the dog to push the ball towards you (and the goal), always shape towards that.

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:07.536
Lucy confidently pushes on a low spot on the ball.

00:02:08.537 --> 00:02:10.937
Use treat placement to line her up for the next push.

00:02:12.388 --> 00:02:15.448
Here are her first attempts before we shaped a harder, lower push.

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.929
They are much more gentle and higher on the ball.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.930
Neither of these are wanted for this game.

00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:28.931
Face different directions to help her learn that pushing towards you is what you want.

00:02:32.932 --> 00:02:38.932
Stabilizing the ball allows you to isolate the dog's movement's in relation to the ball, without the ball moving.

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:43.933
Substitute 'push' for the 'wait' cue wheh the dog is in position.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:48.934
When she is successful with that, start shaping her to push the ball more towards you.

00:02:53.935 --> 00:02:55.935
She pushes the ball directly at me.

00:02:56.936 --> 00:02:58.526
Get the Ball Moving

00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:02.527
At first, don't worry about where on the ball or how hard she pushes.

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:06.998
Just make sure she's successful with a high rate of reinforcement.

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.529
Lucy starts by using the same approach but quickly develops her own style.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.530
Even though she's beside the ball, she goes back to the middle when cued to push.

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:25.531
She discovers she can use her shoulder to control the ball.

00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:31.532
The side to side motion probably comes from her border collie heritage.

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:39.533
Teach Her to Get Around Behind the Ball When It's in a Corner

00:03:41.514 --> 00:03:43.134
Start with the ball a short distance from the  corner.

00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:48.015
Then put it right in the corner so she learns to push it out.

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:51.016
She drops her head for a low push to shove it out.

00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:57.017
Practice both sides.

00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:04.018
Add Distance (by asking for two, three or more pushes before a click and reward).

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.539
A hallway channel helps to guide the ball at first, but fade its use quickly.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.540
Herding the ball seems to come naturally to Lucy.

00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:17.731
I am working on having her follow my arm signals.

00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:26.002
Take it to Different Environments and Surfaces. Start from the beginning.

00:04:28.563 --> 00:04:31.443
We practice low nose pushes before letting the ball go.

00:04:36.444 --> 00:04:39.064
Here's a low push to control the ball.

00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:43.865
Jessie sticks with her technique.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:47.546
With new surfaces and more space, dogs often become more excited.

00:04:49.547 --> 00:04:52.387
Start from the beginning on each new surface and reward only nose pushes.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:05:00.388
Jessie tries pawing. That is not rewarded so she goes back to what works.

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:06.109
Her nose pushes are hard. That's great!

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.750
At this point, I'll click for either hard or low pushes, or both if she offers them.

00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:17.111
But I need to keep my criteria low so she can be successful on the new surface.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.982
Add pushing distance as before,

00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:28.033
and she starts lowering her push point while keeping a hard push.

00:05:30.034 --> 00:05:32.804
Increase YOUR distance from the ball.

00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:37.775
I send Lucy around the ball and back away as she pushes it towards me.

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:41.776
Each session, start a little further back.

00:05:50.227 --> 00:05:54.027
Eventually, Stay Stationary and Send the Dog to the Ball.

00:06:07.778 --> 00:06:09.778
Add Goal Posts

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.639
Because we add a new criteria, we start close.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.040
Add Distance by Backing Away

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:36.041
I ask for more distance than we have trained so far.

00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:41.042
With some help from arm and verbal cues, she eventually targets the ball.

00:06:42.353 --> 00:06:47.043
Her return is more confident as she has more experience with this part of the game.

00:06:52.353 --> 00:06:56.044
Add More Balls and You are on Your Way to Playing Treibball!

00:06:56.045 --> 00:06:59.965
