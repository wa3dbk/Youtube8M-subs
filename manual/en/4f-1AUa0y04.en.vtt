Hey, Chef Kendra here and today we're making
vanilla wafers. I know my Cookaholic friends

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.730
will love this one. Let's get started, add
some cake flour to a large bowl. Then baking

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:30.170
powder goes in. Now a little salt. Up next
is powdered sugar. Now some regular sugar

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.660
goes in. We're going to whisk to combine.
Preheat the oven to 320 degree.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.620
Now I'm adding some coconut oil, you can use
lard if you want, it's your kitchen do what

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:51.280
you want. Butter flavor would overpower the
vanilla here. Now an egg goes in, a little

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.860
water, and some vanilla extract. Stir all
that in really well. Hey, the link to this

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.969
recipe is in the ABOUT section below.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.780
Now we have our dough, we're going to drop
teaspoon sized amounts on our baking sheet

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:17.860
and flatten with our fingers to about 1 Â½
inch in diameter. You want them flat but not

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.700
to flat but you also don't want them too puffy.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.850
Slide them in the preheated oven and bake
them off for 8 -- 12 minutes, keep an eye

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.730
on them because ovens vary. Remove them from
the oven, place on a cooling rack and eat

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.730
them.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:02:07.119
