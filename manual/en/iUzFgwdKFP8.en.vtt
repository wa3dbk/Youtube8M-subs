00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.167
The 9.4 Update will bring only a few changes to the game,

00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:09.767
but they will be significant.

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:16.667
They are: a new battle format, new Strongholds possibilities, and one new historical map: Stalingrad.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.667
Find details in this review!

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.300
The changes in Team Battle mode aren’t just big; they’re huge.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.400
The battle mode itself has changed.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.667
Now it’s called Attack/Defense.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:36.533
As in Assault Mode, one team is attacking, the other is defending.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:41.200
To make chances equal, each team has to protect two bases at the same time.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.533
Base capture points are counted separately, parallel, and are not added together.

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.467
To win, you have to capture just one base.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.733
The team line-ups will become heavier.

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.367
The amount of tier points is now 54.

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:55.700
There are now fixed sets of vehicles.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.400
The sets are: five vehicles of Tier VIII and two of Tier VII, or six vehicles of Tier VIII and one of Tier VI.

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.033
&gt;&gt; Maps

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.733
Meet a new map: Stalingrad.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:11.967
This is a historical map, reflecting the city’s mostly flat layout.

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:19.067
An urban landscape ruined by war stretches across the map—damaged buildings, piles of brick rubble and shell craters.

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:22.167
In some places, the ground is dissected with trenches.

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:24.700
A steep slope stretches along the river.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.267
This makes a very convenient avenue of attack.

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:30.700
A rail road provides the possibility for a defense lodgment.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.267
At the other side of the map are several roads.

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:35.933
This flank is better suited for a fast breakthrough.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.600
At the map centre is a square.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.133
Here we expect to see a lot of severe fire fights.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:44.733
&gt;&gt; Strongholds

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.267
The functionality of Strongholds is expanding.

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.967
Now you can develop Strongholds to level V and beyond.

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:55.967
You can also attack and pillage the Strongholds of other clans.

00:01:56.067 --> 00:02:02.200
Watch the details in a special video, “Guide to Building Strongholds: Level V–X”.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.133
&gt;&gt;Vehicles

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.500
The parameters of the Т-34-3 are changing.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.267
The reload time will be scaled down, from 14.4 to 13.4 seconds.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:19.733
The dispersion while rotating the turret will be reduced by 25%.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:26.167
The AT 15A Tank Destroyer’s hit points are being increased from 850 to 1050

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:29.533
and its maximum battle tier is being decreased to Tier VIII.

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:30.633
That is all.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.000
Good luck on the battlefield!
