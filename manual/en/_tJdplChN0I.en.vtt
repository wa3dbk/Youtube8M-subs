00:00:00.257 --> 00:00:04.235
Many years ago when I was a young mother
with a full-time job,

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.365
I started to develop some serious health
problems including migraine headaches.

00:00:09.647 --> 00:00:11.527
I eventually ended up going to the doctor

00:00:11.527 --> 00:00:16.637
and finally ended up at an allergist,
who told me I was severely allergic

00:00:17.047 --> 00:00:21.807
to many, many basic foods,
such as bread and cheese

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:23.657
and vinegar and things like that.

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:29.355
The method of treating this problem was
that I had to completely abstain

00:00:29.774 --> 00:00:33.274
from any of these foods
because they were, to me, toxic.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:39.919
So, I did. I was really obedient to this.
I followed the diet carefully.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.679
And then I would go back
to have a check-up six months later

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.349
and find that I was now
allergic to more foods.

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:50.682
So, after a year and a half of this,
I was at a point where I just,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.540
I didn't know what to do.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.030
At that time, I met someone
who was a Christian Scientist,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.140
and I had a very strong bias
against Christian Science,

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:03.741
so I hadn't even considered that
as an option.

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:09.316
But now I was getting desperate,
so I decided I would look into it.

00:01:09.972 --> 00:01:14.346
And I began to read the main textbook
by Mary Baker Eddy

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:17.406
called <i>Science and Health with Key
to the Scriptures</i>.

00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:21.646
And within about a few weeks,

00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:25.532
I began to feel a change occurring in me.

00:01:25.532 --> 00:01:30.952
I started to feel safe and secure
and not anxious.

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:34.776
I began to feel actually loved.

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:38.986
That there is a God,
and I'm loved and cared for.

00:01:40.063 --> 00:01:44.343
The interesting thing was that I began
to stop worrying about food.

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.941
I just started to eat normally.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.590
And this was, I'd say,
within a couple months.

00:01:51.598 --> 00:01:52.988
There was nothing wrong any more.

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:55.918
I didn't get the headaches.
I was doing fine.

00:01:56.573 --> 00:01:58.013
It just evaporated.

00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:01.081
I've been eating normally now
for over 25 years.

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:05.514
And I'm just deeply grateful
for what it's teaching me.
