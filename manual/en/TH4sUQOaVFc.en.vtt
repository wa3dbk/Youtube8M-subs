Hi guyyys welcome to another episode of MIMEIKU

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:07.244
Today I'm going to show you guys my foundation routine~

00:00:07.983 --> 00:00:11.000
This Missha BB Cream is my absolute favourite. 

00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:15.852
I'm going to start by dotting it all over my face. 

00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:19.758
Of course if you have great skin you do not 
 need to cover your entire face like me.

00:00:19.758 --> 00:00:24.640
But I have pretty bad skin so I 
 like to do my entire face. 

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:34.272
I'm going to use the Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki 
 brush to blend it all out 

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:37.312
I've seen a lot of beauty gurus using the newer angled 
 brush but personally I'm really happy with this one :)

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:40.574
I feel like it gives a more air-brushed effect than my fingers can

00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:43.592
I just blend it in circular motions. 

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:14.408
If you need more coverage in certain places you 
 can build the coverage as such. 

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:18.714
I'm using the leftover BB cream to give a 
 little more cover to my trouble areas. 

00:01:18.714 --> 00:01:21.370
Of course if you have good skin you don't need to do this!

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.759
BTW you don't need a brush to apply this BB 
 cream, it goes on great just using your fingers!

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:40.300
Now I'm going to use this concealer to conceal 
 all my redness, acne, and undereye circles. 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.320
I usually use a combination of brush/fingers to apply it.

00:01:57.322 --> 00:01:58.240
Not this one...

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:01.610
This one!

00:02:02.475 --> 00:02:04.240
Just using your fingers is totally OK though!

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:18.920
I feel like it's easier to conceal acne using your fingers rather 
 than a brush (of course this depends on you, though!) 

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.400
If you have really good skin or don't like 
 using a lot of make up 

00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:30.600
You can probably get away with just bb cream or just concealer :) 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.740
I just like a more full coverage...especially when I'm filming.

00:03:06.741 --> 00:03:07.900
Next up...let's powder this bb. 

00:03:19.952 --> 00:03:22.920
This is Laura Mercier powder in translucent 

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:27.560
I heard that Laura Mercier is a great brand 
 for sensitive skin, so I'm trying it out!

00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:29.260
Quite like!

00:03:30.913 --> 00:03:34.330
Make sure to brush gently! :) 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.070
This bb cream sticks allllll day but the concealer definitely needs powder! 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.470
Now it should last all day! 

00:03:44.828 --> 00:03:47.380
Finished!

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.490
I..have no idea...what I'm...doing..
