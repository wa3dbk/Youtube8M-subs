Hey everybody!  This is Randy Santel, "Atlas" with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions and proud

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.120
owner of FoodChallenges.com

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:16.565
I'm here with the guy who helped get FoodChallenges.com going

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.780
This will be our 4th team challenge together,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.080
Ramsey "The Mantis" Hilton.  Always excited to have him here!

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.020
We are in Quincey, Illinois at Pop's Pizza taking on their 32 inch Massive Pizza Challenge!

00:00:32.714 --> 00:00:37.434
It's about 13 pounds total, loaded with cheese.  We had to do one topping

00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:42.084
So he went with onions, and I got ham for some additional protein.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.840
We've got one hour to do it.  About 200 teams have tried, only one team has been able to win

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.084
and it was just over 58 minutes.  If we win, we will each get

00:00:53.084 --> 00:00:57.700
a free pizza per month for a year, we'll get the pizza free, and we'll be up on

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.700
their Wall of Fame.  Lets get this challenge started!

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.520
Ramsey is going for win number 157, and I'm going for win number 208!

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.213
Lets get it started!  One, two, three!

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.640
That's you!  Don't you worry!

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.780
He's trying to make me fat over here!

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.280
15 minutes in - not too much left but now we're switching over

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.340
to soda to help get the crust and all the carbs down!

00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:23.241
28:00 - Still have 32 minutes left.  I've been apart of a lot of pizza challenges where they

00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:28.693
say it's about 13 pounds, but this one is definitely up there!

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.460
36:18 - I've been part of many team challenges, and that was by far the biggest!

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.920
You've seen me and him do challenges in under 20 minutes!

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.660
We got the meal free, which was $60.

00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:27.048
Delicious pizza!  I loved the six cheese blend.  We each get a pizza per month for the

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.480
rest of the year!

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.970
Win #208, and win #157!  Thank you guys for watching!
