I'm Andrew from SteadyPost.  In this
video

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.639
I'm going to show you how easy it is for
you to install a fence post

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.710
using these new FenceFins from
SteadyPost

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.119
You only need a few simple tools, not  much more

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.419
than a spade, a  hammer, a tape measure

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.899
and a pen.  You'll also need a stick or
something similar

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.880
to compact the soil.  Also it's a good
idea to wear gloves

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.230
when working.  Let's first attach the
FenceFins to the post.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.450
First things first, I've put a center
line

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.539
down here, like this, that just makes life a bit easier.  And I've made a mark here to show

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:42.989
where the top of the FenceFin is going.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.989
 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.629
I'm just taking care to make sure
the fin is aligned centrally

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.269
down the post using the centre line.  Having got the first fin tacked in

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:04.879
place

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.879
we then add the second fin like this.  Simply turn the post over

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.570
and do the other side.  Next you need to
dig a hole

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.880
to suit your post.  You can use an ordinary
spade

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.880
but I'm using this narrow spade and this
post hole digging tool

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.229
for convenience

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:43.600
once the hole is dug

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.049
just cut a couple of "ears" to clear the fins.  Like this.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.810
 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.179
 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.409
once the "ears" are finished

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.380
the fence post is ready to go in the hole. It's a great idea to use some gravel

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.920
in the base of the hole.  Gravel or a similar
hardcore material

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.920
like this.  Just throw a couple of 
handfuls into the hole

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.660
this is a great idea because it gives
the fence post a firm base to sit on

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.660
and it also allows the base of the fence post to breathe and drain.  Let's try the post in the hole

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.910
That's excellent.  You can actually use
the post to compact the gravel

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.690
like this.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.700
With the post in the correct position
you can now start to replace the soil

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.030
To make sure the base of the post is
held rigidly straightaway

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.340
you can add a bit more gravel or similar 
hardcore material

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.340
to the base of the post like this.  Make sure you compact the soil

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.060
a bit at a time as you go.  To help the
soil compact

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.200
you can add a little water like this

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.630
The compaction process

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.110
is essential if you don't compact the
soil properly your post

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.620
won't be held rigidly. Once you fill the
hole with the soil

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.319
you can then you use your weight to further pack the soil down.  You could also use a

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.030
lump hammer to further compact the soil

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.860
the fence post should be held pretty rigidly straight away like this one is

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.370
the soil will naturally self-compact further
over time

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.969
increasing the rigidity of the post

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.329
as you can see installing a fence post using SteadyPost FenceFins

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.840
is really simple - try using them for
your next fence installation

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.700
I don't think you'll want to go back to the
old methods. You can find out more

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.859
at www.steadypost.co.uk

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.579
the website will also tell you if
there's a stockist

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:10.019
near you
