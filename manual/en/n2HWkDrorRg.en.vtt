00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:05.780
SPEAKER 1: We're in
SFMOMA, and we're

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.655
looking at Frida
Kahlo's portrait, "Frida

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:12.870
and Diego Rivera," from 1931.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.740
SPEAKER 2: So it's
an early Frida Kahlo.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.360
And they were both
in San Francisco,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.787
so it's kind of a wonderful
place to see this painting.

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:21.620
SPEAKER 1: And they
were here because Rivera

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.040
was commissioned to
paint murals here.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.610
He was already an
established painter

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.940
who was famous in
Mexico, had been

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.090
invited to the United States.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.270
SPEAKER 2: He was on the
verge of a major one-person

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.090
exhibition at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.540
And I think that was only
the second solo exhibition

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.582
that the museum had held.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:41.581
SPEAKER 1: That's right.

00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:42.690
The first was of Matisse.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.898
SPEAKER 2: And so that's
quite extraordinary company.

00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:47.106
Just a year or so
later, Abby Rockefeller,

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:49.480
who was involved, of course,
with the founding the Museum

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.200
of Modern Art, had wanted
Picasso and then Matisse

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.620
to create a large
mural in the lobby.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.911
They both declined, but
Rivera was her third choice,

00:00:57.911 --> 00:00:59.535
which was pretty
extraordinary company.

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:00.201
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:01.770
SPEAKER 2: But
this is not Rivera.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.865
This is Frida.

00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:05.660
SPEAKER 1: You know, she
looks so small and diminutive

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.800
next to him, and so delicate.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.700
And I'm sort of struck by
the way she tilts her head

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.170
and looks at us, where
he looks so stocky

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.601
and looks at us straight on.

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.100
SPEAKER 2: And I mean, she's
really depicted him seeing him,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.140
offering him to us as this
incredibly solid figure.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.050
And she floats in a way.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.070
that he doesn't.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.210
He is so rooted.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.200
Those boots are so strong.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.040
And there's something about
the way in which her dress is

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.510
off the floor that gives
her a kind of lightness.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.510
And also the tilt of her
head, as you mentioned.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.176
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:36.176 --> 00:01:39.000
There's curving
forms in that shawl

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.549
that she wears and in the
necklace and in the headband

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:43.840
and in the frills of the skirt.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.440
So she's got this
feminine curviness to her

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.142
that seems really different
than his blockiness, to me.

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:51.850
SPEAKER 2: And there's
a lot of symbolism

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.940
in all of the clothing
that you're talking about.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.230
SPEAKER 1: For both of them.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.146
SPEAKER 2: Absolutely.

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:57.430
So she's referencing
her Mexican heritage.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.890
She's referencing the
folkloric, and, in a sense,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.620
really trying to resurrect
and give a sense of real pride

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.589
and of the importance
of that heritage.

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:07.130
The double portrait,
the way in which

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.520
they are against this
very spare background

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.490
is coming right out of the
colonial Mexican artistic

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.250
tradition, as well.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.040
Diego is represented
with this work shirt

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.936
under a suit, which is an
interesting pairing, because it

00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:22.350
really shows the sense
of the working class,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.414
but also a kind of seriousness.

00:02:24.414 --> 00:02:25.830
SPEAKER 1: His
tradition that he's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.960
coming from of the Mexican mural
painters from the 1920s, who

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.340
are trying to build
an artistic tradition

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.000
on the Mexican Revolution of
creating art for the people,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.380
he's depicted as
a sort of worker.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.600
SPEAKER 2: I'm also
struck by their hands.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.210
Her hand is sort
of light over his.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.560
SPEAKER 1: It almost looks
to me like she's letting go.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.690
Interestingly, he's got the
paint brushes and the pallet,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.645
even though this
is her painting.

00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:53.840
She almost lets go
and looks at us.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.450
And it feels to me like she's
establishing her independence.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.030
Diego is sturdy and not moving.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.850
He's got his hands
there and open for her.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.580
But when she tilts
her head, she's

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.990
got a little movement to her.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.885
She's the one who lifts
her hand and cocks her head

00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:10.337
and looks out at us.

00:03:10.337 --> 00:03:12.420
SPEAKER 2: And if you look
at the bird at the top,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.930
the bird is flying
in with a banner.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.930
As the museum translates
that into English,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.950
it reads, "Here you
see me, Frida Kahlo,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.342
with my beloved
husband, Diego Rivera.

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:26.300
I painted these portraits
in the beautiful city

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.630
of San Francisco, California for
our friend, Mr. Albert Bender.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.510
And it was the month of
April, in the year 1931."

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.920
SPEAKER 1: And Albert Bender was
a founding trustee of SFMOMA,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.590
where we stand.
