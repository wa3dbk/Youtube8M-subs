00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.440
One of the greatest dreams of my life

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.570
was being able to go to a college

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.570
that was not tailored

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.299
to a wheelchair student. I wanted to get

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.929
into the best university that I could

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:25.070
because as most children with SMA,
if not all SMA

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.460
children, we are extremely bright.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.330
It's one of the great ironies of this disease.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.950
Weak muscles,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.340
strong, very strong

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.030
intellect. So I was the president

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.300
of my prep school's

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.670
senior class.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.120
I had great grades. I had fairly
competitive

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.990
SAT scores

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.490
and I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.070
was accepted

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.470
at Duke

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.050
University.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.690
I was the first freshman in a wheelchair
ever accepted

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.800
at Duke

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.530
in nineteen seventy-four. People with
disabilities, especially with

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.530
spinal muscular atrophy, we have to 
devise ways of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.100
adapting for our needs and if 
something did not work,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.880
then we would devise a way that could work. 
You have to be imaginative.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.950
You have to be creative and you cannot
take no for an answer.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.439
The bar exam was

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.460
first of all extremely, extremely

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.310
pressurized.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.280
This is my ticket

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.400
to practice law and if you don't pass
the exam,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.939
then you don't get to practice it

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.070
and so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.140
the first day was a multiple-choice exam

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.350
and i was given extra time

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.410
to write out

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.790
the -- there were thirty

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.549
essays

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.249
or twenty-four essays and I wrote

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:18.139
for eight hours a day

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.659
for three days and so

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.599
as a result of that i really never wrote, i never

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.929
wrote again. It was as if

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.269
I had written all I can write for the bar
examination.
