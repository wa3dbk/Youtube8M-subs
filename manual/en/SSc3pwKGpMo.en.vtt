00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.060
Okay.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.200
So now I'm going to teach you how to place
your left hand on your violin.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.730
In a previous video, I spoke about how to
place your violin on your shoulder the proper

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.880
way.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.580
So once your violin is up and looks beautiful
and it's just in the right position, you put

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.070
up your left hand.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.520
Now, the first thing to think about when you
put up your left hand on your instrument is,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.120
you're putting it on the neck of the violin.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.450
Here's the neck of the violin.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.010
Now the first thing you think about is where
your thumb goes, and what it should look like.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.290
Your thumb should look like this.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.640
For a beginner, you may even want to pick
up something like a sticker, or even like

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.800
one of those corn removers from the pharmacy,
and put it right about there.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.329
And your thumb should point, ever so slightly,
in the direction of the scroll, which is here.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.670
So in this direction.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.841
And the thumb should not be too straight,
but on the straighter side, but relaxed, not

00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:21.539
bent.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.439
On the straighter side, but relaxed.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.429
Then the other thing you have to think about
when placing your left hand, and after thinking

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.520
about the thumb, is the arm.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.090
Your arm needs to be very, very straight.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.850
You don't want the wrist coming out.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.499
You don't want the wrist coming in.

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:53.790
You want it to be perfectly flat like a pancake,
all the way from your elbow to your palm of

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.030
your hand.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.399
And then last but not least are your fingers.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:08.670
Now, depending on which string you're putting
your fingers on, you might want your elbow

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.980
a little bit in, or a little bit out, but
we'll talk about that in another segment.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.760
When you put your fingers down, they need
to be put down right on the very tip of the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.849
fat of the finger.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.850
Not on the nail, and not off the tip.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.689
The tip of the fat of the finger.

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.450
So let's say I'm putting my first finger down
on the A string.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.269
This is the tip of the fat of the finger.

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.730
Second finger.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.330
Third finger.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.829
Fourth finger.

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.370
Now an example of doing it wrong would be
like this.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.769
So you want it to be on the tip of the fat
of the finger, and if you think about that

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.930
everything else is in the right position.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.989
You have a little platform here.

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.819
Here's the platform for the second finger,
platform for the third finger, platform for

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.280
the fourth finger.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.260
If it's like this, there's no platform.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.680
The pizza will fall right off the platform.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.310
So you want it to be nice and tall.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.720
Again, don't move the thumb.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.729
And this is the perfect position for the left
hand.
