00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is the angry comment of the Polish blogger Agness Walewinder.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.900
who recently visited the Philippines and tried Filipino dishes

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.900
Her blog post reached numerous criticisms from etramping.com

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.900
but does her observations had any legit proof?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.900
Let's see what are the comments of culinary and travel experts with this controversy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Cheap, delicious, and savoury...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.900
Carinderia - food stalls offering different viands to go with rice // 
Turo Turo - Street "finger" food

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
...these street foods are a hit among Filipinos.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.900
But according to the Polish blogger/traveler Agness Walewinder...

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
She'd rather go hungry than to eat Filipino street food again..

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.900
In her blog article, she commented that the Filipino food are too salty, sugary and too oily.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.900
She found the fruits sold in markets to be disgusting and did not appear fresh..

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and what's more unacceptable is the poor quality of food stall dishes.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500
After trying out the food, she unfortunately suffered stomachache....

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.000
...diarrhea

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.000
...migraine

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
and even heartburn.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But for a foreigner like Chris, he doesn't get too precious when it comes to eating Filipino street foods.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.900
He have been back and forth here in our country since 2007.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.900
And because he loves cooking and food...

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
He manage to put up his own Youtube channel called "Maputing Cooking"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Im Chris, an Australian who enjoys cooking Filipino food.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.900
You wont believe he's a foreignoy (foreigner/pinoy) because of his fluency in Tagalog language

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What's more interesting is when he's cooking Filipino food.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But for his Youtube channel..

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.000
..everything's homemade and tasted by Chris himself...

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.900
but here in one of the street foods in Makati..

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
he's going to try the Filipino food, street food style!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Ayyy. Delicious!!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Is the owner from Bicol? It seems everything is spicy.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Chris chose.. Tuna Laing (a spicy taro leaves based dish from Bicol region)

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.900
Ginataang langka - unripe jackfruit cooked in coconut milk.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.500
Ginataang Tambakol - Yellowfin tuna cooked in coconut milk (spicy)

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.900
Adobong baboy - pork cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.200
and Sinigang na Baboy - a sour soup native to the Philippines. This particular soup dish uses pork as the main ingredient.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900
He tried one by one..

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.500
and the first is the Sinigang na baboy - sour soup

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I like it because of the intense flavor (sourness)

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.900
...then tries on the coconut based dishes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.900
Then Chris suddenly pulled out a bottle of wine from Australia...

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
He said Filipino dishes go well with the world class wines..

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.900
Lastly, he tasted the Filipino's favorite dish.. the Adobo!

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.000
Chris has no problem eating Filipino street food.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.000
that's why he doesn't have any idea where Agness' article is coming from...

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.000
I was annoyed by it.. I've read the article and I was like...

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.900
Its really important to have the knowledge of which street food stall to go to that is cheap like this place.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But despite their opinion, Filipino food remains a winner with Chris.
