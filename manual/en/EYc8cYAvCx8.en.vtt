00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.470
So let's get to it shall we?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.350
The Backlight Inverter is a part of your TV's
LCD Panel Assembly.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.300
The Backlight Inverter is mounted to the back
of the Panel close to the left edge, and can

be hidden under a metal or plastic cover.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.810

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.580

via small wires or lock into a series of small

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.079
slot connections built into the panel.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:18.509

by hand.

connector and gently remove the ribbon.
