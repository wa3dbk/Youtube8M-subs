00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.100
My name is Gino Perez

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.830
I used to be a professional skateboarder

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.530
Now I'm a painter and a fashion designer.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.930
Yeah, I've been painting for my whole life. 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.440
Dad was a painter

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.360
Mom's a fashion, creative person.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.779
Hope to be doing it as long as I can, you know? 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.319
Still die, trying to figure it out as I go

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.280
I contradict other artists, I make fun of art, 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.440
make fun of like, the seriousness the art
world, even in the clothes.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.200
But influenced by a lot of my father, my family.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.420
You could say they're so real.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.440
When people are offended by your work what does that do to you?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.460
I like it, I love it.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.080
Why? -'Cus I get a reaction.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.600
You know? Art's just for reaction really anyway. That's what it's for.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.900
And so when it doesn't get a reaction?

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.310
Yeah that's when you gotta worry.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.440
Nobody's really an artist. You're just figuring that out.

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.110
You're just doing something throughout your life.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.050
That technically, maybe says
you're an artist you know

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.010
Like 'cus you do it for a living or something.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:21.080
But a true, true artist is somebody that's 100% confident with themselves in every way. 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.800
What's this piece?

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.010
Oh, this is about, uh, Native America.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.510
Indian Casinos, uh...

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.780
Mexican UFOs up top right here. Sombreros. 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.480
Most of my themes are pretty consistent, like:

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.270
Civilization, Mankind, Philosophy.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.800
It's all relative to the human nature.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.060
You know, the human-like experience.
