As gone everyone this is the animate man, but the (lcpn suc) other day I was watching TV

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.829
And I don't do that a lot let me tell you that and I was looking through some of the channels

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.019
You know as best as you do and [I] just happened to stumble upon this one channel in Australia

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.370
We call it, sbs

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.109
Or channel 3 if you prefer and that channel is known for you [know] having all Sorts of international

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.619
Shows and Whatnot, and you won't believe this it was about 9 o'clock and 9 guess. What was on [have] [a] [guess] of it

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.469
Yes, I guess fucking Samurai Champloo

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.259
This anime on Australian TV like what so the opening had just begun

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.149
[I] think it was about 4 or 5 seconds into the opening so it's just you know starting to rock a little bit

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.189
You know it was getting really pumped for [it]

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.219
I was happily listening to the opening and then all of a [sudden] the show start and then the main character came out

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.619
You know if you've seen it before then you know how boss the main character is right his name is Mugen in case you didn't

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.620
know and then

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.710
disappointment just

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.859
Rain down upon me you know why?

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.940
because it was

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.040
[undamped] yes, I know I'm going to be bitching about dubbed anime today

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.859
And you guys might [think] just because you can speak Japanese and whatnot for us. You know [they] can't speak Japanese

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.720
We have to watch dubbed anime

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.099
Well actually you don't because you know there is a thing [called] subbed and may have have you heard of it. It's where they use

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.030
subtitles like Danny in fact if you're watching anime

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.740
Why the hell are you watching it done if you want the original content watch it sucked

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.829
[you] know it's it's it's just so much better

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.390
I'm [gonna] say this loud [and] clear

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.239
but one thing that I really hate [about] dubbed anime is the voices the American voice actors are just so ah

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.169
crap the Japanese voice actors actually sound like they're acting

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.259
The American voice actor sound like they'll picked up off and streets the producers of the anime came up to them when hey do you?

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.259
like voice acting ah

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.229
Yeah, be can you boys this [ain't] about character for us. You know it'd be really cool ah

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.059
Okay, you know as simple as that no training whatsoever

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.909
[cuz] that's what they couldn't [sing] [alone] anyway back to the story

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.839
So samurai Champloo starts up and then [luo] yin starts talk, and it's this terrible American voice actor that has absolutely no talent

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.969
So you know what I did after that I turned the TV off as you do I knew [adult] danny may suck

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.340
But just from watching that it really showed [me] how [much] it actually sucked. So if you're not in my fan

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.549
Don't watch dubbed anime. It's subbed or nothing
