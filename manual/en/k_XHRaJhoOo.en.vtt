&gt;&gt; Hilah: Hey dudes.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.550
I’m Hilah and today on Hilah Cooking we
are going to make Jell-O jigglers.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.420
We’re going to make some holiday-themed
Jell-O jigglers and I know you all probably

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.750
remember these from when you were kids.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.750
I do.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.210
I’ve got some variations for you though
today.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.230
We’re going to do like an icy winter wonderland
looking one and then a red and green for Christmas

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.269
and I’m going to show you a little trick
to make one of them a little bit more grown-up

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.819
friendly if you know what I’m saying.

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.929
So let’s get to it.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:26.929

[Jell-O Jigglers Holiday Recipe]

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.169
&gt;&gt; Hilah: All right.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.440
First thing I’m going to do is spray my
pans with just a little bit of oil.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.440
Super light.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.929
Get the sides and then we will set that aside.

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.770
So it’s ready for us later.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.179
So this first one I’m going to do, we’re
going to use blueberry but I’ve also got

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.850
some mini marshmallows in here and it’s
going to kind of give it a frosty, snowy look.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.539
You will see it later on.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:09.540
So about three cups of miniature marshmallows
and then I’ve got some boiling water and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.150
we’re just going to whisk this together.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.579
I just want to get the Jell-O to dissolve
and then the marshmallows will kind of start

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:17.579
to melt.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.579
OK.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.579
Once your Jell-O is dissolved you will see
the marshmallows are still some little pieces

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:23.590
left, some whole marshmallows.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.870
We’re just going to pour it into our pan
here.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.729
OK, and then go ahead and refrigerate this
one and start on the one for the grown-ups.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.610
For our grown-up one, I’m going to use some
cherry.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.860
You could also use strawberry.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.090
Well, you could really use anything you want
but for this one, we want red and green.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.800
There’s that and some more water.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.890
Then we want to whisk this until it’s combined
and I only put a couple of water in now.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.960
Unlike the other one we did a cup and a fourth.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.479
So once this is all dissolved, we’re going
to add our not-so-secret secret ingredient,

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.320
a little bit of – guess what.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.850
It’s not water.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.770
It’s vodka.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.800
So a little bit of that.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.140
You don’t want to add too much or the Jell-O
won’t set so just doing the quarter cup

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.010
although you could do like up to half a cup
and then three-quarters of cup water.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.830
It’s up to you and we will pour this into
our other pan and go ahead and stick that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.830
in the fridge.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.360
So we will let these both chill for about
two, three hours until it’s set and then

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.330
we will come back and do the second layer.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.160
So a couple of hours later, this is what we’re
looking at.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.160
It’s nice and set.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.200
I’m going to get another package of blue
and I’m using some kind of container with

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.030
a spout here because it’s going to make
it easier when I layer it on there.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.810
OK.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.260
Now when you’re doing a kind of layered
Jell-O thing, it’s going to be a big help

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.790
if you could get a large spoon like this and
kind of use it to pour the Jell-O on really

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.790
gently with the spoon.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.040
It kind of helps to break the fall.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.370
So just hold the spoon upside down and pour
it over the back of the spoon.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.230
It kind of disperses it a little bit so you
don’t end up melting into the cold Jell-O

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.250
at all, if that makes sense.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.290
OK.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.340
Awesome.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.520
Now just back in the fridge for a couple more
hours.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.880
For our red and green, the second layer we’re
going to use lime.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.730
So this kind of ends up tasting like a cherry
lemon [0:03:27] [Phonetic] which is pretty

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.050
good and again just a cup of water, again
with the vodka.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.320
All right.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.900
And then just gently pour it over the spoon
again and you could really do as many layers

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.900
as you want.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.240
I did one earlier with a yellow layer in between
and that was really pretty.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240
Fantastic!

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.960
We’re almost done.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.700
I’m just going to put this back in the fridge
for a couple more hours and let electricity

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.430
do all the work.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.430
OK.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.810
So a couple of hours later and everything
is totally solid.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.780
It kind of looks like an ice skating rink
and that I was just thinking it would be super

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.280
adorable if you could find some little toy
figure skaters or ice skaters.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.291
You could actually just like serve it like
this.

00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:13.620
That would be pretty cute.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.620
OK.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.360
So I’ve got some hot water in this big pan
here from my kettle and you just want to set

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.560
it down in there for 10 or 15 seconds.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.919
Then I’m going to get my little spatula
and just kind of run around the edges to make

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.919
sure we’re not sticking.

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.080
All right.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.979
So once you’re loose around the edges and
everything is loose, loose, loose, we’re

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.860
going to get the cutting board.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.039
Set it on top of there.

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.620
Center it as much as you can and then pick
the whole thing up and grip it really tightly

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.090
like the world’s biggest and hardest sandwich
and then just do a really quick little fliparoo.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.090
Ta-da!

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.060
That is pretty cute.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.060
OK.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.040
Now I’m going to show you how to cut it
into diamond shapes.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.300
That seems like a good little decorative shape
that’s still easy to cut.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.300
OK.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:18.830
So to do diamonds, you want to go diagonally
and then crossways, so not perpendicular.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.800
But see what I mean there?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.210
See what I’m doing here?

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.210
OK.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.210
Cool.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.639
I’m going to show you one of these little
– what these layers look like here.

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.520
Look at that.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.400
Isn’t that neat?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.600
I think it’s cute and then I have the other
ones.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.260
I have already flipped the other ones out
and I cut those up.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.689
So you can kind of arrange them like upside
downside so you get little green and red.

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.460
Anyway, pretty cute.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.469
Also if you wanted to give kids some cookie
cutters and just let them do it themselves,

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.270
then that’s fun too.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.330
So I’m going to try the boozy one.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.610
I’m going to try the grown-up version.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.030
It’s like a vodka cherry lemon [0:06:04]
[Phonetic].

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.419
Pretty good.

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.810
So these are also kind of like Jell-O shots
but you don’t have all the waste of those

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.550
little plastic cups and stuff like that.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.050
So for whatever, fun Christmas party, they’re
very beautiful, like little stained glass.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.050
All right.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.050
Well thank you for watching.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.009
I hope you try this and maybe you come up
with some of your own variations.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.680
There’s also a playlist at the bottom if
you want to check that out with some more

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.490
recipes that use Jell-O.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.930
So have a wonderful holiday everyone and this
lady will talk to you later.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.930
OK.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.930
Bye-bye.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.930
[music]

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:40.930
You should enjoy the doing.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.930
You can't control what's going to happen after
you finish a thing.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.947
If you don't enjoy the doing, that part of
your life is gone and it's not rewarding.
