Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
I'm taking a closer look at these adjustable

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.830
front sway bar end links from SR Performance,
fitting all 2005 and newer Mustangs.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.090
SR Performance has taken the Mustang world
by storm lately with their wide variety of

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.740
high quality performance and suspension components
that fit nicely into just about anyone's budget.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.560
To check out the full selection of SR parts
available for your ride, I highly suggest

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.110
you click the link below to go back to our
site, or if you just want to wait until this

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.350
video is over and then go back to our site,
that's cool too.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.300
Ok, so what are the benefits of going with
an adjustable set of end links for the front

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.409
sway bar?

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:44.129
Well for starters the factory S197 end links
are a known weak spot, and can often fail

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.269
over time, they won't necessarily break per
say, but what does happen is they become extremely

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.049
noisy, and can even bind and pop when suspension
loads change, for instance whenever you go

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.459
over a bump or something like that.

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:01.600
These factory end links get subjected to even
more abuse if you've lowered your ride, due

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.930
to the improper angle that can cause unwanted
load on the front sway bar.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.990
In these two examples I just mentioned the
damaged sway bars could not only lead to poor

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.899
handling, but also a lack of corner stability
basically making the car feel a little loose

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.679
or sloppy in the front.

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.010
Taking a closer look at these links from SR
Performance, I can tell you right off the

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.030
bat that the design is far superior than the
factory end links.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.660
Of course there is that adjustability factor
which I will get into in a second, but just

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.899
the overall construction is very impressive.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.890
These end links also feature these two heim
joints here or rod end bearings as they're

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.659
referred to, which does take the place of
the older, factory ball and socket style joint.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.579
Not only are these less prone to binding,
but they're also much stronger when compared

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.729
to the factory end links, which is really
important if you start adding a stiffer sway

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.369
bar into the mix.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.509
Of course the full adjustability in addition
to the quality construction is what makes

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.460
these end links from SR Performance such a
solid product.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.619
As I mentioned earlier as your ride height
changes, so does the angle on those end links,

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.880
which can cause unwanted stress on the link
itself, and unwanted pressure on that front

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.459
sway bar, which is never a good thing.

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.459
These links from SR Performance allow you
to adjust out all that unwanted pre load on

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.519
the sway bar, which can otherwise hurt your
handling performance.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.130
This is especially important if you're really
into hardcore road racing and you ever want

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.610
to corner balance your ride, which should
ideally be done with the sway bars disconnected,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.760
and then something like these SR Performance
end links should be added to adjust out any

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.930
of that unwanted pre load.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.530
As for the install itself, it really isn't
all that bad and should only take you about

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.421
an hour from start to finish, however the
adjustment part can get a little tricky, so

00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:46.310
that's why we here at American Muscle recommend
getting these installed and adjusted by someone

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.000
who knows what they're doing, either way if
you should have any questions, feel free to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.659
get in touch with us here at American Muscle,
give us a call at 1-855-422-7439 or shoot

us an email at support@AmericanMuscle.com.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.950
So if you're serious about your Mustang's
handling, and you want to improve the weak,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.950
