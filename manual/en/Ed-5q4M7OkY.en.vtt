00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.449
Hey guys, it's Lunden, and every
week in the month of March

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.629
I'm trying to keep you motivated
now that it's cold outside.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.960
So, this month we're doing
four different indoor sports

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.500
that you can't do when the weather
doesn't permit being outside and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
today we're doing indoor cycling.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.440
Hey guys, my name is Katie Alexander,
I'm a Schwinn certified

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.400
spin instructor and we're here today at
the CB Cycle Barn in San Clemente.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.830
Okay, so for those of you that have
never been on a spin bike before

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.550
I'm gonna have Katie give us a few tips on how to
make sure that it's aligned up right for your height

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.190
and body and all that good stuff.
- Stand up straight and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.720
make sure that the saddle is just at
your hip, that looks pretty good.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.870
Cool. 
Now go ahead and jump on.
You can also adjust this saddle

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.800
push it back or forward to your comfort level.
That's not what we're most concerned about.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.750
What we're most concerned about is that at the top of your
pedal stroke - so if you can stop your foot at the top.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.180
That your knee is tracking over your toe. 
So, go ahead and flex your foot. Perfect!

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.089
So, that looks good. And then the newer you are to cycle

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.860
the higher you want your handle bars. So,
you always want your handle bars to be a

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.590
little bit higher than the saddle, but if you're
newer you want them a little bit higher

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.050
that's gonna relieve the pressure on your
lower back and also to strengthen your core.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.580
Awesome! Alright, now that we know
what the saddle, and the handle bars and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.590
everything should be like on the bike for proper
form, we're gonna spin a little bit, guys.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.709
She's my most favorite spin instructor in the whole world,
and how many calories do you think we burned

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.569
in that spin session?
On average you can burn at the minimum about

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.920
500 up to 1000 calories for an hour of spinning.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.509
Awesome!
It's a great low impact cardio.
I was dripping sweat, it was great.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.840
Okay, so we are here on this bike and
I'm going pretty much at the same pace.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.580
What are some ways we can kick it up a notch,
maybe mix up the workout a little bit for those that

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.959
can't go to a spin class?

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.090
Sure, so, if you wanna build your own profile,
you can add resistance by turning the knob.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.890
It will simulate being on a hill, slowing
down your pace. Or you can take

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.920
resistance off and pick up your pace,
simulating going down-hill

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.610
as a sprint.
Awesome! So, as you twist this little knob here it kind of

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.370
slows down the cadence a little bit,
makes you push a little bit harder.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.099
And I'm really feeling it, especially
after taking her class for an hour.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.480
But, one of the greatest things about spin class,
and which makes a really good spin

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.040
instructor is the music.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.360
So, Katie's gonna guide us through a little
bit of the song to kind of show us how you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.230
can mix up your resistance and take
it up a notch while using your music.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.240
Riding the music now, it's getting real.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.620
Alright, so when you have the music on,
music definitely is a great motivator.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.500
I would suggest staying with
the beat of the music and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.640
adding resistance. If you maintain
your cadence and add resistance

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.800
you know that you're always increasing
your wattage, your power expenditure.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.180
Okay, for those at home that don't know what cadence is:
that's as fast as your wheel is turning. Correct?

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.260
Correct! So, go ahead and add some gear.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.680
Hold that pace the same.
Feel it get a little bit harder?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.200
Yes!
Awesome!

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.220
Now, dial back just a bit, pick up your pace

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.480
twice as fast.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.950
Watts stay the same.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.920
All right, add in some resistance.
Simulate that hill.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.260
We're climbing.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.299
Phew, it's heavy.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.370
You can extend your arms,
sit back in the saddle.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.970
Get a little bit...

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.520
... of a deeper workout.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.420
It's deep, that's for sure. Phew!

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.400
Take it on off, let's get out of the saddle.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.540
Phew, try to ride on the beat of the music.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.640
Same pace, little bit slower...

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.640
Add some gear, hold that pace.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.729
Pick it up!

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.240
Phew!

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.820
Extend your arms, hover over the
saddle. Proper form on the bike!

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.740
Shoulders down, hips over the saddle,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.680
weight light in your finger
tips, core engaged.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.680
Phew, sweating yet?
Yeah, just a little bit.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.270
So, as you can see, you can
change your workout based on

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.950
the tempo of the music, the RPMs
of the music, whatever you're

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.350
feeling that day as far as your playlist goes.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.600
Thanks, Katie, for guiding me through
this awesome spin class!

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.870
Absolutely!
If you're interested in taking a spin
class, you should 'cause it burns a lot of calories.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.060
