00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:06.120
I was really attracted to the position of
Vice-Chancellor of Curtin University because

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.400
of the University's strengths. Curtin is regarded as an institution with a strong international

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.400
profile, a reputation for high quality teaching
and learning, great student outcomes and a

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.539
number of areas of genuine research strength.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.009
So those characteristics as a group really
attracted me to the position but I was also

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.260
attracted to the fact that Curtin University
has a strong vision for the future. It's a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.309
bold vision, it's an ambitious vision but
I think it is achievable - that we will be

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.140
an international leader in both education
and research by 2030.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.999
I am originally from Western Australia. My
father's family is from the Margaret River

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:54.730
area and although we left when I was quite
young we spent a lot of our holidays here

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.870
and so it's always a very important part of
my childhood and it's very nice to be back

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.890
in Western Australia.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.600
My early impressions of Curtin are very, very
positive. Everybody's been incredibly welcoming,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.979
which has been very nice. And it's very clear
that staff are hugely committed to what they

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.060
do at Curtin and passionate about the institution and about their work. There is a lot of change

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.729
going on at the moment and, as I've said at
a number of different forums already, I'm very

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.939
supportive of the change. I think the changes
that are in train, are necessary if we are

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.200
to achieve our strategic goals. Nevertheless the changes have to be implemented very

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.840
carefully and very thoughtfully and I'm putting
a lot of time in at the moment to ensure that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.250
is the case.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.500
Three things about myself - they're always
the most difficult questions to answer but

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.439
I can tell you that my husband and children
probably say that one thing people need to

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.140
know is that I'm no good if I haven't had
my coffee in the morning. So I've been very

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.140
pleased to find very good coffee on campus
already. Second thing, I'm sort of an enthusiastic

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.330
cyclist so we've been really pleased to discover
all of these cycle tracks around Perth. So

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.020
really enjoy getting out on the weekend and
having a look around, clearing my head after

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.870
a busy week. And I guess the third thing more
seriously is that really passionate about

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.870
universities. Universities are very important
institutions and you know I really enjoy engaging

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.300
with staff and alumni and working with staff
is just amazing - what diverse things happen

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.750
at universities, and how committed people
are to what they're doing.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.400
I think what I bring to Curtin University
is the fact that I've held a number of different

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.520
roles at another large, comprehensive,
and research intensive university in Australia,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.420
and I think that experience combined with
the talent that is here already, at Curtin,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.370
will mean that we are well positioned to meet
our strategic objectives as an institution.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.260
I hope that people realise that I am accessible, that I am really open to feedback and ideas

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.310
but at the same time I will be driven by clear
plans for the future. I do like to see the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.310
evidence and I'm data driven in terms of my
decision-making but the overriding goal is

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.200
that I'm driven by excellence and impact in everything we do.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.390
I've already received a lot of feedback from
staff and I'm looking forward to receiving

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.070
more comments, ideas through you know many different forums. I see these video posts

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.810
as being a regular feature that I'll be involved
in, and obviously will continue as much as

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.030
I can to get out and about and meet people.
