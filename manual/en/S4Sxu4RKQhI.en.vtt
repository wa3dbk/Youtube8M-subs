00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.660
The Whale Who Ate Everything
by Dan Devoe

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.300
One day a small sized blue whale was swimming
around the sea.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.240
he became very hungry and started to look
for something yummy.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.800
So hungry was the whale... that he ate a rusty
pail.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.200
And the whale got a little bit... bigger!
So hungry was the whale... that he ate the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.980
ABC in Braille.
And the whale got a little bit... bigger!!

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.540
So hungry was the whale... that he ate his
own mail.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.400
And the whale got a little bit... bigger!!!
So hungry was the whale... that he tried to

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.720
eat his own tail.
And to his surprise... he stayed the same

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.760
size
Then the whale went too far...

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.600
He ate a jar.
He ate a guitar.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.060
He ate a chocolate bar.
And he ate a bright red car.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.300
It truly was bizarre.
So the whale got bigger than any whale had

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.780
ever been.
He became so BIG that he could not even swim.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.160
And he became so terribly sad that he lost
his big whale grin

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.940
Then one day an anchor was dragging by.
And even though he had become so BIG the whale

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.380
thought...
"I'll give it a try!"

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.980
But the anchor got stuck inside of the whale.
He p-u-l-l-e-d and he p-u-l-l-e-d and he started

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.580
to flail.
But it was too late the boat put up its sail.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.680
Then something real strange started to happen.
The anchor had hooked all the things within.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.020
And it pulled everything out from his head
to his fin

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.040
Now that small blue whale swims in the sea.
Just eating normal whale food such as algae.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.780
He finds it tasty and it makes him so happy.
THE END.
