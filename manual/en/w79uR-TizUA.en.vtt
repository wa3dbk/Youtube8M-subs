00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:05.021
(Piano music)

00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:36.671
- Hi everyone, it's me Anne,

00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:39.506
today is a Do-It-Yourself Sunday,

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.113
and as you guys probably know by now,

00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:45.210
we will be making some
elegant box clutches.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.645
And I made this one out of a cookie box,

00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:53.428
a macaroon box, and it came
from a really nice pastry shop,

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.254
and I didn't want to throw away the box,

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.968
just because the box was so pretty,

00:00:56.968 --> 00:00:59.584
and I just thought it would
be a waste to throw it away.

00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:02.107
I'm weird like that, I know,
I collect jars and boxes.

00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:05.127
But, anyways, so I finally
came up with an idea

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:09.045
to re-purpose these awesome
boxes that I've been collecting.

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:13.393
And yeah, these are just really
cute, elegant box clutches

00:01:13.393 --> 00:01:16.110
that you see from designers
and department stores,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.346
and I thought this was a
great idea to show you guys

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:21.003
since prom is coming up,

00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:24.193
and wedding season's coming up as well.

00:01:24.193 --> 00:01:26.027
So, if you guys like what you see,

00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:27.873
don't forget to thumbs up for me

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:29.604
and let's get started.

00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:32.347
OK, so let's start with
materials, like usual.

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:34.071
First you would need some boxes.

00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:36.661
Look for something in a size
you would like for a clutch.

00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:40.219
I recommend going with a
good quality and sturdy box.

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.784
For decorating I will
be using acrylic paint,

00:01:42.784 --> 00:01:44.901
and you can choose any
color of your choice.

00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:47.698
You will also need a gloss finish glaze.

00:01:47.698 --> 00:01:52.493
And I will provide all the
links to where you can buy this

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:54.709
on my blog, LifeAnnStyle.com.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.074
I usually put more information on my blog,

00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:58.747
if you guys are wondering.

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:03.093
And a few optional pieces
would be decorating pieces,

00:02:03.093 --> 00:02:06.262
like brooches, decorative
buttons, or rhinestones.

00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:08.603
I found all of these from Etsy.com,

00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:12.477
and I will also provide this
on my blog if you are curious.

00:02:12.997 --> 00:02:14.675
Oh, and one more thing, for the handles

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:18.719
I will be using my leftover
base rings from my last project,

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.002
and then a knuckle ring
that I had sitting around

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.876
in my jewelry box.

00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:26.827
Lastly, you will need a glue
gun to put everything together.

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:29.706
OK, so step 1, if you have a two piece box

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:32.054
with a cover, just like what I have here,

00:02:32.054 --> 00:02:35.452
take the width side of
your cover and cut down

00:02:35.452 --> 00:02:39.680
the two corners, just
like what I'm doing here.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.964
Once you're done, trim that
cut piece along the sides,

00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:45.644
just trim it a little bit in, this way

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:48.436
it will be a lot more
easy when you need to

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:51.184
insert it into the other box.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.514
OK, so step 2, if you have a nice quality

00:02:54.514 --> 00:02:57.840
smooth-looking box, you
can start to paint this

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.509
with a color of your choice.

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.870
If your box have logo that are
visible in contrasting colors

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.052
try using a richer color
that can hide the design.

00:03:07.052 --> 00:03:10.177
Example, white will be
very difficult to cover

00:03:10.177 --> 00:03:14.841
black letterings, so try
a purple or blue instead.

00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:17.180
Paint on about two to three layers

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.027
of your paint, and then make sure

00:03:20.027 --> 00:03:23.055
to let each layer dry for
about 15 to 20 minutes

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:25.110
before painting on the next coat.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.218
By using a brush it will
automatically create brush lines.

00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:30.683
If you paint and stroke
with the brush evenly,

00:03:30.683 --> 00:03:34.620
the lines will look almost
like Saffiano Leather.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.350
The texture really reminds me of

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.074
the Prada Saffiano tote.

00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:40.894
And if you don't like the texture,

00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:43.508
well I'm going to show you
how to cover it later on,

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:46.493
or you can use a brush roller.

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:48.613
OK, so once everything is nice and dry,

00:03:48.613 --> 00:03:50.415
you are ready for step 3.

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:52.768
I like to use a spray
gloss finish for this.

00:03:52.768 --> 00:03:55.911
It makes the paint look
flawless and shiny.

00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:58.691
You will only need to
use two coats of this,

00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.506
but if you want to cover the lines,

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.824
then I would suggest for you to spray this

00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:05.572
over three to four times, and make sure

00:04:05.572 --> 00:04:09.406
after each coat it is dry completely.

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:13.420
Almost done. Step 4, glue the cut part

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.173
of your cover box to the bottom box.

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:20.339
Make sure the glue is on the
inside so it doesn't show.

00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:24.535
OK, so step 5 is the fun part, you get to

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:26.551
decorate this however way you like.

00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.525
I have some brooches, rhinestones here,

00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:31.968
so I'm going to lay it
out and see how I like it.

00:04:31.968 --> 00:04:36.364
Afterward I will start to glue
it on with a hot glue gun.

00:04:40.244 --> 00:04:44.032
Once that part is complete I
am going to glue on the rings.

00:04:44.032 --> 00:04:48.109
And the way you hold this is,
you hold it with the rings

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:49.780
facing downwards, so that way you can

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.047
stick your finger through.

00:04:52.047 --> 00:04:54.938
This will fall if you're
pretty rough with this,

00:04:54.938 --> 00:04:58.027
so let's just assume that
when you're wearing this out

00:04:58.027 --> 00:05:02.439
you're going to act
ladylike and be very gentle,

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.938
so that way these stones don't fall out.

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:06.907
Obviously, if you're rough with this,

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:09.916
they will eventually fall out.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.859
OK, so this last part is optional,

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:14.476
but if you want to add in a lining

00:05:14.476 --> 00:05:18.101
to make it look extra fancy,
you could do this (laughs).

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:22.261
So I basically cut a
rectangle around my box.

00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:26.948
Next what I'm going to do
is fold the raw edges in

00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:31.886
and then glue the fabric
to each end of my box.

00:05:31.886 --> 00:05:34.444
I'm not going to glue the sides in,

00:05:34.444 --> 00:05:38.628
just because it's going to
make the box harder to close.

00:05:38.628 --> 00:05:41.319
So just make sure to
tuck in your raw edges.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.668
And that's all you have to do,

00:05:42.668 --> 00:05:45.831
it will still look very nice.

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:02.886
OK guys, so that's basically a wrap.

00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:04.764
Thank you so much for watching.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.456

00:06:19.868 --> 00:06:21.999

take to you next time, ciao.
