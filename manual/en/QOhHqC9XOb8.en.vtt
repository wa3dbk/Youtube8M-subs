00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Phone rings

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.620
I know, I know, crash. why don't you try and lift it up?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660
What happened?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.800
It moves?!?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200
No, its not moving!

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.300
try

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.820
Oh Come on crash, I was just playing with you!

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.540
Actually, I've hid a lot of things in this telephone body

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.380
which I was able to control with my phone

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.940
You want to see?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.240
Inside this, there is already a cellphone...

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.980
which I've connected to a sensor...

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.360
this sensor converts sound energy into electrical energy...

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.120
using this microprocessor...

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.740
which in turn is connected to two motors

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.540
which are connected to the wheels

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.340
I had set this phone on "auto answer"

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.780
which means after two rings, it accepts the phone call

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.240
every keypad key has a different tone

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.340
which this sensor picks up

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.060
and this converts each keytone into a different movement

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.660
for this little robot

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.440
I have already preprogrammed some of the key functions in this microprocessor unit

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.940
like when I press "2" on my phone

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.460
the robot moves ahead

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.100
and when i press "3" or "5" the robot moves left or right

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.400
Let me demonstrate

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020
Now i will press "2" to make it go straight

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400
now"3" to make it turn

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.380
"5" to make it turn again

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.940
to control this robot i don't need to be close to it

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.220
I , can control it with the cellphone network

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.340
I could be anywhere around the world and I could still control this

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.440
So this was a cool gadget from the FAQ Lab

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.380
A cellphone controlled robot
