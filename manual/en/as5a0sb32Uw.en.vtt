Hello, it's Kinoshita Yuka

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.660
Today I'll be eating instant ramen I bought from my trip to Okinawa.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.660
It's tonkotsu (pork) ramen made from special Okinawan pork.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.340
and today I'll eat 5 packs of this!

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.060
I also bought rafute (braised pork bellies)

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.860
and I will use it as a topping to my ramen today,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.540
along with 5 of these eggs...

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.040
I kinda screwed up when I was cooking them

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.660
They're very runny so I will add it without cutting them

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.560
Also green onion, bean sprouts, and some vegetables will be added

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.880
Mmm looks pretty good. I will warm it up

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.640
I'll only be using 1 pack of sauce

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.660
Ok, it's done!

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.440
I'll add the toppings now

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.060
The rafute smells really good

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.280
Voila! It's finished!

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.040
It looks pretty delicious

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.280
I will weigh it

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.440
its 3.6kg &lt;subtracting the weight of the plate&gt; its 2.7kg

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.980
Itadakimasu!

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.020
Yesterday I had tonkotsu instant ramen as well

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.060
I don't get tired of tonkotsu ramen &lt;I'm guessing couldn't quite distinguish what she said&gt;

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.460
Mmm its got the nice pork aroma of tonkotsu,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.880
Making it really in your face about how tonkotsu this ramen is.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.380
Oishii!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.300
I'll eat this rafute

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.440
Oishii!

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.680
I know I ate afute the other day

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.740
but the taste really comes alive on this tonkotsu ramen

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.900
Totally runny egg

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.380
It all tastes so good!!!

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.760
In Okinawa a lot of dishes were prepared using pork

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.440
and since I love pork...

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.520
I was very happy

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.840
It was only 3 days, I wanted to stay there longer like for a month

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.380
I didn't get to set foot in or swim in the ocean either...

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.900
I really really wanted to try scuba diving

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.620
and see the fishes underwater

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.900
Mmm, it's runny

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.320
The last bite of rafute!

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.000
I will add some rice to the soup

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.400
I have 600g leftover so in it goes

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.280
I present to you tonkotsu ramen rice!

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.920
Eating it like this is so good

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.700
You know what... I usually never have leftover rice lol

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.460
When I make it I usually just finish it all off right away

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.540
Just this bit remaining

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.380
Gochisosama desu!

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.660
This tonkotsu ramen from Okinawa was very delicious

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.640
