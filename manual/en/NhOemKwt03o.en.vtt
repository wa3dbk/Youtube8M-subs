bjbj Mike Chang: Hey, what's up guys! Mike
Chang, SixPack Shortcuts. This video is in

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.950
response to an email I got from a viewer at
YouTube asking how do you go ahead and get

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.250
the definition in the middle of your chest.
So how to go ahead and get the definition

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.000
in the middle of your chest, kind of how to
shape it right. Because as you're building

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.880
your chest up a lot of times you are not having
the shape, you're trying to work on different

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.180
areas to kind of bring it out. So the number
one way to do it to get more definition is

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.440
really just to be leaner. So get your body
fat low enough. So this way every single ounce

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.319
of muscle you have in your body appears to
be a lot more defined when you're not really

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:43.920
gaining more muscle; you just have less fat.
But to go ahead and answer your question to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.219
really how to shape your chest, and one of
the best exercise for doing that I ve learned

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:55.299
in the past is using cable, because the angle
of it really go ahead and work a lot differently

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.179
than doing bench press or doing dumbbell presses
or even doing push-ups and things like that.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:06.490
So we are going to try the cable machine.
The setting of cable should be about shoulder

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.900
width. So what you want to do is you want
to have strong it right there, hold it right

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.390
there by your body, you want to take a giant
step forward and your starting position is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.280
going to be just like this. What you want
to do is you want to get down kind of low

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.619
and then you want to open your palms up and
keep your elbows really close to your body

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:34.049
and let your chest go stretch out. Keep your
chest out and then come right back. What this

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.310
does is it really gives your chest a good
stretch and as you come back like this, as

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.390
you're coming over right here it really builds
that inner part of your chest right in here.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.359
So as you're going you're going like this
and it shapes your chest and it kind of gives

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:54.829
it up a real nice round cool shape. So you're
going like this. So you're pumping your chest

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:34.459
up every single time. So let me show you a
few reps. We will go a little heavier here.

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.380
So there you have it guys. That exercise is
going to really create a really good shape

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.171
for your chest. We can incorporate it with
any chest workout. Ideally, you want to do

00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:50.950
it around the end. After you have really exhausted
of the primarily exercises like bench press,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.680
dumbbell flies, dumbbell presses, things like
that. But really good exercise to shape that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.100
chest. For more exercises, tips, and techniques,
