00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.390
Hey guys!

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.560
It’s Phil from SmilingGardener.com.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.880
And today I have something really cool for
you and I’ve learned over the years that,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.350
to me, organic gardening is just one of the
most exciting ways that we can improve our

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.089
health and the health of our family and our
friends and the planet and I just get so excited

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.939
about it that I wanna share it with you.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.490
You know we can grow food, we can have a vegetable
garden, grow flowers, grow beautiful trees

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:33.130
and attracts butterflies and bees and birds
and all kinds of cool wildlife to our gardens.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.359
And when I was first learning about this stuff,
I just got so interested in how different

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:43.820
it was than the conventional gardening paradigm
that I grew up with.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.649
Like I learned in organic gardening that we
don’t view aphids as pests or as bad things

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.649
necessarily.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.059
We really think of them as an indication that
whichever plants they are attacking are unhealthy.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.160
So they’re kinda telling us which plants
are unhealthy and giving these clues as to

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.030
why they might be unhealthy and so it’s
just this whole different paradigm with organic

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.520
gardening for how to get rid of the aphids.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.200
You know it’s not to kill the aphids - it’s
to create health in the plants so that the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.450
aphids don’t want to eat them.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.720
That is just one of the amazing things I learned
when I was first studying this stuff and what

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.450
I wanna do today is - what I have done today
actually is I took the afternoon and I thought

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.890
okay, I’m gonna record a series of videos
for you guys for free of just the basics of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.119
how I design and install a nice organic garden
from scratch.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.790
So it’s a really fun afternoon here and
I really did this for new gardeners although

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.399
if you’ve been gardening for awhile, I really
think you’ll learn something.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.920
I know, I gardened for 10 years and I didn’t
know a lot of the important things that I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.700
talked about today.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.649
So, I thought about it more like here’s
the basics, here’s what I would do if I

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.870
just have an afternoon to put in a garden,
which has happened before you know as I was

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.359
at a friend’s house and "Hey!

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.560
Can you help me put in a garden," and of course
it usually takes a little longer than an afternoon

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.869
but okay we’ll do it.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.250
So, I have some experience with doing things
in a hurry and you can still – you can still

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.470
do a good job.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.530
So I really did it for beginners, it’s really
for, it’s organic gardening so if you’re

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.860
not into the whole organic thing this really
isn’t for you.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.560
This is all organic, non GMO, totally sustainable
organic gardening.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.620
And that’s about all!

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.180
I really did it for people who are passionate
about learning more, really about how a garden

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.250
works like I am.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.930
