00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.470
If you need a view of what's
happening on your system in

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.900
real time, then you want to use
the Windows Task Manager.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.520
This is a great place to go to
view statistics like your CPU

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.140
utilization, how much memory
a particular process or

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.740
application might be using.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.670
You can see exactly how much
disk access might be going on

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.150
at any particular time.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.880
This can be really helpful
for trying to find those

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.650
applications that are slowing
down your computer, or that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.310
might be using a lot
of CPU cycles.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.610
To start the Task Manager, you
can press Control+Alt+Delete,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.620
and then choose Task Manager.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.860
You can also start the
Task Manager directly

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.980
from the task bar.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.550
If you right mouse click
anywhere in an open space in

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.010
the task bar, you'll have one of
those options available for

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.260
the Task Manager.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.670
Or, you can use my favorite
hotkey to launch the Task

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.235
Manager, which is
Control+Shift+Escape.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.670
Here's my Windows 7 desktop.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.520
I'm going to start
a few tasks.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.270
Let's start the Notepad, I'll
also start a Calculator.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.860
We get some things going in
this operating system.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.400
And now I'd like to see just
how much memory and other

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.900
types of system resources
might be used by these

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.880
applications.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.830
So I'm going to start
the Task Manager.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.740
And I could go down to the task
bar and right mouse click

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.130
and choose Start Task
Manager, or use my

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.060
Control+Shift+Escape, and Task
Manager will launch.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.780
You have a number of different
tabs across the top.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.890
If you're looking at what's
happening from an application

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.240
perspective, we'll start with
this Application tab, and you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.630
can see I've got two apps
running, which is the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.050
Calculator and which
is my Notepad.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.210
And from here, we can end the
task, we can switch to a

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.360
particular task, or
we can even launch

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.000
new tasks right here.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.960
If you know the exact command
line option to use to start a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.710
particular executable, this
would be great place to do it.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.140
Very similar to the Start Run
option inside of Windows.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.370
Well of course, what we see as
applications on our desktop

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.430
doesn't really show
the whole picture.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.430
There are a lot of other things
that are happening

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.460
behind the scenes, and to see
those, we can go to the next

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.360
tab, which is called
Processes.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.240
In the Processes tab, we can
see all the different

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.720
applications that might be
running as processes.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.020
And we can see that some of
these are not listed as

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.710
applications.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.830
We can certainly see the
calc.exe, and we can see the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.940
notepad.exe, but notice Windows
Explorer itself is an

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.120
executable, and things like My
Virtual Box Guest Tray that is

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.310
down on my task bar is
also listed here.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.640
And there are a number
of other processes

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.790
running here as well.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.150
There are also system processes
we don't see here.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.080
By default, we just see
the processes for us.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.510
But if we check this at the
bottom, this click this button

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.880
for Share Processes From All
Users, we can see all of the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.210
system options, as well.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.530
Look at all of these things
that are running on our

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.060
Windows system, and you can view
it all from this view in

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.410
Task Manager.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.580
You can also change
what you can view.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.660
Notice you see the image name,
the executable that's running.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.100
The user that launched this
particular process, we can see

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.430
CPU utilization, how much
memory, and the description,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.100
but you can also change options
for the columns.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.180
Maybe you'd like to see
information about IO,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.280
especially reading and
writing traffic.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.880
Maybe you'd like to
include those.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.960
Now you have even more
statistics to view inside of

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.260
Task Manager, and if you're
trying to troubleshoot and

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.780
find out exactly where a
slowdown might be occurring,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.900
you may need to load up some
additional metrics to view.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.250
There's also a Services tab,
which shows you just the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.860
services that are running
on your computer.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.080
This might allow you to identify
what the status of a

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.760
particular service might be
without having to go into the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.430
Services Manager inside
of Windows.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.760
There's also a Performance tab
so we can see how much CPU,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.730
how much memory, and other
memory statistics may be used

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.250
on this computer any
particular time.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.270
Notice there's also a convenient
button here to

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.980
launch the External
Resource Monitor.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.670
If you're trying to determine
what type of utilization

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.370
you're using across the network,
there's a Networking

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.620
tab, and there's also
a Users tab.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.650
If there are multiple users
connected to your computer,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.250
maybe they're connecting across
the network, you would

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.330
see them listed here.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.180
That way, if you wanted to
disconnect someone from a

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.660
particular application, or
remove them from your

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.990
computer, or simply shut down,
you can get an update of

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.560
exactly who might be
on your computer at

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.160
any particular time.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.700
There is a lot of detail inside
of the Windows Task

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.020
Manager, but you can see that
if you're trying to

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.600
troubleshoot a particular
performance problem, you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.300
should be able to find all the
information you need right

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.780
inside of the Task Manager.
