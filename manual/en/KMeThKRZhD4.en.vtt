00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.823
Do you want this pillow behind you

00:00:01.823 --> 00:00:03.080
for like lumbar support?

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:03.887
Um,

00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:05.072
I'd like it in front.

00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:06.170
Okay.

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.644
Just like this?

00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:08.813
Lil more padding.

00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:09.617
Why are you

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:10.991
acting like a crazy person--

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:12.223
We have a big celebrity.

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:12.932
Okay!

00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:14.417
Welcome to Just Between Us

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:15.252
This week

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:16.209
we are featuring a

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:17.375
super talented

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.411
super funny

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.712
female standup comic

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:20.973
and impersonator

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:23.305
Melissa Villasenor!

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:24.861
This show is not

00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:25.781
that big of a deal.

00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:26.790
Okay, well I disagree

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.865
because I did send her

00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:28.623
a call sheet.

00:00:28.623 --> 00:00:29.845
She's been on television.

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:31.133
I've at least heard of her.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.273
A lot of the people that

00:00:32.273 --> 00:00:33.521
you get very excited about

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:34.893
I haven't even heard of them.

00:00:34.893 --> 00:00:36.485
Okay, but you've heard of Melissa.

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:37.225
Yes.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:38.290
And you probably would

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.060
wanna kiss her.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.485
♪ (groovy music) ♪

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.809
So viewers,

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.168
we realized that we don't

00:00:45.168 --> 00:00:47.486
have a lot of older points of view

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:48.444
at this show.

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:49.320
Y'know Gaby and I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.033
know a lot,

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.003
but how much can we

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:52.074
really know when we're

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:52.822
under 30.

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:54.214
We're significantly under 30.

00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:55.611
We thought it would be great

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:57.276
for her to answer the questions

00:00:57.343 --> 00:00:58.953
as Julie Andrews.

00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:01.245
Say hello as--

00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:02.212
(fancy accent)

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:03.812
Hello, it is an honor to be here.

00:01:03.812 --> 00:01:05.603
Thank you so much.

00:01:05.903 --> 00:01:07.389
She's the queen of Genovia!

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:09.436
Uh-oh, uhh, nnn.

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:10.703
Okay, so

00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:12.914
when is it okay to sext?

00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:14.661
from Ben from the internet.

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:15.986
That sounds like a guy

00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:16.886
from the internet.

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.967
Do you know what

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:19.373
sexting is, Julie Andrews?

00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:21.104
I don't. Can you define for me?

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:23.959
Okay so sex-- from what I've heard,

00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:26.317
from Gaby and the screenshots

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:27.680
that she sent me,

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.183
sexting is, uhh

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:32.521
texting in a sexual way.

00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:34.955
I was having tea at 4 PM,

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.793
in the parlor,

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:38.813
and I sexted

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.385
one of my husbands!

00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:41.263
I said,

00:01:41.263 --> 00:01:42.274
"when you come home,

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:43.315
I will be naked,

00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:44.043
and I--"

00:01:44.043 --> 00:01:44.747
Okay.

00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:45.469
I'm so sorry,

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:46.767
I don't think Julie Andrews

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:47.673
was really sexting.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:48.615
So if you could just

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:49.628
portray her in a more

00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:50.371
true fashion.

00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:51.836
I don't think you should tell

00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:52.943
Dame Julie Andrews

00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:54.498
how she feels about sexting.

00:01:55.137 --> 00:01:56.419
Okay. Sorry.

00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:58.663
She's an independent,

00:01:58.663 --> 00:01:59.383
knighted woman.

00:01:59.383 --> 00:02:01.046
You really think that Julie Andrews

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:02.286
is in a parlor somewhere

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:04.956
sexting one of her husbands Gaby!?

00:02:04.972 --> 00:02:05.846
How could you have

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.133
more than one husband!?

00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:08.272
Oh, Allison.

00:02:08.272 --> 00:02:09.686
Sweet, sweet Allison.

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:10.952
So Julie Andrews,

00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:12.042
what was the last sext

00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:12.821
that you sent?

00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:14.947
It was,

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.478
"let me see dat dick."

00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:18.282
NO! That's--

00:02:18.282 --> 00:02:19.645
that's not possible!

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:21.324
She's not this prim and proper

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:22.653
one-sided woman.

00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:23.867
She's a complex

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:25.445
sexual being.

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:28.483
I sent a pic of me

00:02:28.483 --> 00:02:29.861
in a bubble bath,

00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:30.935
and I sent it

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.062
to my nephew.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.908
Wha-- Okay.

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:34.791
Now we're setting up Julie Andrews

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:36.155
as a pedophile and I don't

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:37.823
think that that's accurate at all.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.201
Do you think Julie Andrews

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:40.423
even has a cell phone?
