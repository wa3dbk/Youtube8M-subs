of January

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:50.279
three in the morning and we can't deny you
ever actually do any but gains in so much

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.350
to be an improvement isn't beings and so in
other words now

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.680
I mean does that mean that time I think because
it does not work accomplished the only to

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.099
the masses signing an execution order alleged
race should go on and black hills

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.930
I think the President has made

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.849
he said he'd rather eat at the meru that pitch
united explosions was of things

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.630

life

to a woman

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.159

well you and oh twelve year old boy but every
a

to see your own side the female features marry
me or your party's this movie side his excellency

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.149
the only interests cetera et cetera

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:53.339
it makes a compelling case

00:05:53.339 --> 00:06:00.339

troopers that in the past

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:08.270

continue to see sir more of these

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.020
so there was much

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.509
still

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.380
also were expected to learn that we'd be sitting
and watching support of military thought of

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.340
serving you in any other matter supported
that city's frankly too terrible to contemplate

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.639

it seems to be from a twenty three-year-old
flight that yet it's now officially impossible

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.229
to say anything that doesn't sound like a
sexual innuendo

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.930
