00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820
"UKULELE TRICKS IN TWO WEEKS!"

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.720
BOLERO  stroke

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.820
Hi !

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.440
I am sure that can do now a Samba stroke :0)

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.200
And now it is about  the time to learn new rhythm-Bolero

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.520
The movement of the hand is the same like Samba that we've already learn 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.340
but the rhythmic pattern is different

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.960
Do you remember opera "Carmen"?

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.800
this is an easy way to remember it :0)

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.020
So now you can play Bolero

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.480
let's learn a composition from our brothers from Peru

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.740
"EL CONDOR"

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.220
Cords we'll use:

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.240
After we know how to play all the cords

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.860
it is time to work on choreography
