00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:02.207
- Don't put ornaments
on the back of the tree,

00:00:02.207 --> 00:00:03.758
no one will see them.

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:05.572
- Yeah, but then it'll be all lopsided.

00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:07.743
- What are you talking about?

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:09.061
- Psychologically.

00:00:10.168 --> 00:00:11.236
- For the tree?

00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:12.455
- No, for me.

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:16.093
- So, we're gonna have to
set a hundred dollar limit

00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:17.517
on gifts, this year, so...

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.286
- Got it.

00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:20.052
- You got it?

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:22.059
- I got it.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:23.314
- How much?

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.508
- A hundred, around a hundred.

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:26.095
- No.

00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:27.401
- There's a spot right there.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.620
- I can find a closer spot.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.350
- Oh my god, can we just park, please?

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.116
- No, I'm -

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:33.075
Look, I'm gonna follow
this mom with the stroller.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:33.868
- Where you goin', lady?

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:35.335
- [Together] Where are you going?

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.441
- Where are you going?
- No, no, no,

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:38.082
don't go over to that aisle.

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:39.208
- No-ahh.
- Ugh.

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:40.687
- Wait, there's a car back there.

00:00:40.687 --> 00:00:41.560
Go back, go back, go back,
- Where, where? Okay!

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.472
- Go back, go back, go
back, go back, go back!

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:43.010
- Hey!

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.421
- Let's just park, okay?

00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:46.547
- I, I am trying to park!
- It takes just as long

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:49.030
to walk from here to the front
(girl sighs)

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.540
door than it does to drive
around another five minutes.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.057
That's Ashley's party tonight, right?

00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:54.632
- No, Ashley's part is tomorrow.

00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:57.015
- Who is it tonight?

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.108
- Sarah's.

00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.396
- Gonna be food at this thing?

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:01.929
Is there gonna be food at this thing?

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.238
Is there gonna be food at this thing?

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:04.924
- [Guy] Is there gonna
be food at this thing?

00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:08.581
One for you, one for me, one for Emmitt.

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.229
- (gasps) Emmitt, what do
you want for Christmas?

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.529
- Oh, you know, not much.

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:16.407
Just like, a can of wet
food, Star Wars on Blu-ray,

00:01:16.407 --> 00:01:18.078
maybe a PS4 for him.

00:01:19.124 --> 00:01:20.720
- And, there's my gift.

00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:23.210
You gotta learn to hide these better!

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.502
So what's the dress code for this thing?

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.434
- I don't know, like, fancy, I guess?

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:29.085
- Well, what did the invitation say?

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:30.536
- I don't know, I threw it away.

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:32.159
- Well, what are you gonna wear?

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.170
- Probably pants and a shirt.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.261
- Oh my god.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.933
Could you be less helpful?

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.589
(phone chimes)

00:01:40.604 --> 00:01:43.219
- My mom wants to know what
you want for Christmas.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.231
(phone chimes)

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:51.028
- Your mom wants to know what
you want for Christmas, too.

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:52.897
I said, "Let's watch a Christmas movie."

00:01:52.897 --> 00:01:54.534
"Die Hard" is not a Christmas movie.

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:56.365
- What?

00:01:56.365 --> 00:01:58.075
It is "the" Christmas movie.

00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:00.617
- Let's watch something
Christmas-y, like "Home Alone."

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.746
- "Home Alone" is basically "Die Hard."

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:06.446
Kevin McCallister is John McClane.

00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:08.990
Wet Bandits, Hans Gruber.

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.703
Kevin's house, Nakatomi Plaza.

00:02:12.703 --> 00:02:14.283
- All right, let's watch "Die Hard."

00:02:15.298 --> 00:02:17.070
N-aah, cold feet, cold feet, cold feet!

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.335
- What?
- Get out, out, out, out, out!

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:19.004
- What?

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.633
- Put socks on, cold feet!

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:21.326
(guy sighs)

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:22.583
- Did you have a good Christmas?

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:23.477
- Yes.

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:24.638
Did you have a good Christmas?

00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:25.808
- It was the best.

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:28.516
(kisses)

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:29.608
- Tell me the truth, though.

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:30.955
You spent more than a hundred dollars,

00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:32.479
didn't you?
- Oh, shh, it's Christmas.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.161
- I'm just saying.

00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:36.109
I'm gonna see our bank
statement, so I'm gonna know.

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.485
- It's not about how much
you spend on each other,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.986
it's that you spend it with each other.

00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:45.848
- That was so cheesy.

00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:47.084
- Shh, it's Christmas.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:48.670
- I'm blocking out that entire last part.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.035
It was too cheesy.
