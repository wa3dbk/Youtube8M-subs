00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
All living things on Earth need water, because
the chemical reactions that make life possible

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.809
happen in an aqueous solution.

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.549
Which means us land animals have to drink
it to keep it inside of us all the time.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.700
But… what about fish?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.800
It seems like since they’re always in the
aqueous solution of whatever body of water

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.260
they’re swimming around in, they wouldn’t
need to actually drink the stuff.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.960
But it turns out that some fish actually do
need to drink.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.070
And others do not.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.890
It depends on the fish, and what kind of neighborhood
it lives in.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.270
Water, you should know first of all, is really
into finding a balance.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.970
If you have a membrane that water can pass
through, and there are different concentrations

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.410
of salt on each side, then the water will
always flow toward the saltier side of the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.750
membrane, until the concentrations on both
sides are the same.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.980
That means that freshwater fish have it easy.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.371
Since the concentration of salt in their bodies
is higher than the concentration in the water,

00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:55.930
that fresh water just flows right in, mainly
through their gills, and into their bloodstream.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.000
They also swallow some water when they eat
-- I mean, it’s kind of unavoidable -- but

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.860
they don’t need to actively gulp down water.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.829
But, in order to retain that balance of concentrations,
the fish’s tissues still need to have some

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.130
salt in them.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.759
And that’s where chloride cells come in.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.450
These are special cells in the gills that
produce large amounts of an enzyme that controls

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.820
the flow of dissolved salts -- like sodium
and potassium -- across cell membranes.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.780
So, in freshwater fish, these chloride cells
work hard to bring just the right amount of

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.810
salt into the fish’s bloodstream.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.119
Now, saltwater fish have the opposite problem.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.450
For most of them, the concentration of salt
in the water is higher than the concentration

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.450
in their blood.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.520
That means that as they pass water over their
gills to breathe, the higher concentration

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.150
of salt outside of their body is constantly
sucking water out of them.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.049
So these fish have to drink a lot, which they
just gulp down by the mouthful.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.759
But since the only water around is salty,
they have to filter out the salt to make it

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.079
safe for them to absorb.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.560
A lot of that salt is filtered out in the
fish’s kidneys.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.789
But these fish have chloride cells in their
gills, too.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.579
It’s just that, in their case, those cells
are constantly pumping salts out of the bloodstream

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.110
and into the saltier water.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.109
So they may be surrounded by water, but no
matter where they live, fish are always looking

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:04.360
to find that balance.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.609
