Hey, how you doing? This is Jonathan Escotto
also know as B-boy Xcel on behalf of Expert

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.920
Village and today we're showing you breaking
tips. The first thing we're going to start

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.160
off with and one of the most important things
in beat-boying break dancing is top rock.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.350
Top rock is your basic introduction, how you
dance to the music before you go into the

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.660
ground, before you go and do all your crazy
moves you want to dance, you want to show

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.990
your movements. Now the most basic top rocking
in breaking would be a step called the Indian

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.599
step. Now, the Indian step is called the Indian
step because its derived from Native American

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.290
or as we call them Indian dancing and I'm
going to demonstrate the step, show you what

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.210
it looks like a little bit and then I'll break
it down for you. Okay this is the introduction,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:48.750
one, now that's a basic back and forth now
that can also be changed around in a circular

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:58.030
motion. So we can change it up this way, okay.
Now, we're going to break the step down, it's

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.500
a pretty basic and simple step. We're going
to start off with our right foot first and

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.990
you just want to step at a 90 degree angle
and you want to make sure you're not flat

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.180
footed and you're on your toes. You're going
to take your right foot, lift your knee up,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.540
step at a 90 degree angle and your hands have
to come wide open like this. Take your right

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.862
foot, lift your knee back up bring it back
to the beginning position. You're going to

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:23.290
repeat the same motion with your left foot
the opposite direction, again at a 90 degree

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.009
angle, hands open, step, step and come back.
Now you're only moving one foot at a time,

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.100
let's try to combine those two steps in a
slow motion, here we go. We're going to bring

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:43.110
it up, step, hands closed when you come back,
same thing knee up, hands open and back. When

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.820
you put it together it looks some thing like
this, step-back, step-back, okay now we want

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.730
to be careful that we're not turned too sideways
or too forward, it has to be completely at

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.030
a 90 degree angle. Again this is what it looks
like to a rhythm, a basic rhythm would be

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:13.120
so, one back, two back, one back, two back,
one back, two back and again that's the Indian

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.150
step.
