00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.699
First I'd like to thank the players, like always

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.679
We played the perfect game

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.429
We were superior from start to finish

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:17.900
It's a great 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.759
deal of happiness to be in the final

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.619
I think it is well deserved 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.730
We were better than our rival

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.730
nothing else. Let's enjoy this moment

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.390
Remember the people that are not with us

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.890
and share it with the players, the most important thing

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.330
It's a party for the people of this city and 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.490
this is always welcomed. 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.770
I think the players are the most important thing in soccer

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.920
We always have a winning mentality, I told you in yesterday's conference 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.000
and 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.960
only we believed in ourselves 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.080
I have all the clips from all over the world

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.430
what they believed 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.360
Yesterday people asked me if it was impossible but we wanted it and 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.670
our strength 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.280
and we are in the final. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.220
I think that 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.720
we were extremely superior, it was 3-0 but it easily could have been 5-0 or 6-0

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.930
and I have said that in the first game

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.440
we played well but didn't have consistency, today we did

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.760
A lot of confidence and patience

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.370
we are strong at home and we have to take advantage of having our fans

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.060
came in to give it all we had and thankfully we came through. 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.790
I want to enjoy the final

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.490
along with my players

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.060
this moment of happiness

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.530
because not every day you are in a final

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.990
I want to enjoy it to a maximum this week 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.800
and try to 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.720
become champions Sunday. 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.440
We were motivated 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.299
In reality we played a good game in the first leg

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.650
We had two or three minutes in which 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.110
gave up the goals but 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.670
we played a great game, we couldn't score but 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.820
today we played a complete game 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.090
and we should enjoy it. 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.790
first of all

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.050
I'll say it a gain, I've said it all year, we have intelligent players 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.679
that knew what we were playing for and that there was no tomorrow

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.959
and the work we did is all about the motivation that comes from the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.379
coaching staff 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.829
and nothing else but great joy.

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.869
There's nothing else to say. I think 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.709
we showed why we were one of the best in the tournament. 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.309
It truly was very difficult. 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:29.339
Leon is a great team that always scored 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.489
has a great coach and 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.549
We knew it was going to be difficult but the hunger to win was more  

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.089
I said it last year when we lost it was a tremendous team 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:44.129
but this time it faced a team I believe is better. 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.540
That's what I think. We beat a great team and that's why it has

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.339
double the merit

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.849
on our part.
