Dominic: Hi, I'm Dominic.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:06.330
I'm here at the Crutchfield campus to talk
about the Garmin nuvi 880 and the nuvi 850

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.260
portable navigators.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.070
I've got the nuvi 880 here in the car with
me and I'm going to talk about some features

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.219
that both of these navigators have in common.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.580
The first is route optimization, which allows
you to enter several destinations for one

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.390
trip and the navigator will sort them and
get you to all your destinations in the quickest

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.789
time possible, which comes in really handy
when you're running errands.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.379
The second cool feature about these navigators
is the speech recognition.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.829
Garmin gives you this handy little remote
control that fits right on your steering wheel

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.530
and you just press the big button on the remote
to turn it on and the little button to turn

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.039
it off.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.710
And the way it works is that it allows you
to input the destination without having to

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.930
touch the navigator or take your hands off
the wheel.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.460
Say I'm here at Crutchfield and I want to
find the closest gas station, all I have to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.390
do is tell the navigator I'm looking for the
nearest gas station and it will do all the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.410
work for me.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.390
Find nearest gas station.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.230
nuvi: Searching for fuel.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.050
Select a line number.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.390
Dominic: One.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.010
nuvi: Would you like to begin navigation?

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.070
Dominic: Yes.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.250
nuvi: Please drive to highlighted route.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.040
Dominic: See, it's that simple.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.780
I was able to find a destination without having
to take my hands off the wheel, and you can

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.750
use this thing to find just about anything,
including nearby restaurants, banks, hospitals.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.020
And you can look up a destination by speaking
the whole name of the address, all sorts of

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.020
stuff.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.960
Now, some other cool features that both these
navigators have in common include the text-to-speech

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.400
voice prompts, which allow you to keep your
eyes on the road by telling you the actual

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.810
street name as you come up to them on a turn,
and they both have a micro SD card slot which

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.960
allows you to load up your navigator with
music and pictures and other cool stuff to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.630
help you along your way.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.310
Now, the nuvi 880 has a couple of additional
features that help it really stand out.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.740
The first of which is it comes with a receiver
for MSN Direct, which is an information service

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:33.230
that provides you with traffic reports, weather
reports, gas prices, movie times and a bunch

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.930
of other cool information in most major metropolitan
areas.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.750
And you get a free trial subscription for
MSN Direct with your nuvi purchase.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.390
The nuvi 880 also has built in Bluetooth connectivity
which allows you to make and receive hands-free

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.430
phone calls with your compatible cell phone.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.420
So there you have it, the Garmin nuvi 880
and nuvi 850 portable navigators.
