Sports is all about teams and about
learning together and getting better and

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.839
contributing and that is that really our goal here with this very exciting

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.420
effort.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.740
These two-way exchanges in sports diplomacy bring people together

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.849
for common purpose and mutual
understanding. It is my pleasure to now

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.179
introduce and a very unique team,

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.699
eighteen high school soccer players
there're from Bolivia,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.379
Germany, Malaysia, Pakistan, Palestinian
Territories, and South Africa. This is a

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.210
US program that

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.350
like came and got some people from other
countries to come to the country and

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.740
explore and promote women's football before the World Cup.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.970
We're girls that came from

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.980
different parts of the world. They play soccer

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.440
so that they can meet like have a great
time meet each other and compare

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.930
football

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.159
from other parts of the world.  I thought its just going to be some

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:08.130
training stuff but we are learning more than that. Through sports

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.190
you can do a lot of things like work with kids,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.650
different things like being able to be part of the group, being a leader.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.130
It's amazing just as learning all those new things about those cultures.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.140
Because I never ever thought I would meet a person from Bolivia or South Africa.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.690
And it's been a pleasure to me because we are actually, like, talking discussing some

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.400
stuff about their culture

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.250
how do they do this, how do they do that and all that and its been like great. We all came together

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.190
and we were like

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.220
"Wow, we want to come back again"

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.640
We were like a family.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.979
The first we did was to be able to see the American, the US

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.380
team. I've loved meeting all those soccer players and I was like really impressed by how good they can play.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.350
Baseball game was like great. Oh it was fun!

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.510
It was like being in America.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.760
That was amazing, we all came as one. we rooted for one team and had the best time ever.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.830
Actually very excited to see

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.280
the US national team play against Mexico.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.100
And we saw Hillary Clinton as well, a chance of a lifetime.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.389
Getting to know teammates from around the world has been an absolutely amazing experience

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.299
so much and so little

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.639
