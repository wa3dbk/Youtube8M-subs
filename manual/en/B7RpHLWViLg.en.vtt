00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.109
I decided to do a little experiment to see
how well aerating the roots would increase

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.580
my lettuce yield.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.250
Currently my raft beds have no bubblers with
just a bit of splashing from my media beds.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.759
I left one bed without air and the other bed
I added two air stones.

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:45.350
Then I placed two identical sets of plants
with 15, 2 week old seedlings into each bed….and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:01:05.180
waited.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.790
I knew the aerated plants would do better,
but I was a bit surprised how much better

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.480
they did.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.270
First I harvested the non-aerated plants.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.920
Looking at the roots they look good for a
plant of this size.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:29.250
The plants also look good, but harvesting
them yields just 207 grams or 13.8 grams each.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.750
Moving on to the aerated plants, the roots
look much better and obviously the plants

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.610
are far larger.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:45.950
These 15 plants weigh 1592 grams, or 106 grams
each.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.050
This experiment ran for 27 days plus the 14
days prior to get the seedlings started which

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.560
makes them just shy of 6 weeks.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.870
The weight of the aerated plants was 7.7 times
heavier than the non-aerated ones.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.800
I think it’s time to make a change to my
system.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.600
You may have noticed that our raft beds are
all numbered.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.950
We use TrackMyPlants.com to record our plant
growth and nutrient levels.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.720
Give it a try!
