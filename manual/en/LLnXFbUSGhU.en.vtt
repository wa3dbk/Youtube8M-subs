00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.190
This is a story about a boy named Marty who
lives in the countryside of West Virginia

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.420
with his father, mother, and two sisters.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.030
One day, as he is walking around in the woods,
Marty discovers a dog.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.900
At first, the dog is scared, but soon follows
Marty home.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.760
Marty eventually names him Shiloh.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.850
However, Marty's father tells him that he
has to return Shiloh, as he belongs to Judd

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.909
Travers, a mean-spirited man who mistreats
his dogs.

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:28.669
After returning Shiloh to Judd, Marty is sad,
but then finds that Shiloh has ran off to

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:29.669
him again.

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.570
Marty secretly keeps Shiloh in the woods for
a while, feeding him leftovers and keeping

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.690
him enclosed in a shoddy pen.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.270
However, one night, Shiloh is attacked by
another loose dog.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.620
Shiloh's wounds are bad and so Marty takes
Shiloh to the town doctor.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.100
The doctor patches up the wounds, but Shiloh
still needs rest.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.110
After the entire family knows about Shiloh,
they get attached to him as he recovers.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.470
However, Judd finds out that they have Shiloh
and wants him back when he fully recovers.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.090
As the days wind down until Shiloh must be
returned, Marty tries to figure out how to

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.090
keep Shiloh.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.829
He decides to confront Judd.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.370
However, Marty sees Judd shoot a deer out
of season and cuts a deal with him that he

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.999
won't report the deer shooting if Judd lets
him work around his farm as payment for Shiloh.

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:17.840
They agree and Marty starts working for Judd,
despite him suspecting that Judd will back

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.840
down from the deal.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.920
But in the end, after working for two weeks,
Judd gives Marty Shiloh and the family welcomes

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.639
a new member to the house.

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:28.210
For the majority of the story, Marty struggles
with lying.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.509
He's not sure whether to tell his parents
that he has Shiloh.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.889
Instead, he justifies his lying with the assumption
that his father will take Shiloh back to an

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:37.889
abusive owner.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.810
So is it okay to lie?

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.279
The story doesn't come right out and say,
but what it does say is that it's not so easy

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:45.729
in real life.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.880
People can easily judge a situation when they
aren't the ones experiencing it for themselves,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.549
but when it happens to you, things tend to
become more complicated.

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.700
And because of the first person narrative
in present tense, readers feel like they,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.600
too, are the ones negotiating whether lying
is justified.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.720
Marty knows that it's wrong to lie, but he
begins to wonder if maybe lying to protect

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.410
someone is okay.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.740
Ultimately, he discovers that there are no
clear lines.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.760
This story also portrays the helplessness
that one can feel in a situation of abuse.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.220
To Marty, it seems like he can't win if he
plays everything the "right" way.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.180
He can't prove that Judd abuses Shiloh, and
even if he does, as Marty's father points

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.100
out, Shiloh belongs to Judd.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.250
It may not be right, but Judd, as the owner,
can do whatever he wants with his own property.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.530
But helplessness doesn't necessarily mean
hopelessness.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.160
The story's message gives readers hope that
even in times of helplessness, there is still

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160
hope.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.330
Marty works hard to buy Shiloh, but he does
so knowing that Judd is under no obligation

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.940
to give him the dog.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.950
Even when Judd points this out, Marty continues
to work on Judd's farm.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.300
In the end, things work out for Marty, as
he gets Shiloh, but even if Judd reneged on

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.010
his promise, Marty could still walk away knowing
that he tried his best.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.730
And that's both the power and value of hope.
