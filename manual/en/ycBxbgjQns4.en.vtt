00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:02.322
- [Voiceover] Let's think
about how many blocks

00:00:02.322 --> 00:00:03.583
we have here.

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:07.406
What number these blocks represent.

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.752
Well, I have four groups
of a hundred here,

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:12.422
so I could say that I have four hundreds.

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:14.480
Four hundreds.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.645
I have three groups of 10 here.

00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:20.216
So I could write plus three tens.

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:22.708
Plus three tens.

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:24.403
And then I have six ones here.

00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:27.026
So I could write plus six ones.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:30.185
Plus six ones.

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:32.900
And, so I can write that as...

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.271
I could write that as...

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:35.943
I could write a six in the ones place

00:00:35.943 --> 00:00:37.940
for my six ones.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.958
Three in the tens place for my three tens.

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.653
For my three tens.

00:00:42.653 --> 00:00:44.186
And then a four in the hundreds place

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:46.669
for my four hundreds.

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:48.328
So this is 436.

00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:49.991
Four hundred thirty-six.

00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:53.195
436.

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:55.168
Now let's subtract from that.

00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:57.838
Let's subtract from that...

00:00:57.838 --> 00:00:59.385
Let's subtract from that

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:01.568
the number...

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:04.958
the number 300...

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.274
312.

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:12.202
312 and let's think about what we would do

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:15.012
here for subtracting 300...

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:19.470
If we are subtracting 312.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.211
Well, we had six ones before,

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:22.697
we're taking away two ones.

00:01:22.697 --> 00:01:23.718
So let me write that down.

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:27.944
We're gonna take away two ones.

00:01:27.944 --> 00:01:29.663
We're taking away one 10.

00:01:29.663 --> 00:01:32.496
So we're taking away one 10.

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:35.244
So minus one 10.

00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:38.161
And we're taking away three hundreds.

00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:40.088
So we're taking away...

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:43.620
So we're taking away three hundreds.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.591
Three hundreds.

00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:47.425
So what's that going to do to us?

00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:49.260
What's that going to do to us?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.605
Well, we had four hundreds,

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:53.020
we're taking away three hundreds,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.996
so let's take them away.

00:01:53.996 --> 00:01:55.181
Let's take away...

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.362
Let's take away the...

00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:02.508
Let's take way the one...

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:04.296
two...

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:05.968
and three hundreds

00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:08.151
and we're just left with one hundred.

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:11.308
One hundred.

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:12.214
We could do it over here.

00:02:12.214 --> 00:02:15.581
Four hundreds minus three hundreds

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:17.972
is going to be one hundred.

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:20.666
Now we had three tens,

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.431
we're taking away one ten.

00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.660
So let's do that.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.796
So we're going to be left with two tens.

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.698
So plus two tens.

00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:31.154
Three minus one is two.

00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:33.204
Three minus one is two.

00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:36.199
And then last,

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.115
then we had six ones,

00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:41.367
we're taking away two ones,

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:42.846
and we're going to be left with four ones.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:46.349
Six minus two is four.

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:50.306
Six minus two is four.

00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:51.583
And we're done!

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:55.430
436 minus 312 is 124.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.249
And you see how we did that.

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.571
We took away three hundreds.

00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:01.150
We took away one ten.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.377
And we took away two ones.

00:03:04.377 --> 00:03:06.537
To get 124.

00:03:06.537 --> 00:03:10.537
Which is one hundred,
two tens, and four ones.
