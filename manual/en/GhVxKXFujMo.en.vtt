00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.320
Don't drink unless you're of legal age.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.830
Drink responsibly, and never drink and drive.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.840
Step 1.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.409
Learn about different styles of beer.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:44.360
Note each style's characteristic aroma, color,
clarity, head character, and flavor, including

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.900
chemical byproducts produced during fermentation.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.089
Step 2.

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.670
Start enjoying any beer you drink like a judge.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.879
When holding a bottle, examine it for sediment
and any signs of a bacterial ring in the neck.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.430
Then, pour the beer down the center of a clean,
clear glass or plastic cup; adjust the pour's

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.370
angle based on the beer's carbonation for
a good presentation.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.930
Step 3.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.960
Sniff the beer to get an initial impression.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.330
Then, judge the brew's color and clarity against
the style's standards before sniffing again,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.650
noting any changes.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.960
Write down your impressions as you go, assessing
them against the beer style's guidelines.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.510
Make your notes detailed to help distinguish
nuances in the beer.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.770
Step 4.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.590
Take a few sips; use one to measure the strongest
flavors, a second for additional impressions,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.780
and a third to judge the beer's body and feel
in your mouth.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.770
Then, take a last sniff before having a final
taste to round out the beer's flavor profile.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.910
Step 5.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.480
Taste homebrews together with other enthusiasts.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.570
Volunteer as a judges' assistant, known as
a steward, at American Homebrewers Association

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.650
competitions -- these events use judges sanctioned
by the Beer Judge Certification Program, or

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.650
BJCP.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.049
You can also take beer-judging classes to
further develop your beer acumen.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.560
Step 6.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.440
Confident in your palate and beer vocabulary?

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.840
Take the BJCP exam, covering brewing techniques,
beer styles, judging procedures, and ethics.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.890
Score 70 percent, and earn judging points
at a few events to become certified.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.770
Then, go on to promote the love of homebrewed
beer.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.620
Did you know In 2010, a Scottish brewing company
sold 12 bottles of beer encased in stuffed

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.340
stoats, squirrels, and a hare for $765 a piece.
