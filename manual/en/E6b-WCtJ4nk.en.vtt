00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.790
Alright, so this morning we are in Drakensberg.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.540
That means the dragon's mountain.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.990
And we're going to be doing a bit of a hike
on a stretch that is called the Amphitheatre.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.510
And yeah, the Drakensberg are actually the
border between South Africa and Lesotho.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.500
So that is a pretty cool little fact.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.970
We've been told to prepare for any kind of
weather.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.970
It could be sunny.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.970
It could be rainy.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.140
It could be snowing any minute.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.250
So we're ready for some adventure.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:54.460
Let's go hiking!

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:14.960
I've really been enjoying the views so far.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.130
I would classify this as a lower-intermediate
hike.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.090
It is not for people who really have a fear
of heights.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.759
There are some vertical parts where you have
to go up ladders and down ladders.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.259
And that part would be a deal breaker for
some people.

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:44.560
But as far as the views and just the actual
hike itself it is really enjoyable.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.560
So this is actually one of the ladders that
you have to climb down on the way back.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.679
And I believe there are two sets of ladders
to deal with.

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.869
So something to consider if you are afraid
of heights.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.159
We've actually decided to just stay back and
enjoy a very relaxed lunch because neither

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.829
Sam nor I enjoy heights and this was making
us a little bit nervous.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.929
But everyone else was very adventurous, very
brave so you can give it a try if you come

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.929
out here.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.470
Okay, so now it is time for lunch.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.060
Woo!

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.209
Alright, so we are coming to the end of our
hike here in Drakensberg.

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.970
And even though we didn't reach the top it
was still an incredible trip.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.799
Like it was so scenic, so beautiful, so I'm
glad we came.

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.409
And if you find yourself traveling through
South Africa definitely consider this region.
