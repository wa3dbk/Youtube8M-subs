00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.440
Why trim aquarium plants?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.320
Above all, the main aim of a planted tank
keeper is to grow their plants. When aquarium

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:21.650
plants are looked after correctly they will
grow rather quickly and just like a garden

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.770
above water, they will need tending. Aquarium
plants will become overgrown and there are

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.579
many good reasons to trim them.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.380
When plants are grown tightly in an aquarium
they will compete for space, the winner will

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:48.969
take all the light and the loser will be left
in the shade, for this reason plants must

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.469
be trimmed, otherwise some of the slower and
less aggressive growing plants may become

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.579
smothered. Included in this are your fish,
some planted aquariums can become so overgrown

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.760
that the fish have very little open space
to swim.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:22.590
Plants generally grow from the center, with
the older leaves on the outside. As the new

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:34.470
leaves grow, the old leaf can become covered
in algae and in addition they may start to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:02:01.260
rot away as the plant discards them. Trimming
them will help to keep your plant looking

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.990
its' best and reduce waste from rotting leaves
entering your aquarium.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.990
Top Tip

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.930
Just like terrestrial plants, trimming can
actually encourage growth in the plant, a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:21.659
regular trim can make a straggly plant become
bushy.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.549
When to trim and how much?

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:38.049
The timing of trimming aquarium plants is
very individual to your aquarium, and it depends

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:54.639
on the 
look you're going for and how fast your plants

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:09.760
are growing. If you're ultra neat, then trimming
weekly or even daily is plausible; if your

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:30.480
going for the natural look, then generally
once a month is a good starting point. I recommend,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.249
for an average planted tank, that you wait
until your plants have at least doubled in

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:39.669
size before trimming them back.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:58.540
When trimming your plants, don't be shy. It
can be scary to cut away plants that you have

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:13.519
been nurturing, but they will be healthier
for it. Trim at least 30% of the foliage away,

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:29.919
up to a maximum of 50%. Always focus on the
older growth and plant leaves that are old,

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:41.330
covered in algae or dieing. Try to leave new
growth alone unless it is infringing in the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:52.699
points I raised in the "why to trim" section
above.
