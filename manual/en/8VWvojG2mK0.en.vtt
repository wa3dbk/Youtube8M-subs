00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Welcome to SewVeryEasy, my name is Laura.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.330
And today I am going to spray baste a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.889
small, craft batt-sized quilt. A "craft batt"

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.580
is 36"×45" and what's great about this

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.420
size is your fabrics normally 45 inches

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.699
so it will fit the width of a fabric and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.289
you don't have to worry about piecing

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.449
the back. Makes a quick little project.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.510
But I need to baste this together and I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.230
only baste two ways: I fuse my basting or

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.860
I use the spray baste, because I really

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.800
don't like hand-basting so this is the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.190
way I like to do it. Now to start with, I

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.430
have a very big cutting table. You can

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.239
use any table with this method. So on the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.539
top of it I have clipped a piece of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.820
flannel. It's an old flannel sheet and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.890
it's been in the wash a hundred times so

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.250
it's all good to use. And because I'm

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.039
using this on my sewing table I make

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.899
sure that I cover my sewing machine and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.760
if you love your sewing machine you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.409
might want to cover it for the spray

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.600
because you do not want any of the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.990
overflow of the spray to go on your

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.360
machine or anything else, so what you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.549
don't want full of glue—make sure you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.520
cover it. The next stage I'm going to do

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.939
is after this has been all tight on the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.549
table. The next layer I'm going to put

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.950
down is going to be my backing and, of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.110
course, it is going to be right-side

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.049
down. Now there is a reason why I like to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.290
use a flannel sheet on my table surface

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.540
or, in this case, my cutting table.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.000
It's because the flannel will hold the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.860
quilt back on it so it doesn't shift. So

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.509
you do not have to stretch the back, pin

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.030
it, tape it, or do whatever you've already

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.899
done on the first surface. So just make

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.380
sure there's no lint or anything hanging

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.369
over the edge, and you're able to lay out

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.880
your backing

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.489
and take out any of the wrinkles and

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.989
make sure there's no threads, and then

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.250
you're going to be able to put your batting

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.819
right over top of this. So I know that my

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.450
batt is going to fit my quilt because I

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.920
have already measured it to make sure.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.080
And did you know you should have your

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.290
batting lay flat for about 24 hours before

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.540
you use it? Because it helps relax the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.610
fibers after they've been shoved in the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.410
bag too much. Sometimes we're a little

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.090
bit impatient, we don't want to do

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.769
that, so I might hit it with a little bit

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.720
of steam and relax some of those

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.750
wrinkles. So what I'll do is I'll take my

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.330
batt and I will fold it into quarters. I

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.640
fold it first of all in half and then I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.430
will fold it in a quarter, and then I'm

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.680
able to work on one corner of the quilt

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.920
at a time and it just is easier for me to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.290
make sure that my batting is going to lay

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.950
perfectly on top of my back and my front

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.549
when I'm done. So I lay my batting in the first

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.610
corner, I'm going to flip it over to the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.790
next corner, and then I will open it up.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.040
So that's the first thing I'm going to

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.590
do. So far I have my backing already

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.160
on my flannel and the flannel holds it

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.290
so you don't have to pin it. That's a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.930
bonus with using the flannel. And I have

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.690
my batting on the quilt.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.690
Now I'm only going to spray half of the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.959
batting at a time because it is a small

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.000
quilt, but if it's a large quilt you

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.160
might want to do it in quarter sections,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.049
just like you would have folded the

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.810
batting. So I'm going to just peel this

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.480
back and I'm going to expose half of my

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.209
batt. And I'm going to follow the

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.940
directions because each spray is

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.250
somewhat different. You're going to spray

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.040
it and then you're going to put it on. So

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.889
let's give it a spray. Now when you go to spray

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.430
there's a little mark on your can and

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.280
that mark is where the spray nozzle

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.739
should be pointing. It will work wherever

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.440
it is but it's really good if you use

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.870
that mark. It just makes the spray

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.880
come out to the way it's designed to do.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.310
So I've given the can a good shake and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.699
now I am just going to lightly spray the

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.870
back of my quilt. And this is why you want

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.169
everything covered. And you just need to

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.600
do a very light spray

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.940
and then I will fold this on top and smooth it out as

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.729
you go because you do not necessarily

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.310
want any bumps in it now you've gone

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.729
this far. So I like to bring over a small

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.360
section at a time

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.200
and then continue.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.800
So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.720
going to peel back this side and spray

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.260
here always keep in mind that you need

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.539
to have everything nice and flat and you

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.850
do not want any lint in between the

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.139
layers. Give your can a shake and give it

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:23.720
another spray. And again I will only take

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.450
a portion at a time, just enough that I

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.130
can handle. And if you have a really

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.050
large quilt, this is when you have a

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.980
girlfriend come over and help you. Offer

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.320
her a bottle of wine.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.260
—maybe you better have the wine when you're done!

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.480
So there I have the back and the batting

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.700
stuck together. The next now I'm going to

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.380
put the quilt top on top of it. So I have

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.560
my quilt top and it's on top now with, of

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.930
course, the right-side up. I know this

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.940
one doesn't look like a quilt top. What

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.560
I'm going to do is a quilt-as-you-go

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.860
with this so I need to have it all one

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.599
piece of fabric and this is a really

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.840
easy pattern. So I'm going to just make

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.720
sure that it fits properly and then I'm

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.460
going to do the same thing as I did to

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.289
the back. I'm just going to peel it back

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.220
halfway, spray it, and then pull that over.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.099
Smooth out the wrinkles and then get to

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.280
the next side. Now the beauty with the

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.880
spray adhesive is if you do end up with

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.760
a little wrinkle in this, it's very easy

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.220
just to lift it off

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.040
and smooth it back down because it is

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.950
repositionable. That makes it very handy.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.680
And you're done. You will be able to just

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.110
take the entire quilt off of your

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.420
flannel, throw your flannel in the wash

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.310
machine and keep it ready for the next

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.800
project and you're set to go. You can

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.810
bring this to the machine and just start

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.530
sewing. So you can see you why I like to

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.620
spray baste: It's very easy. I didn't have

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.870
to stretch, I didn't have to pin, I didn't

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.540
have to hand-baste. It really is the way to

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.650
go. Spray basting is really a nice way to

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.440
do a quilt and most of the spray bastes

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.600
nowadays do not gum up your needles

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.640
so you really don't have to worry about

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.600
it. So I hope you enjoyed this episode on

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.750
how to spray baste a quilt. Feel free to

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.410
Let's see what we're so next time in the

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.420
sewing room. Bye for now.
