00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.659
hello everyone Michael here with the
daily note 2 youtube channel and welcome to

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.389
another episode

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.190
so did you know that your phone 
comes with two maybe even

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.720
three hidden menus or 
tiny little applications for testing

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.779
and they all require secret codes 
to go into them

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.009
and

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.539
the first one is that we're going to
look at is called LCDTest the other one

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.089
is Self Test Mode

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.470
the third

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.510
is

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.660
the secret code was provided to me 
by youtube user that watches my videos

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.460
called hasibusi I hope I'm saying that right
but i'm probably not anyway it's

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.730
the name of the third application

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.920
hidden applications whatever 
your carrier name is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.830
it's hidden menu

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.930
so anyway let's first look at
the LCDTest

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.200
to go into LCDTest 
you need to open up your dialer

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.770
and type in *#0*#

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.340
as you can see 
we have this app that opened up

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
and the first three are obvious
you can look at

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.420
how vibrant your reds are and maybe
if you had two galaxy note 2 or maybe

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.160
another smart phone and you want to see
how your red looks

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.970
compare to the other phone
you could try these options

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.040
now the color white is also here
it is just called receiver when you

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.430
click into it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.140
it makes that little tone 
but it also outputs full white

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
there're some other ones like dimming

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.070
which

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.320
it lets you see the gradual 
dorp off to black for all colors

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.960
and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.630
you'll see two

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.280
interesting ones remember 
if you watched yesterday's episode how I 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.530
mentioned that there's two different
digitizer on the samsung galaxy note 2

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.100
and even though they make it seem like

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.050
it's almost one technology
there're different so this is touch

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.370
for example 
if you took a

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.510
S pen

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.189
and you try to write on it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.229
it's only turning the capacitive touch

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.499
sensor on here

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.279
and to do this test 
you need to just simply

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:17.409
just get all these little boxes

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:23.969
and try not lifting your finger
I believe that's important

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.370
as you can see I pasted the test.. the other one is 
called wacom test.. this is for the wacom

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.009
digitizer for your S pen

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.569
as you could see
your touch doesn't register but

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.899
and make sure this one

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.889
especially if you're doing the test 
make sure you don't take your

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.069
S pen off the screen

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.949
for example

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.229
if you

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.900
do this
it will fail

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.599
let's

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.609
keep on going LED 
that's interesting.. you could see that the

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:00.939
red LED on top has
it will turn green, blue and then finish

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.650
I will let you play with the 
rest of it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.680
let's go to the next one

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.339
this one is called

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.209
self test mode and to get to
you need to do

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.009
*#7353#

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.449
it's interesting when you go to the first one 
it will start playing this

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.359
kpop i don't know if it will be
different for you but I was kinda

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.209
surprised that happened

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.349
there's some other ones
builtin camera

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.019
here to do test your camera
it is really basic camera but it actually

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.659
takes a picture

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.689
let's see what else

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.949
there's some interesting one's called
Accelerometer sensor

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:51.219
basically points to arrow of this 
and that's pointing

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.730
and there's a proximity sensor

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.049
I just have my finger 
over the proximity sensor

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.659
and it will react there
same thing for a light sensor

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.359
just cover your finger with the
light sensor and it will react

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.029
let's go to the last test
now this one

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.629
you will need a code

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.329
for your country

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.659
and a password for your carrier

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.989
and i only have the one for Korea 
and my carrier

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.020
but you could probably 
search the internet for it

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.870
the code for my phoen is

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.190
319

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.679
712

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:36.050
358

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.469
0821

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:42.870
i saw two things in here
that looked maybe

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.649
i haven't really tested it but

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:47.530
when you go to data setting
and do the

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.039
Pref mode

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.220
you could select either LTE only
or maybe if you want it to

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.469
bettery turn off the LTE radio
i believe you could select

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:00.689
EVDO

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.309
onely or

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:05.259
some of these options here

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.819
and i'm not 100% sure 
if it'll turn off your LTE radio

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.990
i believe this is what people use to try
to conserve power with the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.159
LTE radios and

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.439
next thing i saw that was interesting 
was a USB setting

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:23.959
by default it's set at MTP which is 
probably the latest connection

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:25.660
mode to your computer

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.690
but if you want to do something 
more low level

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.030
so that

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.249
for example when you pluged this phone into 
a older style

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:35.189
dock

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:39.139
that tries to read your galaxy note 2
as like a

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.760
usb drive maybe could set one of these
and it might work 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.550
once again I haven't tested it
that's the end of this episode and i

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.589

just interesting information
