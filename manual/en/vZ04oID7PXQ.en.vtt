AMANDA CLAIRE: So, I don't like to do dishes
and especially sticky things made out of sugar

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.840
and food coloring. So, I like to mix my colored
icing right in the bag. And so, I haven't

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.720
cut a hole in this bag yet to just squirt
the icing out of. It's still close. So, I've

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.070
got some royal icing in there. Here is some
paste gel food coloring. This is a blue. I'm

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.949
just going to go ahead and kinda open this
up, and I'm just going to squeeze 'em right

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.150
into the bag here. I'm going to try and get
a nice bright blue. I kind of put a lot in

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.570
here. It's going to be pretty intense blue.
And then, I'm going to kind of mash that down,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.590
and I'm actually going to do the mixing of
the icing kind of right in the bag just by

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.690
kinda kneading it around like this. Make sure
that you're kinda careful doing this. I mean

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.670
this particular kind of bag I am using is
a pretty strong bag, so it's not going to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.329
break. But if you use kind of sort of little
sandwich bags or kind of a thinner plastic

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.030
bags, you might want to be careful that you
don't break them by doing this. But I'm just

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.649
kind of mixing the icing right here in the
bag just by kind of kneading it around, and

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:13.880
you can see it's almost homogenous. I need
to do a little bit more just kind of keep

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.990
kneading it until it's kind of all in one
color, and so it's getting pretty close there.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.229
So that will be my blue icing and kind of
when you're done and kneading it again, you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.530
want to kind of gather it down towards one
corner by just sort kind of pulling it, sort

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.119
of down the bag. So, that's kind of what I'm
doing here and kind of getting it all sort

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.420
of accumulated in one spot. You'll also find
that as you work this with your hands, obviously,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.779
that your hands warm the icing up and it becomes
a little bit easier to manipulate once you've

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:55.210
kinda been working with it for a while. So,
here we go, little homemade icing bag. I have

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.840
most of the icing accumulated there in the
corner. I have some blue icing. I'm going

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.700
to need a couple more colors and then we'll
cut some little tiny holes in the tips there

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.330
then we'll be ready to decorate.
