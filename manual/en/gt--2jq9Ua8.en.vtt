Hey what's up ladies and gentlemen, my name
is david benjamin i'm the founder of healthywildandfree.com.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.220
Today I want to share with you the health
benefits of radishes, and specifically i'm

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.830
talking about red radishes as you can see
here, now, one of the most important things

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.470
in health and wellness and wellbeing is to
eat the color of the rainbow, i'm not talking

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.130
about skittles here i'm talking about fruits
and vegetables.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.679
We want to have red, white, yellow, green,
blue, purple, orange, brown, you want to eat

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:32.640
every color because each color has it's own
unique nutritional profile of minerals, vitamins

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.469
antioxidants and phytochemicals and plant
compounds and things like that which are beneficial

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.280
for your health and wellbeing so one of the
cool things about red radishes first and foremost,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.339
first and foremost I want to share with you
an interesting fact.

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.649
The leaves on red radishes are actually edible,
and these leaves are a little bit old so what

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.410
I recommend doing and this is what i'm going
to do in the future is to get the leaves when

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.309
you first buy the radishes, get the leaves,
clean them and then just juice them so that's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.339
what i'm going to start doing because there's
nutrition in them, there's minerals and I

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.110
don't want to throw away minerals, it makes
no sense absolutely whatsoever.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.300
And I have other videos about this on my channel
like for example you can eat watermelon seeds,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.960
there's minerals in them, in those, you can
also eat celery leaves, those are very rich

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.400
in minerals actually celery leaves contain
five times as many minerals as the celery

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.890
stalk so there's a lot of parts of fruits
and vegetables that we're throwing away that

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.670
have a lot of nutritional content and value
so make sure to pay attention to that and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.620
i'll be making a lot more videos about this
on this channel so make sure to subscribe

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.620
below.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.070
So, radishes are beneficial for your health
in several specific ways, the first way is

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.840
radishes are white internally, the actual
food is white so onions are white, garlic

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.922
is white, a lot of white foods are actually
rich in sulfur and in the last video on this

00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:52.940
channel you'll learn about MSM or sulfur which
is a mineral found in food that is beneficial

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.170
for protein assimilation and absorption and
really good for your hair, your skin and your

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.910
nails, your ligaments, your tendons and your
joints and it's also very very anti-inflammatory

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.800
so radishes are very rich in, they are rich
in sulfur which is beneficial for your health

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.250
and wellbeing but they're also rich in vitamin
C, vitamin C is obviously beneficial for your

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.640
repairing hair skin and nails, vitamin C is
great for boosting your immunity and it's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.040
just an important vitamin to have in your
diet on a daily basis, it's a water soluble

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.031
vitamin which means that it's depleted and
you need to continuously have vitamin C in

00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:33.100
your diet so that you have vitamin C in your
body when it needs to operate and function

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.991
properly and optimally, so it's rich in vitamin
c it's also rich in fiber, it's very very

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.870
rich in fiber, fiber is obviously beneficial
for your digestive system, it's kind of like

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.670
a broom or a brush that it cleans the intestines,
the colon and really just keeps your body

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.480
clean and helps kind of gather fecal matter
basically, pull it together and get you a

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.650
good bowel movement so it's rich in fiber,
it's also rich in minerals like manganese,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.819
potassium, Iron, and copper, minerals that
are beneficial for your overall health and

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.130
wellbeing, magnesium is very important, it's
an important, magnesium and potassium are

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.320
important for your cardiovascular system,
your heart, magnesium is important for relaxation,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.040
to calm your nervous system, to calm your
heart, and to just calm your body overall

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.760
and it's very relaxing mineral.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.280
Potassium obviously is great for you know
the heart once again, potassium and magnesium

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.880
and several other minerals seem to be and
fiber seem to be very rich in white foods,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.730
so onions, garlic, radishes, coconuts, things
like that.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.069
So, white foods internally I mean, obviously
the radish externally is red but internally

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:53.770
it's white, potassium, magnesium, and fiber,
very beneficial in that way.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.599
It's also beneficial because it's got many
different antioxidants that are anti-inflammatory

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.120
antioxidants for dealing and coping with oxidative
stress from your environment or toxins in

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.310
your environment, it's also anti-inflammatory,
it has anti-cancerous properties and it's

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.709
also, it contains beta-carotene as well which
is a beneficial plant compound for your health

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.659
and wellbeing, also in carrots and other fruits
and vegetables as well.

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:27.599
It's mineral rich, it's vitamin rich, it also
has some b-vitamins in it, some mineral, vitamin

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:32.600
rich, fiber rich, and it's rich in sulfur,
and it's very very beneficial for your health

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.330
and wellbeing and your digestive system specifically
as well.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.731
So, the other cool thing about them, one thing
that i've noticed personally is that when

00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:44.759
I lived in costa Rica I ate a lot of coconut,
I had coconut pretty much daily and I had

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.210
a lot of radishes as well and both of them
are round and circular and they're white in

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.439
color and what I found was that my eyes seemed
to become whiter and brighter, so I believe

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.599
personally that radishes, coconuts and fruits
and vegetables that have a white internal

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.849
core help to whiten your eyes and keep those
healthy and it makes sense too because they

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.569
have potassium, magnesium, and all the different
minerals, i'm not sure if calcium is in them

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:15.740
but all the different minerals that are white
colored make up components of your body like

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.210
your teeth and your bone structure, the structure
of your eyes and things like that so I think

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.600
radishes and coconuts and things like that
are beneficial for keeping your eyes white

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.599
and keeping your eyes just healthy overall.

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.860
So, great for your digestive health, great
for anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory, mineral

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.759
and vitamin rich, they're great on salads,
I just clean them and I chop them up into

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.479
little little slices and it adds a nice little
crunch and pungent flavor, a little tangy

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.011
to the salads that I make so get more radishes
in your diet and your body and your health

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.550
will be thankful for it.
