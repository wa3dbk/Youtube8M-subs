Eugenie Kithchen.

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:05.100
Hello,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.419
Yesterday you watched a few Vine videos, here
goes more videos in full resolution.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.679
This is a salad video.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:30.310
This is how I make cherry tomato salad.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:45.410
I started posting simple breakfasts on my
blog.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.940
And here goes rice cake snack with a banana.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.570
I love the colors of these rice cakes.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.739
I made one more vid with them with a fish
plate.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.430
I didn't know this plate could come handy
like this.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.960
And you watched it yesterday.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.720
This is how to make little hearts in soup.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.890
I used heavy cream and pumpkin soup with red
beans and sticky rice.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.640
It's Korean style.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.409
And I made this for fun.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.580
You can call it Winnie the Pooh with rudolph
nose.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.729
And these are my whisks.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.100
I love the shapes and colors.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.299
And I went for skiing early last month.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.000
There were a lot of snows.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.200
It was beautiful.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.340
And I really loved it.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.880
This is good morning video, you see?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:15.050
I also post some photos and videos taken during
my morning walk.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.190
And this was for Chinese new year.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.280
Happy new year!

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.470
And this was for Valentine's day.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.180
This was my very first Vine stop-motion video.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.470
Back then my video was so simple.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.850
And now..

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.830
I make videos like this.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.570
Haha.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:59.360
A lot of improvement.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.420
Thank you for watching.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.360
Bye for now!
