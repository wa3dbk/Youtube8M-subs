Hi everybody and welcome back.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:15.049
This week i have just passed the 2000 subscribers
milestone, to be honest i never thought i

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.300
could reach this far, but with your help and
support i managed to do so.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.890
I want to thank everybody that supports my
channel, all the subscribers and everyone

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.510
that will subscribe in the future, you are
always welcomed.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:40.500
And here we have my latest finds, another
one of the Muppets cars and yes, this is still

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.410
from the older batch of Muppets that i found
in that store at the beginning of this year,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.770
or the end of last year, i am not exactly
sure.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.720
But there are the same cars, i told you that
because of the price nobody is going to rush

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:08.030
and buy them, so i have four so far, i am
just missing the Ford Sedan Delivery and the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.210
Midnight Otto, which were still on the pegs
in that store,so i have high hopes i am going

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.470
to find it.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.850
And in my stores we have the same old mixes,
the 2014, which i think it is the B mix.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.630
And i don't know how i managed to find this,
it was right in front of the pegs and it's

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.350
the Mazda RX-7.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:43.119
You guys probably know this is a 2013 Treasure
Hunt, i had eight and with this one i have

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.189
nine so far from last year.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:55.390
This is a nice Treasure Hunt, i like it, so
i was very surprised to find this one.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.079
Let me know in the comments below, did you
ever find and older Treasure Hunt ? I managed

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:10.519
to find a Treasure Hunt for this mix, the
2014 t-hunt and, i don't know, maybe you guys

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.420
don't agree, but this is one of the ugliest
Treasure Hunts.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:25.330
This is the t-hunt logo, on the back there,
of course this is more for kids, this is a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.390
kids car.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.970
This is why i always say that the older way
of the green striped t-hunts were better for

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.239
the regulars, do only for the regulars, because,
let me give you and example : something like

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.450
this, for that sign i don't feel anything,
i don't feel it is a t-hunt, but in the past

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.840
even if you find something ugly like this,
but still had that green stripe that sayed

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.260
Treasure Hunt it had a different feeling.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.021
you felt like you have a t-hunt, this time
i don't feel anything, you guys should let

00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.100
me know what you think about this.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.489
But i do agree with the Super versions, the
made and they had a very good idea with the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:21.230
Supers, but not with the regulars, i loved
more the green striped on the regulars.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:30.250
So this is just my seconds Treasure Hunt for
2014, yeah i know, very unlucky for me.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.780
So these are all the finds for today, it has
been a while since i found two Treasure Hunts,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.740
two different Treasure Hunts in the same day,
so i can say it has been a good day.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.610
on the pegs the same old mixes, nothing new,
i am still waiting for the new mixes, so i

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.000
can find at least the New Models.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.280
Thank you for watching, don't forget to check
my other videos and see you next time.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.120
Happy collecting and bye bye.
