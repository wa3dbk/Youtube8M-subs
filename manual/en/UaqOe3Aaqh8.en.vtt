00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.730
Upgrade your card game
with Black Playing Cards.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.670
These cards are a
fully playable deck

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.770
with a striking visual style.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.920
Each card features
modern illustrations

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.270
printed in glossy black
ink on a matte black card.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.960
The glossy finish catches
and reflects light,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.900
making them perfectly
readable to the cardholder.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.380
The good looks of
the all-black cards

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.740
don't sacrifice playability.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.450
Black Playing Cards
are a standard deck

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.060
of 52 cards in four
suits plus 2 jokers.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.119
So aside from the
enchanting design,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.920
there's nothing magical
about Black Playing Cards,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.100
although you can
perform magic with them.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.789
Let's go explode some minds.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.657
I want these guys.

00:00:51.036 --> 00:00:53.360
Do you guys want
to see some magic?

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.930
No way.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.840
Is that Kryss?

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.290
That's Kryss Kadabra.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.450
Yeah.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.210
Yeah.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.760
Go ahead and pick
a card, any card.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.461
All right.

00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:00.120
OK.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.540
Sign it with this, please.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.290
Sign it with this.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.000
OK.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.750
When you're done,
show it to the camera.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.620
OK.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.744
Put it back in the deck.

00:01:10.744 --> 00:01:11.956
OK.

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:13.710
I'm going to shuffle them.

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:17.394
This is crazy.

00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:22.290
I love this guy.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.970
Is this your card?

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.690
No.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.660
No, that's not my--

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.020
I thought he was
better than this.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.445
That's not my card.

00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:30.920
Well, how is everything
tasting at least?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.846
It's all right.

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:32.720
Pretty good, I guess.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.446
Why don't you take a bite of
your Boombastic Baconburger.

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:37.739
OK.

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:38.238
What?

00:01:38.238 --> 00:01:40.630
No way.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.720
No way.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.830
What?

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.760
What the crap?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.370
What?

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.430
No way.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.240
That's my card.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.060
You've got to be kidding me.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.610
That's my card.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.685
How did he get it in the burger?

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:49.518
It was in my burger.

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:50.450
Where did he go?

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.370
Is he--

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.270
There he is.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.920
Can I get you guys started
out with any appetizers today?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.420
Kadabra.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.270
I recommend the triple dip.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.539
It's like a buffalo
wing sauce, and then we

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.270
top it off with some wontons.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.011

(SINGING TOGETHER)
Happy, happy birthday,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.420
from all of us to you.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.630
We wish it was our birthday,
so we could party, too.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.230
Hey.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780
Hey.
