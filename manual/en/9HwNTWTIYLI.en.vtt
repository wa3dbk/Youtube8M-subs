00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.260
Warwick was once a man revered for his ability
to track down human specimens for the darkest

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.000
types of scientific research.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.540
When his ambitions exceeded his physical limits,
he drank a dangerous elixir to transform himself

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.400
into an unstoppable manhunter.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.120
His newfound strength bore a heavy price.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.160
Before his transformation, Warwick found his
calling in Zaun as a ''procurer'' of human

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.820
test subjects.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.149
Known for his crafty methods and ruthless
determination, people regarded him with a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.430
cautious mixture of fear and respect.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.950
As his reputation grew, so did the demands
placed upon him.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.400
His clients wanted more rare and dangerous
specimens, and they wanted them sooner.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.460
To meet their demands, Warwick needed strength
that transcended his limited human form.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.450
His longtime friend, Singed, devised a powerful
formula.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.820
The recipe called for three critical components:
silver from the Shadow Isles, the fang of

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.740
a Balefire dire wolf, and the heart of a celestial
being.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.970
Warwick tracked down the first two in short
order, but the third proved a much greater

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.430
challenge.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.190
He traveled to Ionia to trap Soraka, a creature
believed to be a child of the stars, but she

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.160
discovered his ploy and drove him away with
powerful magic.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.510
Unable to tolerate his failure, Warwick returned
to Singed disfigured and furious.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.920
He demanded the chemist's incomplete potion,
but Singed warned him that the results would

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.950
be unpredictable.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.590
Ignoring his friend's warning, Warwick drank
the concoction.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.360
The brew transformed him into a creature both
man and wolf, infusing him with raw strength

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.940
and heightened senses.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.280
Exhilarated, he immediately began testing
his newfound power.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.000
Each day his instincts became sharper, but
his human half slipped further away.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.430
He could feel himself losing control: though
he always got his prey, he often failed to

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.430
bring them back alive.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.910
Now he seeks the heart of Soraka to stabilize
his transformation before his mind gives way

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.010
to the feral urges of the beast.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:32.760
''Eventually the beast catches up with all
of us.''

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.960
