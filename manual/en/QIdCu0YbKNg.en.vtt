00:00:05.108 --> 00:00:07.108
Hi and thanks for joining me welcome to another 
 addition of my 12 weeks of Halloween...

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.310
This is a mummy pillow box.

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:15.305
It will hold all kinds to treat size candy...

00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:37.271
I have gone ahead and cut out the Pillow Box die...

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:43.308
I cut a piece of Naturals Ivory card stock that measures 8-1/2 x 5-1/2...

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.046
I used this part for the pillow box...

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.648
and I'm going to use this part...

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:53.455
for the layers on him...

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:02.836
I'm folding this on the score lines...

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:17.093
The first thing I'm going to do it seal this side with adhesive...

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:20.612
I'm going to use my Sticky Strip...

00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:38.758
I want to make sure that I attach these 
 layers to the front of the box...

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.520
I consider this the back of the box...

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.600
because this flaps over like that...

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:48.840
I'm just going to leave it flat like 
 that while I work on the layers...

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.380
Start with one end and just tear down the side...

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:55.960
flip it when you start to tear the next row..

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:01.350
I want the tear of each side...

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.320
you don't want these pieces perfect .

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.330
there meant to be messy...

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640
I think I determined that I needed 7 or 8 pieces...

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:29.920
We are going to sponge with the Soft Suede ink...

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.830
Now we are going to assemble these pieces..

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.200
I'm going to take my Snail Adhesive to attach the layers...

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.450
Now we are going to trim off the extra..

00:03:38.755 --> 00:03:40.760
make sure you don't cut the side of your pillow box...

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:51.300
Check to see if any of the pieces peel back 
 up and you will need to add extra adhesive...

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.540
We are going to use the 3/4" Circle Punch 
 and the 1/2" Circle Punch for the eyes...

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.970
2 Whisper White card stock 3/4" circle and 2 Basic Black 1/2" circles...

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:18.520
Use snail adhesive to attach the eyes...

00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:41.590
Close the one end with Sticky Strip...

00:05:22.873 --> 00:05:24.870
So there you have it... if you have any questions let me know....Thanks!
