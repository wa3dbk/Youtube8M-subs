00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.190
 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.990
hi I'm Joe Weisenfelder with cars dot com

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.660
near the 2008 Lexus I S F

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.689
is their new designation like BMW's Anna
and Cadillac v-series

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.540
its their souped-up version of the IS
250 and 350 I'll give you some ideas

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.220
what makes it different from the base
car as you can probably tell

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.669
it's a little bit more ball this no hood
region a kinda looks like a beluga whale

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.460
that's the fed a much larger engine

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.750
on it's a couple inches wider you got
'em

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.829
larger grille here and actually huge
brake cooling ducts in the front now the

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:42.489
brakes

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.690
in the front are six piston calipers
with cross drilled rotors

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.859
they do a good job of stopping the car
but they are a little bit gradi we've

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.170
found along with the wider fenders are

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.390
wider and deeper cell extensions now the
wheels are larger on this car there 19

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.429
inches compared to the regular I S

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.539
up but unfortunately the tires are only
about one inch maybe less than one inch

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:03.210
wider

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.030
than they are on the regular I S and
this is a rear wheel drive car with over

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.190
400 horsepower

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.360
%ah in my opinion you need a lot more
rubber back here

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.460
other features unique to this car a
larger spoiler on the trunk lid

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.160
and also these kwan tailpipes this is
strange with notices on the LS sedan to

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.380
they aren't really connected to the
exhaust pipes they're actually part in a

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.990
bumper

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.510
and the pipes blow through their but
it's kinda weird

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.780
now why does it have an enormous Obama's
heard like a beluga whale

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.470
for the best possible reason it's a
giant 5-liter v-8 that takes place

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.640
Ave 3.5 liter v6 any IS 350

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.620
the thing put up for 160 horsepower
which puts that right now league with

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.710
the BMW and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.140
three now there's also F badges
obviously all around the car they were

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.870
nice blue accent around then actually
carries over

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.260
into the inside a car there after badges
on the outside

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.350
on the seat cushions you got blue
stitching everywhere

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.630
and eventually incorporated the blue
into the perforations

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.900
on the sport seats there's also a unique
the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.009
is Ryan panel on this one special
cluster with the F on it and blue gauges

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.510
again the blue carries over

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.110
are we really like this design here the
center it's kind of a wall than aluminum

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.640
it's kinda like a cross between aluminum
trim

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.780
and the carbon fiber weave its really
very effective people been impressed

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.150
with it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.800
a people have been equally unimpressed
with the center console in the back seat

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.890
now the regular I S has a three seed a
back seat this one actually is just two

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.530
buckets

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.590
it's not a problem in that regard but
that hard plastic Center

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.490
I is an issue for people I don't know
why that and you something richer

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.810
now refer you to my full review for all
the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.240
performance aspect of the car but I have
to mention of course this is the first

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.700
car

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.600
with a eight-speed automatic I in a
production model

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.390
and it is controlled either with the
stick or with these

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.150
paddle shifters now %uh the short
version is yes it's impressive

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.290
I ships very quickly and it works well
in automatic mode too but honestly

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.060
I want a manual transmission I want to
drive the car myself

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.340
for additional information on this car

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.900
