Hi! I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now I'm
going to show you how to display our baby

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:13.681
carriage watermelon. I've chosen a nice oval
platter to go with our oval shaped baby carriage.

00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:20.730
You can choose anything that you like. If
you want you can line the platter with lettuce

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:30.619
leaves. I'm not going to because I like the
white lacy look of this platter with our baby

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:39.640
carriage. I'm just going to set it on there.
Now, you want to take some nice strong wooden

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.190
skewers and you're going to take an orange
because we're going to cut orange slices to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:56.030
fit on there. In fact, you can precut the
orange slices. Make them fairly thick. Don't

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:05.229
make them too thin or they'll get wealthy.
You may actually not use the ends of orange,

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:15.420
just the center, to get some nice thick wheels.
You hold the wheel up to judge where the skewer

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.329
will go in. You just push the skewer in. If
it's difficult to push in, you can mark and

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.930
poke a hole with a knife first and then push
it in. Then you want to be careful where it's

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:38.549
coming out on the other side. You may want
to manipulate it a little bit until it comes

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:47.549
out on the other side. Now, this skewer is
very long. After we put our fruit on it we

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:56.630
can cut it off. We're going to need 4 wheels.
Down over here by the handle section we're

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:08.350
going to put another skewer through and it's
coming out here. Now, we'll put our wheels

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:20.980
on like that and like that. On the other side
you'll do the same. Then you'll want to hold

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:34.480
them on with a piece of fruit. You can use
grape, you can use strawberries if you have

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.159
strawberries in season. I like these grapes.
If you want real fancy you can put a kiwi

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:49.650
there and then something else. You do that
on both sides. Now we're going to fill. We're

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.709
going to take the watermelon that we took
out of the watermelon we're going to put back

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:02.079
in now. You can just dump that all in there.
Then you might want to add a variety of other

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:10.870
fruits to mix in there. I have some honeydew
melon; some purple grapes, some green grapes,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.409
and then you fill it up to make it look nice
and full.
