00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.680
We’re in Borgou, in northern Benin between Nigeria and Togo,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.880
 home of the Bariba and Betamaribe groups of the Somba people, 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880
one of Africa’s oldest tribes.  

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.640
Formerly hunters, today they also grow crops and keep livestock

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.480
but hunting is still more for them than just a way to acquire food.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.640
They hunt in small groups led by a chief. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.960
Their arrowheads are treated with Strophanthus, 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.480
a deadly poison that they get from a plant. 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.000
 Every May, a number of tribes come together for the hunt. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.160
The hunters set out from their villages playing flutes and beaded rattles.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.760
 The Council of Elders selects a meeting place. 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.280
The hunt is very important for the Somba people. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.640
They hunt to eat and to demonstrate their courage and intelligence. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.080
Special powers are attributed to the hunters,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.720
 particularly to the chiefs, 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.000
who have the ability to neutralize the animals that they are going to hunt. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.360
When everything is ready, they’ll give the order to set out.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.560
 No one knows how long they will be in the bush, 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.440
and the hunt may sometimes last for weeks. 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.720
The Bariba use hunting lures. 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.880
Of all the Somba groups they have the most ingenious hunting techniques.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.600
They hunt antelopes, zebras, monkeys, 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.800
elephants, buffalo and all kinds of birds. 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.640
This camouflaged hunter moves silently across the land. 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.440
He knows the terrain and the behaviour of his prey intimately.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.120
 If luck smiles on them and they take down a large animal, 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.960
they will carry it back home to cut into pieces and share all around.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.680
 Forest rangers allow the Bariba to hunt, 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.280
but not so the poachers who use rifles rather than arrows

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.640
 and sell ivory and tusks on the black market.
