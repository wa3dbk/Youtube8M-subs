00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.420
There are four valves in the heart.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.240
What heart valves do is they open and close
and when the heart beats, generally the heart

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.850
valve opens, then when the heart relaxes,
the valve closes and this allows the blood

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.490
to go in one direction.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.540
The most common valve that we operate on is
the aortic valve.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.620
This is the aorta.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.640
This is the large artery leading out of the
heart and if I were to remove this, under

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.870
here, you would see the aortic valve.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.280
The aortic valve is the window of the heart.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.390
It's the last valve the blood sees before
its ejected out to the body.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.050
In the case of aortic stenosis, thereÕs a
blockage in the valve and the valve has trouble

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.370
opening.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.760
You can't ususally replace the aortic valve
because itÕs typically heavily calcified.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.510
We need to replace the valve and we do that
by cutting out the valve and replacing with

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.100
a prosthetic valve.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.489
There are two choices of prosthetic valves.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.180
Basically, thereÕs mechanical valves and
there are biological valves.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.329
The mechanical valves are made out of a phosphorylated
carbon compound.

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:21.289
The white cloth is where we place our sutures
and thatÕs how we implant it into the heart.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.579
In this case, its what we call a bi-leaflet
valve.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.219
In this case when we open you can see there
are two leaflets.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.590
When it closes the leaflets come together
like that.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.329
The mechanical valve or people often refer
to it as the metal valve, lasts pretty much

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.329
forever.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.009
ThatÕs a great thing but there are a couple
downsides to the mechanical valve.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:52.259
The one is they can often have a clicking
sound so on a patient who is thin, you may

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.289
actually hear the valve clicking.

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:02.569
The other thing is the mechanical valve requires
blood thinners like Coumadin for the rest

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:03.569
of your life.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.840
Now Coumadin is a pill you would take once
a day and once a month you would have to have

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.980
your blood tested to make sure your blood
is adequately thinned.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.310
The other option is a series of biological
valves: the two most common biological valves

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.980
are the pig valve or porcine and cow valve
or bovine valve.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.360
This is an example of the pig valve or porcine
and this is an example of the bovine or cow

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.360
valve.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.100
WhatÕs interesting is that the pig valve
is literally the pigÕs, valve.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.090
The company harvests the valve of the pig
and creates this stent around it so youÕre

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.250
actually using the pigÕs valve.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:57.800
The white part again is the sewing cuff and
you can see the valve tissue inside.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.730
The cow valve is not actually the cowÕs valve.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.500
It is cow pericardium which is the lining
around the heart that they make into a valve,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.880
in other words, you can think of it as small
pieces of leather that is made into a valve.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.360
It just happens to be made out of a cow.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360
So, whatÕs the difference?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.560
Well both are very good.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.120
The advantage of a biological valve is you
do not need any blood thinners except maybe

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.560
a baby aspirin each day.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.510
The biological valves do not make any clicking
sound.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.910
The downside of a biological valve is that
it might not last forever so we typically

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.350
will put these valves in patients who are
65 years of age or older, and particularly

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.090
in patients who are 70 and older and we believe,
we hope in patients who are 65 or 70 years

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.820
old and up, that it will last maybe 15 or
20 years.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:07.690
Well the good news is that nowadays if a biological
valve doesnÕt last 15 or even 20 years, we

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.530
have a new procedure known as TAVR or transcatheter
aortic valve replacement where we can actually

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.090
leave the old bioprosthetic valve in place
and put a new one in with catheter techniques.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:28.850
Now that technology is evolving but its fair
to say that patients with bioprosthetic valves

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.880
that wear out, most likely wonÕt need a second
open procedure; likely they can be treated

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.759
with the new TAVR or transcather aortic valve
procedure.
