00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.749
anyone else golden bahut zero

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:41.150
stephen hawking believes in alien cell i
feel like that

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.940
webwork morning evening knocking whether
or not they visited a high school with

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.830
really that's the before we get to the
aliens exciting that's in if i'm

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.909
probably the more about the c_i_a_ to
campaign for one thing

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.150
he he said that he has been interested
in this roswell incident like this whole

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.480
career fifty-five

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.350
comes across the basically is in the
warehouse with our could cover that was

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.590
put whatever if i could find prideful
cardboard box in the evidence then take

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.620
any of it

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.270
lengthening not showing us he didn't
take any for himself when do you think

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.940
that exactly is that i felt pictures and
documents and yes one hundred and says

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.730
that were alive when it and also that
the reason we're supposedly in this is a

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.389
thirty five-year stages

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.790
did anything to do with billions are
used for you know i wanted to see how

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.310
yanning dot how are things that people
have worked at the c_i_a_ yahoo stratus

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.900
guys i have is a sponsor for nus ac

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.230
and was there i thought you right will
always have a yahoo show anybody

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.699
announcers are way down and yourself a
god help

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:44.699
he has pictures definite plans i wish i
mean i think maybe later

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.099
billions and billions of dollars in the
middle of the afghan we've made the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.489
front lines actually think was linkedin
article you were talking about about the

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.269
fact that we now have through the
certainty that their plants run most

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.649
starts japanese are rare thing like we
were to fought ray but the thing is that

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:09.569
media aside fireball licensed products
to magid the killings are gonna be like

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.330
that

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.560
free intermediates which is like this
new

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.989
retailing it would be like no sense

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.310
well that's what i selected out even in
previous like a big aliens wear helmets

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.630
and they use steering wheels like why
would we imagine that because like the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.350
vault somewhere else in the universe

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.720
they're wearing shoes and stuff well i
think we are products of our environment

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.020
and in waveforms involved towards what
day college in the environment has and

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.909
if there is some

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.860
of clean it out there somewhere terrace
it's possible and there are similar to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.279
like

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:46.279
being means with pat pai miscarried
state cream strong theory according to

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:48.279
your point color t_v_

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.809
reptilians once ruled that this planet

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.109
itinerary

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.809
now not going to have been visited beary
that well i guess you could see if you

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.439
were looking at that alicia ever telling
theory just like you look at the

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.939
evolution and

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.719
primates this is that the reason you can
do but wait it's actually quite in my

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:11.719
brothers yep after his pai rahul

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.509
he was in a city that he works in the
technology base of the self-proclaimed

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.509
you apologize inland

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:23.400
expert

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.060
and that there is a theory out there
with her jillian theory which is quite

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.199
interesting that that since there is two
different species that kind of

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.810
to me i didn't there's the primates to
displace item now and then there's a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.730
connecting the out they really believe
that morning

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.270
sydney saying the media

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.640
is that have run by the reptilians

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.779
that george bush's reptilian

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.709
and they have all the night

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:54.709
his comments on in the modern-day dillon
clearly not trample for now

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.229
caitlyn duran wineries and i'd love to
make stephen hawking

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.639
that bag a feeling in the air
conditioning really scared to have been

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.780
denominator i would even the brain power
to conduct their banks like we did have

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.619
a

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:16.580
really wet wet find facts and fiction
said to be sure that they

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.340
are at the debilitated their plan and
and they're looking for resource

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.590
management and you think

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.650
it again popular conspiracy theory then

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.929
the faculty knocking at the bright for
twenty minutes away as almost it

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:33.439
prisoners pieces can travel to us across
like here's what do you think i mean the

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:38.789
admission got up and i know exactly how
argentina on foreign israelis in a

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.210
leadership plan

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.870
trillions back

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.539
a computer scientist

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.780
but it is the

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:52.780
woodlands issue it's help
