00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:04.190
AMY RYAN: Hello.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.870
I'm Amy.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.160
ELMO: Oh, and Elmo's Elmo.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.096
AMY RYAN: And we're pretending
to be paleontologists.

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:08.480
ELMO: Yeah.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.707
Tell them what a paleontologist
is, Miss Amy.

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:13.000
AMY RYAN: Sure, Elmo.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.910
A paleontologist is a scientist
who looks for and

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.778
studies things that lived
a long, long time ago.

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:19.694
ELMO: Yeah.

00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:20.610
Oh, oh.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.541
What kind of things that
lived a long, long

00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:23.440
time ago, Miss Amy?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.810
AMY RYAN: Well, paleontologists
study plants

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.560
that lived a long,
long time ago.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.230
And animals that lived a
long, long time ago.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.202
And even humans that lived
a long, long time ago.

00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:34.555
ELMO: What about dinosaurs
that lived a

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:36.170
long, long time ago?

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.800
AMY RYAN: Oh, yes.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.420
Paleontologists definitely
study dinosaurs.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.362
ELMO: Oh boy, oh boy!

00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:44.950
Well, can paleontologist Elmo
and paleontologist Amy study a

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.200
dinosaur right now?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.880
AMY RYAN: Well, sure, Elmo.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.450
Do you have any dinosaur
bones we could study?

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.150
ELMO: Well, paleontologist Elmo
has something even better

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.130
than bones.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.372
AMY RYAN: What's that?

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:56.818
ELMO: A real dinosaur?

00:00:56.818 --> 00:00:58.264
AMY RYAN: Huh?

00:00:58.264 --> 00:00:59.710
What?

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.674
Whoa.

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:02.060
You are a real dinosaur.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.320
DINOSAUR: Yes I am.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.530
Wanna study me?

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.625
AMY RYAN: Of course we do.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:07.875
We're paleontologists.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.470
DINOSAUR: Ooh--

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.123
ooh!

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:13.870
AMY RYAN: What's the matter?

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.333
DINOSAUR: You paleontologists
have cold hands.

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.280
AMY RYAN: Ooh!

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.255
Sorry.

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:19.505
ALL: Paleontologists!

00:01:25.936 --> 00:01:29.626
TRAIN: We were counting, finding
the amount then we

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:30.856
counted up to five.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.316
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.940
COUNTESS: Carson.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.310
Might I have some tea?

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.538
CARSON: At once, Mum.

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:50.370
Your tea, Mum.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.244
COUNTESS: Thank you.

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:53.558
Ooh!

00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:55.660
Why is the tea not
going in my cup?

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.550
CARSON: Perhaps because you
are upside-down, Mum.
