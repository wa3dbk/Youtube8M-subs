00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.299
Hi I'm Emily Larew, we're continuing on with
our beginning hip hop combination. We're on

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.750
count four, counts one through four. So if
you remember correctly, we are sitting here

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.100
on eight and. You are then going to drop your
right arm to the floor and we're pushing our

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.131
pelvis forward. Left hand comes to our heads.
So if you have a hat on, a hoodie, if you

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.600
wanted to put it up and add your hand on your
hoodie, whatever. You can play. So we're just

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.320
going to stop right there. You're already
here. We got lower to the floor so all you

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.510
have to do is push front, and we're on the
balls of our feet, no knee, no back here,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.050
right here. One, from here, you're going to
push off that right hand. You're going to

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.780
switch your left foot comes out straight and
you do switch to the left hand at the same

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.010
time. Alright? So we did one, push two, all
my weight was in my right foot. Your right

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.399
foot is going to cross over, three, and you're
going to the back corner, right hand on your

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:12.569
thigh and you're going to push up and pop
out and four as you turn around. So it starts

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:21.749
from being down here in the lunge, push up,
and four. OK? Let's do it again. And seven,

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:29.109
eight and one, flip, two, cross three, and
four. Alright? Take it back from the top.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:37.990
Five, six, seven, eight. A one and two, and
three, four, five, six, seven and eight. We've

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:47.229
got one and two, three, four and five, six,
seven, eight. And one, two and three, turn

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:56.979
four, five and six, seven and eight and one,
two turn, three and four. Good and that was

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.569
our count of eight.
