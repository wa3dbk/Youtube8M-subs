00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.280
O.k., now we have two hands that we can see
that one is a little bit thicker than the

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.130
other one; we have to reshape these. You know
this part of the hand it's thicker than this

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:22.410
one; that means we are going to reshape with,
like that all the fingers. And this out a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:37.640
little bit, but not that much and we're going
to do like this. And then now we need to start

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:49.470
reshaping in the hands form; except this is
going to be. Now you have to round the edges,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:01:12.920
round the edges; round the edges, you know
to make it like; look like a hand. Now we

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:23.689
need to make the forms of the bones that we
have in there. We will need an extra clay

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:48.920
to the knuckles here. Then we just there.
This one's a little bit too thin and we put

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:58.700
a little bit in here. Just try to shape; reshape.
And if we want like feminine hands we have

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:30.460
to think how long the fingers. When we have
this we can shape with a spoon. And then put

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:51.230
it in here and we try to bend the hand in
some kind of shape that, that we want. Then

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.610
this hand is going to be attached to the other
one. Then let's work with the other one.
