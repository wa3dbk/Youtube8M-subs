00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:06.040
What if there was a game, set on a world the
size of our planet with one universe

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.759
that all players lived within, that
allowed players to expand without limit

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.449
What if there was a game, that allowed
you to come up with your own playing

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:18.859
style that could be played an infinite number of ways
where the gameplay was as diverse

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.719
as the choices make in your own life

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.910
What if there was a game were survival
was necessary

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.310
weather it was real

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.239
safety was in numbers

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.259
The universe project is the most
ambitious and unique computer game

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.120
project ever undertaken

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.750
that seeks to reinvent the computer game
by creating a completely new genre...

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.470
the Virtual Parallel Universe

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.059
it begins on a planet devoid of
humanity and infrastructure

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.480
where the players invent their own

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.630
tools, skills, and weapons...band together

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.210
teach each other, and build together

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.700
This is the world modeled after our own

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.050
A simulation of humanity by humanity
as individuals

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.430
Just like massive online games of today

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.339
in the game, every character is a real
player

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.220
and each player 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.200
controls a single character in the game world

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.310
a player can pick apples to sell in a nearby town

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.500
or farm if they want

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.960
more efficiency

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.130
a player can build a boat to sail across rivers and lakes, or ships to get across the largest of oceans

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.260
players can steal

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.690
what they do not have

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.590
or raise armies to conquer

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.180
entire villages or even empires

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.549
a player can start his own village, governed by
his own

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.050
rules, or mastermind the building of the nation

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.720
fueled by economic growth and stability

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.880
the game environment will be enormous, and
it will start on a planet

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880
the actual size of Earth

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.890
 To put this into perspective, if a player were to attempt to walk

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.910
completely around the game world,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.360
it would take just over a year

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.970
We wont be stopping at a single planet
however,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.630
as the game progresses, and players
continue to advance their technological

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.140
strengths eventually all space will open
up to them

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.130
How you succeed in this ever-changing
world depends on what interests you most

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.530
about it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.030
What would you do?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.010
