A  tree and it's fruit

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.440
This tree produces GOOD fruit

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:55.061
But there are bad trees in the outdoor industry

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.445
that have been producing BAD fruit

00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:01.062
I would consider that WOOD

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.820
how ironic that the first segment

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.850
of this snake oiler

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.280
spotlight is gonna be dedicated to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.070
mister ... doctor should I say

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.380
Grant Woods the great doctor

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.960
Grant Woods  this segment's gonna be about

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.420
Wood's  highly inaccurate and totally

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.800
misleading statements about dear eating

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.700
and using

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.850
soybeans as they're drying check in the
information this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.729
for more information in the future and
publishing for

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.950
for information

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.230
more irrefutable  FACTS verifying

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.040
what I have to say

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.079
more  irrefutable FACTS

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.350
verified these people are nothing

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.370
more than snake oil salesmen
