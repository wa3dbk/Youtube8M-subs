Hi I'm Cameron from Yamaha Music Australia,
and I'm here today at Better Music to talk

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:14.860
you through our two beginner saxophones, the
YAS26 and the YAS280. So as I mentioned, there's

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.349
two options in the Yamaha student range of
saxophones. A lot of attention has been paid

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.339
to both models, in terms of their ergonomics,
the saxophone is obviously a little bit heavier

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.640
than the flute or the clarinet, so it is important
that they are comfortable to hold and therefore

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.160
easy to play for beginners.
Both instruments feature our low B/C# connection

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.750
which is a new design, and it's something
that our technician will adjust at the point

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.120
of setup or point of servicing, and suffice
it to say that it means that this part of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.730
the instrument stays well adjusted and that
the pads seal, and it makes it really easy

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.320
to play.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.690
Both instruments have our newly designed neck
receiver, it's a slightly more robust design

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.190
and this is designed to combat any potential
damage if the saxophone isn't stored in it's

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.520
case, like it should be, with it's end plug.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.520
The 26 saxophone comes with nickel plated
keys and a really durable hard case, and also

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.160
comes without a high F#. What that means is
it's lacking a key that is the high F# out

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.400
of the stave, and what that means is that
the instrument is just that little bit more

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.510
free-blowing for the beginning performer.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:29.290
The YAS280 has gold lacquer keys, it has the
high F# mechanism on it and comes with a really

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.540
good zip style case, has plenty of pockets
to carry all of your reeds and accessories

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.260
and straps so that you can carry it easily
like a backpack.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Both are suitable for your first year or two
of playing, but like I said, in your 3rd or

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.120
fourth year of playing you are probably going
to be utilising this high F# mechanism, so

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.820
with the case and the saxophone, my personal
recommendation would be there YAS280.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.020
Don't forget, all Yamaha brass and woodwind
comes with a 3 year warranty and just in case

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.310
something does go wrong you can take advantage
of our National Network of Aurthorised service

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.129
centres, or of course bring it back in to
Better Music and the team here will help you

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.450
out.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.180
So come in to Better Music, or have a look
at our website, bettermusic.com.au and the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.060
team here will be able to help you out and
