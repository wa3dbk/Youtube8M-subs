Hello, this is Michael McCarthy and in
this video we are gonna take a look at

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.210
using

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.280
Ornatrix and some of the Roots sub-object modes to

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.440
help your grooming of hair. So in

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.410
this model, a great model that was, provided by Turbo Squid to us

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.570
to do a few demos for you guys.
Wonderful models they're really nice topology.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.160
 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.609
And this character we've added some hair
to.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.099
And these are actually just Guides. They
were created as splines and then

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.000
we went through and a added some
symmetry in ground them to the mesh.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.829
And here's another video that
shows that process. In this video what I

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.040
wanted to kinda show

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.579
is how to edit those guides afterward so
if I add my Ox Edit Guides either from

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.809
here or the toolbar

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.789
you can see that with that symmetry I
might have a couple guides that are

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.250
crossing or they might be

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.000
very very uniform or symmetrical and we may want some asymmetry to this.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.059
I can go into root mode and I can

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.239
select one of these roots and I can
actually move it .So

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.199
if I click and move this I can kinda
drag it on the surface and that'll help

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.430
me move my guides around you know maybe
this one that's kinda

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.570
crossing over here. I can select multiples
at once. Kinda move this over so it's not

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.930
quite crossing anymore.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.340
And that will give me a little more natural feel to
the guides that I'm placing

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.619
on my model. Now the other thing I wanna
show is there may be a gap as you can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.100
see in here in places

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.210
and I can plant some new roots there
which is kinda nice so

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.829
under roots if I go down into Root
Operations you can see a Plant and

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:30.939
Remove, of course.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.500
Now the default is on which is
Interpolate Strands

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.549
and you can choose how many strands you
want to interpolate between.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.180
Either 2 or multiple 3 or no guide
interpolation

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.810
and with this on what's going to happen
is we're actually gonna get the shape

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.479
I'll show

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.350
with that off if I click on Plant you'll see that my hair

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.560
just kind i do get a new hair but I have
to go in and groom that.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.140
And if I have interpolation on and if I
click here

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.850
then you'll see that it will a groom
kinda with the other hairs. It will look at the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.719
hairs around it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.930
you know give us kind that shape. So you
can see here we

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.599
implanted a couple new hairs to fill out
our groom a little bit more and this

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.099
one's a little bit too far back

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.489
then we can go in and just select it,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.560
and move forward slightly. Grab that and
move it forward here

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.200
put it in a place where I'd like it to be in
place.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.170
So hopefully that help you when your
styling and grooming your hair.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.360
To go into sub-object Root mode

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.590
and either add some new roots and/or
move them into place where you need them.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.080
Thank you very much!
