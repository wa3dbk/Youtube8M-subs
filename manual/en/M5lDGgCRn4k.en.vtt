CHRISTIE OWNES: Hi, my name is Christie and
I'm with Expert Village and I'm teaching you

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.710
proper care of fish today and a little bit
about the different types of fish. Now I'm

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.849
going to teach you how to fill the fish tank
up. I've got the python on my hand with a

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.580
hose pinch so that the water cannot go out.
But the water is slowly dripping out of this

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.861
so you're going from the kitchen to the living
room. Be sure you can and be able to fast

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:25.590
walking in doing this. When you're going to
fill the tank up, put the head of the python

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.700
onto the sink and let go of the hose very
slowly so that you don't wash the fish out

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.110
of the tank. If you let it go too fast, you
can actually hurt your fish and bruise them.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.559
This process will kill them. There's also
a step of a chlorine remover which this one

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.359
is an aqua safe that I got. It removes chlorine
out of the water and what I'm going to do

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:50.769
is take the cap off, spurt a bunch in the
tank. Usually, it's one cap full for every

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.680
ten gallons of water but being a pro like
I am, I know how much water that I take out

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.530
of the tank which is about twenty gallons
of water. So now, in this bottle, I had enough

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.270
for twenty gallons that I just put in to it.
But as I'm filling the tank, I installed the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.230
python here into the tank and I put the chlorine
remover in there. And the chlorine remover

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.390
works instantly so you don't have to let the
tank sit. If you're not comfortable with putting

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.300
the python head into the tank with the chlorine
remover as I did, please feel free to make

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.040
sure you have five gallon buckets that are
clean that have not been used for chemicals,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.520
washing cars or soap in them. Fill the buckets
up with water, add the chlorine remover to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.380
the buckets of water and then you can pour
them into the tank. But if you're comfortable

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.060
with doing your water changes as I have shown
you here, then, you can also do this way as

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.490
well. This is you're kinda have more of the
professional people do water changes on our

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.650
fish tank. But sometimes even doing this and
the water companies decide to put a lot of

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.010
chlorine remover in the tank and you can smell
it a little bit when you're going to adjust

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.730
your water temperature or when you drink the
water, you may add just a little bit more

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.500
chlorine remover to the tank to remove that
out. To fill the tank up, it'll approximately

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.020
take three to five minutes. It's not as long
as draining water out of the tank which you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.170
can see the water temperature--well, the water
level to the tank is rising very fastly. Our

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.720
time again at approximately 5 minutes to explain
more, I had to turn the tank back on what

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.201
the filter is going to do and finish with
the closing process on how to take care of

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:22.220
your fish tank.
