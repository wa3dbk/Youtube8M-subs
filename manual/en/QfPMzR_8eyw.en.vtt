Hi, I'm Sherry Watson, and today I'm going
to be showing you how to make one of my favorite

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.270
smoothies. What I love about this Avocado-Colada
is that it tastes like this great, sweet,

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.449
tropical drink; and yet it's a really healthy
smoothie. One of the main ingredients is chia

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.470
seed. Now, if you havent heard about chia
seed, it's really become the go-to

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.470
super food of 2013; and with good reason.
It's full of the omega-3 fatty acids, protein,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.980
lots of antioxidants. And one of the main
things about chia seeds is its full of fiber.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.440
In fact their are eleven grams of fiber per
ounce in the chia seed, which can help make

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.950
you feel full throughout the day, so then
you're not grabbing those high-cal snacks. And so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.250
with all the healthy fruit that's in this,
plus the chia seed; I use the smoothie as

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.140
a healthy meal replacement. In fact, I love
it for breakfast. It's a great way to get

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.110
your day started, give you that energy that
you need that will keep you going throughout the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.060
day. So, lets start with the ingredients.
Here's what you will need.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.920
 So you can just start putting the ingredients right in your blender. I start with the pineapple, 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.460
which pineapple is really good for you; its anti-inflammatory,so it's really great for your body overall...

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.619
I missed one. And then your avocado, which,
avocado- you can't find anything better for

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.689
your skin, than avocado. And you use a whole
half of an avocado in this so it's really

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.989
great. Keeping your skin nice and bright and
clear. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:12.560
Put in the chia seed, your juice, and I like to use organic juice, some filtered water, nice and cold, especially if you haven't

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.980
used ice or frozen fruit, because we want
the smoothie to be nice and cold. And then

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.740
your lime juice...get this without spilling
it. 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:35.220
And a pinch of salt...if you wish. You don't have to put salt in. I like a little sea salt. And then you just blend this for

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.560
a few minutes, and it's ready to go. 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:52.060
And so after you get this blended...you're ready go...ready to taste, the best part.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.340
And  there you  have your avocado-colada smoothie, and I hope you enjoy it.
