00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:08.560
Have you ever heard the term,

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:09.728
"tip of the iceberg"?

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:11.895
You know that icebergs
are mostly underwater,

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.076
their immense bulk hidden
beneath the water.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.718
But why is that so?

00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:17.951
Well, the density of pure ice

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:19.942
is less than that of sea water.

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.216
Usually only 1/9
of the volume of an iceberg

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.638
is above the water.

00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:25.329
The shape of the underwater portion

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:26.474
is difficult to discern

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:28.750
by looking at the above-surface portion.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.309
This has led to the expression,

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.893
"tip of the iceberg."

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:33.727
Here are some thing you might not know

00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:35.235
about the icy islands.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:36.326
The life of an iceberg

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.825
begins many thousands of years

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:39.617
before it reaches the ocean.

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:41.655
Unlike sea ice or pack ice,

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.386
which form when the ocean freezes,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.569
glaciers are made of fresh water.

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:46.657
For thousands of years,

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:49.661
these glaciers build
layer upon layer of ice,

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:50.828
constantly compressing,

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:51.591
moving,

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:52.386
adding snow,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.084
compressing,

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:54.133
and moving again

00:00:54.157 --> 00:00:56.640
as they inch along like a frozen river.

00:00:56.664 --> 00:00:58.084
It is the force of gravity

00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:00.142
that pulls them towards the sea,

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.716
where a glacier may calve
off to become an iceberg

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.646
or continue to spread up as an ice shelf

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.083
or an ice tongue.

00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:08.523
Once an iceberg breaks away

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:10.239
from the glacier or ice shelf,

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:12.359
it will usually live
for three to six years,

00:01:12.383 --> 00:01:14.288
floating around, carried by the currents

00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:16.513
and tidal movements of the ocean.

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:17.732
As it floats along,

00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:18.899
it is battered by waves,

00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:19.653
melts,

00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:20.999
and smashes into land

00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:23.250
and sometimes other icebergs.

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:25.119
Some icebergs are so unstable

00:01:25.143 --> 00:01:27.206
that they have more dramatic ends,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.667
heaving up,

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:28.205
collapsing,

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.972
and sometimes even exploding.

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:31.281
And as they fall apart,

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:35.027
many icebergs make all sorts
of strange sounds.

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:36.717
When a piece of iceberg melts,

00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:38.168
it makes a fizzing sound,

00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:40.101
called Bergie Seltzer.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.364
This sound is made when
the water-ice interface

00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:45.606
reaches compressed air
bubbles trapped in the ice.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.955
As this happens, each bubble bursts,

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.369
making a popping sound.

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:53.991
There are six official size
classifications for icebergs.

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:57.158
The smallest icebergs are called growlers.

00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:59.566
They can be up the size of your car

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.121
and are very dangerous for ships and boats

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:03.697
because usually they sit
just at the waterline

00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:05.656
where they are not easy to spot.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.502
Next are the bergy bits

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.618
- yes, that is their scientific name -

00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:12.162
which can be up to the size of your home.

00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:13.996
The other four sizes are small,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.660
medium,

00:02:14.684 --> 00:02:15.372
large,

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.057
and very large.

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:20.147
So just how big is a very large iceberg?

00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:22.594
Officially, any iceberg looming larger

00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:25.646
than 270 feet high above sea level

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.766
and 670 feet long

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.324
is considered very large.

00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:34.140
That's 27 stories of looming, blue ice.

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:37.739
And how do icebergs get
that blue color anyways?

00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:39.133
When snow on the glacier

00:02:39.157 --> 00:02:41.242
is compressed over many hundreds of years,

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.244
the weight of the snow

00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:44.426
forces the air bubbles out of the ice,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.062
creating pure ice with very
little air trapped inside.

00:02:48.086 --> 00:02:49.330
This compression is seen

00:02:49.354 --> 00:02:50.863
when the glacier calves,

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:52.556
creating a blue iceberg.

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:54.867
An iceberg that has not experienced

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:55.876
as much compression

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.174
and has a large amount
of air and surface edges

00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:00.776
reflects light as white.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.604
Although they form in far
northern or southern areas,

00:03:03.628 --> 00:03:06.346
icebergs can float thousands of miles.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.002
An iceberg from the Arctic floated

00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:10.254
as far south as Bermuda.

00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:12.403
Antarctic icebergs are mostly trapped

00:03:12.427 --> 00:03:13.936
in the Circumpolar Current,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.147
never giving them a chance to float north.

00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:18.466
However, they have been known to interrupt

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.607
shipping lanes between Australia,

00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:20.361
South America,

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:21.967
and South Africa.

00:03:22.712 --> 00:03:23.903
For all their travelling,

00:03:23.927 --> 00:03:24.793
many people think

00:03:24.817 --> 00:03:27.608
that these slabs of ice
are barren of life,

00:03:27.632 --> 00:03:29.700
but these seemingly sterile ice slabs

00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:32.230
also harbor their own complex ecosystems

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:33.635
and they shape the ecosystems

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.081
that they pass through.

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:38.335
They become mobile, floating ecosystems.

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.597
Even in the coldest seas,

00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:41.088
icebergs are always melting,

00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:42.762
at least a little bit.

00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:44.340
This melting has a major impact

00:03:44.364 --> 00:03:46.388
on the ocean around an iceberg.

00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:48.057
The fresh water from the berg

00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:49.554
creates a pool of fresh water

00:03:49.578 --> 00:03:53.153
that can extend a nautical
mile away from the iceberg.

00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:55.729
This water is colder
than the surrounding sea water,

00:03:55.753 --> 00:03:58.325
and the temperature variation
creates thermal currents

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.346
in the vicinity of the iceberg.

00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:04.052
Life thrives on and around an iceberg.

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:07.615
Young icefish hide in small
ice holes to avoid predators,

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.287
while a variety of invertebrates,

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.317
like jellyfish and siphonophores,

00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:13.256
congregate in the area.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.646
Many of them come to feed on krill,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.067
tiny shrimp-like creatures.

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:19.091
Snow petrels nest on the icebergs

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:21.418
and feed on the sea life nearby.

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:25.230
Whales and seals and penguins
seem to like them too.

00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:28.394
And even now that you know all this,

00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:30.925
we're still at the tip of the iceberg.

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:31.978
There are all sorts of things

00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:34.085
we don't know about icebergs.

00:04:34.109 --> 00:04:36.509
Perhaps you'll be
the one to see a little deeper.
