00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.569
did you know up to 30% of all
steering comebacks are due to

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.879
contamination in the system

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.179
did you know O.E. manufacturers
recommend fluids types other than power

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.429
steering fluid

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.449
refer to application data for the correct
fluid type

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.539
did you know

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.759
there are substandard power steering
fluids distributed throughout the

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.219
aftermarket. Recent findings have shown
these fluids are prevalent in the

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:32.199
aftermarket and have been substantiated
by top fluid manufacturers. Sub-standard

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.650
fluids lead to premature, and in some cases,
instantaneous catastrophic failure

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.910
CARDONE has performed independent tests
on aftermarket fluids using

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.560
O.E. specifications

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.590
Go to www.cardone.com to
download a listing of recommended fluids

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.220
these common problems are easily remedied
by proper installation techniques

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.060
remember to 3F's

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.510
use a quality fluid

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.430
specific to your application

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.010
always flush the system

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.550
and install and in-line filter

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.820
A proper power steering flush should be
performed by two people

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.919
one under the hood

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:12.080
and the other to crank the engine and turn
the wheel

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.430
disconnect the return hose and let the
fluid drain out of the hose and pump

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.560
plug or cap off the return pipe

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.880
fill the power steering reservoir with
the O.E. recomended fluid type

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.290
it is very important to keep the
reservoir full of fluid throughout the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.510
entire flush process to prevent damage
to the power steering pump

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.420
as it is not designed to run dry

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.020
disable the engine ignition system

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.440
crank the engine in short bursts and
turn the steering wheel of the same time

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.040
turning the wheel allows the fluid to
pass through all passages in the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.740
rack &amp; pinion or steering gear

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.140
removing as much trapped contamination
as possible

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.649
continue to crank the engine, turn the
wheel

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.920
and fill the reservoir until the fluid
runs clear

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.690
if your application is not covered by
Magna-Pure power steering pump

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.340
install a Magna-Pure in-line filter
to ensure system longevity

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.310
A1 CARDONE's comprehensive Magna-Pure
program features both power

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.280
steering pumps with internal magnetic
filtration and serviceable in-line

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.709
magnetic filters covering the majority
of the vehicles on the road today

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.859
the exclusive, easy to install Magna-Pure
products provide affordable filtration

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.909
that has proven to prevent comebacks
caused by contamination

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.599
therefore every CARDONE Magna-Pure product
is backed by limited lifetime warranty

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.999
remember the 3F's when
performing any power steering installation

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.049
use a quality fluid specific to 
your application

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.839
always flush the system 
and install an in-line filter

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.739
these three simple steps will improve
customer satisfaction by preventing

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.659
comebacks
