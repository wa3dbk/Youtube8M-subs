What Surgery Do I Need to Correct my Eyes?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.330
My eyes are not even, they are completely
different.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.910
My right eyebrow is much lower than my left,
the right eyelid comes over the top of the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.210
crease.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.190
When I pull my right eyebrow up to match the
left, the eyes seem normal again.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.920
So is it my eyebrows that are the problem?

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.320
Which surgical procedure would you recommend
to correct this so that my right eye looks

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.989
like my left?

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.789
Just want to add, this uneven-ness has gotten
worse in the past year and a half.

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.660
3-4 years ago my eyes were perfectly even.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.640
Thank you for your question.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.399
You are describing a very common problem or
situation that we see in our practice which

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.760
is the asymmetry of the face resulting in
the asymmetry in the shape of the eyes.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.640
So your right eyebrow being much lower than
your left, if this is something that has always

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.360
been the case, well, then most likely, this
has to do with the natural bone structure

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.509
and the soft tissue overlying the bone structure
being something that's constant.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.989
We refer to a term called hemifacial microsomia
which means one side of the face is smaller

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:57.970
than the other side.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.899
Although you didn't send a full-faced picture,
you can take a look at yourself and notice

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.640
that one side of the face, the cheek is less
projected.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.470
So when you have this type of asymmetry, it
is natural that soft tissue tends to descend

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.670
relatively speaking.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.340
Sometimes the amount of volume in the upper
eyelid is such that it obliterates the definition

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.980
of the eyelid crease.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.420
So what I would do in my practice for someone
like you and this based on the photos, not

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.690
based on physical exam.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:46.520
Routinely in my office, I can help you look
more symmetric but I can't help you look 100%

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.560
symmetric.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:57.750
Essentially, it's about creating the balance
so that when we look at people, most people

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.140
are actually asymmetric.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.730
And so, typically in a situation like yours,
I would do an upper eyelid blepharoplasty.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.470
Basically, conservative removal of extra skin
over the eye to compensate for the relative

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.069
difference between the two eyebrow heights
and subsequently or consequently, the relative

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.550
amount of skin over the eyes.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.290
Now, in some colleagues of mine and sometimes
in older people where there's a lot of skin

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:37.920
elasticity of skin, sometimes they will actually
botox or relax the brow that's higher to bring

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.060
it down, again, depending on the patient's
aesthetic concern.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.310
Since you expressed a concern about your eyes,
I think that an upper eyelid blepharoplasty

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.709
done conservatively, done to match the crease
to the other side will probably be the most

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.300
practical solution for you.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.680
If there are issues with the dynamic activity
of the muscles in forehead, so botox and other

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.310
things can be implemented as part of your
strategy.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.539
But understand that we are beautifully imperfect
and that asymmetry is normal.

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.720
This being a particular concern for you, I
would say that the right upper lid blepharoplasty

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.160
is probably practical approach without being
too aggressive to try to give you a match

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.220
between the two eyes.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.100
So I hope that was helpful and thank you for
your question.
