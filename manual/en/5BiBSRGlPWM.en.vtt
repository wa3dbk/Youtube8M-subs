Hello and welcome to a new video

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.220
Today we will review the extremely rare and adidas Primeknit from a limited edition of 500.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.580
You’ve got a chance to win this boot. 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.160
To find out how stick around until the end of the video. Enjoy the video! 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.720
To begin with I had some problems with the adidas Primeknit

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.440
The boots left pressure marks and blisters at the front of the foot as it is rather small. 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.000
Following two to three training sessions it got better and the blisters went away as well

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.100
The feel for the ball is very good. 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.920
This is down to the very soft fabric which feels softer than leather

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.540
I did miss the zones which boots such as the Predator have got

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.680
This may prevented a higher rating

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.120
but doesn’t necessarily have to be a disadvantage

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.320
The quality of the adidas Primeknit is very high

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.900
This is of course suggested by the price, which demands a high-quality boot

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.880
Adidas have produced a high-quality boot so again it receives a maximum score

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.400
Let’s get to the verdict for the adidas Primeknit

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.760
Overall I had high expectations which was also down to the high price 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.660
which promises something exclusive

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.020
Most aspects were fulfilled

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.540
However, all in all I believe 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.880
that this boot is too expensive

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.320
Given the quality one could also purchase the adidas F50 in the leather version 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.820
which would also fulfil and even exceed most aspects

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.840
Anyone wanting to buy a high-quality and very exclusive boot should, of course, go ahead

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.740
After all the Primeknit is a very good boot that does a lot of things right

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.480
for everyone else I would recommend the aforementioned F50 in leather or the Tiempo 5

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.080
These boots are comparable and are much better value for money

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.680
Overall this boots gets 9 out of 10 points from me

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.920
You can win the adidas Primeknit (size 44)

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.540
