which said there are they are
insignificant lewis i must say

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.320
tomorrow's bonus show there's ever been
a better incentive to sign up i can't

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.130
think of one

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.150
let's talk about the twenty thirteen
state of the union address

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.750
we're gonna get into the content we're
gonna analyze this thing piece-by-piece

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.950
we're gonna look at everything

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.220
but first and some of the casual
observations no clarence thomas no

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.940
samuel alito no school leah

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.240
not unusual right now time for all of
the justices not to be there but i think

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.800
scalia had like a nother speech he was
doing for money that night

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.050
while yelled oh he prolly decided not to
go to the stadium in well before he

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.460
scheduled an appearance

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.850
reminiscing pierre nodal justices go but
it certainly no coincidence i don't

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.250
think the factory most conservative
justices aren't showing up i would have

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.700
liked to seize thomas their particularly
lest i really would like to see his

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.619
reactions

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.189
yeah if uh... you know i don't know if
it'd be anything like a leaders but

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.380
uh... right now

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.280
polina here

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.079
uh... joe biden was putting on a hell of
a show he was taking his glasses on

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.960
taking them off rubbing his eyes

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.240
folding papers on folding papers writing
notes down laughing when nobody else was

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.870
doing anything i actually was

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.120
i was listening to obama but watching by
dinner time because he was putting on an

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.560
incredible show

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.060
yet he seemed uh... like you just

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.999
want uh... get up and dance and shake
you know what to do with themselves so

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.799
they kept on like pulling a little
pieces of paper and writing on them for

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.969
like a split second yeah then putting on
back in his code used does it show it

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.340
was it was a very good show and the
funniest thing overall was watching the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.899
republicans unsure about whether they
should be clapping about certain things

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.690
and kind of like looking around and see
what is everybody else clapping it was

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.500
like they couldn't think for themselves

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.770
it was group think

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.970
but it was really poorly executed group
think louis where they couldn't figure

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.599
out are weak where what is our position
on this

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.810
semi awkward i mean you you should be
able to know exactly

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.810
uh... we're you let yeah

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.519

has hurt him

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.569
there think you have some computer
issues

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.390
uh...

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.929
unconcerned having issues yet you are

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:56.489

the stream while playing the video those

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.019
issues are let's get louis if we may

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:06.019
