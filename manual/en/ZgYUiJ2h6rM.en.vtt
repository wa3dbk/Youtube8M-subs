00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.310
How to Play Seven Card Stud.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.840
Seven Card Stud was the preferred game of
good guys and bad guys alike in the Old West—and

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.420
its popularity spread worldwide during World
War II thanks to American G.I.'s.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.700
You will need A standard deck of playing cards
Poker chips or money to bet with A working

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.660
knowledge of poker hands A group of 2 to 8
players and a table or surface to play on.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.660
Step 1.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.660
Choose a dealer.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.130
One way to do this is to deal cards around
the table face-up.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.260
The first player to get an Ace is the dealer.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.440
Step 2.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.399
The dealer shuffles and cuts the deck of cards.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.399
Step 3.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.250
Each player "antes up" by placing an amount
predetermined by the dealer into the pot.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.250
Step 4.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.090
The dealer deals around three times, distributing
a card at a time to each player, for a total

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.719
of three cards each.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.030
The first two cards—called "hole cards"—are
dealt face-down; the third card—called a

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.200
"door card"—is dealt face-up.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.200
Step 5.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.960
The dealer announces the lowest card showing,
and a round of betting follows, opened by

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.890
the player holding the lowest card and proceeding
clockwise to his or her left.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.810
The opening bet is called a "bring in" and
is usually a small, nominal amount.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.300
If two or more players hold low cards of the
same value, the cards are then ranked alphabetically

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.430
by their suit—club, diamond, heart, spade.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.670
So if four players hold Twos, the one holding
the Two of clubs makes the "bring in" bet.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.690
Step 6.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.869
The dealer deals a fourth card—called "fourth
street" or "the turn"—face-up to each player.

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.750
The dealer announces the highest card or hand
showing and a round of betting follows, started

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.120
by the player holding that high card or hand
and proceeding clockwise to his or her left.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.180
It's also customary for the dealer to announce
any pairs that may be showing after the fourth

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.399
card is dealt and any raises that occur during
betting.

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.509
Step 7.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.929
The dealer deals a fifth card—called "fifth
street"—face-up to each player.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.090
The dealer announces the highest card or hand
showing and betting again follows, started

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.060
by the holder of that high card or hand and
proceeding clockwise to his or her left.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.580
Step 8.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.790
The dealer deals a sixth card—called "sixth
street"—face-up to each player.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.150
The dealer announces the high card or hand
and betting again follows, started by the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.440
holder of that high card or hand and proceeding
clockwise to his or her left.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440
Step 9.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.450
The dealer deals the final card—called "seventh
street" or "the river"—face-down to each

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.450
player.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.330
The dealer announces the highest card or hand
showing and a final round of betting occurs,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.560
started by the holder of that high card or
hand and proceeding clockwise to his or her

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.560
left.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560
Step 10.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.980
When the betting has stopped, every player
still in the game turns their hand face-up,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.980
starting with the dealer.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.510
The player holding the best five-card poker
hand wins the game.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.190
Did you know A poker hand of two black Aces
over two black Eights is called a "Dead Man's

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.790
Hand"—according to legend, those are cards
Wild Bill Hickok was holding when he was gunned

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.420
down in 1876.
