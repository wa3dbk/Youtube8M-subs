00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.410
Hello boys and girls

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.400
This is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.920
Called "Abram follows God"

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.590
Today's memory verse is from 1 Corinthians 14:1

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.840
It says "Follow the way of Love"

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.990
The message for today's story is "Christian families follow God"

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.050
Have you ever moved to a new house?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.050
A new city or country?

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.460
Moving is not easy

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.960
There are so many things to pack

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.540
And so many friends to leave behind

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.050
A long time ago, God told Abram to leave his home and go faraway to another country

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.930
"Abram," a voice called

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.710
Abram looked around, he couldn't see anybody

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.400
Who was calling me he wondered

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.880
"Abram, I am the Lord, the God who made the heavens and the earth"

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.280
Abram stood very still

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.280
He even held his breath

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.210
He listened very carefully

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.860
God was really speaking to him

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.370
"I want you to leave this city of Ur"

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.060
"Leave your family's house and go to another land that I will show you"

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.820
God said, "I will protect you"

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.530
"I will bless you"

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.560
"And through your family the whole earth will be blessed"

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.530
God explained to Abram

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.650
that in his family many many years later

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.320
the Saviour of the world would be born

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.370
That Saviour was Jesus who would be born in Bethlehem

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.010
What God was asking Abram to do was not easy

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.660
But Abram and his wife Sarai wanted to follow God

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.610
So they packed all of their belongings

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.870
Abram was a wealthy man

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.340
He had large flocks of sheep and other animals

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.340
So, he and his servants gathered together all of his sheep and other animals

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.560
Sarai and her servants prepared tents for the journey

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.460
So, Abram and Sarai took everything they owned with them

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.130
They knew that they would not return

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.950
Abram's nephew Lot decided to go with Uncle Abram and Aunt Sarai

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.320
So Lot, his family and his servants packed all their belongings too

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.450
They gathered all of their animals and prepared tents for their journey

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.480
Lot was also a wealthy man

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.670
Though probably not as rich as his Uncle Abram

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.200
It would be a long, long caravan that would travel for many, many days

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.550
even weeks before reaching the special place God had for them

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.090
Finally the day came when everything was ready

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.720
Abram and Sarai got up early

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.450
The servants were up too

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.370
Lot and his family and his servants were ready to go

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.580
Everyone helped to load their belongings on the pack animals

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.060
At last, Abram, Sarai, Lot and all of their servants started down the dusty road

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.710
It was a long, long way to the land God wanted them to go

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.460
In fact, Abram did not even know where they were going

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.950
But he knew God was leading them

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.360
And that was enough

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.020
Abram, and all those with him, would follow God

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.160
