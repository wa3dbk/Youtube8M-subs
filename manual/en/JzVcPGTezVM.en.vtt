Hello! My name is Maja.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.820
Today I have visited Mrs Iza. Mrs Iza knows a lot about hair and I like to play different games with her.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.060
Together we do hairstyles for Zosia, Zosia is my doll.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.520
One day I would like to have so much hair as Zosia because I like hair very much and I do not have too much of them.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.680
I told Mrs Iza about it and she promised me that she will do  so that I will be able to do any hairstyles I want to!

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.080
I just have to wait until another child will share his hair with me…

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.500
Sonia – my best friend, visited Mrs Iza when we were playing together and she revealed her secret.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.980
Immediately after Mrs Iza took me to the big white room where there were many funny things and we waited for Sonia together.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.760
A child in adolescence time explores the surroundings and shapes his personality,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.080
Child’s hair loss  can disrupt this process,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.560
as a result of that he cannot fully enjoy his childhood,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.860
because he feels a little bit different in his environment.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:36.900
The solution of the problem can be non-surgical methods of  hair replacements or wigs made from natural, real childrens’ hair.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.020
Unfortunately collecting this hair is a big problem because of small availability.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.740
Often parents during their visits to the hairdresser or girls who wanted to have long hair on the occasion of Holy Communion, after the haircut they throw the hair away.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.700
We can sell the child’s hair in special points or give them to appropriate foundations.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.860
Acting in this way we can help save happy childhood of our children.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:26.980
Sonia smiled at me a lot and told me that she has gift for me and other children – great gift.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.560
She  gave me her hair and Mrs Iza could do so that I have the same hair as my friends have

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.380
Thank you for the best gift I got.
