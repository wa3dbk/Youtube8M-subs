00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.299
Did an elephant just fall out of the sky?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.240
I do believe... yes. It did.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.030
Hurry, Krishna! Bhima needs our help!

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.850
I think Bhima has help already.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.060
Though he knows it not.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.180
What... what just happened?

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.640
Someone threw an elephant at us, Sire. Most accurately, I may add.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.980
Why did they do that?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.380
They couldn’t find anything heavier?

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.820
Bhima. He’s in there. Even he’s not capable of such things.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.580
Is he?

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.490
I think we are about to find out.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.010
I should be dead a thousand times over.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.680
No way could I survive Bhagatta and his war-elephants.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.229
But someone, or something,

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.360
 has given me my life back.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.660
I’m not used to being rescued. It’s usually the other way around.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.140
Not that I’m complaining.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.140
Come here, Bhagadatta. We’ve some unfinished business.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.640
For a man with such a large reputation, you look a lot like an ant from up here.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.840
It’s easy talking big from on top of an elephant.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.430
Why don’t you come down and we’ll settle this man to man?

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.930
No, I’m happy up here.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.670
I said...

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.450
...come down!
