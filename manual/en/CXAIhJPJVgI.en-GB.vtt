00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:07.790
This is a tutorial on the sternoclavicular
joint. The sternoclavicular joint is this

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.860
joint here between the proximal end of the
clavicle and the manubrium of the sternum.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.220
You've also got the first costal cartilage
that is involved in this joint.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.590
This joint is a synovial and saddle-shaped
joint. I'm just going to isolate the structures

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.410
involved and we'll take a look at them in
closer detail.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.680
So you've got three articulating surfaces
in this joint. You've got the proximal end

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:48.489
of the clavicle, you've got the clavicular
notch of the manubrium and you've got the

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.380
first costal cartilage.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.470
So as this joint is a synovial joint, you've
got a joint capsule which surrounds this joint

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:06.610
and the articulating surfaces. This joint
capsule is lined by a synovial membrane and

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.460
it's strengthened by ligaments.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.241
In between the clavicular notch of the manubrium
and the proximal end of the clavicle, you've

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:25.110
got a small fibrocartilaginous disc. So you've
got an articular disc which splits the cavity

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.880
into two compartments. So you've got this
fibrocartilaginous articular disc sitting

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.280
in its articular cavity and separating it
into two compartments.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.799
So strengthening this joint capsule, you've
got four ligaments. The way to think of this

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.420
is just to think of the structures that are
involved and the names are logically named.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.920
So we know that we've got a costal cartilage
involved, we've got the manubrium of the sternum

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.130
involved and we've got the clavicle involved.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.880
The first ligament I'm going to talk about
is this ligament here. This ligament connects

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.930
both clavicles together, so it's called the
interclavicular ligament.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.920
And then the next ligament is this ligament
here which connects the clavicle to the manubrium

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.480
sternum. This is called the sternoclavicular
ligament. It's got two parts. It's got the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.849
part which you can see here from the anterior
view. So it's got an anterior part. And if

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:30.270
I rotate around to the back, it's got a posterior
part, so you've got an anterior and a posterior

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.660
sternoclavicular ligament.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.150
And the final ligament is this ligament here
connecting the costal cartilage to the inferior

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.629
surface of the clavicle. This is called the
costoclavicular ligament.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.700
So you've got four ligaments stabilizing this
joint. You've got one ligament connecting

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.209
the two clavicles, the interclavicular ligament;
you've got two ligaments, anterior and posteriorly

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.629
connecting the sternum to the clavicle, and
this is called the sternoclavicular ligament;

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.840
and you've got the ligament connecting the
inferior surface of the clavicle to the costal

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.650
cartilage, and this is called the costoclavicular
ligament.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.181
So in terms of the movements that you get
at this joint, they're fairly limited. They're

00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:26.159
mainly occurring in the anterior and posterior
plane and in the vertical plane. So you get

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.340
some anterior and posterior movement, but
you've also got some superior and inferior

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.980
movement. And then you get a very small amount
of rotational movement.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.150
That's a quick rundown of the sternoclavicular
joint.
