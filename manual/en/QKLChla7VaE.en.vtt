00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.790
I want to share with you the secrets of a
great parry in foil fencing. It's actually

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.410
pretty simple. If you want to make sure that
you maintain good point control, so remember,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.780
forefinger and thumb are controlling your
point at all times, fingers wrapped around

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.200
on the French grip. And, from an en garde,
your parries are small. You want to control

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.949
them with the point, with the tips of your
fingers, so that you're moving the foil just

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.100
enough to get your opponent's blade off target
area. That means that my parry four is never

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.409
going to be over here, it's just a quick easy
movement. And as much as I can, I want to

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.710
keep my wrist in-line here, because a broken
wrist is not a strong wrist. So you want to,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.160
well, a broken wrist is never a strong wrist,
but even a bent wrist is not a strong wrist,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.179
we call it broken when the line is broken.
You want to keep your arm, your wrist, straight

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.780
here because that's strong. And sometime your
attacks are going to be coming with a little

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.489
bit of force, so you need to have a strong
enough parry, so that you have the strength

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.269
to parry properly. So for all four basic parries,
there are a couple of extra's, but we're going

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.240
to talk about four, six, seven, and eight,
you want to keep your movements very small,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.549
inside the body, maintain proper point control,
and keep your wrist strong at all times. So

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.080
let's demonstrate the parries. 'K you're going
to demonstrate the foil parries in action.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:43.590
as she thrusts to my four, I will parry four.
Parry six. Parry four. Parry six. This is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.299
the parry seven. It?s on my low line, this
way my point stays as close to being in-line

00:01:50.299 --> 00:02:01.149
at all times. This is parry eight. Parry seven.
Parry eight. So the important part is that

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.249
you keep your economy of motion, and you keep
you point, as much as possible, pointing in.

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:10.920
You notice my parries didn't come out to the
side like this. My point is always, even though

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.060
my arm is bent, and it's ok to have a bent
arm for foil parries, the tip of my blade

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.810
is always close to target area. And the reason
is, of course, because as soon as I parry,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.380
I want to be in-line to make a riposte. To
make a solid attack, and score a touch. Which

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.330
is really what it's all about.
