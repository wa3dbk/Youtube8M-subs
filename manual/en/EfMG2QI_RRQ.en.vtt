00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.030
My week is always quite busy.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.360
There's not much time to myself because of the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.279
training with Hartpury and Gloucester, and I have to fit matches around that. Hartpury is

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.600
usually done early on in the morning to get
the training out of the way because

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.949
lectures don't really start until about
10. The level of coaching they've got here is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.060
of good quality. Both of the coaches are former

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.010
professionals, so the level of training is good. The facilities here

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.620
are incredible. It's all about trying to get
quick, fast rugby.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.909
The emphasis is on being dynamic. Off-loads,

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.710
quick play,  getting it away from rooks, nice and
quick. Hartpury is definitely a place to come if

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.330
you want to

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.460
excel in sport. All of our training is done at about the same time so we're always on a tight

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.040
schedule.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.210
Our lectures are always in the afternoon so training is always out of the way

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.720
in the morning. I'm in a marketing lecture.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.920
A lot of lecturers have industry experience which helps

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.760
in the lectures. They all have a sports feel
to them.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.010
It's a business-related topic though that focusses on
sports businesses

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.500
I think it helps us to engage more in the lectures because

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.800
it's what we're interested in. Any
gym and conditioning sessions fit around

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.560
our lectures.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.860
The gym is almost always open with the conditioner on hand.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.590
As you can see, we're in
the power gym at the moment. This is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.350
where a lot of the rugby specific
training happens. We've also got a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.250
cardiovascular gym upstairs and we've
also got the performance gym which is up

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.230
top.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.159
I've had an ACL injury, which
was a couple of years ago now.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.330
Luckily I had a very good physio on hand to get me back to training.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.460
At the moment, we are doing a lot of work to get my glutes active

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.960
because

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.840
that keeps your knees straight which hopefully will

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.870
prevent that injury from occurring again. Good quality control.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.070
Good.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.600
It's working on helping my ankle

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.840
whilst I work my rugby skills as well.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.100
I've just been training with Gloucester academy.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.720
We have an hour weight session then we

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.190
have 40 minutes to an hour of skills with a bit of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.690
speed tied in. How closely everything is tied in with

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.160
lectures and with training, so for instance,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.900
some days I can go up to lectures and come back down. If I were elsewhere,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.099
if it wasn't on the same campus as my uni, things would be a lot more

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.430
difficult, so it's very beneficial. It's national.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.700
You've got premiership, championship, nat one, nat two.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.720
If you come to play rugby, it's a good place to be.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.489
Our captain was playing in premiership last year,

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.180
we've got a prop who was with Bristol, a full-back who was with Bristol.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.260
There's a few lads involved in the setup with Gloucester academy as well.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.660
Hopefully the perfect mixture of
experience and young talent is coming through.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.049
If you want to be the best, you've got
to train against the best, play against the best. So

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.440
you can be a superstar but you go through a lower

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.739
league team and you'll be carving up every Saturday but you won't

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.700
improve as a player. You need to
really push your skill sets if you ever want to improve.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.450
And coming to a place like Hartpury, you'll get a good education but you can also combine

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.030
it with

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.720
top level sport.
