00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:04.433
- Which of the following
is a correct interpretation

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:09.066
of the expression one plus six?

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.656
Well before I even read
this, let's just think about

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:13.666
what's happening in one
plus six on the number line.

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.474
I'm going to start at one,
which is going to be one

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:17.200
to the right of zero.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.967
And then I'm going to add another six.

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:21.200
I'm going to go six more
to the right of zero

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.766
to end up at seven,

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.733
which is going to be seven
to the right of zero.

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:29.266
The number that is six to the left of one

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.733
on the number line.

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:34.200
Now six to the left of one,
in this type of a number line,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.700
which is the standard number line,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.533
where to the right is positive
and to the left is negative.

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.986
If you move six to the
left that means you're

00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:42.033
subtracting six from
one so that's not right.

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:43.733
We're adding six.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.571
The number that is six to the right of one

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:46.366
on the number line.

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.866
Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.700
We're going six to the right.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.966
If you're adding six
you're moving to the right.

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.700
You're going to increase.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.333
So that's definitely
going to be the choice.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's keep going.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.233
Which of the following is
a correct interpretation

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:04.833
of the expression three
plus negative seven?

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:07.067
So before I even look at these choices,

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.633
one way I would think about
it is I would start at three

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.300
and then I would move
seven to the left of three.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.066
I'm adding negative sevens.

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.000
So this is the same thing
as three minus seven.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.433
So I'd move seven to the left of three.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:21.033
So let's see they would say.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.700
Start at seven on the number line

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.133
and move three to the left.

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:24.933
Well that doesn't make sense.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.000
I want to start at three.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.533
And let's skip over to here.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.933
Start at three on the number line

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.533
and move seven to the left.

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.966
Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.366
We're going to start at three,

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.566
and then we're going to move seven

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.842
in the negative direction into the left,

00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:39.629
if our convention, which
is our standard convention,

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:41.129
that to the left is negative

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:42.912
and to the right is more positive.

00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:45.133
So that's going to be exactly right.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.433
Let's do one more.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:50.000
So now they have three
minus negative four.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.904
Well one way to think about it

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.200
is three minus negative
four is the same thing

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.100
if you subtract a negative,
it's the same thing as

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.833
adding the positive version.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.300
So it's the same thing as three plus four.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.773
And so I would want to start at three

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:05.900
and then move four to the right.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.639
Because once again this is the same thing

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:09.509
as three plus four.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.666
Three minus negative
four is the same thing

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.733
as three plus four.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.200
So I want to start at three
and move four to the right.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.700
Start at three and move four to the right.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.567
This would be the same
thing as three plus four

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:25.078
which is the same thing
as that expression.
