Yappity-yap~ It's Francis!

Japanese baked goods are not only tasty,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.260
they come in all sorts of cute shapes!

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.500
The next stop on our bakery tour is Boulangerie Shima,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.500
known fondly as Shima Pan or Shima Baked Goods.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.840
What cute baked goods do you have here?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.220
Here it is: a melon bun shaped like a turtle~

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.500
Look!  An exercising bear!

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.840
Why do you make baked goods in the shape of animals?

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.900
There it is: Sekimoto!

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.540
Feast your eyes on these beautiful fruits!

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.320
Can you all guess what I am about to show you?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.060
What are your most popular items?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.660
Cream and fruit, sandwiched between two slices of bread.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.740
Looks great, doesn't it?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.460
Mr. Sekimoto's fruit sandwiches are very popular among fruit aficionados.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.700
Mr. Sekimoto and I are quite alike, it seems...

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.600
I had a great time meeting my guests for today.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.460
They all wake up at the crack of dawn to make delicious baked goods for their customers.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.620
I will meet a lot more people and show all of you further facets of Japanese food culture!

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.380
I must go now.  Chef is waiting for me!
