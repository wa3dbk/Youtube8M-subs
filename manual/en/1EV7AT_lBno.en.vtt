Hi my name is Lucy Spain on behalf of Expert
Village here to talk about cheerleading stunts.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.599
After you've learned your all girl stunts,
it's really fun to move into partner stunts.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.859
Now a partner stunt group is going to consist
of a male, a female and a spotter who can

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.149
be either sex as long as they're tall enough
to catch where the bases height is. So now

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.869
that we've got our two people that we need
involved, you really need to learn how to

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.239
do your job. Now if you're a female, you're
going to be a flier. For the stance, you and

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:44.320
your partner are going to be about a foot
away with the male in the back. Females, your

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.340
arms are going to go behind you, grasping
like this onto your partner's wrists. Now

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.600
males you're going to have your stance in
the back. And you're going to be holding your

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.879
partner's waist. Now this is really important
to do. You can hold wherever you feel comfortable

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
and wherever your partner feels comfortable.
Don't go too high up because your grip's not

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.070
going to be as good. And really make sure
you've got a firm grip with your thumb in

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.780
the back, your forefingers in the front. Now,
the way you get into a stunt, the back partner

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.970
which will be the male is in charge, and he's
going to do the same call that we always do

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.300
to get into a stunt, which is ready, one two.
Now you guys both need to be on the same page

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.630
here. As the flier, and the female, you are
going to dip on his ready, one two. So you're

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.790
going to go down, bend at the knees and really
push yourself up off of his arms. It's half

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.010
your job to get in the air, half his job.
So don't slack off, nobody's going to want

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.570
to stunt with you. Make sure you jump. It's
really important. Don't just let the guy take

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.650
you; you really need to push yourself off
the ground. That's half the momentum. Now

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.380
men, the most important thing you need to
remember as you're holding your partner's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.130
waist, ready, one two, don't bend forward
and lift her up with your back, because she's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.680
not going anywhere. You need to lift her up
with your leg muscles. So make sure, I know

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.509
it's hard because not all of us are that flexible.
You'll learn it over time, but once you call

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.830
your ready, one two, really, you want to get
under her before you can throw her. Now it's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.680
really important to practice toss drills before
you stunt. That's how you can find out if

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.230
you and your partner are compatible to stunt
together. Toss drill is going to be what we

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.341
just learned. And you're going to do them
over and over again until you want to hit

00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:32.000
the floor. So you're going to go, ready, one
two, throw her, catch her, throw her, catch

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.670
her. No break in between. Do about fifteen
to twenty of these, as many as you can stand.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.910
Girls, your legs are going to be burning,
guys; your arms are going to be burning. It's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.630
a really good drill. Now two of the most basic
partner stunts are a chair sit. Now for a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.540
chair sit, we're going to start with our basic
toss. Females, your position is going to look

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.760
like this: sitting. Now males, you're going
to be holding the girls, bottom ankle, this

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.959
is kind of like your steering shift. And this
hand is going to be underneath her bottom

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.790
like this, one side. So you're going to have
a hand her, you're going to have the other

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.660
hand here. Girls, it's really your job to
sit back into the guy's hand. Get comfortable.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.670
Guys, it's really important when she hits
that peak, you've got to get this hand under

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.980
cause she's going to fall on it. Keep your
arm stiff. Make sure you can hold her up.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.100
The next stunt we're going to do is toss hands,
similar to an all girl stunt, but you need

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.150
to throw her up there. So basically we're
going to go from here, do our toss, you need

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.210
to complete, all the way up to the ceiling
even though we're only going to catch her

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.819
right here. It's really important for momentum.
Girls, you need to keep your eyes forward,

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.290
and basically you can't see where your feet
are going to land. The most important thing

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.900
is just to jump. Though guys, you really have
to catch her feet. If they're out a little

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.090
further, pull them in and you're going to
rest them right her by your shoulders.
