00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
On May 28, 2009, the announcers Mr. States and Mr. Williams of radio station KRXQ 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They ridiculed and they promoted the abuse of transgender children on their radio program.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
[Rob Williams] You want to come out and say

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
'Well, I am a man trapped in a woman's body, and I want to have surgery ..'

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You are a freak! 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I think you are a freak and I have every right to say that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
[Arnie States] A boy that wears a dress is a freak!  He is a nut!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
[Rob Williams] This transgender movement in America ...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Dawn Rossi] Rob!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
[Rob Williams] is so phony.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
[Arnie States] God forbid!  If my son put on a pair of high heel shoes, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Probably, I would beat him with one of my shoes.  

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I would throw a shoe at him

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
because, you know what?  Boys don't wear high heel shoes.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
On June 2, I wrote to Mr. States and Mr. Williams and general manager, John Geary 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to explain that their comments endanger these children and to demand an apology.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Later, a reporter from TV station KCRA interviewed me.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.500
[Dr. Milazzo] This is not a subject for sensationalism.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.000
This affects people's lives seriously.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
[Narrator] Dr. Carol Milazzo, with the organization PFLAG,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
says that as a medical doctor, she works with transgender children,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and these comments could lead to violence.

00:01:15,000 --&gt; 00:00:17,000
[Dr. Milazzo] "Children who are gender variant or transgender

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
have a high risk of suicide unless they receive the care that they need,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and these comments put their lives in more danger.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The persons who made these comments should apologize,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and they should receive an education about this condition."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
On June 3, the announcers responded that they would not apologize 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
because they always joke with offensive words on that radio program.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
On June 7, after they lost many sponsors and after they received many complaints

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Radio station KRXQ published an apology on its web site and suspended the program.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
On June 11, the program returned with an apology and with a 2-1/2 hour open forum 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to promote the safety and sensitivity for these and all children with special needs.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Child abuse is NOT a joke.  

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Thanks to all who defended our children.
