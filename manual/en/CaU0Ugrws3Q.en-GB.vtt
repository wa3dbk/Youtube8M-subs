00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.880
What has impressed me most about
the Latex 3000 is the faster speed

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.240
and also the decrease
in cost of the ink.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.960
It’s fantastic for us for
getting into longer and faster runs

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.600
for no compromise in quality.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.200
The HP Latex 3000 is a model
that will change the market.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.360
The applications that we’ve seen on
the machine have been wonderful.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.400
We’ve seen almost all the materials
and it gives you a wide range.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.280
For example,
you can use banners.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.560
You can use canvas.
It works very well on canvas.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.200
SAVs auto-adhesive material
works very well too.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.240
The new HP Latex 3000
is impressive for speed

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.520
combined with very
high image quality.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.040
This machine is much more industrial,
suitable for high productivity,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.200
and it's extremely practical too,
because a single operator can manage it. 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.200
About the printer Latex 3000, I think
we will have much better productivity,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.120
in a market that is more
and more competitive.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:22.240
Since introducing Latex we have been able
to expand into interior design, with architects,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.160
offering opportunities
that we didn't have before,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.680
because with UV printing certain
types of products are not possible.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.880
Latex technology is better for us
simply because it works immediately.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.480
So, we’re not waiting for drying.
We’re not smelling the print.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.960
It’s ready to go immediately
and we can apply it.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.080
It just makes for a better turnaround
and the quality of the print.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.520
HP Latex has been a
massive advantage for us.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.680
It’s mainly due to gassing out
and the lack of solvents.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.680
Also, our company is now
registered with 18001 ISO.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.160
Also, we’ve moved massively towards our
environmental tasks within the company

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.040
to meet certain
regulation limits.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.600
Presently, where we are now,
we wouldn’t have been

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.880
without the opportunity and the
use of latex within the company.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.680
Latex technology allows us to
have a true eco-friendly model.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.320
This is very important
in our society nowadays.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:30.320
There is less printing in solvent
with solvent machines in our country.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.640
We have completely crossed into
a more ecological approach for our clients.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.800
Currently we run solvent machines
for the majority of our vehicle departments.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.320
I see that latex is the way that we’re going
to have to go for speed to market,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.800
being able to print and utilizing
the print straight away

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.000
and not having to dry the actual
prints or de-gas the prints.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.760
Also the fact that the inks on the
Latex machine are all Green Guard

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.800
is going to be a big help for
environmental government tenders

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.240
and also for school applications
with the Green Guard certified inks.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.760
Before latex, we used
to run solvent machines.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.560
Our productivity increased massively
purely by just moving to latex.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.240
It’s not even the amount
of time to gas out,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.680
it’s even the area that you
need to be able to do that.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.840
A lot of area like that we
now use as now for storage,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.080
we use it for racking to be
able to gas the old vinyls out.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.960
I’m very impressed with the new technologies
that have been implemented on this machine.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.600
In particular, the drying of the latex,
the increase in speed,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.880
It’s a very impressive machine.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.960
So, it’s something that we’ll have to look at
for an investment very soon in the future.
