00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.830
Maybe it's jaded memory talking, but there's
really not many good things that come to mind

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.010
when talking about the arcade driving classic
Outrun.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.330
Perhaps the aspect that stands out the most
though is the decision making process in which

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.430
path you took each leg of the race.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.760
While this had no real bearing on the gameplay,
a change of environment is always a welcome

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.860
addition in any game, and it is this exact
mechanic that resurfaces in Endless Road...

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.850
though any other comparisons to Outrun aside
from them both being driving games are not

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.640
likely to be found.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.829
Probably the most striking thing about Endless
Road is its art style, so let's address that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.920
first.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.570
It has this isometric, zoomed out, minimalist
approach to representation, that almost looks

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.870
like a modern art installation that just happens
to be moving.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.960
Colors are used in striking contrast to the
predominant white and gray of the road and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.570
cars, and it results in a novel uniqueness
that has not really been seen in gaming.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.740
But of course art is ancillary to how a game
plays, so let's get down to brass tacks.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.700
What we have here is a game that has taken
inspiration for its core mechanic from the

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.700
movie Speed.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.420
Not only is the road behind you constantly
deteriorating, but if your car falls under

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.970
eighty two miles per hour, and thus trails
behind the almighty dotted line, well it's

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.420
game over for you.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.050
The trick then is to press either on the left
or right side of the screen to weave through

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.950
traffic, hit all the speed boosts, avoid the
slow downs, and last for as long as you can.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.100
Of course there are missions to complete,
and coins to collect that go towards upgrades

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.100
in the shop.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.610
You'll be happy to hear that the unlocks and
prices are not too outrageous, so you shouldn't

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.900
be needing to fork over money unless you really
want to.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.420
So this all sounds pretty straightforward,
yes?

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.189
Well the game itself is a lot harder than
it sounds.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.640
It can be quite unforgiving, at least until
you learn the knack of keeping your speed

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.640
up.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.500
Nevertheless, this is a fun little arcade
racer with a really distinct presentation.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.229
Like a lot of these endless games, longevity
may be an issue, but how long is something

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:59.880
that's different with each individual.
