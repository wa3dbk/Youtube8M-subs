00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.870
The Numark Orbit is a handheld MIDI controller
that wirelessly controls your DJ software.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.070
With 16 back-lit colored pads, a built in
accelerometer, and an endless rotary wheel,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.000
you can have full performance control without
being tethered to a cable.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.650
The Numark Orbit is powered by a rechargeable
battery and can last for several hours on

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.050
a single charge.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.030
You can see the battery life of the numark
orbit by holding down K1 until the pad bank

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.570
buttons illuminate indicating the battery
life from 25% to 100%.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.260
You can connect wirelessly to your computer
with the included USB stick or use it wired

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.789
with the included USB cable.

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.190
On the bottom of the Orbit are your pad bank
buttons which toggle between the different

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.289
controls for each set of 16 pads.

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.039
At the top are your controls for four different
knob functions which can change depending

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.530
on which pad bank you have selected.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.760
You can change the colors of the pads on the
Numark Orbit.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.420
To do this, simply hold down the pad bank
button for three seconds, then tap the right

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.520
bumper once, select the pads you wish to change
the color for and scroll through the colors

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.090
with the bumper.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.229
The Numark orbit lets you control functions
with a built in accelerometer.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.350
You can activate the accelerometers y axis
by holding the right bumper, and the x-axis

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.090
by holding the left.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.380
Holding both bumpers simultaneously engages
both.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:43.380
Double tapping a bumper will leave the accelerometer
on until the bumper has been taped again.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.170
On the back of the orbit is a place for you
to connect the included velcro strap.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.850
The Numark Orbit can be mapped to most every
software including the popular Serato, Virtual

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.319
DJ, Ableton, and Traktor DJ softwares.

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.189
We are using the included Orbit software that
comes free with the purchase of an Orbit to

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.289
give you an idea of how the controls function.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.340
You have all of the basic functions of a standard
DJ controller.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.479
There are controls for Play and Pause.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:26.670
You can setup four hot cues 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.849
and clear them out.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:38.310
You have looping functionality with one, two,
four, and eight bar loops, as well as manual

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:49.390
looping controls.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.590
Your FX can be engaged either by selecting
an effect, or by holding down that effect

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:22.319
and using the accelerometer controls.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:41.900
Using the K1 through K3 buttons, you can control
the highs, mids, and lows.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.110
