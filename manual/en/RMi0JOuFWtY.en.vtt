Hello, I am Ceci Saia and today i wanna show you my winter morning routine

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.300
Routines have the bad reputation of being boring

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.420
but, at the end, routines help us to clear our mind and put energy in positive things

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.260
This is my ideal  morning routine, but it doesnÂ´t mean that i always follow it exactly

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.580
Every morning i try this will possible

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.000
My days start early. My alarm rings at 7 o'clock and I wake up with the radio.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:45.360
Like most people, I stay a little bit of time in bed. And when I'm almost up, I take my phone to make sure of nothing had happened while I was sleeping and that requires my attention .

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.220
If it didn't happen, I stay at bed a little bit more.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:01.180
Now, it is time to start the day. First my body needs, is a good glass of water, something that is not necesary to say, is that it is good for the body.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.160
After that, I get comfortable to read my favourite news sources to know everything before leaving bed.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.360
And watch some videos of my favourite youtube channels.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.060
Some stretching, and it is time to front facing the world out of bed.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.480
In winter, I take showers at night. Because of that, I wash my face to wake up seriously, and then, I prepare sonmething for breakfast.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.040
I take for breakfast toast with cheese spread, and a cup of tea. I love tea, and I almost never leave my house without having breakfast first.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:55.900
If the time lets me, I try to tahe a relaxed breakfast time, to keep reading, checking my social media, and charging energy for the day ahead.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.840
Now, activate!

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.680
After picking my clothes, and protest beause I have to take my pijamas off,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.580
Lets start with my cleaning and makeup routine.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.840
First, untangle the mess made in my hair trough the night.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.340
And move it of my face.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.180
Always is good to wash the face with a washing product, to wash the impurities collected trough the night.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.700
While the product does it's work, I wash my teeth as a good girl.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.480
I rinse everything, and after drying, I apply a moisturizer creme. This one, is the one I showed you in my january's favourites (watch this video!)

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480
It lasted a lot

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.660
While the creme absorbes, I put some concealer in my eyes, one I can use as a primer before applying eyeshadows.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.900
Today, I'm not going to record a video and my makeup is going to be very quiet,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.600
Starting with a pink eyeshadow.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.660
The same, goes to the base. I don't have to record, I'm just going to use a CC Cream to correct the colour, and have an uniformed skin.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760
To the final touch,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.800
a little bit of powder for a natural and light finish.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.200
I continue with the rimmel or mascara, as you prefere, and then the eyebrows.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.200
I confess that until last year, I didn't pay attention to them. But Michelle Fan's videos convinced me to make them up.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.880
Some blush as final touch, and that's it!

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.880
I brush my hair, and I'm almost ready to go.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.760
One last thing before leaving. Make my bed.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.640
There's nothing worst than arrive home after a long day, and the bedroom is made a mess.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.440
Now, lets wrap, it is cold. And if you wanna know what is in my bag, you can watch my video about it.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.080
That's it! Bye! lets take advantage of this day. Have a nice day! See you next time.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.560
