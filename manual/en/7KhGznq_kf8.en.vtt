00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.860
This whole thing is atypical...

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.260
I think we have much better feel for what's going on now then 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.080
certainly we did on February 20th.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.250
This'll give me real time coordinates
for this point right here.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.350
We're mapping. We're drilling.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.800
We're doing test pits.We're just
basically creating an underground map of what's happening.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.559
Right now we have about 500 feet of
affected roadway.

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.300
But the active part of the slide at the
base is 1200 feet wide.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.500
So if you're moving twelve-hundred feet
of something at the bottom,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.540
eventually you could get that or maybe more at the top. Now we don't know what that risk is. 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.460
It could be very low or it could be moderate.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.960
But we do know that
in the active area we do have a high

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.460
potential for at least some additional road damage because this is very deep.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.680
The shears here are at depths of about 105 to 125 feet.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.500
Most to the shears are extending
through what we call the Chin Lee formation.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.740
It varies but part of that Chin Lee is a
very kind of plastic clay.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.160
That's the bad actor
here.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.150
You have bedrock that's being dragged down the hill but it's riding on these

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.549
thin, gooey, fat clays. The biggest thing
is to determine

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.549
if we can keep the road here, if we
can fix it here

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.000
or what we can do. If the shears are too
deep, it tells us that we have certain options

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.140
in terms of trying to fix the slope.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.000
We've drilled a total of 17 holes.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.759
We started off by drilling 10 holes,
actually in the road with auger rigs,

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.880
installed inclinometers in all of those
holes.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.430
Then the next stage we started drilling
holes down

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.150
in the slide and up above the road. So we've got now the crux drills which are the track drills.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.899
We've got a helicopter that we're using
to move them around

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.450
and they can put that thing just about
anywhere piece by piece.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.300
There's no other type rigs really in
the country that can do what these rigs can do.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.989
And then and the great thing about them
is that they get pretty much a hundred percent recovery

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.869
when they're coring which is the important thing.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.830
We've done some compression tests on
rock back in our,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.080
our Tempe lab. That kinda gives us the
mass strength of the rock properties out here.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.100
And then the clay itself, we've got some
torsional ring shears that are being run out in California.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.150
We're doing a lot of grain size
analysis,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.300
P.I. Atterberg limits tests. That also
gives us an indication of just how bad that clay is.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.420
We're continually monitoring

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.340
everything that's going on out here. We've
got slope inclinometers like I say.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.780
We've also got TR, time domain
reflectrometer cables 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.820
in seven of the holes. It goes down along
the length

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.989
of the slope inclinometer casing.

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.230
We send a signal down that cable and what
what comes back up

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.879
tells us basically if there's a shear
along that cable at some depth.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.690
And so we're using all of that
information to kinda map

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.810
what's going on underneath.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.600
We're coming
up with alternatives basically right now. 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.080
We would like to try
to keep this allignment in its current configuration as much as
possible

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.900
but we do need to have the entire
picture before we

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.680
really finalize those, those alternatives.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.680
It's all about, unfortunately, patience. I know the road's been a nice

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.680
thoroughfare
for everybody and everybody loves to use it. 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.590
But when you get an incident like
this, in mother nature, you just gotta,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.840
gotta be patient and give it some time. Make sure you get
the right answer

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.460
and not just put a band-aid on it.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.700
ADOT... Keeping Arizona moving.
