Hi, my name is Ed Jurewicz.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.580
I'm with Liberty Safes of Florida and I'm
here to

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.830
introduce to you the FatBoy 48 made by Liberty
Safe.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.230
Made in the USA, up in
Utah.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.820
The thing that we like about the Fat Boy is
that it's got a uni-body construction.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.950
There's no seams here.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.490
It's one mold.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.680
And also it has a robotic weld, a deep weld
that

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.720
goes across to put the back plate on.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.329
It also has a re-locking device inside here
that if someone knocks the dial and punches

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.610
the lock, it has two re-locking devices that
will go off and lock the thief out.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.980
If they try to drill it, they hit a hard plate.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.370
The other thing that we like about the FatBoy
48 is that it holds 24 guns here with

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.030
a flexible interior that can give another
24 guns on the other side.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.690
Now this safe here is fire protected for 45
minutes at 1200 degrees and it has a fire

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.040
seal here that will seal up the door if there
is ever a fire of intense heat.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.460
We also have a lifetime warranty that we include.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.700
If there is ever a fire or burglary, they
will repair and replace the safe for free.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.280
Liberty also has holes here on the bottom
where you can bolt the safe down and includes

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.469
a bolt down kit for you.

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:30.780
The Liberty gun safe here, we include with
it a dehumidifier rod or a Eva-Dry, either

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.139
one that will help prevent the guns from rusting.

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:44.149
We also give you the option of either a jewelry
drawer, electronic keypad in exchange of the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:51.030
dial or a deluxe door panel which we like
a lot which will hold the guns.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.439
The Fat Boy 48, we will ship it to your door,
curbside for free.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.159
And if you're out of state there is no sales
tax.
