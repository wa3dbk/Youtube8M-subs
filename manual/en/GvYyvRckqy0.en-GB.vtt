00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.670
Hello everyone and welcome to this week's
game development log video diary, and this

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.500
week I've been implementing support for enchanted
items

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.820
as well as adding a couple of new mobs into
the game.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.400
But first off I want to show you the icon
particle effects that I mentioned briefly

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.010
last time, because this week I improved the
system

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.850
and finished implementing them. So I can now
set any icon to emit articles, and when I

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.590
do that the icon will start to randomly generate
2D quads like this. The quads are then textured

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.429
using a texture atlas, and the particle fades
linearly through all the different stages

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.690
of the atlas throughout the particle's life.
I can also choose how many particles are emitted

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.140
per second, I can choose how large or small
the particles are, and how long they stay

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.149
alive for.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.579
So I created these icon effects for the enchanting
update that I worked on this week, so that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.910
I could use the particle effects to indicate
when

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.120
an item has a certain enchantment. I haven't
actually added the mechanics for enchanting

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.080
weapons and armour yet, but I have implemented
support for

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.990
enchanted items. You can now mouse-over an
item to see what enchantments it has, so here

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.670
you can see that this sword has sharpness
and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.869
life sap. There are also 5 different tiers
of enchantments, so eventually you'll actually

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.820
be able to upgrade the enchants on your items,
and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.230
you can see the different tiers of enchantments
shown in slightly different colours here,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.680
with the higher level enchantments being a
darker shade of

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.009
purple. And I know it's a bit tricky to read
right now but I'll get round to redoing the

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.360
text rendering system fairly soon.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.289
Each item can have up to three enchantments,
and each enchantment can have it's own icon

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.090
particle effect. So these boots here have
super speed

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.280
and you can see that for now it has this sparkly
particle effect, these boots here have jump

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.929
boost, and these boots here have both of those
enchantments, and so the icon

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.259
shows both of the particle effects. And these
enchantments do actually work as well, so

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.090
if I wear these boots you can now see that
I can move at super speed

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.340
and jump unreasonably high.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.540
Another small little feature that I implemented
this week was personalising the names of items.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.040
Again, I haven't added the actual mechanics
of

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.069
this into the game quite yet, but items can
now be given personalised names like these

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.379
three shadow swords here. It doesn't really
change much and

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.010
the personalised name will only show up for
the owner of the item. When you sell it in

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.450
a shop or trade it with someone else it will
just have

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.030
the original item's name for them. It'll probably
cost a fair amount of materials or coins or

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.450
something to rename your items so it wouldn't
be something you can just

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.599
do whenever want, it would be something that
you'd save for only your best weapons and

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.599
armour.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.340
And finally, last weekend I released the list
of mobs and animations and a load of you guys

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.900
have already started creating some of these
mobs for

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.709
the game which is fantastic. And I can already
show you guys 2 of these new mobs that I added

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.560
into the game this week, both of which were
created

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.459
and animated by Christopher Jubell. So this
is the first of the two mobs, the skeleton,

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.280
looking very awesome here and I've got a couple
of them

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.500
roaming around the desert, and then over here
is the second new mob which is this brilliant

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.989
giant spider looking very creepy indeed. So
a big thanks

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.069
to Christopher for these mobs, and hopefully
I'll be adding some of the other mobs that

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.170
you guys have been making into the game next
week.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.620
So that is it for this week! Next week is
the last week that I'm going to be working

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.189
on the weapon and armour system because after
that I'm going

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.860
to get to work on the combat system itself.
As always if you want to get involved with

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.930
making content for this project then do send
me an email,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.020
especially if you'd like to do some animating
because there are a load of mobs that need

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.590
animations right now. Don't forget to follow
the game on any

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.530
of my social media pages, links are in the
description below, but yeah thank you guys

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.341
very much for watching this video, do subscribe
if you

00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:02.500
haven't already, have an absolutely wonderful
week, and I will see you all, next time!
