00:00:00.118 --> 00:00:04.721
[piano music playing]

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:06.307
(Dr. Steven Zucker)
We're in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art

00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:07.780
looking at Thomas Cole's

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.057
"View from Mount Holyoke,
Northampton, Massachusetts,

00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:13.609
after a Thunderstorm--
The Oxbow."

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:14.304
(Dr. Beth Harris)
Right.

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:15.718
But we know it
as "The Oxbow."

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:17.802
(Dr. Zucker)
It's a Hudson River
School painting

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:18.887
by Thomas Cole

00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:22.598
who's credited with founding
American landscape painting.

00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:25.421
(Dr. Harris)
Landscape painting was
ranked very low

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:27.136
by the academies
in Europe.

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:31.388
(Dr. Zucker)
And painting was ranked
very low in American society.

00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:32.724
[Dr. Harris laughing]
That's true.

00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:34.196
And when Americans
did want paintings,

00:00:34.196 --> 00:00:36.887
they didn't want
grand, mythological scenes.

00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:40.179
They wanted portraits
or landscapes or views

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.349
like this one.

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:45.136
(Dr. Zucker)
And this is a view of a
well-known, unusual, natural scene,

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:46.408
a place where the
Connecticut River

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:48.120
bends back on itself.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.309
(Dr. Harris)
This is a really large painting.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.469
I think it's five 
or six feet wide

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.143
and five feet high.

00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:58.883
And that speaks to the importance
that Thomas Cole wanted to give

00:00:58.883 --> 00:01:00.164
to landscape painting,

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:02.869
landscape painting, considered
this lowly genre,

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.596
but here made not
only large in size

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:09.210
but Cole, even here
in this view,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.557
trying to say something
more with landscape.

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:12.776
When we think of 
Thomas Cole,

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:14.580
we think of "The
Course of Empire,"

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.922
or "The Voyage
of Life",

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:18.140
these moments when he
tries to use landscape

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.304
to say something big,

00:01:19.304 --> 00:01:22.802
but something big
is hidden here, too.

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:24.924
(Dr. Zucker)
This is really ambitious.

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:26.638
And it's not
just landscape.

00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:28.417
It's about transformation.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:29.661
It's about time.

00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:31.663
It's about a kind
of metamorphosis.

00:01:31.663 --> 00:01:32.804
(Dr. Harris)
Well, it's about America,

00:01:32.804 --> 00:01:35.635
and what America is
going to become.

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:37.307
(Dr. Zucker)
So on the left side,

00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:40.108
we see a storm-ravaged landscape.

00:01:40.108 --> 00:01:41.560
We see a broken tree.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.879
We see rain pouring down,

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:45.804
birds that seem 
to be frantic

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.139
as they fly
through the sky,

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.968
and we can even make out
a little bit of a lightning bolt

00:01:49.968 --> 00:01:51.516
at the extreme left.

00:01:51.516 --> 00:01:53.134
(Dr. Harris)
So we have 
what art historians

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:54.561
and art critics 
at the time

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:56.891
even referred to 
as "the sublime,"

00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.466
an image of nature
that is wild and untamed

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:02.184
and frightening
and awesome.

00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:05.310
(Dr. Zucker)
This untouched wilderness,
this virgin forest,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.498
was seen in stark
contrast

00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:11.094
to the built environment
of old Europe,

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:13.597
and so here was a
promise of the new.

00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:15.889
It was America
as a new Eden.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.380
(Dr. Harris)
And this is so different
than what Cole gives us

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.680
on the other side,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.848
which is Americans settling
this virgin landscape,

00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:26.637
transforming it into
cultivated plots of land,

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:29.423
into areas to graze
their livestock,

00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:32.192
into places to settle
and build homes.

00:02:32.192 --> 00:02:35.383
And the storm is passing.
The sun is coming.

00:02:35.383 --> 00:02:38.392
And there's a sense
that this settling of the land

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:40.803
is something which
is ordained by God

00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:42.558
which is approved by God.

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:44.717
(Dr. Zucker)
And this is really 
tied in with the American notion

00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:46.429
of manifest destiny,

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.971
that Americans were
meant to tame this landscape,

00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:51.132
that this was ours.

00:02:51.132 --> 00:02:52.717
And in fact, at least
one art historian

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:54.811
has looked at the 
hill in the center

00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.004
of the painting

00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:59.018
and read in that
Hebrew letters.

00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:00.524
(Dr. Harris)
When looked at
from above,

00:03:00.524 --> 00:03:01.755
and in reverse,

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:03.422
from God's viewpoint,

00:03:03.422 --> 00:03:05.848
they seem to read
from the Hebrew,

00:03:05.848 --> 00:03:08.583
the word "Shaddai,"
which means "almighty",

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:09.629
referring to God.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.720
So that idea that
this is God's plan,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.304
and God has
blessed America.

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:16.334
(Dr. Zucker)
Now in art historical terms
what this is,

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:19.058
is the transition from
the sublime to the pastoral.

00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:22.043
(Dr. Harris)
The pastoral being 
a peaceful idea of landscape,

00:03:22.043 --> 00:03:25.304
of man inhabiting landscape
with a sense of tranquility

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:26.334
and peacefulness.

00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:27.681
(Dr. Zucker)
And we can see that

00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.617
in all of these anecdotal
vignettes that Cole gives us.

00:03:30.617 --> 00:03:32.351
If you look at the 
lower right corner

00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.642
of the painting,
for instance,

00:03:33.642 --> 00:03:36.023
you can see a ferry
that's been carefully rendered.

00:03:36.023 --> 00:03:38.392
You can see people that
have been let off at one side,

00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:41.027
and people who are now
crossing over to the other.

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:44.265
(Dr. Harris)
And a pathway that goes
down to some farmland,

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.471
and places where
sheep are grazing,

00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:48.869
and our eye can travel
up and back

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.720
through the chimney
stacks of a few houses

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.225
here and there,

00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:56.933
up through a valley where
the sun is shining

00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:58.678
between two hills,

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:01.213
and up those bright clouds
and the sunshine,

00:04:01.213 --> 00:04:02.703
and that sense of promise.

00:04:02.703 --> 00:04:04.252
(Dr. Zucker)
There's also a 
wonderful specificity

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:06.308
that I think is very much
meant to entertain

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:09.554
and to represent the
particularity of nature.

00:04:09.554 --> 00:04:10.720
If you look at 
the left side,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.027
you can see there's
fungus that's growing

00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:14.659
out of the blasted
tree trunk.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.997
You can just make out a bird
on one of the blasted bows,

00:04:17.997 --> 00:04:21.092
but probably the most
fun is at the bottom center

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:22.103
of the canvas,

00:04:22.103 --> 00:04:24.272
the artist himself 
looking back at us.

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:26.560
(Dr. Harris)
And next to him,
just slightly up the hill,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.726
is his supplies,

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:29.309
his umbrella that
will shelter him,

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.391
a portfolio, 
a chair.

00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.347
(Dr. Zucker)
But that chair is 
also a cross.

00:04:33.347 --> 00:04:36.351
And so we understand
not only the passage of time here,

00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:39.120
the transition from 
wilderness to a paradise

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.475
that man is creating,

00:04:40.475 --> 00:04:43.893
but we also understand
this all within a Christian context.

00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:45.635
(Dr. Harris)
His portfolio which has
his name on it

00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:47.639
reads as the signature
of this painting,

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.964
also reads as
a tombstone for the artist.

00:04:50.964 --> 00:04:53.216
So there is that sense
of the passage of time.

00:04:53.216 --> 00:04:54.721
But I want to go back to
a word that you used

00:04:54.721 --> 00:04:55.470
a moment ago,

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.052
and that was "entertain",

00:04:57.052 --> 00:05:00.373
because here we are,
first half of the 19th century,

00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:02.550
there's a middle class audience.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.266
and a new rising
merchant class

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:07.054
from which Cole is
drawing his patrons,

00:05:07.054 --> 00:05:10.170
but there is this real
need to entertain,

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.519
to exhibit these paintings
and make them fun

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:13.923
for people to look at.

00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:15.521
This is not complicated --

00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:16.558
(Dr. Zucker)
It's not mythology.

00:05:16.558 --> 00:05:17.642
(Dr. Harris)
No.

00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:19.250
It's something that
everyday Americans

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.295
could relate to and 
really fall in love with.

00:05:21.295 --> 00:05:25.424
