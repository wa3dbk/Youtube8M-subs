00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Earth - The Planet of Life

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Water - Essential to the functionality of all organisms

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Water covers 70% of Earth's surface

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.000
Our bodies are made of approximately 70% water

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.500
Why is that?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.500
Just a coincidence?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Hungary has an abundant supply of quality therapeutic and mineral water.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The town of Lazberc gives home to the spring that supplies the residents of Bukk with clean drinking water for the past 600 years.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The spring is located in a protected nature reserve.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This natural spring water is the main element of the Kaqun drinking water.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.500
Kaqun water is bottled in this spotlessly clean facility. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.500
This is the facility where water's structure is modified into KAQUN water.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
No chemicals are used and no high pressure oxygen is pumped during the manufacture of KAQUN water.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.500
State of the art technology and a new classification: KAQUN water

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
HUNGARIAN PRODUCT- UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500
PROVEN RESULTS

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500
Kaqun therapy consists of drinking and bathing therapy.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
10 years - 10 successfully completed clinical studies

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
Proven results shown after a 14 day bathing therapy

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Significant KAQUN studies: 2009, National Chemical Safety Institute

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.500
The effect of KAQUN water on the immune parameters of healthy volunteers 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The volunteers participated in a 21 day drinking and bathing therapy course.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.000
Every bathing session lasted 50 minutes with water being 38C / 98.6 Farenheit.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.000
The drinking therapy consisted of the consumption of 1.5 liters (50.7 ounces) of KAQUN water.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.000
Result: KAQUN therapy caused a significant increase in the number of natural killer cells.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.000
Namely: there were more NK cells (Natural Killer) available to destroy virus infected or tumor cells.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.000
According to the results of the study, two week therapy sessions proved to be the most effective.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.000
Clinical studies have shown that KAQUN water has a  positive effect on the function of the immune system.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.000
KAQUN water has no side effects, so it is recommended to everyone for drinking and bathing therapy, as well.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:32.000
2011: National Chemical Safety Institute: KAQUN water's effect on antioxidant capacity

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:40.000
Summary: samples studied after 1, 2 or 3 week therapy indicated significantly increased antioxidant capacity

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.000
I had triple bypass surgery and it took me a long time to find a remedy that would counteract the after-effects of that surgery

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.000
That is when I discovered KAQUN water and I have been drinking it ever since and lately I have been taking KAQUN baths, too.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:04.000
I am 82 years old and I feel healthy, my symptoms are gone.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.000
My quality of life has improved and I can recommend KAQUN water to everyone

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:22.000
Using KAQUN as bath therapy and as drinking water significantly helps the function of the immune system.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:34.000
KAQUN positively influences the body's intake of antioxidants.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.000
The newest, currently ongoing studies are taking place at the National Oncology Institute, Budapest

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:48.000
The initial results are promising

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:57.000
KAQUN water speeds up the process of regeneration

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.000
KAQUN water made it obvious for me that  -&gt;

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.000
real help is provided for patients who take medication or radiation therapy for tumors and suffer its side effects

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:20.000
I have been using KAQUN therapy for preventative reasons for the last 6 years -&gt;

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.000
as drinking and bath therapy. After the bath therapy I feel so much better.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.000
my skin becomes silky and I am able to live my life without taking any medications event though I am 79 years old

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.000
When I take a bath I feel like I am floating and my body is weightless

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.000
the outside world ceases to exist and I don't' even notice that an hour flew by

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The drinking and bathing therapy - the standard for the study - lasts for 14 days

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
3 daily baths lasting 50 minutes each and consuming 1.5 liter (50.7 ounces) of KAQUN water

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.000
The bath therapy positively influences the mind and the soul

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.000
The 50 minute bath is an excellent opportunity for relaxation and reflection

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.000
Many patients who are receiving oncological treatment take advantage of the KAQUN Baths

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:33.000
KAQUN bath and drinking therapy significantly reduces the side effects of traditional oncological treatments

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.000
To treat a  lymphatic tumor my doctor prescribed 20 radiation therapy sessions

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.000
which resulted in difficulties to swallow

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.000
On my friends' recommendation, I started the bath therapy

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.000
While it eliminated my difficulties swallowing, it also protected my skin from the radiation

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:03.000
My appetite did not decrease, I was able to maintain my weight and I can live a full life

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.000
At the Oncological Institute a 4 bath KAQUN system has been established for study purposes
