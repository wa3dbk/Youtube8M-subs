CES 2009

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.800
Alright, check this out.
This is one 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.470
of the most popular items
at CES, right now.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.260
One of Sony's brand new...
Well it's kind of between

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.500
a netbook and a notebook
because it's not cheap,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.110
but it's not really
that expensive either.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.600
Coming in at around $900s.
Have a look.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.200
Have a look at this thing,
just super thin,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.380
super small, 
an 8 inch LED backlit display.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.860
It comes with Windows Vista
pre-installed.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.230
It has a GPS built-in.
It's got WAN built-in,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.130
it's got Verizon wireless WAN
built-in.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.270
It has a touch nub
rather than using

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.800
the track pad 
in order to save space

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.300
and it also runs
Windows Vista

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.030
which is incredibly cool
because most of the notebooks

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.700
you see this size
are going to be running XP.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.100
Not this one though.
It's got

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.200
a forward-facing
motion I-camera right here

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.870
and it's in general
insanely light.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.840
I think it's
about 1.4 pounds,

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.570
1.3 pounds, 
something like that?

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
It is very, very tiny
and a really, really impressive

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.740
piece of kit right there.
I can see

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.700
why all these people
are standing around

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.900
looking at it
because it's wildly popular.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.060
I would bet that
a lot of people here

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.330
at the show looking
at this thing,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.310
will probably be buying one
really, really soon.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.040
Let me show you
around this thing a little bit.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.560
I've got my hands on one
that's not tethered,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.570
which is good
because now I can

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.570
run away with it.
-Hey, no running.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.230
Sorry, ok, sorry.
Tell me when his

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.770
back is turned
and I'm out of here, alright?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.740
This thing is really,
really sweet.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.880
You've got 2 
track pad buttons right here

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.360
along with the middle
track pad button,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.600
a couple of 
multi-function keys.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.260
A USB port, right here
on the side,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.430
headphones and your 
powered outlet right there.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.030
And if you are going
to reverse it, you've got

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.840
another USB port
and god, I don't even know

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.160
what that is right there.
What is this port

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.370
right there that I'm looking
on the side here?

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.800
That port right there
allows you 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.330
to plug in an adapter
that has both VGA 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.760
and a wired 
internet connection on it.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.130
It comes in the box
with the unit.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.600
Oh, right on.
So you just plug it in,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.300
you've got your VGA 
and your internet right there.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.770
Correct.
-It's very, very cool.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.500
Now, I was guessing,
but I'm not sure I was right.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.500
 I was guessing
 it was around 1.3 pounds.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.260
Man, you are close.
-What was it? 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.960
1.4 that's nice, nice.
-Ok, yeah 1.4 pounds.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.270
And when are these 
actually going 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.140
to be available for purchase?
-These are going to start

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.500
shipping the first part
of February,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200
but they are available
for pre-order 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.400
on Sonystyle.com, today.
-And they come in what, 4 colors?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.470
They come in 4 colors,
there is granite red,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.530
onyx black, 
that's what you have

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.240
right here. 
Emerald green and white as well.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.700
And of course
one of the big questions

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.800
is battery life,
what are we looking at?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.900
You are looking at
up to 4 hours

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.400
on a single charge
with a standard battery.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.140
There is an 
extended life battery as well

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.940
which is going to be
giving you close to about 8 hours

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.230
on a single charge.
-Adds a little bit girth to it?

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.000
Little bit of girth,
a little bit of bump on the end.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.770
I actually like it 
a little bit more though,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.970
makes it look nice typing experience.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.400
Puts the keyboard
on the bit of  a pitch.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.130
Ok, well this is fantastic.
You guys are pretty proud of this one.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.240
Oh, absolutely.
-Yeah, very, very nice.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.440
This is an incredible device.
This Sony P Series, Lifestyle PC.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.600
I mean, you're probably going to sell
a lot of these, 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.390
I think I'll have to pre-order one.
-You're going to try 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.860
and run away with that one, aren't you?
-Um... no.
