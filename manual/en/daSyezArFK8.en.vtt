00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.290
How to Brew a Pot Of Tea.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.330
Drink tea.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.450
You'll be a few millennia too late to be a
trend-setter, but it's delicious, globally

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.820
loved, and a hell of a lot healthier than
soda.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.450
You will need A kettle Fresh water A stove
A teapot Either loose-leaf tea or pre-filled

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:31.599
tea bags Tea cups An infuser or inset basket
A strainer An additional teapot and a tea

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.040
cozy.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.300
Step 1.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.530
Fill the kettle with fresh, cold water.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.530
Step 2.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.570
Set the kettle on the stove-top and turn the
burner to high.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.629
While you're waiting for the water to boil,
warm your teapot by filling it with hot tap

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:48.629
water.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.800
Let it sit a few minutes before emptying.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.800
Step 3.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.070
Measure the amount of tea you will need.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.289
You can generally plan for 1 teaspoon per
cup if brewing loose-leaf, or 1 tea bag per

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.500
cup, using more for a stronger brew or less
for a milder brew.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.670
Step 4.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.850
Spoon the loose-leaf tea into the teapot or
the infuser or inset basket.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.330
If you're using teabags, drop them into the
teapot.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.570
Step 5.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.360
When your water reaches a boil, slowly pour
it from the kettle into the teapot.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.520
Consult your individual tea for its optimum
infusing temperature, since some are ideally

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.780
steeped in water that is slightly cooler.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.930
Either way, don't overboil the water, since
this removes oxygen and flattens the taste.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.940
Step 6.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.830
Steep darker teas, like black and oolong teas,
for four to five minutes.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.470
Lighter or finely cut teas, like green tea
or a teabag, need to steep for only two or

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.470
three minutes.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.280
Don't rely on the color as your guide.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.110
If you'd like to add milk to your tea, pour
it into your teacup, just before the tea is

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.110
ready.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.640
Add sugar, honey, or lemon later, but never
all togetherâ€”lemon will curdle milk.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.640
Step 7.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.780
When steeping is complete, remove the infuser
basket or teabags from the pot and serve.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.910
If you used loose leaf tea, place a strainer
over your teacup before pouring, then decant

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.450
any leftover tea into a second teapot to avoid
oversteeping.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.110
Did you know Black tea leaves are fermented,
green teas aren't, oolong teas are partially,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.580
and herb teas, well, aren't tea at all, but
fragrant blends of herbs, spices, and flowers.
