00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.340
The fastest human footspeed on record is 44.72
km/h.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.833
The record was set by who else than the fastest
man on the planet - Usain Bolt.

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:10.600
That man is strikingly fast.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.250
But humans aren't built for speed.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.820
Grizzly bears, those humangous 300kg animals,
can outrun Bolt without breaking a sweat.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.169
The record for the fastest 100 meters is 9.58
seconds.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.990
An average grizzly bear can cover that distance
in about 7 seconds.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.259
But let's talk speed.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:39.090
A cheetah called Sarah at Cincinnati Zoo,
was recorded running 100m in just 5.95 seconds.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.950
And they can run even faster than that.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.489
Let's see just how fast that is.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:54.059
Using some computer magic we can superimpose
cheetah onto the running track.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.579
We're slow animals.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.219
But what limits our running speed?

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.600
That's a tough question to answer.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.370
First of all, experts do not agree on this
one.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.460
One group believes that the major limiting
factor is the amount of energy that we can

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.750
strike the ground with while running.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.409
On the other hand, another group believes
that the speed of the swing, or how fast you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.950
can put one leg in front of the other, is
the limiting factor.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.649
Some say that we won't run much faster than
today.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.630
That we reached our limits.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.290
Other say that sometime in the future we will
be able to run even two times faster.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.540
We don't know for sure.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.630
What we do know is that we are awesome at
running.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.189
Long distance running.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.729
Compared to the other animals we are the kings
of the ultra distance running.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.140
Endurance running hypothesis suggests that
endurance running played an important role

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.689
for early hominins in obtaining food.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.200
And I qoute:

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.250
Humans have a certain badass not-intelligence-related
quality.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.100
Apparently science tells us that we're a bogeyman
of the savanna.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.640
Maybe not the deadliest creature, but much
creepier because we give the victims time

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.740
to marinate in their own fear.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.359
Those antelope and whatever?

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.479
They can run faster than us, yes.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.261
But we can keep running, and with our elevated
point of view and good binocular vision, our

00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:18.770
hunting party will specifically mark one of
them for death.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.430
With our peculiar two-legged gait, we follow
without spending too much energy.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.290
Our hairless features make it easier to shed
excess heat.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.470
Eventually, the victim staggers, gasping for
breath, overheating in its own fur, eyes rolling

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.870
desperately in their sockets as its herd-mates
leave it behind.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.530
The hunting party circles, bringing out crude
sticks and stones...

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.340
You can hide, but you can't run forever.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.209
Marathon Man has seen you, and he is coming.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.310
But here we talked about professional athletes.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.960
They practiced their whole lives to be able
to run like that.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.990
What about us?

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.420
Can we do something now that will enable us
to run a bit further and a bit faster?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.019
I present to you the 4 minute mile "jetpack".

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.909
This device, while in most of the cases it
won't live up to it's name, will help you

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.290
run faster and while using less energy and
thus increasing the distance you can cover

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.519
in one go.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.110
Of course, the project is at it's start and
there is a lot of place for improvements.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.049
We just have to wait a bit more.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.000
This jetpack uses fans that shoot bursts of
air through rear-facing nozzles, generating

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.220
thrust.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.760
But what if we were to remove the air from
the equation.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.450
What if we were to run in a vacuum?

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.280
I mean, have you seen cyclists riding behind
a big truck?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.799
They can go up to 100kmh without much effort.

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.799
Why?

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.290
Because air resistance.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.650
When they are riding behind a big truck, the
truck pushes the air on the side and thus

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.319
the air resistance for the cyclist lowers
significantly.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.570
So something like that should work with running
too?

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.570
Right?

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.330
Apparently no.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.370
Even in a complete vacuum, we wouldn't be
able to run just a few percent faster than

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.370
usual.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.370
Why?

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.200
The answer is simple: we can't run very fast.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.700
When you're riding a bike you're traveling
much faster than when running, so the more

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.550
air resistance you'll encounter and thus drafting
will have a noticeably bigger impact.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:25.610
So the only thing we, mere mortals, can do
is wait for this jetpack thingie to be improved.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.080
Keep exploring and I'll see you next time.
