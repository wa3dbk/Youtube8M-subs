I bought it last Thursday midnight, and I receive it

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.960
today which is Monday morning.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.210
so it only take like 2 days

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.299
so we going to unbox now.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:12.299
I'm so exciting to unbox it now. Let's see what in there.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.850
This is the box

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.040
from Culture King. and this is the beanie from them.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.040
it's free if you purchase more than a hundred aud and here is the Culture King Box

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.630
So let's open up see the hat/ snapback inside.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.299
Now I'm going to show you the detail

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.580
Have a closer look

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.110
so can you see that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.899
this is not a cork print, it's actually the cork that they

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.810
compress it to come up with the
shape, I think

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.810
so it's really cool. See the texture.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.670
and yeah and a they have this triangle

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.220
logo of the brand 'HATER'

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.819
and the breath hole

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.310
on the top

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.530
and the snapback strip

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.750
and the floral roses print inside

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.050
and they do have these tags

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.680
and here, at the left side of the hat

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.730
the Hater 2012

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.730
Yup, the tag.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.120
and you can see the texture of the fabric

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.079
It's really nice. It's a stiff kind of fabric

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.549
Yea, and let's see the stitching inside.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:22.459
Here you can see the structure support

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.670
So.. this is the snapback.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.030
okay and now this is the strapback

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.730
What is the different between snapback and strapback

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.349
which is the back part, the stripe part

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.269
is different that one is in plastic and this one

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.670
is actually like a belt, like a knob.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.049
so have a closer look at the material.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.310
the same they have the logo here

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.980
the hater logo, and you can see the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.950
material of the front part.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.940
It's actually 3D, can you see that the reflection.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.859
and now we have a look at the fabric.

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.500
you can see the geisha is actually like a

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.329
embroidery, and not a plain (flat)

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.580
printing fabric.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.900
It's actually reflect to the light.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.680
The one thing I really like is about

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.010
the strapback, they have the detail

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.370
on the knob like a snake skin

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.240
and the ring have the snake scale texture as well.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.200
and they do have this their signature tag here.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.510
and the inside

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.630
is not as interesting as the black (previous) one, maybe because

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.659
the out side is bold and loud

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.080
so.. this is it!

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.599
HATER THE SNAPBACK

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.500
Hope you like my video. Thank you for watching.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.820
Bye! =D
