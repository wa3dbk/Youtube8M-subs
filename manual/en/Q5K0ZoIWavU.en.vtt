00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.180
So is this were love runs out of patience
With just one question left to be

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.000
answered
You wanted more but you got it all

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.410
A taste of rust, Your are the touch of
death

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.690
We walk the lines which the sinners led
We are passionate but lost

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.780
You only think about yourself girl
At least I'm not the one who sells

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.810
pleasure
You fucking whore

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.040
You touch my heart when you're feeling
down

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.530
But when the night falls (when the night
falls)

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.930
you're seeking blood just to trap your lust
This will never be ignored

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.450
I gave you all but you just kept me
burning

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.490
You just kept me burning on and on
And now it feels so fine to see you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.520
breaking down girl
To see you falling further down from here

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.920
She shakes as she turns around
With big tears and her lying mouth

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.110
She only wants you to say the words
"I'm sorry my love, can we please turn

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.370
around?"
This will not be succeeded

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.450
We crave for more
You only hear what you want to hear

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.110
It's over for sure, it is over for sure

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:59.180
This will not be relieved no more
This will not be suppressed no more

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.710
At least give the illusions back
For a sweeter outcome than this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:23.010
Prepare for battle
Prepare for war

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.590
Prepare for battle

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.510
Step back
I need to break her words

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:04.740
one last time
I need to break her words

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.160
Step back, Step back, Step back
I need to break her words

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:25.370
one last time
I need to break her words

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.420
I gave you all but you just kept me
burning

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.280
You just kept me burning

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.570
I gave you all but you just kept me
burning

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:49.860
You just kept me burning on and on
And now it feels so fine to see you

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.940
breaking down girl
To see you falling further down from here

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.800
I gave you all but you just kept me
burning

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.920
You just kept me burning on and on
And now it feels so fine to see you

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.330
breaking down girl
To see you falling further down from here

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:23.890
The blood is still warm but her soul has
been stolen

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:34.070
and I hope that your parents are proud to
hear what you have achieved;

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:44.160
to have a whore of a daughter
Stop! Don't turn this away from you now

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:53.050
You shall bleed it out
You shall never be

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:06.150
You shall never be a part of me
Smile a last smile and believe that world

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.480
will go on without you and your lies
The rose will decay
