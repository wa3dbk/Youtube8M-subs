00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.560
You know what I hate?

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.560
working out.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.560
It’s the worst.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.440
If only I could reward myself with like a
cheeseburger afterwards.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.440
Sound counter productive?

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.660
New research suggests maybe not

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.770
Hey hungry hippos, Julia here for DNews

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.900
A recent study from the University of Montana
found that there was no difference in energy

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.689
gained from eating fast food or from taking
sports supplements.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.660
In the study published in the International
Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.210
- 11 male cyclists cycled for 90 minutes,
depleting their bodies of glycogen.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.520
Right after the ride and then two hours later,
the participants either ate fast food or took

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.820
sports supplements.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.430
Then fours after the first bit of exercise,
they did a 12.4-mile time trial.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.620
The researchers found no difference in blood
glucose and insulin response between fast

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.600
food and supplements, but even more intriguing,
there wasn’t a difference in the athlete’s

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.550
performance in the time trial.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.550
This story sounds great!

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.399
I mean I could go run a mile then eat a greasy
cheeseburger with some french fries and be

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.399
HEALTHY.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.399
RIGHT!?

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.719
well hold on, let’s take a closer look at
this.

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.490
First of all, it was an incredibly small study,
with only 11 male cyclists as participants.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.119
Any study with small sample size warrants
caution.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.659
But what about their results?

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.780
This is really a story about glycogen.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.549
Which is a type of carbohydrate found in a
few different cell types, like Liver cells,

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.799
but in this case, it’s important that it
makes up about 1 to 2% of your muscle mass.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.569
Your body uses glycogen easily during exercise.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.390
In fact it’s the first source muscles use
to contract, especially during high intensity

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.619
exercise.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.259
Some intense athletes like marathon runners
can deplete their body’s store of glycogen

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.259
during a workout.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.880
They “hit the wall” and experience extreme
fatigue that makes it hard to even move.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.590
Thus a lot of athletes carbo-load before a
big race or game.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.679
But restoring glycogen afterwards is super
important too.

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.909
By eating lots of carbs afterwards, the body’s
glycogen stores are replenished and can build

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.700
bigger muscles with more glycogen storage
capabilities for future exercise.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.319
So this is basically what the study focused
on.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.149
It could mean that any high glycemic foods
would restore your glycogen levels.

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.329
Pasta, pizza, bread, rice, pasta, did I say
pasta?

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.450
I love pasta.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.620
Or another way of looking at this study is
that sports nutrition supplements work JUST

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.349
AS WELL AS FAST FOOD.

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.159
Which doesn’t bode well for expensive nutritional
supplements.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.980
Would you pay 60 bucks for a bottle of supplements
over a 5 dollar meal down the street?

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.159
Well, you wouldn’t be the only one.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.450
Over 150 million Americans take some form
of supplement.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.079
But nutritional supplements have their own
host of problems.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.659
The New York State attorney general's office
recently tested dietary supplements and found

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.180
that many don’t contain what they're supposed
to.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.680
But what’s actually in them is another story.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.879
One study published in JAMA Internal Medicine
found that many supplements for weight loss

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.439
and body building were recalled for containing
banned substances that could cause serious

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.530
health problems or death.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.030
And I mean really, let’s not say fast food
is good for athletes.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.659
Fast food is still considered a leading cause
of obesity.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.680
Most fast food meals are high in fats and
sugar.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.900
While these are good for the body in small
doses, too much of a good thing, is bad.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.310
Very bad.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.609
Too much fast food increases your risk of
heart disease and stroke.

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.520
And the authors of the fast food study say
all the hype is just that, hype.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.670
Moderation is key.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.749
Don’t go binge on a burger and fries after
every workout.

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:16.749
Sad day.

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.969
Would you give up your body building pills
for a cheese burger?

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:19.969
Let’s be real.

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:20.969
We all would.

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.569
