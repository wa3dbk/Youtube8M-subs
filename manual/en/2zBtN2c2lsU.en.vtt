00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:29.919
On the one hand, there's justice in a game
this good coming to a bigger audience.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.489
On the other hand...there's a gun, covered
in slime.

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.829
And on the other hand, this was a handheld
game.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.191
A great handheld game, but a handheld game
nonetheless.

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:46.579
And what's great on a handheld, isn't always
as great on a big screen.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:59.469
Now, if you don't have a Nintendo 3DS, you
missed out on something pretty special in

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.499
Resident Evil: Revelations.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.460
It was a return to form, in a lot of ways.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.909
It brought the series back to something a
little more Resident Evil and a little less

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:08.909
Rambo.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.230
And now, a year later, this fantastic handheld
game...has made its way to home consoles.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.430
Whoa.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.680
Calm down there, Jessica.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:39.310
The title for sweet asses in Resident Evil
is...kind of occupied.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.510
Revelations is a kind of spin-off, that takes
place between the fifth game...and the legendary

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.580
fourth game.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.229
What made it so great is that...it was like
a rebalancing of the series' components.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.000
It still plays like four and five, but it
scales back that action movie feel and reestablishes

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.960
the atmosphere of the early games.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.189
Case in point,
the desolate Queen Zenobia, which is still

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:09.149
one of the series' creepiest settings.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.569
So you're starting with a pretty awesome 3DS
game, right?

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.380
And the general idea is to take that game,
bring it to more powerful hardware, improve

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.380
things.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.010
But the funny thing is...even though Revelations
has been improved technically, it's doesn't

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:31.650
look nearly as impressive in this new form.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.370
And that's the irony here.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.760
Revelations looked stunning on the less-powerful
3DS, but in HD...it's really underwhelming.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.379
And again, that certainly has a effect on
the game's vibe, which is a lot less effective.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.849
I mean, it's still a creepy game and it does
manage tension, but...you can always tell

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.849
this was a handheld game blown up for a bigger
screen.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.120
And to be fair, that's actually understandable.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.410
Even if poor performance is less so.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.349
Fortunately, there's also some good news here.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.190
That's that Revelations at least plays great
in HD.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.400
I mean, there's an argument to be made that
no Resident Evil game plays great, but...this

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.500
one is as good as any other.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.530
And if you liked popping off head shots in
Resident Evil 4 and blowing sh*t up and then

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.970
re-blowing it up in Resident Evil 5, you should
have no problem with Revelations.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.739
And it's still really fun to play.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.920
Know what's weird about reviewing remakes
like this?

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.450
I mean, I've spent this whole time criticizing
the game and comparing it negatively to the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.849
original, but...it's still really good.

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.939
Resident Evil 4 is one of my all-time favorite
games, and Revelations is the first one since

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.349
to even come close to that feeling.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.939
It's a perfect mixture of the action and atmosphere
the series has so often struggled to balance.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.379
Even on the PS3, even though it's not as good
as the original, this is the best Resident

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:10.889
Evil in years.
