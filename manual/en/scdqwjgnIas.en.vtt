00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.380
This is a video for an origami star.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.630
The first step for the origami star is a diagonal
fold.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.991
So take the paper, the white side up and then
we're going to take the bottom point and get

00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:18.430
it right up the top point, where it's right
on there.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.720
So make sure that it's very precise and there's
no extra paper showing.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.410
Then slide your finger down, lock it in place
and then go out to the corner, so it's nice

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.200
and flat, everything's equal, so we get that
nice diagonal fold.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.090
Next step we're going to take these two corners
and we're going to fold them up to the top

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.640
of the triangle just like this.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.239
So from the outside edge up to the top, and
they should meet right in the middle, where

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.899
the two of them are sort of butted up right
next to each other but not overlapping.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.420
Next we're going to unfold those two guys
and then go from the left side over to the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.420
right.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.990
So fold the whole thing in half, and that
should cut that triangle down in half like

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.990
that.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.080
Now we're going to rotate the paper around,
so that these two openings are now on the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.120
top left corner, and what's going to happen
is, we're going to fold this one flap over

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.320
to the other side.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.780
But the way we're going to do it is so that
when it comes over, you can see this line

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.920
right here is going to stay right on the center
line.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.979
You can see how, if it was over to the side
that edge, we want to get it where it lines

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.560
up exactly, on the part that sticks out underneath
it.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.719
So get that to line up and it should meet
right there on the top as well, so do that

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.340
on one side and then we're also going to do
it on the other side.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.520
So go ahead and flip it over and then fold
this flap over.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.759
Again they should match, but also see if you
can get that line to go all the way through

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.869
just like that.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.940
Next there are two sheets of paper that are
down here.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.030
There's one that's hidden on the inside and
there's one that we can see on the outside.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.831
So what we're going to do is we're going to
open it up and split those papers apart, and

00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:22.750
I'm going to take the one that's on the inside
and I'm going to pick it up and then flatten

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.770
it back out just like that.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.520
That's going to give us another point to work
with over there on that side.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.010
Next we're going to fold this whole flap,
that's right over here.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.800
We're going to fold it all the way up as far
as it goes.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.760
It's going to go all the way back up, and
this should look nice and symmetrical.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.460
In the next step we're going to fold it back
down to this point, so that this point and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.060
this point are going to reconnect.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.560
And lastly we're just going to fold this tip
up about that far.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.810
And that's going to give us, you can see how
the star point is going to peek out, right

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.810
there on that side.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.820
So that's done for that side, and then flip
it over and we're going to do the exact same

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.970
two steps, we just did over there.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.640
So we're going to fold this tip down to this
tip like that, and then lastly, we're going

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:33.400
to fold that up like that, and that gets us
the shape we need for the origami star.
