00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:08.540
So I'm a big fan of pumps with skimmers. This is a skimmer. It basically fits inside of the pump and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.709
it captures chunks of debris, it captures snails, 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.579
it captures little fish, it captures just about anything big and solid in your system 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.019
that could damage your pump. Now most of
the pumps that we use, because these are pool

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.599
pumps, come with skimmers,

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.699
And, I'm a big advocate of these
types of pumps because they're reliable in

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.839
the long term and they're very inexpensive.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.059
And, the fittings for them are very easy
to find. So, you can go to just about any

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.780
spa store or hardware store and
find fittings for these pumps.  They're all

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.060
pretty standard.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.020
So, I like to use these inline pumps and um...

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.020
they come with skimmers like this. Occasionally you'll have to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.380
clean these out. So, we basically just
uh, they fit in the pump like so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.020
and they typically have

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.120
a covering. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.500
A threaded top to them. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.170
That allows you to kind of see down in the pump. 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.200
It fits on like this. There's an O-Ring there and it seals, 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.400
and then that collar threads on and basically tightens it down. 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.850
So, all you got to do is basically take that collar off 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.649
and take off the top of your skimmer covering here, 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.079
and take out your skimmer and this one we just kind of gave a 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.050
little rinse out, a little earlier, but 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.150
you know you can see it is pretty clean. A lot of the time you'll pull these out

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.670
and they'll just be full of gunk. 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.280
So you want to take the hose and give them a good rinse and get that gunk out of there. 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.780
And, it's going to improve the efficiency of your pump. 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.400
But, the nice thing about these of course
is that it prevents your impellers in 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.670
your pump from being damaged by all this big hard solid stuff 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.549
going through your system. So, 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.799
uh... if you're thinking about buying a
pump, definitely look into pumps like this.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.110
We use Jacuzzi pumps by and large. 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.430
They're very inexpensive and they'll do a really great job for you. 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.100
Hi, welcome to our video tour of our greenhouse 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.400
This behind us is the greenhouse.
You can see the fish house here and we've got our greenhouse 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.439
over here heading on an East-to-West axis. 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.369
