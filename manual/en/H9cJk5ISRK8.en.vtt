Hey guys this is Austin. Is it time to move
to 4K?

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.100
Back in 1979 Mattel launched the Intellivision,
one of the most powerful game consoles yet.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.619
It was able to play games at a whopping resolution
of 159 by 192 meaning you could fit over 270

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.650
Intellivision screens on a single 4K TV. While
normal high definition TVs and monitors have

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.089
been around for a while now, Ultra HD aka
4K has typically been pretty pricy. Just over

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:37.110
year ago my 4K monitor that I use to edit
videos on cost $3500. Today though you can

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.460
pick up a full 50 inch VIZIO Ultra HD TV for
less than $1000. If you take a look at a YouTube

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.940
video like this it’s 1080p or Full HD. Now
this is the resolution you’ll find on most

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.430
computer monitors as well as TVs. This is
just fine however when you move to 4K you’re

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.980
getting a lot more detail, enough to fit four
1080p screens. But the question is, what can

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.780
you do in Ultra HD? If you have a powerful
gaming PC like the Positron you can play games

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.570
in Ultra HD. The new Nvidia GTX 970 and 980
graphics cards are outfitted with an HDMI

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.500
2.0 port which you can use with the VIZIO
P-series to play PC games in 4K at 60 hertz.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.540
So it might seem weird to be using a 50 inch
TV as a computer monitor but it works surprisingly

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.969
well. So in addition to being able to play
games you can also watch 4K video and there’s

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.359
a ton of screen real estate so instead of
having to have multiple displays you can just

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:29.319
have all of your tabs, all of your Austin
Evans videos in one place. Pretty handy. Jump

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.840
into a game like Metro: Last Light Redux and
the move to 4K is a big one. Even on Medium

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.139
settings the extra resolution makes a big
difference and it’s even more noticeable

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.280
in Watch Dogs. With Ultra textures there’s
just a ton of detail everywhere which is a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.359
far cry from the console version which can’t
even reach 1080p much less 4K. There’s also

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.819
a surprisingly solid Game Mode included that
brings latency down to some of the lowest

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.819
levels I’ve ever seen on a TV. It might
not seem like a big deal but this alone makes

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.389
the P-Series totally usable for even the most
fast paced games out there. While the Positron

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.289
has no problems gaming in Ultra HD you can
still get some of the benefits of gaming in

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.740
4K without an awesome gaming PC. The P-Series
TVs have a Spatial Scaling Engine to upscale

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.769
HD content to 4K which helps to make normal
gaming PCs and consoles like the Xbox One

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.000
and PS4 look even better. There’s also a
smooth motion mode which helps to make content

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.180
like sports look much smoother. For less than
$1000 the VIZIO P-Series means that 4K gaming

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.730
on a big screen actually makes sense. Of course
you’re also getting a TV that’s futureproofed

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.129
for watching 4K content like Netflix right
in the TV and all kinds of fun nerdy stuff

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.780
like AC wireless, a dual core CPU and H.265
decoding. So what do you guys think, is it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.189
time to make the move to Ultra HD? Definitely
be sure to let me know in the comments below

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.689
and big thanks to VIZIO for making this video
possible. Anyway guys thank you so much for

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.469
watching and I will catch you in the next
one!
