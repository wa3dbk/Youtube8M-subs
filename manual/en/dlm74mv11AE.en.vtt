00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.800
Today on our 2004 Ford F-250, we&amp;#39;re going
to install part #RP56005-53.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:13.200
Were going to start off with our vehicle with
the spare tire removed for a little bit easier

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.909
access underneath the vehicle and also the
rear wheels on the axle.

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:28.279
We&amp;#39;re going to temporarily remove the
emergency brake cable hangers 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:01:02.060
from 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:41.139
the frame on the truck 

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:53.340
and keep them off to the side.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:23.410
Now we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and start measuring
for the rear mounting rail.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:49.520
We&amp;#39;ll go ahead 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:03:23.970
and measure from the edge 
of the bed to where the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.290
edge of a rail will eventually sit.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:52.400
We&amp;#39;ll make two marks.
