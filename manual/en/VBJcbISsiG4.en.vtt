texas school near dollars and the rent
with viral now i think it's an excellent

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.030
rent especially because he is accusing
the teacher of not really teaching the

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.289
class and just giving that pockets and
having them learn things on their own

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.789
now take a look at this rant and i will
discuss

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.419
e old

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.310
as a recruiting keeps crafted

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.049

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.490

constantly that wasting your time

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.540
and tell me what you do it at the white
kids at holy cross alluded easylifeing

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.490
you gotta come in here that it may
concern blanketed status that they want

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.640
their together classes for a while

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.530

with the debt itself seriously fifteen c
the issue

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.870
by like this that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.650
and i like the hand motions to he was so
hard passionate about what he was saying

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.420
and uh... you know he did not face any
consequences from the administrators at

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.280
the school which i find a little
surprising

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.200
he's usually stuff like this happens and
then they'll get sent to prison for

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.210
terrorism is something that i think that
terroristic acts uh... you know

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.470
threatening the teacher like this is

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.579
sitcom g_m_ truck to the scientists are
the rest of this error in the in the new

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:28.600
police state

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.670
thanks god

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.690
now the teacher has been placed on ad
paid administrative leave the and uh...

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.790
it is pending an investigation to see
whether or not she is actually an

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.500
effective teacher she's just passing out
packets of not doing her job

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.840
but and israel work is rented work which
is kind of incredible and he also

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.149
alleges that

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.850
i during one class she walked a she says
whatever this is just my paycheck i

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.009
don't know if that's true that's what he
alleges but the investigation is

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.070
important and if she really is in an
effective teachers she doesn't really

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.909
like her job i mean i'd think they're
putting on blast isn't necessarily the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.310
worst thing in the world you've got a
hold everyone accountable in any other

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.880
workplace like if i don't do my job if
you'll have a renter someone else has a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.160
ramp

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.579

without them

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.650
well it's as though the bravery decided
about

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.059
i don't know what you got to do this
with passion

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:28.709
