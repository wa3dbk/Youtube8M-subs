00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:38.417
oil - 1/4 cup (to be used for kneading dough)

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:41.938
green coriander - 3/4 cup (finely chopped)

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:44.081
oil - to fry mathirs

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:51.628
knead dough first.

00:00:52.281 --> 00:01:09.874
add cumin seeds,salt,carom seeds,black pepper,oil and green coriander in the flour.

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:15.050
mix all ingredients nicely.

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:28.167
with help of water knead hard or tight dough.

00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:31.083
we have taken 1/2 cup water.

00:01:31.704 --> 00:01:35.990
add little water at a time and knead dough.

00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:55.131
kenad for 2-3 minutes until it gets smooth.

00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:05.554
dough is ready;now keep it side for 20 minutes so that dough gets set.

00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:17.200
dough is ready;now we will make balls from dough.

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:24.219
we will make small size mathirs.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.832
now roll the balls in round shape.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:46.824
flatten them a bit like this.

00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:50.972
check whether oil is hot or not.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.060
we don't require to much heated oil for frying mathris.

00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:11.438
fry until it gets crunchy and crasty from inside.

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.958
we will fry mathri on medium-low flame.

00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:19.826
place the mathri in hot oil.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:39.590
place as many mathris as possible in oil.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:57.132
fry mathris on low-medium flame until they turn brown in color.

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:08.307
the reason for methris getting soft is that they are fried on very high flame.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.459
don't ever fry mathirs on high flame.

00:04:12.013 --> 00:04:18.755
keep the flame medium and fry until they turn crusty and brown in color.

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.907
it will take 10-12 minutes in frying mathris.

00:04:26.128 --> 00:04:30.327
flip the mathris when they will float on the surface.

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:05.714
mathris have almost turned brown but we will fry  them for 2 more minutes.

00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:14.716
it will take 12-13 minutes for frying mathirs.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.468
mathirs have turend brown now take them out.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.821
place the mathris on plate with basorbent paper.

00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:47.122
crusty and cripsy dhaniya mathri is ready.

00:05:47.457 --> 00:05:49.981

00:05:50.310 --> 00:06:01.047
