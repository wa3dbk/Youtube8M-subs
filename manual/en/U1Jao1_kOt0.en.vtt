CUTE THINGS SELL GAMES. Well, in Japan at
least. And it�s tough to get more cute than

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.880
an adopted kitten. Sure, we�ve had bajillions
of Hamster games before that operate on much

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.160
the same premise, but those were for Hamster
Thursday, and today�s FRIDAY! Which means

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.460
it�s Strange Anime License Friday, as usual
brought to you by the import-collecting prowess

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.470
of Felicity in Worcestershire, who�s sent
us more animal-raising games than I can even

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.070
shake a stick at. But this is one of the few
that comes on the back of its own manga and

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.670
anime series, even if the latter follows EXACTLY
THE SAME EPISODE-NAMING IDIOSYNCRASY AS CHOBITS

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.499
AND WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THAT oh I can�t
stay mad because there�s a kitten.

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:03.960
So Chi got lost, and it�s rough out there
for a kitten, even the adorable ones, so the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.671
Yamada family take her in - despite a strict
no-pets clause in their lease agreement, THE

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:14.490
REBELS - and hilarious misadventures ensue.
That is, hilarious misadventures if you�re

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.350
watching the animation, as there�s not much
room for filler in 3-minute-long episodes.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.060
This game, though... well, you�ll be spending
a lot of time watching a cat sleep. And trying

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.590
to housebreak her, which is its own brand
of special hell. Every once in a while, the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.920
action will break for a dialog event, moving
what serves as this game�s �plot� along

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.830
bit by bit, usually having to do with the
various mischief Chi gets into and how exasperated

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.370
the family of any kitten must be at the destruction,
carnage, and wonton urination that follows.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.550
But they can�t stay mad, because there�s
a kitten.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.500
Chi�s Sweet Home - which, thankfully, has
nothing at all to do with the 1989 survival-horror

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.030
RPG or related film, Sweet Home - takes the
now-familiar (at least to my Hamster Thursday

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.040
crew) small-cute-animal-raising gameplay and
tries to incorporate a more solid plot to

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.290
the whole thing, as seen through the event
scenes that give the game a more �interactive

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.120
story� feel. Throughout the course of these
events, new objects can be unlocked that give

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.390
you more interac... that�s a pair of underwear.
Y�know, we could do with an actual toy or

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.410
something, maybe a feather on a stick, that
usually works... but no. You get a micturated-upon

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.349
rag as an item. Man. That rag really tied
the room together, did it not. But you can�t

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.280
stay mad, because there�s a kitten, who
gets into mini-games like chasing her down

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.989
and poking her X number of times in a given
time limit, which serves to underline the

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.069
rather sophisticated system of being able
to move throughout eight different areas of

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.280
the Yamadas� house. Unfortunately, the controls
for looking around each particular room are

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.489
frustrating at best, and you might end up
getting Chi�s bowl stuck behind the �move

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.790
to next area� icon. But you can�t stay
mad, because there�s a kitten.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.340
You can even use the touchscreen to directly
poke, pat, and pet Chi, who�s more receptive

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.810
than newly-adopted kittens tend to be. Make
her happy and the friendship gauge up there

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.099
will fill up, right underneath a battery of
status indicators representing hunger or lack

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.849
thereof, sleepyness, and THE FACE OF MISCHIEF
ITSELF. And if you need to OD on cuteness

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.010
at a more concentrated pace than just waiting
for the whims of a digital cat, you can always

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.590
go into the collection mode and analyze every
funky cute maneuver and vocal clip at will.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.990
There�s plenty of events to unlock and time
to spend here in Chi�s Sweet Home, though

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.319
attempting to housebreak a kitten in Japanese
probably isn�t everyone�s cup of... I�m

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.999
going to leave out any mention of a beverage
given that we�re talking about housebreaking

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:46.670
a kitten. But there is more active gameplay
around the edges, which means... you guessed

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.569
it. I can�t stay mad. There�s a kitten.
