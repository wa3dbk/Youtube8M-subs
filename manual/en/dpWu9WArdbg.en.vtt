00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.639
Today on BRSTV we have a quick product demo
on Pukani dry rock.

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.360
I can personally bring home any of rocks we
sell, there are tens of thousands of pounds

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.600
to select from and this is the one I personally
choose for my own tanks almost every time.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.020
Pukani is the lightest and most porous of
all the rocks we sell which makes it the best

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.430
value, by far the easiest to manipulate for
aquascaping, comes pest free and provides

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.170
high volumes of surface area for filtration,
habitat for microfauna.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.750
Pukani rock is crazy light and porous.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.351
I guarantee the first time you pick up a piece
you say "holy cow this is light".

00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:45.460
This is result of the rock naturally being
pretty low density, combined with incredibly

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.350
porous surface just filled with holes that
transverse the entire structure of the rock.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.880
To give you an idea of value we put forty
pounds of standard Fiji in this tank and forty

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.399
pounds of pukani in the same size tank.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.770
You can instantly see the volume rock you
get with the pukani is significantly larger.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.220
More or less this means you can buy fewer
pounds of rock and save some hard earned dollars.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.000
On top of that, dry rock is relatively cheap
to begin with and doesn't require overnight

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
shipping.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.749
In fact, if your order is over one hundred
and seventy five dollars it ships for free.

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:18.119
The low density of the pukani also makes it
the easiest to manipulate.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.939
You can create all kinds of modifications
with a hack saw, chisel or demmel.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.009
One of my favorite modifications is taking
a piece like this, what would otherwise never

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.759
balance, and creating a flat stable bottom
with a hack saw.

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.209
This results in some stunning structures that
would otherwise be pretty difficult.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.340
Since the bottom is flat this is something
that can even be siliconed directly to the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.950
glass bottom of a new tank.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.189
You can use a chisel and hammer too really
mold it any way you like, including creating

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.380
an entire cave network right through the middle
of the piece.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.100
Notice the irregular way the chisel cuts its
way through, it results in a really natural

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.100
look.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.389
I typically use a nice narrow wood chisel
and mallet for this.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:02.719
The end result of doing this can be pretty
stunning and result in structures which would

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.989
otherwise be impossible.

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.759
Rather than just lay two pieces on top of
each other, you can also chisel or dremel

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.710
some curved edges off so the pieces fit together
nicely, which not only allows for a nice stable

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.060
structure, but also looks much more natural
and seamless.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.490
In the joints you can add some thick aquascaping
super glue like paleobond and it will be completely

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.490
stable.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.490
.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.340
The number one reason I use dry rock in general
these days is because I am in this for the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.850
long hall and wet live rock will almost certainly
introduce at least one unwanted pest, if not

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.850
many.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.660
The difference between a one to two year successful
tank and a five to ten is not letting it get

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.970
overrun with pests like Aiptasia, bubble algae,
flatworms, fire worms, red bugs, parasitic

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.710
isopods or flukes that attack your fish and
a whole slew of weird algae found in the ocean.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.550
I start with dry rock and don't put anything
in the tank I don't closely inspect for pests

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.320
and dip prior to adding to the tank.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.470
It's likely something will sneak by at some
point but I am sure I will avoid having to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.910
deal with most of them.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.780
Lastly this porous surface and internal network
of holes serves as habitat for a wide variety

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.200
of critters in the tank.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.890
Many of the anthias and chromis like to bed
down in the crevices at night.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.810
I have a dwarf golden moray which is constantly
weaving in and out of the rock and I know

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.400
he enjoys the security he finds in all these
crevices.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.660
The internal network also provides a safe
harbor for copepods and amphipods to safely

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.370
reproduce away from predators like fish.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.640
These pods not only provide natural foods
for the fish but I also tend to believe the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.390
theory that this army of pods is constantly
scavenging the surface of the rock removing

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.980
unwanted waste as well as likely grassing
on the tiny bits of algae before it gets a

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.780
chance to grow and show up as nuisance algae
we can see.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.530
Curing pukani is a lot like curing wet rock
since both come out of the ocean with some

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.010
organic material on the surface.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.290
Difference here is wet rock comes with sponges,
algae and other organics which are often in

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.340
a state of decay and it may take a while for
the process to stabilize.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.510
With dry rock all the organics are dead and
you just need to wait for them to break down.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.180
Either way the process is typically the same,
soak the rock in heated saltwater with good

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.040
flow for a month or so.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.740
This is best done in a dark container but
can be done in the tank itself as long as

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.569
the lights are turned off.

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:24.130
Once the cycle is complete you should replace
all the water in the rock bin or do a 100%

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.840
water change in the tank to get rid of the
nutrients like nitrate and phosphate produced

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.630
during the curing process as the organics
broke down.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.520
Pretty much the same as you would with curing
wet live rock.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.280
There is no reason to start a brand new tank
with any nutrients.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.219
It is pretty common these days to jump start
the cycle process with bacterial boosters

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.819
like Bio-Spira or Red Sea's reef mature pro
kit.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.560
Coraline algae will begin to populate the
moment you add a source like a crushed up

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.629
rock, shell or coral base that has some .live
coraline algae on it.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.460
After that all you need to do is maintain
calcium and alkalinity, with a particular

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.330
focus on alkalinity and it will cover most
of the rock in no time.
