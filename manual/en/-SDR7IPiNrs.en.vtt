Hi, I am Eugenie. 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.000
Today I am making no-bake chocolate peanut butter oatmeal cookies.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's super fast to make and it requires only 6 ingredients.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.600
For this recipe, you will need:

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.090
3 tablespoons light corn syrup

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.600
3 tablespoons granulated sugar

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.210
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.620
3 tablespoons semisweet chocolate chips

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.420
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.460
and 2/3 cup quick oats.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.200
In a small sauce pan, add in corn syrup 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:01.670
I am using white corn syrup today.
00:00:56:50
and sugar. 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.290
And over medium-high heat cook until sugar dissolves.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.290
When the mixture starts to boil, immediately remove from heat.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.620
And add in peanut butter and quickly mix until smooth.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:29.000
Then add in chocolate chips, and vanilla extract.
 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.760
and roughly fold until combined.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.160
Add in quick oats and stir until well coated. 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:51.370
Drop tablespoonfuls of batter onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.000
As you see, today I am not making a lot of cookies. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.710
And press down the cookies with a back of a spoon to make them flat.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:13.500
Then let cool completely. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.000
Voila, 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.540
This is very quick and easy no-bake chocolate peanut butter oatmeal cookies. 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.200
Bon appetit. 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:41.460
The chocolate flavor in these cookies is stronger than salty peanut butter.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.040
Today it was no-bake cookies and tomorrow itâ€™s espresso. 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.750

Thank you for watching. Bye for now!
