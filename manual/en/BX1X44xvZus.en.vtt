00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:11.539
-Thanks for coming by, little nephew.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:12.471
-It's not like I had a choice.

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:14.234
My mom says you're lonely 'cause you have no friends.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:16.788
-Okay then, great. We're gonna have a lot of fun.

00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:18.646
That's because it's story time!

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:20.039
-Oh no, not again.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.268
-Did I ever tell you about the time that I caught Bigfoot?

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:22.981
-Yes!

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.690
-There I was, in the forest.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.443
I was fishing in the great Colorado River

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:27.986
catching many o' rainbow trout.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.946
Of course, I was setting all sorts of world fishing records.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:33.533
-Does he really think we are going to eat that icky worm?

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.618
-I know, right? Like, gross.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.704
-Please kill me.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.100
-(Grapefruit) Anyhoo, I'm minding my own beeswax

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.204
when, all of a sudden, I hear it.

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:44.466
-(Orange) Mashed potatoes!

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.322
-Mashed potatoes?

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:48.042
-Oh. Hey, guys.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.131
-Okay, moving on. Where was I?

00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:52.128
-(Orange) Mashed potatoes! -Oh, yeah.

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:54.125
[stomp! stomp!]

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.139
At first, I thought it was every person in the world

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.398
applauding simultaneously for how awesome I am,

00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:00.435
but I was actually wrong. -(nephew) Shocker.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.649
-(Grapefruit) Do you know what it was?

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.624
-(nephew) A bigfoot.

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:05.364
-(Grapefruit) Not A bigfoot... THE Bigfoot.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:07.900
[sniffing] Hey, anybody else smell

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.569
an unnaturally large stinky foot?

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.329
[Bigfoot roars] Oh, good. It's not just me.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.075
Whoa! Hands off, you hairy dork!

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:18.370
-I turned my back for five minutes and you--

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.317
-Can't a fish change his mind?

00:01:20.317 --> 00:01:21.710
[splash!]

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.871
-(Grapefruit) I chased that silly Bigfoot

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:25.022
to the end of Yosemite National Park and back,

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:27.376
but you know what? I actually lost him.

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:28.722
Where'd he go?

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:31.138
-Uh... how were you chasing him again?

00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:32.391
'Cause you don't have any legs.

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:34.388
-At that point, I thought all was lost.

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:37.221
That fishing rod was everything to me.

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.290
-What about your family?

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.882
-EVERYTHING TO ME!

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:42.352
That's why I invented the most technologically advanced

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:45.674
piece of technological technology the world has ever seen.

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:47.531
There, that oughta do it.

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:50.277
And then I performed the greatest Bigfoot call

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.198
the world has ever heard.

00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:54.906
Hey! Hey, Bigfoot! Where the heck are you,

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.908
you smelly fishing-pole-thieving wimpazoid?

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:58.542
[Bigfoot roars, crash!]

00:01:58.542 --> 00:01:59.918
Aw, crap.

00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:04.236
Yaaaaahhhh!!!

00:02:04.236 --> 00:02:06.061
-Mashed potatoes!

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.057
-And that's how I caught the missing link,

00:02:08.057 --> 00:02:10.798
a.k.a. Sasquatch, a.k.a. Bigfoot.

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:12.051
-But you didn't even catch him.

00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:13.306
-Oh, didn't I?

00:02:13.306 --> 00:02:15.547
-No! [record scratches]

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:17.225
-When's your mother picking you up?

00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:18.878
-Hey, hey, fruit lovers!

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:20.457
Thanks for watching my brand-new video,

00:02:20.457 --> 00:02:22.780
and just to let you know, my brand-new Annoying Orange toys

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.055
are in stores right now and we're having a contest.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:26.646
All you have to do is use the toys

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.306
to make your own Annoying Orange video,

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:29.316
then upload it to YouTube

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.139
and make it a video response to this video.

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.777
You could win all kinds of cool prizes

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:35.364
and get featured on my website. Here's an example!

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.948
Hey! Hey, Midget Apple!

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:39.080
-[groans] What is it, Orange?

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.284
-Hey, Midget Apple, hey!

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:41.995
-What is it, Orange?!

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.955
-Can you do this? Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya, nya-nya-nya-nya...

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:47.393
-[groans] Stop it, stop it, stop it!

00:02:47.393 --> 00:02:49.063
-Hey! Hey, Midget Apple!

00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:50.039
-What?!

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.061
-Ninja Baby!

00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:53.086
[Midget Apple yells]

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:56.866
Whoa! He got a serious dose of kung-fruit. [laughs]

00:02:56.866 --> 00:02:58.817
So hey, start making some videos

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:01.556
and, until next time, nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya.
