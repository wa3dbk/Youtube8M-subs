When you're in high school
you can just come to school,

00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:08.800
kind of throw away
the day and say,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.053
"Yeah, I did alright,
I'm here, it's whatever."

00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:12.804
I was once
the man on campus

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.015
but now I'm just
a man on campus.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.683
I didn't study much
in high school.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.977
In college you obviously
have to pay attention.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.438
You have to do all your work;
have to do it on time.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.024
That was a big change from going
from high school to college.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.692
Making the transition
from high school

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.111
to being a freshman
in college is extremely hard.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.240
You just have so much
going on in your head.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.618
It's a new school,
it's bigger; it's harder.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:37.704

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.630
I joined
a learning community

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.924
because I felt that
with all the students

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:52.052
that had the same major as me,
it would be really interesting

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.179
to live there,
to study with them.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.932
People told me it was
a great way to meet new people.

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:59.518
I had no idea what
classes to take.

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:03.313
It made the initial process
of scheduling my classes easier

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.065
because it had
that group of classes

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.442
that you could automatically
put in your schedule.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.779
I wanted to have that
small class feeling.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:11.989
I thought joining
a learning community

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:13.365
would help keep
me on track.

I got to meet some people

so right off the bat

00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:23.542
you don't feel

It's given me
more friendships

than I've made
in any other classes.

There's been a few
last minute calls where

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.220
I've had to contact one of my
learning community classmates

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.723
to help me out with
an answer with homework

00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:41.727
or what chapter we need to study
for a test the next day.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.604
I've seen a lot
of different places

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.023
that I normally wouldn't
have on my own.

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:49.109
I've learned
to be more outgoing

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.112
and be able to talk
out in class.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:56.366
I've learned some studying tips,
just some overall college tips.

My learning community has
helped me make that transition

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.872

a better college student.

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:03.749
It's different than high school,
you know, everything's just

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.417
a little different,
a little faster,

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.586

down and breaks it down for you.

Half the battle of freshmen year
