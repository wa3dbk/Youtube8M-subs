00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:02.485
- Today on "Learn 2
Love," I wanna help you

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:05.806
appreciate one of my all-time favorite

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:08.429
glorious green vegetables,

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.846
broccoli.

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:12.549
(relaxing music)

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.870
Love it or hate it, the
nutritional value of broccoli

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.529
cannot be denied.

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.014
It's full of vitamin C and calcium,

00:00:20.014 --> 00:00:23.426
and it'll keep you regular,
if you know what I mean.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:26.270
Today I wanna show you how
to learn to love broccoli

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.347
by making it three delicious ways.

00:00:29.347 --> 00:00:31.947
I'm going to show you my
oven-roasted broccoli,

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:35.315
an incredible broccoli slaw and finally,

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:38.228
a broccoli stir fry
that you are absolutely

00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:39.645
going to adore.

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:42.454
So let's get started by
preparing our broccoli.

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:44.334
So I've got a beautiful
head of broccoli here,

00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:46.448
and we're gonna start
by removing the florets

00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:47.992
and putting them aside.

00:00:47.992 --> 00:00:49.990
A lot of people throw
broccoli stalks away,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.567
and that is a huge mistake because

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:53.924
there are a ton of nutrients in the stalk.

00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:55.933
I peel them, cut off the woody end

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.838
and then grate them to use
in all sorts of recipes,

00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:00.661
like the broccoli slaw
I'm going to show you

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:01.880
in a minute.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.724
But first, let's get started
with some super simple,

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:07.940
but super flavorful,
oven-roasted broccoli.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.019
So I've got my broccoli
florets standing by,

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:11.946
and in a small bowl I'm going to combine

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.523
some olive oil with some minced garlic.

00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:15.917
I'm going to dress my florets with the

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:18.702
olive oil mixture and stir
it until it's well coated.

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:20.780
Then I'm going to pour
it onto a baking sheet

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.637
and put it into the oven at 425 degrees

00:01:23.637 --> 00:01:26.225
for between 10 and 15 minutes.

00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:28.535
When they're ready,
they're nice and tender,

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:30.439
but they've got some
crispy bits on the outside,

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.819
which make them extra delicious.

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.036
We're gonna finish these
off with some lemon zest,

00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:37.579
some lemon juice and some freshly grated

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.204
Parmesan cheese.

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:41.956
Broccoli will never be the same again.

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:45.473
Now let's talk about my
amazing broccoli slaw.

00:01:45.473 --> 00:01:47.644
It's all the goodness
of traditional coleslaw,

00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:50.256
but with the added benefits of broccoli.

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:52.057
So we're gonna get
started with our dressing.

00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:53.786
And this is really, really simple.

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:55.226
Instead of mayo in this dressing,

00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:56.678
I'm using Greek yogurt.

00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:58.583
You could use mayo, if you prefer.

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:00.580
So to my plain Greek
yogurt, I am going to add

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.412
some apple cider vinegar,

00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:04.967
some honey, and some salt and pepper.

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:06.929
It's really as simple as that.

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.264
I'm going to whisk this all together

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:10.806
and then set it aside
while I assemble my slaw.

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:12.664
So for my slaw, I'm going to be combining

00:02:12.664 --> 00:02:14.488
some shredded broccoli stalk.

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:15.752
I've drained a little bit of the water

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.132
because I do find it's got
some high water content.

00:02:18.132 --> 00:02:20.454
I'm going to top it with
some shredded red cabbage

00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:22.032
and some shredded carrot.

00:02:22.032 --> 00:02:24.691
Now, you could also add
some shredded apple to this.

00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.350
It gives it a nice sweet bite that I love.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.604
If you are adding the apple, though,

00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:30.949
I definitely recommend
adding it just before

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.726
you mix your salad because otherwise,

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:34.664
it will brown and ruin
the entire aesthetic

00:02:34.664 --> 00:02:36.673
of this gorgeous salad.

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:38.471
I'm going to add my dressing.

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.004
We're going to toss this all together,

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:40.932
and there you go.

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:42.931
You've got an amazing broccoli slaw

00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:44.926
that is not only super delicious,

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:47.051
but also extra nutritious.

00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:48.665
What could be better than that?

00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:52.183
Now let's get started on
our broccoli stir fry.

00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:53.727
You know, the great part about this recipe

00:02:53.727 --> 00:02:55.166
is that it's very versatile.

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.011
You could add some chicken or some beef.

00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:58.731
Some grilled shrimp
would be amazing with it,

00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:00.251
or even some tofu.

00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:02.828
But today I'm keeping it just veg.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:04.326
So I've got some chopped bell pepper

00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:06.589
and some chopped broccoli standing by.

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:08.285
And I'm going to start by heating some oil

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:10.421
in a nonstick frying pan.

00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:11.930
Once the oil is heated, I'm going to add

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.207
my peppers and then my broccoli.

00:03:14.207 --> 00:03:15.808
I basically wanna give them a little bit

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:19.105
of a head start before I
start layering in my flavors.

00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:20.429
So I'm going to cook this mixture

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.344
for two or three minutes,
or until the broccoli

00:03:22.344 --> 00:03:24.330
starts to turn bright green.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.487
Then I am going to add
a whole lot of flavor.

00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:29.228
What I'm gonna do is create a little well

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:31.389
in the middle of my broccoli mixture,

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.965
and to that I am going to add some garlic,

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:35.404
some grated ginger

00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:37.982
and some chopped red chilies.

00:03:37.982 --> 00:03:38.911
Now, if you don't like the heat,

00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:41.183
it's totally fine, you
can leave the chilies out.

00:03:41.183 --> 00:03:42.974
But I think this flavor combination

00:03:42.974 --> 00:03:44.938
is one of my all-time favorites.

00:03:44.938 --> 00:03:46.583
I'm going to toss everything together well

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:49.251
and then cook this for
another 30 seconds or so,

00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:52.282
or until everything
becomes really fragrant.

00:03:52.282 --> 00:03:53.907
While that's cooking, I'm going to combine

00:03:53.907 --> 00:03:55.590
a little bit of vegetable broth,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.890
some soy sauce

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.387
and a tablespoon or so of honey.

00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:00.629
I'm going to whisk it together

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.589
and then pour it over all of my veggies.

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:04.752
We're gonna let this cook for another

00:04:04.752 --> 00:04:07.097
two or three minutes,
and it is ready to serve

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:09.419
over a beautiful bed of rice.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.694
I'm going to finish it
with some crushed cashews

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:13.458
and some green onion.

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:15.269
And baby, that's dinner.

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.895
I hope this video has inspired you

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:18.533
to get a little more creative with your

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:19.995
cruciferous vegetables.
