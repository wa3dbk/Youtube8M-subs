00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.200
Ok, the first silk reeling practice and the
most commonly practiced silk reeling is forward

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.570
silk reeling. So again we are going to start
with the feet approximately right underneath

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.660
the shoulders. We are going to start with
the right hand, so we are placing the left

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:30.890
hand on the hip. And the right hand comes
out, palm outwards facing the right. The eyes

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.609
will follow the hand. Your eyes however, never
go downwards so as we move off to the left

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:44.019
and the hand circles, we are going to keep
the eyes simply in the same direction as the

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:52.499
hand. So to start this motion our weight is
in the right foot to the front side. We're

00:00:52.499 --> 00:01:01.809
going to start by allowing the hand to circle
downwards and the weight goes to the back

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:08.890
to the right side. And starts to transfer
to the front of the left. So the palm is now

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:20.570
starting to face upwards and we are transferring
the weight to the left side. So now the weight

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.399
is transferred to the front of the left, then
return the arm over, turn over the shoulder

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:40.280
as the weight moves to the back of the left
hand and we turn the hand over and go back

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:56.460
to where we started. So the hand is taking
a large circular motion.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:09.119
Inhaling as the hand comes under, exhaling
as the hand comes over.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.580
As the hand comes under we are going to feel
the energy going into our pinkie and the hand

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.349
twisting somewhat back and up. Going over
the energy goes into the thumb and pressing

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:35.140
outwards.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.409
Inhaling, exhaling.
