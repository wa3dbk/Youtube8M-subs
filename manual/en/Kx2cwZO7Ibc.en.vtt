00:00:00.118 --> 00:00:06.018
Winston came speeding up to a junction, when
he saw Paxton up ahead. Winston’s signal

00:00:06.018 --> 00:00:11.358
turned red but he couldn’t stop!
- Watch out Paxton!

00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:15.617
-Woah!
-Paxton put on his brakes he, stopped just

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:17.158
in time.
- Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!

00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:22.878
- I wonder what the big hurry is?
Poor Winston is looking sick with worry as

00:00:22.878 --> 00:00:26.237
he continues his wild ride.
- I don’t like this anymore! I wish I wasn't

00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:33.237
going so fast! I wish I could stop!
I wish I had a driver!!!

00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:41.987
Winston was racing towards Tidmouth sheds.
THEN THERE WAS TROUBLE! There were cars ahead

00:00:43.717 --> 00:00:45.008
and Winston couldn’t stop!

00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:50.528
- Oh no! Help! I'm going to crash! OHOHHHOHHH
- Winston shuts his eyes and prepares for the

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:55.697
impact. But then his motor begins to &lt;SPLUTTER&gt;
and &lt;CHOKE&gt;. He starts to slow down...

00:00:55.697 --> 00:01:01.227
- Ooooooh! Now what's happening?
- Winston was starting to slow down. Slower

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:05.218
and slower and slower...
Winston rolls to a halt inches from hitting

00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:05.898
the buffers.
...until he came to a stop.

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:06.548
Seconds later Thomas arrives. SIR TOPHAM HATT
climbs down from the cab.

00:01:06.548 --> 00:01:13.548
Winston opens his eyes to see SIR TOPHAM HATT
glaring at him.

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:18.798
What’s happened?
What’s happened?! You've run out of gas!

00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:19.578
That's what’s happened!

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:22.468
Phew. I thought I was going to crash.

00:01:22.468 --> 00:01:28.718
That was very irresponsible going off without
me! And dangerous too.

00:01:28.718 --> 00:01:31.198
Winston looks ashamed and embarrassed.
But...

00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:37.598
It wasn't all my fault, Sir. I mean... you
forgot to put on the brake, Sir.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:39.958
Now SIR TOPHAM HATT looks embarrassed.
Oh my!

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:45.038
Oh my!
I see... Of course... You're absolutely right,

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:51.798
Winston. I should have put on the brake.
But I should have reminded you, Sir. I realise

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:57.688
now that I do need a driver.
Oh well, no harm done, Winston. Early days.

00:01:57.688 --> 00:01:59.658
Early days.
Winston smiles relieved that his big adventure

00:01:59.658 --> 00:02:03.008
is over.
The workmen pack up. Job done. The rails look

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:04.078
shiny and new.

00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:09.258
All the engines were happy when the work on
the line was finally finished.

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:12.678
Gordon glides past followed by Percy, Henry
and Thomas.

00:02:12.678 --> 00:02:15.857
New tracks. That's better.
So no more wobbling wagons.

00:02:15.857 --> 00:02:17.948
No more shudders and shakes...
SIR TOPHAM HATT arrives aboard Winston - still

00:02:17.948 --> 00:02:20.868
lurching along in stops and starts as before.
...Unless you're Winston that is!

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:25.478
All the engines laugh, especially Winston,
and he smiles at SIR TOPHAM HATT, who smiles

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.097
too.
&lt;laugh&gt;

00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:26.407
&lt;Chuckles&gt;

00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:33.407
The engines all laughed, but Winston didn't
mind, he was glad to have Sir Topham Hatt

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:40.767
back in the driving seat…once again.
