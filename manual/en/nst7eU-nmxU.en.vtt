00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:07.026
Well, we're building a house for a competition
in Washington D.C., involves 20 colleges

00:00:07.026 --> 00:00:12.286
from around the world, 800 square feet,
we're building it in modules because it needs

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:16.576
to be transported to the national mall for
a contest in Washington D.C. in October.

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:21.766
This project has been a tremendous experience,
I kind of got into it through my advisor

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:25.426
because I'm in the Solar Energy Lab, and
it's just been this phenomenal experience,

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:28.196
I've learned so much about home
construction and architecture

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.926
and how we incorporate that into engineering.

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:33.176
It's been a fantastic learning experience.

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:37.716
It's been kind of crazy, earlier on we took
a little bit more relaxed approach to it,

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:42.866
inviting everyone into design sessions, into
discussions about what the concept should be.

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:45.876
As we get closer and closer to the
end, right know we're six months off,

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:49.856
we're kind of in frantic mode where we're
doing both construction and fixing up drawings,

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:53.706
and dealing with communication stuff,
so our team is really, really busy.

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:58.446
I think what we're trying to do is just,
essentially raise awareness about all the things

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:04.166
that people can do to have a house that might be
a solution to some of the problems we're facing,

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:08.606
so when we build a solar house we're really
trying to use all the technology we can,

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:14.316
and showcase it in ways that maybe the public
can see and understand how they might be able

00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:17.236
to implement it in the same way or
possibly in an entirely different way.

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:19.886
That's the whole idea of this type of house,

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:26.816
we're using for the most part very conventional
building materials, 2x4 stick construction,

00:01:27.246 --> 00:01:30.866
we're just modifying it to make
it more structurally sound,

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:34.226
besides the fact that it's also allowing it

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:37.676
to contain more insulation
to improve the "R" values.

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:42.686
We've essentially tried to incorporate
solar thermal technology in a way

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:45.076
that gives us the most performance possible.

00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:50.516
We have panels on our south wall which may be
slightly atypical, but when we get low sunlight

00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:54.946
in the winter and the sun stays near the
horizon, we get exceedingly high output

00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:59.146
out of those solar panels, just as high as for
instance we do out of the roof panels in summer.

00:01:59.426 --> 00:02:06.086
Here's a real life, practical application
of design, engineering and architecture,

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:09.966
construction that these students that they
wouldn't have had an opportunity to work

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:14.696
on this had it not been for this project,
so it's really high value for many reasons

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:17.526
and it's been really inspirational
to work with these students.

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:20.366
I just can't believe how much
energy they've given to the project.

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:23.516
Earlier on we've had problems
communicating across the table,

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:26.096
you work in different disciplines,
you have different fields

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:28.556
and there's a different set of
language that you establish.

00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:33.136
And so it took us a while to understand where
each other came from and what we were trying

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:35.986
to communicate, but I think our
team is far enough now along

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:38.266
that we're doing really well
in terms of communication.

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:42.546
I almost get teary eyed when
I talk about this, look I did.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:47.946
The students are so amazing, the engineering
students and the architecture students,

00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:50.806
the construction students, the
interior students, the graphic students,

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:53.466
they've all just totally risen to the occasion,

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:58.946
and they are so committed,
so smart, so strategic, so...

00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:03.666
just in there to be on the
team and do whatever it takes.

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:08.666
It's got me really pumped about the future of
this business and when I eventually get done

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:11.896
with school someday it's something I'll
definitely consider getting involved in.
