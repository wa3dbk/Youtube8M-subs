Hi! This is Roy Stringfellow for expertvillage.com.
Today we’re doing a coil pot, as I mentioned

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.690
in earlier segments, and at this moment what
we’re going to do is build some coils. There

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.650
are a couple of ways to build coils. First,
is by hand, actually manually by hand. So

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.000
you take a ball of clay, pull a piece of the
clay off, and begin by rubbing the clay between

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.020
your two hands, something like this. You begin
getting the form of maybe a clay rope kind

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.411
of look like that. What I like to do, because
my hands aren’t quite as wide as the clay

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:46.820
I’m going to have going, is put it on a
flat surface and very gently begin to roll

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.899
the clay out. You can do it with all kinds
of speed, whatever you feel comfortable with,

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.000
but the thing to do is remember you have a
length of clay that you want to have bring

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.850
out here. If you keep your hands in one position,
you’re going to have a critter that comes

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.299
out of this. What I do is kind of roll the
clay, paying attention to both ends, and move

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.299
my hands out with the clay so that it doesn’t
split or fall apart. Then you notice that

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.090
you can get long and longer pieces of clay
and coil. You have to pay attention. Like

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.450
this place here is becoming a little too thin,
so I’ll try not to get that one too much

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.100
with my hands. I slowly roll over this clay
and then make it the length that I think I’m

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.479
going to be able to work with, and the thickness
that I’m going to want on my clay pot. Now,

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.380
as we roll this clay out, you’ll notice
it gets longer and longer. Sometimes your

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.479
going to have this thin spot that’s eventually
going to break off. What I do is I say well

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.530
lets cut our losses, lets move that over there
like that. Now I’ve got a piece of clay

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.679
that’s a little bit more workable and I’ll
move it out like that. You can tell by working

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.390
the clay with your hands this way, you’re
going to have eventually some long pieces

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.090
that are going to be a little bit unmanageable.
So this a more difficult, although this is

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.510
the accepted and accepted way of making coils
for a coil pot. Now, we didn’t lose this

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.440
piece, we’re just simply going to bring
it over here and attempt to make it the same

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.750
size. My idea is that you want your coils
about the same thickness and diameter. You’ll

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.420
see as we put them on a form in a pot, why
we want something like that. The other way

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.700
to make coils is with an extruder, and we’ll
talk about that in the next segment.
