Hey, guys.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.000
Justin here with AmericanMuscle.com and I'm
going to be taking a closer look at one of

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.539
the most popular spoiler options available
for your late S197.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.219
I'm talking about this GT500 Style Spoiler,
available either unpainted or pre-painted,

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.660
fitting your 2010 through 2014 Mustang.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.920
When weighing your aftermarket spoiler options
for your S197, I think you'll find the hands-down

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.410
favorite with many owners out there, myself
included, is the GT500 Style Spoiler for many

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.720
different reasons.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.232
The biggest reason being it really adds to
the aggressiveness here at the rear of the

00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:37.480
car without being over-the-top.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.880
As for the build, guys, we're looking at a
durable yet very lightweight AVS plastic for

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.180
the construction.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.260
Now as I mentioned at the top of this video,
you do have the option of grabbing this spoiler

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.860
either unpainted, if you have a paint hook-up
or if you're going to paint it yourself, or

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.010
for a few bucks more you can actually spring
for the prepainted version, which we have

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.350
installed on our 2011 GT here.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.420
Now the prepainted parts do get sprayed right
here in our state-of-the-art paint booth at

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.690
AM and the best part is, since we use the
same paint and clear coat that Ford uses in

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.580
their factories, you can expect a perfect
color match right out of the box.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.520
Getting your new spoiler installed on to your
ride really isn't that hard of a job but you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.340
will spend a little time removing that factory
spoiler, which can be a little stubborn.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.060
My advice, use a heat gun or a hair dryer
or something similar and just take your time.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.979
Now once you get that thing out of the way,
it's simply a matter of just cleaning and

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.979
prepping the area using the supplied alcohol
prep pads and that 3M adhesion promoter and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.920
then getting this thing installed into place.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.319
Now the nice thing about this particular spoiler
is that you do reuse the bolt holes left by

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.259
your factory spoiler so no drilling necessary.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.359
Now we do call it two hours here on the site
but again, expect most of that time to be

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.479
spent removing that factory spoiler but again,
guys, hit up a Mustang expert here at AmericanMuscle.com

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.920
if you have any questions or concerns.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.350
So if you're looking to grab one of the hottest
spoiler options available for your 2010 through

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.420
2014 Mustang, then be sure to check out either
an unpainted or a prepainted GT500 Style Spoiler

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.759
