00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.170
Hi.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.110
My name's Arem.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.610
I'm 29.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.280
I'm from Bradford.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.410
For a living, I work at
[INAUDIBLE] full-time,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.150
and I am a model
part-time as well.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.810
So I started to lose my hair
in my early 20s, I'd say.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.550
I used to have really
long, curly hair.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.177
And then it just started
to get a lot thinner.

00:00:21.177 --> 00:00:22.760
So there's a lot of
things I've tried.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.480
I've tried laser hair
treatment that didn't work.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.500
I've tried the sprays,
the gels, the shampoos,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.420
just nothing seemed to work.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.800
And massive confidence issue.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.040
And just paranoid on
sort of nights out,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.210
lad's holidays, things like
that, when most of the men

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.050
have got a full head of
hair and I've not got any.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.890
And I've tried the
laser hair treatment.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.510
I did that for 12 months.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.630
That's not worked.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.450
If anything, it's made it
worse than it was before.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.640
I've tried the
gels, the shampoos,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.382
and I've also tried the
spray-on hair, which

00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:55.590
is all right for a quick fix.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.287
But it just makes
you too paranoid

00:00:57.287 --> 00:00:59.620
because if it rains or you
sweat, or anything like that.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.810
You can't go in the pool,
can't have a shower.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.360
It's just not practical
for me, really.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.550
Found out about Skalp on Google.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.700
I did some research on the
actual treatment itself,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.000
and a few came up.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.060
And I read the reviews
on Skalp, and it sounded

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.110
like the best one to go for.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.890
And so I rang up, and booked
in for a free consultation.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.590
And I was a bit nervous because
I've never had a tattoo before,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.360
and I've got phobia of needles.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.380
So this treatment wasn't the
best idea for me, really.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.230
But when it did come down,
they put my mind at rest.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.320
The guys down at Skalp
were brilliant and answered

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.810
all the questions I had, and
reassured me that it would look

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.202
fantastic once it's finished.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.690
So after your
first consultation,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.860
they actually take a picture
of you as you are now.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.401
And then a couple
of days later, they

00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:58.760
send you a picture of
what you would like

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.761
once the treatment's finished.

00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:02.510
And that's kind of
sealed the deal for me,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.010
because once I saw
a picture of what

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.030
I would look like with
hair, it was brilliant

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.363
because obviously I hadn't
had a hairline for that long.

00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:10.289
You forget what you
actually would look like.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.164
Then you come for your
first treatment, which

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:13.640
they put your hairline in.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.670
And you have your first
four hours of treatment.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.340
You leave that week,
and you come back

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.062
for the second session, which
is, again, up to four hours.

00:02:23.062 --> 00:02:24.520
And then after
that, you'd leave it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.100
sort of six to eight weeks,
so it's kind of settled down,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.090
and get used to your skin.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.380
And then you come back for
your final third treatment.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.430
So with me never having a tattoo
before, and phobia of needles,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.700
obviously the first
session was quite scary.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.080
But you don't actually
see the needle, anyway.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.522
And I wouldn't describe
it as painful, either.

00:02:44.522 --> 00:02:45.980
It's just more
annoying that you've

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.610
got to sit there for
a long length of time.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.730
But I'd just subscribe it as a
small pinprick, really, not--

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.746
I wouldn't say painful at all.

00:02:53.746 --> 00:02:57.010
I've had three treatments
now, but the third treatment

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.770
that had--

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.870
because the psoriasis
had flared up.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.360
The actual ink didn't take to my
head, so it was pushing it out.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.930
So I think I do have to
have a fourth session,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.730
just to finish it off.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.300
But to anyone that's got any
doubts or anything like that,

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.370
I recommend, just
definitely go for it.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.660
It's life-changing.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.980
And you'll feel so
much better after it.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.030
