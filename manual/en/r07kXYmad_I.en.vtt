Expert Village. I just heard the timer ding,
so that means we'll check our cookies. Looks

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:19.200
like the first batch is ready to go. That's
a delicious golden brown and it looks like

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:29.820
it's nice and ready to be taken out. You can
let them stay on the pan for just a minute

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.340
and then they'll be easier to remove. Remember
the pan is really hot so you don't want to

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.980
burn your hand. I see over here that two of
them have gotten sort of run into one another.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.010
So while they're still very warm, I'm just
going to take this spatula and stick them

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.050
between the two. They'll be easier to remove
if you do that. That looks okay. I'm going

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:13.619
to slide the spatula underneat.
Even though there was no grease put on the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.180
pan or butter or anything, it comes off because
of course remember we put two whole sticks

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:36.069
of butter into this recipe. There's just enough
on there to prevent the cookies from sticking.

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:45.810
Take them off carefully so that they'll lift
off easily and find a little place for each

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.079
one to cool. Don't try to eat them when they're
still very hot. They're delicious when they're

00:01:53.079 --> 00:02:00.509
warm from the oven, but give them just a quick
minute to cool off because the chocolate will

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:09.100
be very hot and you could burn your tongue
if you're not carful. Remember I mentioned

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.390
that we wanted to be sure to do each one spaced
so that they would have a nice round shape.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.330
If two of them do bump into one another, they'll
have a kind of sharp edge. Not a real problem.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.430
They're still delicious to eat these.
