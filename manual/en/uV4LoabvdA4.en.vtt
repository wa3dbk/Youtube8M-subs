00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:05.799
lets now study about earths magnetic field.

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:07.920
which is also called.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.160
geomagnetic field.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.300
and the study of characteristic of earths
magnetic field we call it terrestrial magnetism.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.669
and about earths magnetic field we can write
down that, it is due to.

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.640
motion of.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:40.719
molten iron alloys. in the inner core of earth.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.750
as we know that.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.149
if a charge particle revolves in a circular
path.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.230
it is considered as an equivalent current
due to its revolution.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.230
and.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.930
due to this equivalent current it produces
magnetic field in the surrounding also.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.430
these magnetic lines of forces are developed
due to the revolution of charge in its surrounding.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.030
similar to this inside the core of earth when
molten iron alloys which are mostly in ionized

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.030
form.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.860
these are revolving due to.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.350
gravitational and, geological reasons.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.159
produces magnetic field in the surrounding
of earth lets have a look on this situation.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.860
say this our earth.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.180
and, we are given, with axis of rotation about
which the earth is rotating.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.700
but due to some.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.579
geological reasons inside the core of earth
the molten iron alloys are revolving. at some

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:40.829
angle to the.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.040
axis of rotation or you can say the axis of
rotation of.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.240
these revolving particle is slightly tilted
at an angle approximately 11 degree. and this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.300
angle is also not a constant it is continuously
changing.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.940
with time and it is considered after couple
of thousands of years.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.360
the axis of.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.500
these rotating iron alloys, will get rotated
by 1 80 degree.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.180
now in this situation these iron alloy charge
particles will behave like an equivalent current.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.670
and it produces a magnetic field in the surrounding
of earth just like.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.860
a coil produces.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.300
and in this situation these can be considered
as, several coils which are developed due

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.180
to rotation of these charge particles.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.500
so this is the cause of.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.470
earths magnetic field or magnetic field in
the surrounding of earth, and the region.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.920
in the earth atmosphere where the magnetic
field exist this region we call, or termed

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.590
as magnaeto-sphere. in the next section weâ€™ll
discuss about, the direction and some characteristics

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.590
associated with earths magnetic field.
