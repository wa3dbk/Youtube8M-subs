00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.960
The first step in converting a decimal to an improper fraction is to convert the decimal to a mixed number.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.520
We'll convert to mixed numbers first.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.340
In this first example, we have 7.6.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.580
To Convert this to a mixed number.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.800
We'll take the whole part or the part to the
left of the decimal,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.760
which is 7,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.560
and then we'll take the part to the right of the decimal,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.900
which is a 6.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.500
Now, we can put the 6 over a power of 10

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.280
and
there's only one digit to the right of the decimal,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.980
so there's only one zero.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.640
We have 7 and 6 over 10.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.600
Now, we can reduce this fraction by dividing
top and bottom by 2.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.980
We have 3 on top

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.740
and 5 on the bottom.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.460
This is equivalent to 7 and 3/5.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.180
Now, to convert this to an improper fraction,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.900
we'll multiply the denominator by the whole number

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.180
and then add the numerator.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.100
5 times 7 is 35 plus 3 is 38.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.640
We have 38 over 5.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.440
In this next example,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.000
we're going to once
again take the whole number part, just the 5,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.900
and then we will put the part to the right
of the decimal

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940
over a power of ten.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.840
Two places to the right of the decimal,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.240
so
two zeroes, 35 over 100.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.820
We can reduce this by dividing top and bottom
by five.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.539
35 over 5 is 7.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.800
100 over 5 is 20.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.300
This is equivalent to 5 and 7 over 20.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.340
To convert to an improper fraction now,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.300
we'll
multiply 20 times 5 which is 100 plus 7, which is 107.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.480
We have 107 over 20.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.880
In the final example, we'll once again take
the whole number of part, three.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.000
Then take the part to the right of the decimal.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.120
375 over three decimal places, so three zeroes.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.160
375 over 1000.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.000
Now, we can divide top and bottom here by
125

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.500
which leaves us with 3 over 8.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.520
This number is equivalent to 3 and 3/8.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.260
Now, to convert to an improper fraction we'll
once again multiply 8 times 3 which is 24,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.720
plus 3 which is 27.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.920
We have 27 over 8.
