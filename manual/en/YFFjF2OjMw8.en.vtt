10 Years of Enterprise Experience
INFRARED SECURITY CAMERAS

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.800
Each of our military grade cameras is night
vision ready for monitoring your facility

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.800
or installation
after hours.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.040
This view is from a camera that is does not
have infrared capabilities and is unable to

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.040
see in the dark.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.520
When you use an infrared camera, you’re
able to see everything within the camera’s

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550
field
of view because the infrared LEDs flood the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.729
area with infrared light so the camera to
record in pitch black

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:17.729
environments.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.250
These cameras are a must have for after-hours
surveillance and monitoring.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.869
MISSING OBJECT DETECTION
Missing object detection allows you to designate

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719
a high value object to monitor.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.450
The moment it is removed
from its position, an alarm can be triggered

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.600
or alerts sent.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.670
This feature is ideal for keeping an eye on
valuable equipment and items.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.619
The camera is always watching so you don’t
have to be.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.871
UNATTENDED OBJECT DETECTION
Like missing object detection, unattended

00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:37.530
object detection allows you to designate a
zone in the camera’s

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.119
view and detect when an object is left in
that area.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.509
For example, if a suspicious item appears,
the software

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.950
will highlight that object on the screen and
can be configured to trigger an alarm or send

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.950
an alert.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.549
This simple feature can help draw attention
to suspicious packages, potential threats,

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.719
even lost items to be
returned to their owners.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:52.719
This feature is ideal for corridors, roads,
parking lots, breezeways, supply depots,

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.719
perimeter fencing, mess halls, and many other
areas.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:54.719
FLOOR PLAN BASED SECURITY SYSTEM NAVIGATION
We understand that not everyone is a security

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.500
system expert and the floor plan based navigation
feature in our

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.069
NVR software was specifically designed to
be used by people outside of the security

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.179
industry.

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.670
Your facility’s
floor plan is recreated and uploaded to the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.659
system where your cameras may be dragged and
dropped onto the blueprint.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.940
To view these video feeds, it’s as simple
as scrolling across your floor plan and clicking

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.940
on the camera.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.970
That video
feed will pop up in a standalone player for

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.250
your viewing convenience.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.830
We have seen this system implemented in numerous
correctional facilities and Police stations.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.040
FACIAL DETECTION
One of the key requirements of security systems

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.190
is monitoring who is entering and leaving
your facility and this feature

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.420
is exceptionally useful to achieve that goal.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.440
The facial detection function in our NVR software
catalogs every face

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.690
captured on video into a thumbnail index and
is time stamped for later use.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.700
This gives you a clear image of each person
that visits your location from the moment

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.100
the face was detected to the moment that it
leaves the camera’s field of view.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.780
This level of documentation is unparalleled
and is highly recommended for use at all of

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.730
your entrances and exits.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.980
OBJECT TRACKING
Object tracking is one of the many features

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.980
that comes in our NVR software and can be
used on any camera in your

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.980
surveillance system through the software interface.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.390
This view is from our 4 megapixel fisheye
camera and when you

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.480
de-wrap the fisheye view into the 180° tri-view,
you have a much better view of the monitored

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.480
area.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.250
The tracking feature automatically follows
movement in the camera’s field of view until

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.140
the person or object comes
to a stop or leaves the area.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.970
The software recognizes that there is movement
and uses the electronic pan, tilt, zoom

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.580
feature of the fisheye camera to follow it
across the field of view and highlight it

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.040
in the top right view frame.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.780
Another fantastic camera view is the multi-grid
view which allows you to simultaneously monitor

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.090
numerous points of
interest with a single camera.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.290
This lets you have multiple static viewing
frames at varying zoom levels so you don’t

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.570
miss any details.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.530
You can monitor entry into a sensitive area
while watching soldiers on duty and keep a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.190
close eye on
foot traffic from a camera the size of a smoke

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.190
detector.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.730
LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION CAMERA SYSTEMS
We regularly integrate license plate recognition

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.960
cameras, also known as LPR cameras, and the
system shown is our

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.000
standard LPR solution that has a 99% license
plate recognition rate.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.310
As you’ll see in the video, the difference
between our 5 megapixel overview camera and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.069
our LPR camera video in the bottom right is
clear.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.370
The quality of the
video produced by the LPR camera gives you

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.130
a clear view of the license plate and, in
most cases, will even allow

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.880
you to see the name of the state as well!

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.930
An LPR camera solution is a valuable addition
to any security system and can be used to

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.350
:
Track visitors &amp; personnel entering and leaving

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.100
your facility
Generate alarms for unauthorized personnel

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.620
or soldiers arriving on site or leaving outside
of approved hours

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.190
Improve the efficiency of your logistic pipeline
Activate other devices such as electric gates,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.270
alarms, and door locks
Monitor on-watch activity

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.650
LPR cameras are specifically engineered with
special IR cut filters that see through ambient

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.389
lighting and poor weather,
and produce the highest quality image possible

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.650
to store captured license plates for later
retrieval.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.159
The license plate
captures are compiled in a very user friendly

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.310
interface that allows you to search by a license
plate number, traffic

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.400
direction, time frame, or by a specific LPR
camera.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.770
The data is then populated on this screen
with the most recent

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.770
capture at the top.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.770
SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEM ADVANCED VIDEO ANALYTICS
PACAKGES

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.139
These following features come standard in
our advanced video analytics package.

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.870
People Counting : Counts the number of people
or objects passing through a pre-determined

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.469
area
Crowd Detection : The software detects that

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:46.720
a crowd has formed and generates an alert
Scene Change Detection : Generates an alert

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.219
when a camera’s focus or field of view is
altered

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:53.419
Advanced Video Stabilization : Compensates
for inclement weather or shaky video in a

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.219
mobile system and produces a clear, steady
image

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.830
Advanced Video Quality Enhancer : Filters
and enhances object visibility in foggy or

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.949
blurred environment caused by bad weather
That concludes our video demonstration.

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.129
