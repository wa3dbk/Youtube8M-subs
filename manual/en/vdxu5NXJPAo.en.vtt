The Institute for Creativity Innovation was an initiative started by President Hargis when he came

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.109
to foster creativity across campus. In September we launched the institute and our purpose is to honor and enhance and

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:28.419
celebrate the creativity and innovation of OSU.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.389
The Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship scholars in the school of entrepreneurship are

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:40.659
responsible for helping plan the creativity festival and they wanted to break a world record to engage the students and

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:47.389
engage the campus so we brainstormed and we came up with worlds largest twister board as a creative way to raise

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.869
money for disaster relief, so twister, disaster.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.489
And we're raising money for Feed the Children, which is an international and local relief organization.

00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:04.480
Before I came to OSU, I helped start the Oklahoma Creativity Project. The reason for that was that we're never going

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.000
to get to the top just spending our way there, nobody's going to drag us to the top, we're going to have to do it. The only

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.509
to do it fast is using creativity. When I came to OSU I felt the exact same way, for us to really reach our full potential,

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.899
we've got to be creative. You could get yourself twisted up and you lose immediately so you've got to think about which

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.030
red you pick, which blue you pick.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.370
I wasn't exactly in uniform for this but for a guy with a bad back it was ok. My wife, who's a 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.200
yoga teacher's still out there. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.000
I've never seen anything like it before. I think i've proven that my left side's stronger than my right. But fresh paint 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and fresh young students, it just doesn't get any better. I got to know my fellow students very well indeed. I think I took

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.200
the high road. Most of the students went down low but I was a little more comfortable up high.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.000
I think the twister game is really good because it's so bright and colorful and really attracts people to see what's going

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.500
on, so I think that shows creativity.
