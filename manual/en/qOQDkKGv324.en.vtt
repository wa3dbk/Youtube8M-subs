To fulfill his promise of building a school in Tibet,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.470
the Sakyong became running marathons to raise money.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.450
&gt;&gt; SMR: These they go in your shoe.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.650
As soon as you cross the starting line and the finish line then it checks your time.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.000
&gt;&gt; Mitchell Levy: And do they have check points to make sure you are not running off course?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.150
&gt;&gt; SMR: You know I am sure you could take a cab. [laughs]

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.100
&gt;&gt; Mitchell Levy: [laughs] That’s what I would do.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.100
&gt;&gt; SMR: I think they have a way of doing it.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:34.280
[whistle]  &gt;&gt; Starter: Five, four, three, two, one [horn sounds]

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.000
&gt;&gt; SMR: We're running for Tibet, we're running for these causes,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.240
and every time you know you have a little bit of suffering, it's going to help a lot of people.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:52.300
[cheering and clapping]

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.630
I think in the West sometimes the body and mind have been split up;

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.210
so when people think about meditation or spirituality,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.340
they think it's very much distancing themselves from body per se.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.230
They are actually meant to be united.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.150
Sometimes when you first start running you have a lot of thoughts.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.650
Just like in meditation, when you first sit down you have a lot of thoughts.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.000
And then once you begin to move, you begin to balance your mind and body;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.540
so I think it's the same with any kind of sport or activity.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.170
If you're riding a horse; it's the balance. If you're skiing or if you're playing golf,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.000
whatever it may be; there's the kind of mind-body coordination.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.860
And that's inherent; 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.000
And that's inherent; because the notion of meditation is that you're synchronizing your mind with your body.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.290
You're using the present moment as your gauge;

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.500
and as soon as you let your mind go too far into the future,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.000
like how long do I have and things like this, automatically sometimes you get to be tired.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The present moment can be this very full moment.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.160
As you're running, if you can be there, time goes by very quickly.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.520
The more processed the mind becomes the stronger it becomes,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580
the more flexible it becomes. Same with the body.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.000
I think if you train the body, it becomes stronger and more flexible.
