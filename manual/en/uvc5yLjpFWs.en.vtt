00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.880
The beginning of the Iraq war
was a moment that no American will ever forget.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.430
Nine years later, we remember those who gave
their lives, and honor the sacrifice of all

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.650
the brave women and men who have served our
country.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.560
In 2008, Barack made a promise that as President,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.980
he would bring the Iraq War to a responsible
end the kept his word. When he took the

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.710
oath of office, more than 140,000 troops were
stationed in Iraq. This past December, the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.160
last of our soldiers came home.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.920
Now that our service members are home, we
are doing everything we can to support our

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.930
veterans and their families in the challenging
transition to civilian life. 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.690
Barack expanded the Veterans Affairs budget

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.940
and made it possible for more than 500,000
veterans previously denied care to become

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.920
eligible for VA health care. And he streamlined
the claims process to ensure that our veterans

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.609
can get the high quality benefits and services
theyve earned  and get those services

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:07.329
more quickly.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.679
Barack helped pass tax credits to encourage

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:13.929
small businesses to hire our wounded warriors.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.539
We also know that when our men and women in

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.359
uniform are called to serve, their families
serve right along side them. Thats why

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.859
weve been working to expand employment
opportunities, job training programs, and

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.399
wellness services for military spouses and
families the folks who bear the greatest

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.579
burden of their loved ones deployment.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.509
In the end, we all have an obligation to support

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.989
those who have served our country so selflessly from
our veterans with special health needs, to

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:51.429
all those seeking to join the civilian workforce,
to families coping with the grief of losing

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.259
a loved one. 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.009
So I hope youll join me in standing up
for all those who have served.
