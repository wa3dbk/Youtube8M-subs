Hey guys it’s Andy, and this is my review
of the Logitech Wireless Performance MX mouse.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.900
Now for a while&nbsp;I&nbsp;was on my quest to find
the best wireless mouse, and after seeing

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.130
a great review from Phil V and along with
many other tech YouTubers recommending this

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.620
Logitech mouse I broke down and bought it
myself. After using it for a month I can say

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.570
that it’s one of the best wireless mice
you can get. It’s rated 4 out of&nbsp;5 stars

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.480
on Amazon and I will leave the link to the
best price in the description below.&nbsp;Now

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.409
I almost did not get this mouse because it
lacks Bluetooth. I really didn’t want a

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:37.699
mouse that required a USB receiver like this
Logitech&nbsp;MX does, but the unifying receiver

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.200
is&nbsp;not that bad. Even though it does take
up one USB port, it’s very small and it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.289
does allow you to connect up to 6 compatible
wireless devices to it. So if you happen to

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.890
get a Logitech wireless keyboard, this single
receiver can handle both&nbsp;the mouse and the

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.879
keyboard.&nbsp;This Logitech Performance MX mouse
is the perfect mix of functionality and design

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.129
in my opinion. I&nbsp;love the looks of it with
the sleek black and silver style. Kinda reminds

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.969
me of a mouse that Batman would use. “Where
is she?”. So I’m very pleased with the

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.490
design&nbsp;and build quality. The first thing
I noticed when I used this mouse is how well

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.230
the mouse conformed to my hand. It has a&nbsp;very
ergonomic build, and the curved sides have

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.530
a slight rubberized finish which gives a perfect
place for my thumb to rest. It takes up about

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.760
the same real estate as my iPhone 6 just to
give you a little comparison. It&nbsp;also has

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.180
a nice weight to it. It&nbsp;weighs more than
expected, but it’s still light enough to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.890
be picked up easily with one hand. The only&nbsp;complaint
I have about the build is how sensitive the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.100
right-click button is. When I&nbsp;just rest my
hand on the mouse, the weight of my middle

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.240
finger always seems to accidentally press
down on the right mouse-click&nbsp;which is something

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.750
I’ve had to get used to.&nbsp;This mouse is
packed with features. First the scroll wheel

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.670
is a normal notch based scroll wheel, but
with the press of a button it turns the scroll

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.750
wheel into a smooth hyper-fast scroll wheel
that comes in handy if you need to scroll

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.820
down long documents or webpages so you can&nbsp;creep
on people’s tweets from 5 years ago. The

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.730
scroll wheel can also&nbsp;be moved left and right
to scroll horizontally which is nice.&nbsp;There

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.930
are forward&nbsp;and back buttons on the side
for when you’re browsing the web&nbsp;and want

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.020
to go back and forward through pages. It has
a zoom button and a&nbsp;window switcher button

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.619
as well. If you download the free Logitech
software you can customize almost&nbsp;all of

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.220
these buttons&nbsp;which is awesome.&nbsp;On the top
there’s&nbsp;the DPI and battery indicator lights.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.190
On the bottom you’ll find the power switch.
It’s also equipped with a Darkfield sensor

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.280
which lets you use this mouse on virtually
any surface even glass. So if you have a glass

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.530
desk you’re in luck.&nbsp;This wireless mouse
comes with a rechargeable AA battery which

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.720
you can charge while you’re using the mouse
with the micro USB cable&nbsp;that comes&nbsp;in the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.780
box. I’ve had this mouse for about 4 weeks,
and yesterday was the first time I had to

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.170
charge it. So the initial charge on this mouse
lasted me a long time, longer than expected

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.030
actually. I did turn the mouse off when I
wasn’t using it so that&nbsp;probably helped.&nbsp;Overall,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.710
the Logitech Performance MX is the best wireless&nbsp;mouse
I’ve ever used. Wireless, rechargeable,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.310
great&nbsp;design, and&nbsp;useful features. You really
can’t go wrong with it. Again, the link

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.290
to the best price on Amazon is in the description
below. If you found this review helpful make&nbsp;sure
