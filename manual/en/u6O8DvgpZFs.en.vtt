00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.500
Destiny: My name is Destiny and I used to
be a cheerleader.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.600
We kind of talked about this previously.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.740
We're getting back into it and I haven't done
it in a long time.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.400
It's probably been about two years since I've
been actively cheerleading and actively doing

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.219
my jumps and my stretches, and whatnot.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.900
I took time off from college to have my son
and so now I'm getting back into the swing

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.869
of the cheerleading stretches and the jumps.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:22.869
It's good for you.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.780
We're going to show you how, with using the
resistance bands, how much it improves your

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.220
jumps and your kicks immediately.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.140
You'll definitely see a difference.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.500
With the resistance bands, you do feel the
resistance.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.800
Martin: Let's do maybe about three of the
kicks with each leg, and three of the leg

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.090
raises, and then I want to show them the differences
when you unbuckle and then we'll go ahead

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.120
and try the jumps.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.120
Destiny: Okay.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.490
We're going to go ahead and do three on each
side as far as the kicks go and then we'll

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.020
go and do leg raises.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.020
Okay.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.530
Now our leg raises.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.970
Martin: Let's unbuckle and then let's just
real quick try that again.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.970
Destiny: Okay.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.420
We're going to go ahead and do three on each
side just like we just did.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.220
See, it's an immediate difference.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.010
It feels like you're flying.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.950
Martin: Let's do you without the bands, then
we'll put the bands on, buckle them up.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.290
Now, we'll come back and we'll do the same
thing and we'll see the difference.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.290
Destiny: Okay.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.500
I'm ready to go ahead and do a toe touch without
that or with them on -- or without them on.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Excuse me.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.729
Just having done your simple kicks and stretches
with the bands on you feel that immediately.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:38.729
Martin: Let's try a couple more just without
the bands.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:47.450
We're going to do a pre and then we're going
to do the bands and then we'll come back here.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.640
Destiny: All right, okay.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.240
Martin: when Destiny has the bands on you're
going to see definitely that she's not going

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.440
to go as high.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.120
Her legs aren't going to go out as far.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.400
Let's try three or four with the bands.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.479
Don't worry about form right now.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.599
We're just working on training to jump higher
to be more fit.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.085
Destiny: Reminder, this is not about the form
because it's not going to look very pretty

00:02:17.085 --> 00:02:18.260
with the resistance bands on.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.370
Careful not to let your legs snap back together.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.410
Martin: We want to control it so that you're
under control and that the bands aren't controlling

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.410
you.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.599
They are going to resist you, but you control
it.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.609
Good job!

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.629
It feels a little bit funny.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.139
Destiny: It does, it does.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:48.450
It definitely feels funny, but you can feel
how much of an impact it's going to make.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.230
Martin: Let's unbuckle them.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.629
Destiny: Okay.

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.890
It's a lot easier going back up into it.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.889
Your momentum is a million times better.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.831
Oh, it's a workout!

00:03:00.831 --> 00:03:02.519
You definitely feel the impact immediately.
