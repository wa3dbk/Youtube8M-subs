(hard rock music)

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.637
Chad: Hey Chad Ferguson
here, Catfishedge.com,

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:16.000
and, I want to talk to
you a little bit today,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.026
about locating blue catfish.

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:21.156
Now, one of the questions

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:24.856
that I get so often is,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.557
"How do you go out and find fish?

00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:30.392
"How do you know where it is

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:31.836
"that you need to fish?

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:34.562
"How do you pick a location?"

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.208
And, I want to tell you
a very simple trick.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.305
This is locating blue catfish
in its most basic form.

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:50.171
Find the bait and you find the fish.

00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:52.336
Now, there are going to be times where

00:00:52.336 --> 00:00:53.704
you go out and you're going

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:55.905
to find bait all over the place,

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:58.705
but you may have a hard time finding fish.

00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:01.271
But a good general rule to go out,

00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:04.668
and locate blue catfish of all sizes is

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.369
to find out where the bait is.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.964
Find that target area or target depth

00:01:10.964 --> 00:01:15.283
that the majority of the
bait fish are holding in.

00:01:15.807 --> 00:01:16.937
Now, there may be times

00:01:16.937 --> 00:01:19.974
that those bait fish are
scattered out all over,

00:01:19.974 --> 00:01:23.807
and, there's not one single place,

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:25.558
but if you can narrow down

00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:31.037
to any extent where those
bait fish are holding

00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:32.558
what depth they're in,

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:34.704
what kind of areas they're in,

00:01:34.704 --> 00:01:37.537
that's going to do wonders for you,

00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:40.103
to go out and locate
and catch blue catfish.

00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:41.438
Now, most of the time,

00:01:41.438 --> 00:01:43.557
those bait fish are going

00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:46.307
to be threadfin shad and gizzard shad.

00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:49.637
Now, there's other bait
fish obviously as well.

00:01:49.637 --> 00:01:53.051
But the vast majority of the country

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:55.823
that has blue catfish
populations has threadfin shad

00:01:55.823 --> 00:01:58.558
and gizzard shad populations as well.

00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:00.676
So, if you can go,

00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:03.718
and learn in the most basic form,

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:08.083
how to find schools of shad,

00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:13.641
then start looking in those
areas for blue catfish

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.474
and that's going to
really shorten your curve

00:02:16.474 --> 00:02:19.338
to go out and finding these fish.

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:23.438
Now, there may be fish all
up in those schools of shed,

00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:26.194
there may be fish near them,

00:02:26.778 --> 00:02:30.027
and you may not find
any at all for a while,

00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:32.233
but, I promise you

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:34.301
that if you'll follow that rule,

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:36.369
find the bait,

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.327
and you'll find the fish.

00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:41.161
It's going to help you tremendously

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.452
with locating and catching blue catfish.

00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:46.286
Now, there's all sorts
of variables to this,

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:47.757
and there are times,

00:02:47.757 --> 00:02:51.191
and you can certainly catch blue catfish

00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:53.882
when there's no bait fish around at all,

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:57.256
but, that is the simplest
way that I can tell you

00:02:57.256 --> 00:02:59.524
to go out and locate
and catch blue catfish.

00:02:59.524 --> 00:03:01.715
Find the bait and you'll find the fish.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:05.837
Now, if you want to get
more in-depth information,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.940
and all sorts of tips and tricks,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.869
on locating and catching shad,

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:13.069
go over to the catfishedge website

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.703
and check out some of the resources there.

00:03:16.703 --> 00:03:18.244
I've got all kinds of great stuff

00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:19.661
that are going to help you

00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.036
with a lot of these basics

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:24.161
of going out, locating and catching shad,

00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:28.577
and finding where they
are in a body of water.

00:03:28.577 --> 00:03:31.270
so you can, not only catch them for bait,

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.661
but so you can find them
to catch catfish with,

00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:37.936
but then I've also got some
more in-depth resources

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:39.432
through the forms of e-books,

00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:41.985
and some other paid products,

00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:44.296
that are really going to
get you on the fast track

00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:47.400
to locating and catching shad and then,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.150
in turn, going in and
locating blue catfish.
