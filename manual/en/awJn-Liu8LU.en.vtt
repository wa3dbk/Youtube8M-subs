Hi, I am Natalja from the Red Brick Cafi.
On behalf of Expert Village, we are going

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.180
to learn how to properly make the popular
gourmet coffee house drinks. So now we are

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.150
going to learn how to make Matcha Iced Latte.
Just like you are making a regular hot Matcha

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.070
Latte, we are actually going to use the powdered
green tea that has already been sweetened.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.630
The only thing that is changing is that we
are changing the order of how to pour into

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.310
the glass or how we are mixing it in the glass.
I am to start with putting the powder into

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.370
this little pourer here. Going to put 3 teaspoons
worth for a small Matcha Latte. Then, just

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:48.081
going to add some hot water. Just a hint;
just to be able to dissolve it. Then I am

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:59.280
going to use a spoon and really dissolve it
in the pourer. The next step is to put your

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:13.301
ice into the cup. Then we are going to use
homogenized milk and if, it depends on you,

00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:17.820
if you prefer the skim or soy, it doesn't
matter; but we are going to use the whole

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:30.000
milk. We just go about 3/4 because we are
going to add the Matcha to it. Then to get

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.820
all the Matcha out, because it is a fairly
expensive product, you don't want to loose

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:46.670
any of the good stuff, add some milk into
the pourer, mix it, pour it back here. Stir

00:01:46.670 --> 00:02:01.940
with a spoon. Add some more milk. There you
go. That's how you make an Iced Matcha Latte.
