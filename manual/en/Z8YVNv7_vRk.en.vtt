&gt;&gt; Hilah: Hey dudes!

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.520
I am Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking I am
gonna show you a really, simple, quick springtime

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.520
salad.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.759
We’re gonna make a green pea salad with
goat cheese, and this is sort of a modern,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.799
twist on the classic green pea salad that
usually has like a lot of mayonnaise, and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.410
celery, and a little old tiny, perfect cubes
of American cheese, and it’s real delicious

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.910
actually if you don’t believe me it is,
but this is just a little bit lighter, and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.570
a little more, it’s a little prettier I
think personally, and you know, you eat with

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.350
your eyes first and all that stuff.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.079
That goes for people too!

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.970
What does that mean?

[Green Pea Salad Recipe]

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.730
&gt;&gt; Hilah: Okay, so for this salad I am going
to use frozen peas.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.730
I’ve just defrosted these.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.149
I’ve put them in a colander, and then just
pour some boiling water over it.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.789
If you want to use fresh peas, you can totally
feel free to shell a couple of pounds of peas.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.769
It makes no difference to me, but you’ll
just want to blanch them for like 30 seconds

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:55.769
to get them cooked.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.859
So these are now thawed but still very cold.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.200
The boiling water isn't enough to like heat
them up or anything.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.450
It just thaws them out.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.980
So we got those in there.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.040
That’s diced celery.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.940
That’s classic, and then Chris and I were
able to go out to this goat farm a couple

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.750
of weeks ago, Blue Heron Farm and shoot some
stuff out there.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.250
They make this really awesome goat cheese.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.890
You can use any kind of goat cheese obviously,
but this is just a plain chevre, and when

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.650
it’s cold it’s crumbly, and this goes
for all chevres, but when it’s cold it’s

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.360
cold it’s crumbly, and when it’s room
temperature warm it’s creamy, so we want

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.640
to use this cold because we want to sort of
keep it in little, nice little clumps like

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.950
that, and this particular one is not very
like goatey like some goat cheese is a little

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.950
strong.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.140
This one is really, really mild.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.520
So just find one that you like.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.600
You want about, oh, about a half a cup of
that in there, and then I’ve got some fresh

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.660
herbs .I’ve got parsley, and then the secret
little kicker is some fresh mint.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.420
If you don’t have any fresh mint growing,
and you don’t want to pay like $500 for

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.219
a sprig at the store, you can just use some
dried mint, a couple of pinches.

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.689
In that case you’d want to make the salad
maybe an hour or two ahead of time just to

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:21.670
let that sort of dried her get all infused
with all the flavors and everything.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.770
You can make this also like a couple, maybe
eight hours ahead of time with no noticeable

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.790
difference, and then a little squeeze of lemon
juice, oooh, that squirted out really cutely.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.129
Just prettier than a picture.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.819
Don’t get any seeds, and a little lemon
juice goes a long way here, and a little bit

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.530
of salt, and the amount of salt that you put
in is gonna to depend on your cheese.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.049
Some goat cheeses are saltier than others.

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.980
This one is not particularly salty, so a little
bit of that, and then we’re just going to

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.860
toss it together really gently.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.920
Like, we don’t want to break up those little
clumps of goat cheese too much because I think

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.489
it just looks so beautiful with all these
different shades of green and the white.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.810
I mean, c’mon, it’s gorgeous, wow!

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.810
There.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.810
That’s it.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.810
We’re done.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.180
So this is like the shortest video in the
history of Hilah Cooking, and give it a little

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.909
taste, and just taste it and see if you want
to add more lemon or more salt, you know,

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.560
like a lot of times most recipes if their,
they taste good, but they’re not delicious,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.389
try adding, you know, a little bit of salt,
and/or a little bit or lemon juice, and that

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.800
kind of takes pretty much every recipe that’s
just okay and makes it awesome, so you know,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.120
adjust to your taste, but I am going to taste
this now.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.120
Mmmmmmm!

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.120
Mmmm!

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.120
Man, I love popping little peas in my mouth.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.480
It’s such a joyful feeling, and this salad
is just so bright and light and lively and

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.480
wonderful.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.790
It would go great with any kind of like grilled
fish or grilled chicken or anything like that,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.529
any kind of light protein would be fabulous,
and I think it’s really beautiful too.

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.150
I think it might be even pretty enough to
serve for Valentine’s Day.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.810
So, there you go, green pea salad with goat
cheese.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.810
I hope you try it.
