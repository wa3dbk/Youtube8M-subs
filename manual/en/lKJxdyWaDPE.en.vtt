00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:21.460
I’m a 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.850
huge fan of Disney...at least, classic Disney.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.519
And I’m a huge fan of Disney video games,
too...at least, classic Disney games.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.530
From Chip ‘n Dale and DuckTales to Epic
Mickey and Castle of Illusion, Disney characters

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.069
translate beautifully to video games when
they’re done right.

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:43.530
The thing is...not all Disney video games
fall into that category.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.730
There’s another category, too...the obvious
category of “oh, it’s just a crappy licensed

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.730
game.”

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.389
But the interesting thing about this particular
Disney game...is that it doesn’t fit into

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:56.389
either category.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:01.739
I mean, you don’t even need to play Disney
Princess: My Fairytale Adventure to see that

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.129
it’s obviously not one of those Disney classics.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.860
But I wouldn’t call it a crappy licensed
game, either.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:20.350
I 
guess the key question here is, “Are you

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.380
a six-year-old girl?”

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.119
Because if you are, you’re probably very
happy to hear this and I appreciate you watching.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.229
Although you probably shouldn’t be.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.310
I say awful things sometimes.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.979
Everyone else is probably like, “Derek,
come on...you actually like this crap?”

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:33.979
Uh, yeah.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:34.979
I do.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.510
It’s a perfectly fine kids game that lets
me create my own Disney princess.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.159
If you don’t want to create a Disney princess,
you’re a godd*mn liar.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.979
After you create that princess, you take her
on a delightful journey through various Disney

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.979
worlds.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.319
You get to interact with Ariel from The Little
Mermaid and Belle from Beauty and the Beast

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.560
and all the whole lovely crew.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.649
They all have these problems, which they ask
you to help them solve.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:07.189
I’d help Ariel with plenty of things.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.510
So the premise is fabulous, the game looks
beautiful...the problem is its a kids game.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.690
Which means the gameplay doesn’t exactly
hold up its end of the bargain.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.620
It’s a basic recipe of simple platforming,
lots of fetch quests, zap the evil fairies.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.959
The game never really switches gears, but
again, that’s understandable given the audience.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.830
The customization is nice, but it’s actually
pretty clunky in practice.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.430
In fact, the game generally feels clunky at
times.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.810
You can’t just check out a dress—if you
pick one, the game automatically slaps it

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.000
on you and moves on.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.930
To continue, press B...not A.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.450
You know, like every other game ever.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.420
Listen, I’m not a six-year-old girl.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.120
But we do have some common interests.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.049
I prefer milk with my cookies, I’m not afraid
to wear pink and yes, I cried when Belle danced

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.530
with the beast.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.530
She looked stunning.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.959
This game isn’t stunning.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:08.770
But it’s not a bad dress for a six-year-old
girl.
