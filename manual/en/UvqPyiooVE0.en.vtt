for pates marker for phone dot dot com
in Everson CES a few months back

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.110
Samsung has been prepping a new one a
tablet's call the Pro Series

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.710
it's a new line created to give the most
powerful most beautiful experience to

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.820
all tablet users

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.580
and what you've got here is the biggest
baddest most expensive tablet they've

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.150
got

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.550
it's the same some no pro12 point2 from
a name alone you guessed it has a

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.180
12-point too anxious play

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.090
but it also has a whopping 2560 by 1600
resolution

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.130
which gives it 247 pixels per inch

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.360
in comparison the iPad air only houses a
2048

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.460
by 1536 resolution it does get washed
out

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.460
really extreme angles but overall it's
pretty good you add content looks great

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.320
when it's optimized for the extra screen
real estate but when he loade things

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.050
like Twitter

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.870
visually it's not taking advantage other
display I like a tailor-made

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.219
applications for the iPad

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.730
inside this WiFi only model you'll find
a 1.92 GAA hurts quad-core processor

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.160
sitting next to a 1.3 gigahertz
quad-core processor

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.420
working at an art to core configuration
and if that wasn't enough you also find

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.780
3 gigabytes of RAM

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.170
and 8-megapixel rear-facing camera for
those people in a 2-megapixel

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.549
front-facing camera for everyone else

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.439
this is an auto but since it's quite
large much larger than most your average

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.590
size up tablets at timepoint one inches

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.000
like its own top row brother and
material on the back to the same

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.759
faux-leather what's found on the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 per obviously on a much

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.790
larger scale

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.079
Italian is pretty thin overall coming in
at 8 millimeters thick

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.530
nope wrote 0.2 has a few ports and
buttons running along the side

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.850
starting with the bottom its be
completely clean with no ports

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.790
on the left side of I'd wanna be two
stereo speakers and a 3.5 kilometre

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.610
headphone jack

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.829
on the top you'll find the sleep/wake
button next to the volume rocker

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.460
a microphone plus a IR blaster for your
Samsung Smart TV

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.630
and on the right side you'll find your
trust the ESC onslaught as second stereo

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.140
speaker

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.579
micro SD card slot to expend a 32
gigabyte internal storage any micro USB

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.619
port for charging

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.810
one thing to have nurses for size it
almost feels like something that should

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.189
be running Windows 8

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.219
summer to the Samsung achieve tablets of
last year but this is not running

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.939
Windows 8

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.099
it's running Android 4.0 4.2 k cat for
new skin called

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.180
magazine you ax essentially it's a
slightly lighten version of TouchWiz

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.640
summer to a touch was we looked at on
the Samsung Galaxy S five

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.700
and the magazine part comes in a way of
streams amusing stories on separate home

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.290
screens

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.780
now I see home screens because I don't
exactly know what to call these things

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.660
we are not home screens but they're also
not applications Sophie slide into this

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.970
magazine the you can see feeds from news

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.209
sports tax in blocks really anything but
how some sort of RSS feed

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.250
it's basically it ripped off urging the
Flipboard actually I think I'll leave it

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.739
at that

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.670
it's a ripoff a Flipboard I'm not
exactly sure what the real use for it is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.920
I've never been a fan of RSS readers but
I love the way Flipboard worked

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.319
I usually go to be independent
applications from my news my sport

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.379
and tack but I do like the idea of a
central hub for software

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.989
to give you everything that you wanted
but it won't be optimized for one single

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:01.870
news feed

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.909
so like most people I use notifications
for all of my alerts and I kill

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.400
directly to the application Murphy alert
came from only a few times have I ever

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.050
used Magazine on Oprah twelve-point you

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.860
now if you love Flipboard you love
magazine now back to incorrect

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.950
it looks like touch was a only more
Google on top I do like the Google now

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.680
icon on the bottom left corner

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.239
it gives a slightly faster access to
Google now a little bit better than

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.659
holding down the home button

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.470
I do wish it had the okay Google phrase
that the Nexus phone taps Google now

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.099
it's just much better than us voice
which still sadly exists on the no pro

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.170
top white to

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.209
now Samsung is marking this talent ass
keep role model

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.549
and it comes off Pro software or so
Samsung thinks

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.220
it comes to be split where applications
like each cell basically a spreadsheet

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.849
application each word

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.750
H show and so on and so on to meet the
sound like a direct response to Apple's

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.280
pages on all their ISL s products

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.860
they are useful but it doesn't connect
to the cloud like I cloud does or

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.019
Microsoft's one drive

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.939
so that a massive massive fault this
isn't exactly an

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.519
ecosystem solution moreover the by
solution to compete with the rest of the

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:08.080
pack

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.900
it once you figure that out you'll see
that this is in a tablet for the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.620
professional

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.439
if you really do need something pro you
have Microsoft Surface tablets

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.889
that's running a full version of Windows
8 but if we take up the pro goggles any

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.620
take a look at this tablet just

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.780
as a tablet you'll find this extremely
fast and efficient

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.040
no pro12 point2 has made me use the S
Pen more but I ever had before

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.080
a larger surface allows you to do things
like as notes action memos

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.979
air gestures and one my favorites with a
larger display is panel window

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.470
just basically dropped the space where
you want your multi window application

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.229
to run and

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.290
events like the application you what and
if you're worried about the performance

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.780
at the No pro12 point to you really
should

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.880
I mean two quad-core processors really
is enough to run Android 4.0 4.2

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.509
and magazine you actually no sweats
there are a few kinks currently worth

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.490
magazine but nothing but software
updates can't fix

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.410
and speaking of software updates
hopefully this new friendship with

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.930
Google means Fasher Android updates in
the future

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.100
on like its touch was counterpart also
battery life is amazingly good at the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.190
battery is rated at ninety five hundred
million powers

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.870
it took me for two days to run this down
into the red zone

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.729
but this is still a premium product its
price at seven hundred and forty nine

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.220
dollars and ninety nine cents

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.150
for the wifi model wilde's larger more
powerful than most of its competitors

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.610
I just don't see why I would spend an
extra $250 dollars

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.880
for a tablet with the same features as
all the other tablets

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.930
it's clearly not a pro product the only
pro tablet device currently around

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.360
is Microsoft Surface pro article for
version of Windows 8

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.400
in also intel's i5 chip for the average
consumer go buy something like the

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.240
Kindle Fire

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.380
the Nexus tablets or he have deeper
pockets for a tablet

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.979
