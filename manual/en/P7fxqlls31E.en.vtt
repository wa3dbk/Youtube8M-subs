00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.820
Hi, I'm Jordan from Picklee.com.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.460
Today we're going to learn how to achieve a super distressed crackle finish

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.300
on this vintage drum table.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.460
We're going to layer two colors on top of each other

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.400
to make this table look like it's been around for centuries.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.700
For this project, we're going to use Americana Decor Chalky Finish paint in two colors.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.860
We chose Vintage and Refreshing.

00:00:28.363 --> 00:00:33.723
We're also going to use the Crackle Medium to achieve that nice aged, crackled look.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.300
Once our piece is complete, we're going to seal it off with the Ultra-Matte Varnish

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.214
to give it a nice matte finish, so it will really look like it's been around for a while.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.300
We're also going to use two brushes. A larger brush to apply the paint,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.280
and then a smaller brush to apply the crackle finish.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.720
To achieve a crackled finish, we always start with a basecoat of paint

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.320
followed by the Crackle Medium, and then a second coat of a somewhat contrasting color.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.840
For my first coat of paint, I chose to use the color Vintage

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.075
which is a nice pale shade of blue.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.680
I love the natural color of this wood, so I want to kind of work with it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.420
when I distress and crackle this piece.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.640
So for my first coat of paint, rather than using a full-coverage coat,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.760
I'm just going to lightly dip the brush into the paint

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.580
and apply a very light, streaky coat, allowing some of that natural wood color to show through.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.120
This will ensure that once we crackle our piece with a second coat of paint,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.027
we'll still see some of that wood.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.000
So as you can see, we completed our first coat of Vintage on our table.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.300
It's only about a half hour later, and it's already dry to the touch.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.020
So the next step is to lightly apply the Crackle Medium

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.740
over the entire table.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.219
You don't really need a real heavy coat of this.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.580
Just enough to kind of lightly coat the piece.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.540
So it's been about a half hour since we applied the crackle finish over our table,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.214
and it looks like it's pretty much dry to the touch.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.540
As I mentioned, for my top coat I chose the color Refreshing.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.460
I just thought it was a nice contrast with that pale Vintage blue.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.880
So the weight of our top coat depends on how thick and large we want our cracks to be.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.280
I want to have smaller cracks on this piece, so I'm going to apply a very thin top coat.

00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:02.713
I would go a lot heavier on my top coat if I wanted real wide and large cracks.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.380
Similar to our first coat, I'm just going to lightly dry-brush

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.800
right on top of our crackle finish.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.660
We're still going to allow some of that natural wood color to show through.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.700
After about 10 minutes, we can already start to see those beautiful cracks develop.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.040
See, you can definitely notice the two different tones of paint

00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:53.933
along with that natural wood color peeking through.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.420
You can kind of get a peek at what that dry-brushing did

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.200
in addition to the crackle effect.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.520
Definitely makes this look like a period piece that's been painted a few times

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.040
and swapped for centuries.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.160
About an hour after applying the final coat of paint,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.000
it should be just about dry.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.140
Especially with a smaller piece like this, with a very light top coat.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.880
So we're going to go ahead and apply the Americana Decor Ultra-Matte Varnish.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.320
And I like to use a heavy duty paper towel to apply my top coats,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.720
just because it goes on real smooth.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.780
So basically

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.160
in kind of a straight-line motion

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.340
you're going to apply a real thin, thin coat

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.560
right over the top of your piece, over the entire piece.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.800
And this is going to cure the paint

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.520
and make it so you have a nice durable surface.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.160
So I just finished sealing our table

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.894
and it looks like we're done.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.180
We just transformed this boring old piece

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.580
into a table that's packed with character.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.520
It looks like it could have been passed down for decades.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.720
I hope you enjoyed watching this tutorial.
