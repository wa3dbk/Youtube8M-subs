Hi, Alan Stratton from As Wood Turns dot com.
In May, I attended the Utah Woodturning Symposium

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.460
in Provo, Utah. There were a lot of great
demos, an instant gallery that you could not

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.200
believe in honor of Dale Nish.
One of the fun contests was an egg cup turning

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.750
contest. People would sign up and then turn
an egg cup as quickly as fast as you could

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.440
either as an individual or as a team. I decided
to participate; my time was not the best.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.590
I think I turned out something that was reasonable.
But, in all cases, they were somewhat rough.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.510
So, I decided that when I returned home, I
need to turn a real finished egg cup. One

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.510
that was actually finished, sanded and looks
good. So here it is, an egg cup. Now I just

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.189
need an egg to go in it. Since I don't eat
soft boiled eggs, I'll have to use it as a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.890
display.
So, let's make an egg cup.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.260
The wood for this egg cup is a piece of juniper
that I brought home from Arizona. While there,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.659
I rough turned it round and cut a tenon on
each end. However, these tenons became my

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.960
biggest problem. Now I'm back on my full sized
lathe and my normal chuck jaws are larger

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.900
than the tenon. I decided to go ahead anyway
and try it with my long nose jaws. That was

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.240
a mistake. All went well as long as the tail
stock was in place.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.530
But as soon as I moved the tail stock to hollow
the cup, I was in trouble. The long nose jaws

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.530
have a very small gripping surface to grip
down to 3/8" which means they have a very

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.540
small gripping surface on my approximately
1.5" tenon. These jaws are also straight without

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.649
any dovetail. Between the soft wood of this
juniper and the small gripping surface, the

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.649
wood jumped out immediately.
I tried the steady rest with similar results.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.719
No choice but to cut a new tenon. This tenon
is slightly deeper than the first one but

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:35.150
with a larger diameter. It has a dovetail
shape. Most importantly, it is only slightly

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.669
larger than the minimum gripping diameter
for my normal jaws.

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:46.019
Now that the wood is secure I can continue
hollowing the cup portion. I started with

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.980
a spindle gouge hollowing from the center
out. I quickly went fairly deep but found

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.760
it difficult to widen it out this way. I think
the grind on this gouge is not quite adapted

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.459
to this cut. I finished the hollow cutting
from large to small but that is doing a lot

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.459
of cutting against the grain. Then fine-tuned
the cup with a round nose scraper.

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:33.180
Then sand and finish the cup interior.
Then on to shape the exterior after first

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.180
marking the cup depth on the outside -- I
don't want an egg cup funnel. An egg cup is

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:47.290
a lot like a goblet with a minimal stem. I
also want a fairly substantial base in case

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.069
it would ever be used to eat an egg. It would
be bad news to tip over or too easily slide

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:01.069
around. The juniper is soft but finishing
very nicely.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.550
Then sand and finish the exterior with beeswax
and mineral oil.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.220
Then part it off angling in the tool to provide
a concave base. I sanded the bottom with a

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.509
2" pad in the drill press and signed the bottom.
Mike Waldt is an expert goblet turner. I'll

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:04.509
let him judge whether my egg cup counts as
a mini goblet. Meanwhile, this egg cup is

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.550
much nicer than my 2 ½ minute cup from the
Utah Woodturning Symposium. But it took much

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.550
longer than 2 ½ minutes. I'll never use it
to eat a soft boiled egg. Yuck. But it is

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.650
a good display base for a future turned egg.
