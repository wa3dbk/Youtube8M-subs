00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.210
Good day.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.860
The early to mid 2000's was really a hay day
for the first person shooter genre.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.330
They still had great, fast paced run-and-gun
gameplay from the previous era, but now this

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.240
gameplay actually had context.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.440
Now you had more to do than just run forward
and kill everything.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.640
AI and enemy types were also getting more
varied and complex.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.430
Now, enemies were getting smart enough to
fight back instead of dying in droves.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.350
Now, here we have Return to Castle Wolfenstein.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.200
A sequel, slash remake, of what is quite literally
the first first person shooter.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.640
It is one of the best examples of that new
breed of first person shooters.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.110
Graphically, the game was quite good looking,
with the enemies looking quite detailed, moreso

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.149
than just about any other at that time.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.460
Really, this is one of the first games to
reach the graphics plateau.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.110
Essentially, in the early 2000's, graphics
reached a point where they still looked good

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.860
even to modern eyes.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.150
The 3D models and levels here look as good
as any seen today.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.280
Sure, modern graphics may be sharper, with
slightly better textures, but they will still

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.770
look pretty much like this.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.020
Gameplay is... that of a first person shooter,
as one would expect.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.590
But there is more to do than just shoot, and
at times there are other ways of dispatching

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.360
enemies than just shooting them.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:58.640
You get a knife, and you can perform stealth
backstabs.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.310
As you can see, it's pretty bloody effective.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.530
There are also objects you can interact with,
such as alarms and switches that can lead

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.000
to secret areas.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.070
That's really the best thing about this game;
the secrets are handled just like they were

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.280
back in the day.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.099
You activate something and then a bit of the
wall moves.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.010
And then you can of course find weapons and
ammo, OR gold, which is just an amazing little

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.330
touch.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.950
Another cool thing is that the game gives
you your stats upon completion of a level,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.170
and it tells you how many attempts it took
to complete it.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.200
So if you suck tremendously, you will know
just how bad you suck.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.690
AI for the game is really quite good.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.760
The enemies actually know how to get into
cover, and will work together to kill you.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.090
Furthermore, the instruction manual even says
that enemies are smart enough to kick grenades

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.240
at you, which they do to pretty good effect.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.200
Sound for the game is pretty damn good.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.340
Return to Castle Wolfenstein was really one
of the first games of that era to have an

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.420
overly orchestral soundtrack that actually
does a good job of giving the game a nice,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.880
dramatic feel.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.570
Now all the weapons sound really good, with
the MP-40 sounding really deep and powerful,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.740
and more menacing than it has since.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.540
Voice acting is also spot on, and pretty much
better than any other voice acting heard in

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.590
any other first person shooter game of this
era.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.910
The story for the game is deep and complex;
on the surface, the game may appear to be

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.860
another generic war shooter, but it is anything
but.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.740
The plotline does not just stay in basic World
War II territory.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.940
Essentially, it's not even until halfway into
the game that the real villain is even mentioned.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.870
And when you finally get to the end of the
game, well, let's just say it's a metric ton

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.870
of awesome.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.480
Thankfully, this game was not affected by
the later FPS standard two weapon rule.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.410
You can carry a huge number of weapons and
ammo is actually handled realistically.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.550
You see, you eventually get a Thompson Submachine
Gun, but you never actually get any ammo for

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.150
it because you're behind the German lines
and they don't use that particular weapon.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.600
Really, the main weapon you will be using
in the game is the solid and dependable MP-40.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.140
Not only was it an exemplary weapon in real
life, but here, it is basically the main weapon

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.140
of the game.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.630
It has a great rate of fire, and you trip
over so much ammo for it that you never really

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.019
will run out.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.300
Then there is the sniper rifle.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.180
It's accurate, ammo is somewhat plentiful,
and it's very powerful.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.820
The Silenced Sten is... okay.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.040
It allows for stealth, but not much else,
as it overheats quite quickly.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.410
Now there are many other great weapons to
be found in the game, but I don't want to

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.020
spoil them here.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.650
But let's just say, on some of the harder
enemies found later in the game, you definitely

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.320
need to get Ol' Painless out of the bag.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.340
The enemies have a very wide variety as they
range from the generic infantrymen to the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.060
elite infantrywoman that is armed with a Silenced
Sten, and if you think that doesn't make sense,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.010
then guess what the next type of enemy you
fight is!

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.010
ZOMBIES!

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.150
Yes, in this game, you don't just fight half
the German army.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.620
Instead, there are various paranormal and
cybernetic enemies to be found.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.270
In short, the game does not ever get boring
on the enemies front.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.410
So in the end, Return to Castle Wolfenstein
was just as epic and legendary as Wolfenstein

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.410
3D.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.460
It had great throwbacks to classic first person
shooting, while still keeping with the then

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.190
modern style of first person shooting.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.030
This is a game that is, of course, a must
have.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.770
And so, this is Jon, signing off.
