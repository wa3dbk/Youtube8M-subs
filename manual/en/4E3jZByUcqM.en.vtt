00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.990
When you're transitioning from seated to standing/climbing,
if it's a condition where you have good traction

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.500
ideally you would want to shift up 2 gears
to harder gears to compensate for the fact

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.060
that you're going to make more power and get
the most efficiency out of it. Then, when

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.460
you are climbing standing you have to focus
on keeping your weight shifts appropriately.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.750
As we climb this section of trail, I will
demonstrate both appropriate and inappropriate

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.160
weight shifting and weight distribution as
well as pedaling technique and you'll see

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.239
what the marked differences are and style.
So, I'll start off trying to ride rather sloppy

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.739
and we'll see if that nets the desired negative
result. So I'm starting off on real upright,

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:59.579
you know, standing and just you know it's
like riding a bucking bronco. Things just

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.890
aren't working out well. I was in a really
low gear, really standing up. It's hard for

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.000
me to mess up sometimes, but I think you understand
what the desired... what's going to happen

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.570
is you're going to spin out. I'll grab the
two gears that I should grab, lower my weight,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.390
get nice and low and it enables me to get
up this climb which is a lot more difficult

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.370
than the section I was just on with a lot
less wasted energy and climbing is partially

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.570
about conserving energy so you can have more
fun on the downhill. Grab those two extra

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.930
gears which you want to make sure you are
getting the most out of your efficiency. I

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.632
lowered my center of gravity and really pulled
back on the wheel and tried to pedal a little

00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:54.430
bit smoother and it kept me on the bike doing
what I need to do.
