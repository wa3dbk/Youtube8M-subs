00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:13.169
Fi fi fo fum...I'm Matt Guff, this is The
House Snowboard Shop.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:19.560
This is a Burton Bullet Snowboard. This is
for the big-footed snowboarder. You could

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.060
be a tall guy with big feet, you could be
a short guy with big feet, you could be a

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.390
girl with size 16 feet, this could be the
board for you if you want to advance your

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.689
skills to the next level.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.210
It has a feel rating of a 2 so it's going
to be nice and soft, and it is part of the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:50.120
Double Chair tier of snowboards in the Burton
line. It has an EZ V rocker, so on the nose

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.670
and on the tail there's going to be a slight
rocker and there's going to be V rock in the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.420
middle, making for one continuous rocker shape.
It does have a directional shape, and depending

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.040
on what size you get there is a 3 to 6 mm
taper on the tail.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.190
The flex is a twin flex, so the nose and the
tail are going to flex basically the same.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.920
It does have the classic Burton Fly Core.
Tip to tail laminate wood that runs parallel

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:29.140
with the edges. It does also have a negative
profile core. The negative profile is thicker

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.659
in the middle and gradually tapers off to
reduce swing weight and material in the nose

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.659
and the tail.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.360
It has Biax fiberglass. The fiberglass strands
run at 0 degrees and at 90 degrees throughout

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.229
the board, giving it a nice, soft, buttery
feel.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.870
It has a low-maintenance extruded base. A
lot of companies out there have extruded bases,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.640
but they're not on this level. This thing
is going to be fast right out of the box,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.380
you're not going to need to wax it as much
as a sintered base, or a base that's more

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.540
porous than this.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.290
The edges are the Cruise Control edges. So
they're a little bit more mellow. They're

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.989
not going to catch you up when you're sliding
on the snow back and forth. The Bullet does

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.560
have Slantwall system as well. It's 28 degrees
Slantwalls, durable, and it's strong.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.469
Again this is the Burton Bullet, with the
Cruise Control technology. Flex rating of

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:37.099
a 2, it's going to be soft. If you have big
feet, this is the board for you to get to

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.799
the top.
