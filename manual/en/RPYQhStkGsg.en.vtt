00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.400
Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
I'm checking out our AMR wheels fitting all

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.820
94-04 Mustangs, available in your choice of
either gloss black, silver, or charcoal. The

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.179
modern drift styling of this concave multi spoke
wheel has quickly become a favorite, and it's

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.900
a nice change of pace for the SN95 owner out
there who may be looking to take a break from

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.339
the standard 5 spoke wheel design, traditionally
found with a Cobra or Bullitt style wheel.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.650
These lightweight aluminum AMR wheels are
offered in both an 18 and 19" diameter, and

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.560
in your choice of either 8, 8 Â½, and 9" width.
Of course the different width options leaves

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.480
you with a choice, you can go with the same
width wheel on all 4 corners, giving you the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.170
standard fitment, and allowing you to properly
rotate your tires in the future. Or on the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.920
other hand, you can go with a tried and true
muscle car look, and opt for a staggered fitment,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.130
meaning you have the wider wheels in the rear,
it's totally up to you. To give you a better

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.710
idea of how these wheels might look on your
own ride, we've outfitted some of the cars

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.119
here in the shop with the AMR's, starting
with the 98 GT behind me, which is equipped

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.010
with the 18" version in charcoal. Our 2000
V6 back on the lift is sporting the 18" AMR's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.200
in silver, while finally our 2000 GT on the
Dynojet is rocking the 18" in gloss black.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.600
You can purchase these wheels by themselves
if you'd like, however the smart move would

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.870
be to take advantage of one of our pre built
tire and wheel combinations, here we pair

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.250
your new AMR's up with some of the top tires
on the market today, in sizes that are guaranteed

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.310
to fit your Mustang without rubbing, even
if you're lowered an inch or two. On top of

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.390
that we then mount, balance, and then ship
them to your door, absolutely free. Finally,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.810
all our AmericanMuscle wheels are backed by
a lifetime structural warranty, and a 1 year

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.850
warranty on all finishes. Installing any new
set of wheels and tires is something any backyard

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.729
mechanic should be able to tackle with ease.
You'll first want to crack the lugs loose

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.240
and then jack the car up. Once the car is
in the air, simply swap out all 4 wheels and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.630
tires and that's it. Getting all this done
shouldn't take you any more than an hour.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.200
So if your SN95 needs some new shoes and you're
ready to introduce a little drift inspired

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.799
styling, then be sure to check out these AMR
wheels available right here at AmericanMuscle.com
