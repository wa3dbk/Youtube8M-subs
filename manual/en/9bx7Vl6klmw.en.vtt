00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.616
- I hate brain tricks.

00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:03.079
God (bleep) it.

00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:04.045
What is this?

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:04.934
Witchery?

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:06.395
- Just one more, just one more.

00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:13.998
This alliteration might fool some people.

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:17.651
Ask someone, "What is the
word spelled S-H-O-P?"

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:20.550
What is the word spelled S-H-O-P?

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.250
- Shop.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.694
- Shop.

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:23.202
- Then ask them, "What do you do

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:25.148
"when you come to a green light?"

00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:25.703
- Shop.

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:27.617
- What do you do when you
come to a green light?

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:28.613
- Stop.

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:30.799
- Green light.

00:00:31.768 --> 00:00:32.802
Get it?

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:35.463
(laughs)

00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:36.648
'Cause a green light.

00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:38.084
You don't stop at a green light.

00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:39.769
- No!

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:40.861
- Stop.

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:44.335
Oh, (bleep).

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.776
- Oh, I'm so dumb!

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:49.129
- Their answer will most likely be wrong,

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.658
because they've been primed
to think of the wrong word.

00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:54.943
Priming manipulates
people to think and act

00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:56.724
as they were suggested.

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.219
Here's a mind/body test.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.187
Ask your friends to catch
a dollar from the midpoint.

00:01:04.187 --> 00:01:06.673
Have to try to catch this
dollar from the midpoint.

00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:08.395
So put your hand like right here.

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:09.573
- Okay.

00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:13.807
- Do you think you can catch
this dollar from the midpoint?

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.424
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:18.244
You can't!

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.912
- I can do it.
- Okay, okay, okay.

00:01:21.103 --> 00:01:22.008
- Okay.

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:23.686
Can anyone do it, or is it just me?

00:01:23.686 --> 00:01:24.609
- No, no, no.

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.379
It's a sure bet their reaction
time will be too slow,

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.703
because by the time
the brain processes it,

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:31.815
the dollar would've
already dropped too far.

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:35.196
Try this one.

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:36.523
Give yourself a thumbs up.

00:01:36.523 --> 00:01:37.862
Now, point at it.

00:01:37.862 --> 00:01:39.335
Now, switch.

00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:41.411
Now, switch.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.909
- Wait, what the...

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.381
Oh my God!

00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:53.543
- Ugh.

00:01:53.543 --> 00:01:54.766
No, I can't do it.

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:57.067
- Don't get discouraged
if you can't do it.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:59.594
It's really hard. (chuckles)

00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:02.093
Nope.

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:03.541
You can do it.

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:04.260
I can do it.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.666
We all can do it.

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:07.547
One, two, three.

00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:08.570
Oh!
