00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.460
So we're here on the Salmon River. This is
a rotary screw trap. This is one of four that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.300
we're running this year.
This year we're doing the Salmon River, Still

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Creek, Clear Fork of the Sandy, and the Lost
Creek. Since 1992 we've done Still Creek

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.170
every year so this is one that we keep in
place always every year and the others rotate around.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.600
These are outgoing smolts so they're on their

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.600
way. They're juvenile 1, 2, or 3 year old
fish on their way out to the ocean.

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.369
This is volutionarily spinning them into this
live well where we catch them and they stay

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.039
in here.
We check the trap every single morning and

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.500
if we know that there's going to be a lot
of fish we'll come and check later in the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.240
afternoon just to
make sure it's not too full. We also, in conjunction

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.240
with ODFW in the Fall, do spawning surveys
with the adult fish that are coming in.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.240
And so by using both of them we can get really
good population estimates on our streams here

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.930
on Mt. Hood.
We're trying to catch as many coho and steelhead

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.930
as possible. We mark 25 of each of the target
species and then we take them upstream. We

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.560
mark them with a special
paint that stays on between one and two weeks;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.610
we mark 25 each of the taget species, we'll
take them upstream a quarter mile and then

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.310
we try to recapture them in this
smolt trap. And then by determining our efficiency

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.910
of how well we're catching the fish in the
smolt trap, we can then extrapolate an overall

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.880
population estimate for both
steelhead and coho. Okay, we have a coho smolt,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:03:03.880
110 mm, 16.7 grams, give him a bath, check
the mark. The mark is good. Right back into

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.010
the cold, fresh water. The mark is good.

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.030
The historic populations in these streamswere much larger than they are now.Of course humans, and dams, and all, a few other things,

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.030
water quality has hurt these populations overall.
So, first off, we'd like to see the populations

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.930
get back to historic numbers. We're definitely
out here trying to help the populations. And

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.840
the overall goal
would be to have people be able to fish for

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.579
these fish and take them home. But we're also
here just to revive these populations and

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.540
to keep them going.
Any species we don't want to become endangered and go away. 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.859
Everybody remembers when they were kids, especially
people who live here, that there was a bunch

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.169
of fish spawning at their house, and we work
really hard at it.

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:04.139
I would like to just say, we are seeing results,
and just in the few years that Josh has been

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:11.169
here he's already seeing an increase in populations.
So, it's backing up

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:17.660
our initiative to do this habitat restoration.
To me it matters because we're making a difference.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.199
What we're doing matters: we're rehabilitating
thee streams and bringing the populations

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.360
back up
so people do have the chance to catch fish

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.270
and there are fish for the future.
I grew up in Michigan and I fished a little

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.370
bit on the lakes around my house. Then I moved
to Montana and one day I was driving up along

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.340
the stream, and it was a beautiful sunny day,
and I saw this guy standing in the middle

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.270
of the river fly fishing. And it was gorgeous!
I mean, it was straight from, "A River Runs

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.180
Through It." You know, he had his dog with
him. And so I was

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.960
like, "I want to learn how to fly fish." So
I started to learn how to fly fish and I really

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.820
got into fish, and I really, really loved
it. A I heard that populations, you know,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.500
that it's harder
to catch fish than it used to be. You know

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.939
all those fish stories and big stringers of
fish so I really got into wanting to help

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.289
the populations out.
It's hard sometimes to see what we're doing

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.680
and how it's helping, but you can see it in
the numbers. So why we're doing these outgoing

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.069
smolt studies and monitoring, is because if
you're not monitoring

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.060
than you won't really know what's happening.
And then some day you'll ask, "What happened

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.759
to that fish?" And if we didn't pay attention
to it, we'd never know.
