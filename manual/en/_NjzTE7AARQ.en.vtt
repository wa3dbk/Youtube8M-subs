00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.799
Hello and welcome to the BotherMe&amp;U Reminder Messenger video tutorials.

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.900
In today's tutorial, I'm going to show you how to register your device

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.450
so that you can unlock the full
potential of BotherMe&amp;U, including

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.340
the E2E encrypted messenger,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.280
Timed Delete, and the brand new SelfieCheckr function.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.580
Unlike most messenger apps, BotherMe&amp;U can
function without a SIM-card,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.080
allowing you to sync a tablet or another
non-SIM device

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.739
with your mobile phone number, or simply
generate your own number.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's find out how.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.000
There are multiple opportunities to register your phone number.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You're prompted upon the first install of
the app, 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.960
or when trying to send your first message,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.309
but it can also be accessed via the
settings menu in the top right-hand corner.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.040
Go back to the settings menu, scroll down
and select

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.170
'Enter your phone number'.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.890
Here, you have the choice to enter your
real phone number (in which case you must

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.790
first select the country dialing code)

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.940
or, alternatively, you can enter a
self-generated,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.000
555 number. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.430
You can choose any number you like, as long as it hasn't already been taken.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.620
You can set a password for the 555
number you create,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.620
so that you can use it with your other
devices, and sync your notes.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.049
You can now chat with other users by
selecting the chat icon in the top right hand corner.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.860
Thank you for watching, and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.000
