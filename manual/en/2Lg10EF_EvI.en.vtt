00:00:02.016 --> 00:00:05.067
What we're gonna do is to look at the difference between

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:10.034
cooking with the regular old-fashioned range

00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:12.012
and an induction cooktop.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:13.083
So what we're gonna do today

00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:15.068
is focus on what happens when you cook it on

00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:17.085
a regular conventional range.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.018
What we've got is a GE (if you want to show that, Honey)

00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:25.095
We've got a GE range that's maybe three years old.

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.094
And it has this glass cooktop,

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:34.036
which we're told is about as efficient as the old-fashioned kind

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:36.036
with the radiant elements.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:41.070
So I'm just going to pull our Lodge cast iron skillet

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.037
out of the cabinet,

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:46.063
put it on this main eye that we use,

00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:48.088
and I'm going to set it

00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:55.080
on a range from zero to (I guess) an imputed 10

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.030
because it's like 2-4-6-8-high,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.011
I'm going to set it on 8.

00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.005
And you can see here what's happening here is

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:06.090
as the element heats up it's going to heat up that skillet.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.006
But it heats it up very slowly.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.036
Now I'm going to get some olive oil,

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:14.024
which we use when we're cooking our eggs.

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:17.066
What we're cooking is a frled egg for Amanda

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.007
and a scrambled egg for me,

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:23.016
with a little bit of veggies and some cheese in it.

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:27.000
We'll get that ready for Amanda's egg.

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:27.071
[Cabinet door closes]

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:31.037
Oh, and I didn't notice when I turned it on;

00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:36.009
it's probably been on now for maybe 15-20 seconds

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.009
(Note: actually about 45 seconds)

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.085
Okay, I'm gonna note the time here:

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:47.027
7:47 is when I turned it on.

00:01:48.064 --> 00:01:51.056
Doesn't look like it's quite ready for the egg;

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:54.072
what I'm looking for to know when it's time to

00:01:54.072 --> 00:02:03.012
put the egg on is for the oil to sort of spread out on its own.

00:02:03.012 --> 00:02:05.020
The induction cooktop

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.046
doesn't use a lot less electricity than the radiant element;

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:15.071
it's just that it uses it for a much shorter time.

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:19.013
And this is probably the best illustration of it.

00:02:19.013 --> 00:02:24.006
If I were using the induction cooktop,

00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:27.048
my egg would be well along its way by now.

00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:29.098
And I'm going to put this in here and I bet it's gonna be a little cool.

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:33.027
Yeah, it's a little cool for the egg right now.

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:34.082
As you can see it's being . . .

00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:42.024
that's a little cooler than I would want to put an egg in,

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:46.058
but I'm sort of out of the habit of using the radiant eye,

00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:53.010
so I forget how to judge that.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.074
And Amanda likes a little pepper on hers, so

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:01.035
actually she likes a LOT of pepper on hers

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:02.038
[Amanda chuckles]

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.007
And now I'm gonna wait for a second because it's

00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:09.045
got some cooking to do before we're ready to turn it.

00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:11.036
I put the egg in too soon.

00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:14.052
Should have waited even longer to put it in.

00:03:20.088 --> 00:03:23.020
If I'm a real man I'll figure out how to do one of those

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.084
"time passes" things

00:03:24.084 --> 00:03:27.051
(Note: I'm no real man . . .)

00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:34.041
Okay it's 7:48 now, I guess, so it's been in there for . . .

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:36.080
Well we'll figure that out.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.082
We'll probably flash it on the screen

00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:40.090
how long it's been in at this point.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.009
Note: call it 2 minutes 50 seconds so far . . .

00:03:47.052 --> 00:03:50.062
Whatever you do then, Honey, don't let it stop.

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:54.055
Just let it keep rolling.

00:03:54.055 --> 00:03:57.095
I'll let it cook a little bit longer before I try to turn it,

00:03:57.095 --> 00:04:01.058
because I want to see that middle area there harden up.

00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:05.042
You're probably a little close for focus.

00:04:05.052 --> 00:04:07.083
(Note: She was fine . . .)

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:13.024
[Spatula scraping on pan]

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.092
Probably turned it sooner than I should have.

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:23.026
[Amanda: looks good.]

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:26.077
Looks good? Okay.

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:35.094
And of course it's heating up as all of this is happening, so

00:04:35.094 --> 00:04:39.052
my egg, my scrambled egg's gonna cook a lot faster

00:04:39.052 --> 00:04:43.014
than Amanda's is.

00:04:44.078 --> 00:04:48.020
Since we're using this anyway, I'm going to go ahead and set

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.080
the warming zone (which we don't have with the induction cooktop).

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.087
You need to back up 'cause it won't, yeah,

00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:59.071
What I just did is to set the warming zone,

00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:02.021
which is this little thing right here,

00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:04.058
which will keep Amanda's egg warm while I cook mine.

00:05:04.058 --> 00:05:11.026
That's one of those conveniences we're about to give up.

00:05:11.026 --> 00:05:12.062
Okay.

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.082
Now Amanda's egg is done,

00:05:17.098 --> 00:05:21.003
and here's mine already mixed up.

00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:22.070
[sound of sizzling oil in pan]

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.060
That's more like the temperature you'd want to have.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.097
You can hear it bubbling and sizzling.

00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:36.018
Note: 4 minutes 46 seconds so far . . .

00:05:36.018 --> 00:05:38.091
This one's gonna cook nice and fast.

00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:43.054
It's had time to warm up now.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.026
Now it won't be long before I'll be able to turn this off.

00:05:52.026 --> 00:05:58.060
So we'll figure that out.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.077
Probably after I flip it one time, we'll be able to

00:06:00.077 --> 00:06:06.019
turn the radiant element off,

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:13.015
knowing that the rest of it will cook by itself okay.

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:20.027
Yeah, I think I feel safe now to go ahead and turn it back off.

00:06:20.027 --> 00:06:23.007
Note: Power off at 6 minutes 16 seconds.

00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:25.012
So whatever time I just turned it off, that's the

00:06:25.012 --> 00:06:34.072
time elapsed for that radiant element.

00:06:34.072 --> 00:06:43.023
Then we'll just let that sit in the pan and finish cooking.

00:06:43.023 --> 00:06:45.007
And then the next time we do this we'll

00:06:45.007 --> 00:06:48.062
use the induction cooktop.
