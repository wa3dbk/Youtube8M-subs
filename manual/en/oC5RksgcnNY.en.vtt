00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.990
HEY NOW!

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.580
WELCOME TO PREVIEW REVIEW THIS WEEK.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.650
WELL LAMAR ODOM WAS TRADED FROM THE LA LAKERS
TO THE DALLAS MAVERICKS THIS WEEK.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.539
I WONDER IF HE’LL BE TAKING HIS CADDLE WITH
HIM TEXAS

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.730
(**KHLOE KARDASHIAN***)
TOO MEAN?

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.380
ALRIGHTY THIS WEEK WE’RE SOLVING THE CASE
WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES BUT FIRST THE RODENTS

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.890
ARE BACK IN “ALVIN AND CHIPMUNKS: CHIPWRECKED.”

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:55.840
(***CHIPWRECKED TRAILER***)
Playing around while aboard a cruise ship,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.800
the Chipmunks and Chipettes accidentally go
overboard and end up marooned in a tropical

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.800
paradise.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.910
They discover their new turf is not as deserted
as it seems.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.070
(***ON CAM***)
APPARENTLY THESE THINGS HAVE MADE A TON OF

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.620
CASH, SO WHY NOT MAKE A THIRD ONE.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:15.360
I HAVEN’T SEEN ANY OF THESE BUT DAMN IT,
IT’S THE CHIPMUNKS SO IT HAS TO BE CUTE

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.189
AND FUNNY.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.810
AND OF COURSE WE KNOW THIS GUY NEEDS TO MONEY…MEMPHIS
DIDN’T WORKOUT TOO WELL FOR YAH HUH?

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.140
I THINK THERE’S A KEY FORMULA THOUGH TO
MOVIES LIKE THIS BEING SUCCESSFUL, BUT WHAT

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.140
COULD IT BE?

00:01:29.140 --> 00:02:18.030
(***MONTAGE OF SPEED UP MOVIE QUOTES***)
HMMM…THAT MIGHT JUST 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.140
BE IT.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.480
ALRIGHTY NEXT UP ROBERT DOWNEY JR.’S DROPPING
THE IRONMAN COSUME FOR A BRITISH ACCENT IN

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.160
“SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS.”

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:52.740
(***SHERLOCK TRAILER***)
Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. Watson

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.940
join forces to outwit and bring down their
fiercest adversary, Professor Moriarty.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.230
(***ON CAM***)
THIS IS A SEQUAL TO THE FIRST SHERLOCK FILM

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.870
THAT CAME OUT A FEW YEARS AGO, THAT ONE WAS
PRETTY DECENT SO I’LL MOST LIKELY BE GOING

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.980
TO CHECK THIS OUT.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.580
JUDE LAW’S BACK AS HIS ASSISTANT WATSON,
RACHEL MCADAMS IS BACK, AND GUY RITCHIE’S

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.840
DIRECTING SO HOPEFULLY IT’LL BE ON PAR WITH
THE LAST ONE.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.440
THOUGH I’M CONFUSED…IS DOWNEY JR.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.780
A BILLIONAIRE PLAYBOY SUPER HERO, OR IS A
BRITISH PLAYBOY INTELLECTURAL SUPER HERO?

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.700
I SAY HE JUST COMBINES THEM AND GIVE TONY
STARK A BRITISH ACCENT.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:43.570
(**CLIP OF TONY STARK WITH BRITISH ACCENT***)
AHHH…MAYBE NOT SO MUCH.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:04:26.220
ALRIGHTY THAT’S GOING TO DO 
IT 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:38.280
FOR PREVIEW REVIEW…..
