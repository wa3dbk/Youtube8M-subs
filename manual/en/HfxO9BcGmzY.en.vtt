00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.740
Hi I’m Jodi and today I’m going to dye my hair with Madison Reed color 3NVV

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.750
I'm excited. This one's non-toxic. And I'm gonna start out 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.930
 very simple just sectioning my hair into four quadrants

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.910
to make it easy to dye and get to my roots.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.760
Just twist them into little nubs.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.450
Don't worry if they break out. You just need the

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.700
four sections of hair evenly sectioned off

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.219
Throw the clip on there. Okay, once you get your hair

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.969
sectioned off into four easy quadrants you
need to put a light coating of barrier cream

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.140
just around your hairline all the way down onto your ears

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.080
a little bit behind your ears and around your neck

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.229
just to make sure that you don’t dye your skin

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.559
and just be very careful not get it on
your hair or

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.050
it'll impede the dying process. Then just rinse your hands off quickly

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.829
before you put the gloves on. Here’s our little gloves to keep our hands clean.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.159
Viola!

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.620
The next step is to take the activator and the color and mix them together.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.320
 You can take the cap off and leaving the little tip in place

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.760
take the top off and puncture the top with the little top.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.320
Then when you're putting the color into the activator 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.520
just make sure that you push evenly all the way down the tube.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.480
 I like to
squeeze it to make sure I get it all in there.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.800
Great. And once you get it all in

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.500
put the top back on, make sure it's securely tight 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.911
and just shake it for about 20 seconds.
Make sure it’s thoroughly mixed.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.880
When it starts to shift color a little bit 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.999
and turn a little bit purple it should be done.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.600
You can take the little tip off, then we can start dying.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.280
So I start with the back quadrant

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.980
because I have to make sure I get a
thorough root coverage

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.200
I have to be very very careful when I
dye my hair because as a 46-year-old Asian

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.670
we look good, but we still get gray hair.
I have to make sure there are no gray hairs

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.000
sticking off of this head

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.640
It's very important. So I start with the roots,
 and I just do a back and forth motion 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.760
working in with my fingertips. All you
have to do is just like when you're in your shower

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.200
make sure that all the hairs are wet
through the gloves

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.260
and then you know you have full coverage.
And it has to sit on my roots for 20 minutes

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.780
before I go into the tips. 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.120
Very very easy and so worthwhile.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.400
Now, I go to the next quadrant. Same thing.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.230
This is my little method I go back and
forth

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.150
I section with the tip of the bottle and I keep going, working it in with my fingertips, 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.520
because we know the grays on the top of the head are the most horrific.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.820
So here I go

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.710
working it in, working it in.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.969
beautiful 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.540
Also, for all my fellow forty-year-olds, I love
the smell.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.430
Cause my old kit made me want to pass out and this one smells like flowers.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.020
Big improvement. So again, same with the bangs,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.020
just working in all the tips. 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.480
Alright, perfect.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.509
Okay, now the back quadrant.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.159
Same thing. Making sure everything feels wet through the gloves.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.569
Massage with the fingers. Get it all the way down to the scalp.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.620
Okay, fourth and final quadrant.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.380
Getting rid of all the evil grays.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.420
Once again, row by row sectioning with the tip of the bottle.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.400
Again I've kept track of how much dye I have left for the rest of my hair 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.840
but for me since I have black hair 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.500
and evil gray/whites [laugh] I like to put the
majority on my roots. 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.780
Oops! I got a little bit on my head. It's fine, you just wipe it off 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.099
with your glove, and at the end when you work through your tips

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.321
there's a little cleansing wipe in the kit that
you can wipe off you entire head

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.120
so that you don't dye your skin. 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.680
So now I have it all on my roots and I'm just massaging through 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.590
for thorough coverage and also checking
for any dry spots

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.250
for my evil evil white/grays, and make sure everybody’s covered in there. 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.840
I look like a Robert Palmer girl.  I'm dating myself 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.400
but I think it all done now 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.620
Alright, I’m going to let that sit for 20 minutes now and then I'm going to come back and finish my tips.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.520
Hi guys, I'm back! 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.080
Alright, so I just loosened up the dye again

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.900
cuz we're just gonna do tips now. I just section my hair in two.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.050
I take a little strip, hold it against my hand,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.660
start with the tips to weigh it down

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.680
and then work my way up massaging it in.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.760
I'm excited, it's gonna be beautiful.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.620
Just make sure that all your hair is wet to
the touch

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.200
so that you get full coverage 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.540
and comb through with your fingers.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.900
There we go.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.000
and then we just twist

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.920
and put it on top of your head

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.040
and if you want, if it won't stay in place - if your hair’s thick like mine - anchor it with a clip.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.480
 Okay, a couple more sections.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.800
Again, start with a tips, work your way up. 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.800
Massage, massage.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.240
Stick on the top, there we go.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.640
Okay so now I've applied all the dye

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.570
and I just want to do a quick check 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.360
with my fingertips to make sure that I've circulated the dye everywhere on my head for even coverage

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.760
or the color's not going to take.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.320
And to make double sure I’m going to take a wide tooth comb

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.110
and work it through my entire head.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.800
There we go. Beautiful!

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.260
And I've taken the little wipe that's enclosed in the kit and I'm just going to check my hairline,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.610
my ears, my neck, my arms, and make sure that there’s no dye on my skin.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.040
Perfect. Spot free!

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.140
Anyway, so now I'm going to go enjoy myself for 15 minutes maybe have a cocktail 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.960
and oh, last thing I wanted to tell you I used to sacrifice one of my beautiful t shirts to dye my hair 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.740
but now I can buy these gorgeous professional smocks.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.000
Very vogue. I'll see you in 15 minutes!

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.460
Hi guys, I am back and I love my hair 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.580
It's so soft and silky, but more importantly

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.200
I have never had so much depth and dimension from a kit

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.400
ever before and what blows me away is the coverage is so natural.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.539
I feel like I look twenty again who doesn't want that in their forties? 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.800
I have to go out and party now! Anyways, I hope you try Madison Reed 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.960
and I hope you love it as much as I do.
