Hello Everyone,

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.100
A couple of years ago, I had designed a sequencing
valve to fill 6 different grow beds in my

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.620
aquaponic system. It has been running continuously
for 2 years without clogging with solids or

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.410
needing maintenance. The micro-switch used
for the indexing positions has finally worn

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.410
out.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.910
I was going to patent the design, but it’s
too expensive with too little return so I’m

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.360
now sharing the design. Also, a good commercial
sequencing valve that has a completely different

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.460
style of indexing is available which works
well. While I have it dismantled, I will replace

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.260
the latex tubing since it is starting to rot.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.260
The indexing mechanism uses a windshield wiper
motor running on 5 volts and has a 6 sided

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.829
cam that a micro-switch travels around. Power
is applied to the normally closed pole which

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.829
will turn on the motor through the common
pole. When the cam moves to a high position

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.649
the switch opens and turns off the motor.
When it’s time to move to the next position,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.829
power is applied to the normally open pole,
turning on the motor again until the switch

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.950
travels to the next area of the cam.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.750
There is also a secondary cam that has one
indent at the first position. This is to allow

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.250
the controller to reset the valve to position
one in the event of a power failure.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.470
Removing the cover exposes the internal workings.
There are 6 latex tubes that are located around

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.670
a cam with a small ramp cut into it. As the
cam rotates, the ramp area will push against

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.350
the slider which will pinch and hold the tubing
closed. As the cam continues, the next positions

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.659
slider will spring open. One nice feature
about using a pinch valve is that there are

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.030
no seals needed. The mechanics never touch
the water!

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.049
The water is fed into the valves through a
ring with 6 tee connectors. The latex tubing

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.421
is attached to each of the tee’s and a zip
tie is attached to insure it won’t slide

00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:53.421
off the barbed fitting.

00:01:53.421 --> 00:02:05.220
The 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:20.629
6 latex tubes are inserted through the base
cover. They are then inserted through the

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:21.639
center ring section.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:40.099
The master cam is placed onto the rotating
shaft. There is a wing-nut connected to the

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:47.980
shaft and the wings are used to anchor the
cam to the shaft.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.419
Latex tubing is very flexible and pinches
closed easily. The sliders that pinch the

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:57.579
tubing closed have a peak on it. The anvil
on the other side has a valley cut into it.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.129
When this area pinches the tubing, it also
folds it a bit which creates a tighter seal.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.999
The anvil rests on a screw so it can move
around a bit so the slider and anvil will

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:14.419
always align while it is being pinched.

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.980
The final cover is placed over the mechanism
and the tubing pulled through. There are 6

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:31.839
bolts that pass through the entire assembly
which hold it together.

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:39.290
Here is the entire sequencing valve installed
in the greenhouse. I hope you enjoyed this
