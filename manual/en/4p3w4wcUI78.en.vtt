00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.280
We've done a bunch of research here at the
University of Rochester in the past looking

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.030
at how men perceive women in red.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.240
And we found that men perceive women in red
as particularly attractive and the reason

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.970
why they find them attractive is because they
perceive them as sexually available or sexually

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.180
interested.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.500
So we wanted to take this line of research
a step further and see how women perceive

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.800
other women in red.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.029
So in our experiments we showed women photographs
of other women and we had manipulated the

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.160
clothing color of the women in those photographs
to where the pictures were identical.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.380
The only thing that was different was the
color and we asked women various questions

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.380
about them.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.130
So, how interested in sex does this person
seem?

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.560
How flirtatious is she?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.390
How seductive is she?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.830
And we find that the exact same person, when
wearing red, relative to white or green, is

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.350
perceived as much more sexually interested
and available.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.430
We also found that women were likely to insult
these other women when wearing red, specifically

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.710
on topics regarding their sexual fidelities.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.500
There likely to say, for example, this woman
probably can't stay loyal to just one man

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.500
at a time.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.850
She probably cheats on men and then very interestingly
we recruited women who were in committed romantic

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.030
relationships and we asked them how likely
they'd be to introduce their partner to a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.500
women in red versus green.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.750
How likely to let their partner spend time
alone with her and we find that women are

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.350
much less likely to have their man anywhere
near a women in red, essentially.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.690
The big picture take away is that color is
much more than meets the eye and this is something

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.880
that we take for granted all the time so we
go through life thinking that color is just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.080
here for our visual pleasure but really color
can convey information to people that regardless

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.189
of our intentions, whether or not we want
it to, people can pick up on color as a cue

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.950
to certain things and that may effect on how
people view us.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.090
It may affect how people treat us and this
kind of information is really handy to have

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.560
when navigating the social world.
