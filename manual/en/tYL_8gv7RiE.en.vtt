Hi. This is Mr. Andersen and
the second Life on Earth podcast on classification.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.509
When we're talking about classification we
have to talk about this guy, Carolis Linnaeus

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.699
or we'll just call him Carl. Carl was a Swedish
botanist. And basically what he liked to do

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.140
is discover new species, name them, classify
them. And so if you're familiar with like

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.990
order and class and species, this all comes
from Linnaeus. We call this our Linnaean classification

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.040
system. And so if we play this through time,
way back in 1735 Linnaeus develops this. Basically

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.660
he would classify life vegetable or animal.
If we play this forward in time we've had

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.860
a number of different taxonomists who come
up with different systems. So we've added

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.870
things like protists, prokaryotes, monerans
and now finally we have a three domain naming

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.870
system today. And this will probably change
in the future. But we have another Carl. Carl

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.890
Woese who's come up with this idea of how
to classify life. So we've gone Carl to Carl

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.780
and changed quite a bit. Especially the technology
that we have. But we've also made a huge shift.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.220
Because Carolis Linnaeus didn't believe Darwin
was right. He didn't believe in evolution.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.420
And now we build our whole naming system on
the idea of natural selection and evolution

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.200
over time. And so the goal in classification
today is to have monophyletic naming and monophyletic

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.780
groups. So what does that mean? Well basically
right here we've got a phylogenetic tree.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.600
And so what we want to create is what is called
a monophyletic grouping. So if we look at

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.290
this group right here, we want this whole
group here, all the individuals inside here

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.470
to share this common ancestor and to not leave
anything out. In other words we want to make

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.979
sure that we're putting, you know, if birds
were to be classified as mammals, that would

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.010
screw everything up. So we want it to be in
one big group. And we want our naming system

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.860
to kind of reflect that. And so as we go from
this huge tree of life. So if we go from this

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.860
first tree of life where we branch it off
to bacteria and archaea and eukarya, we want

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.260
this naming system to keep going along with
this phylogenetic tree of life. And so ironically

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.950
the Linnaean system is used to basically classify
life according to the work of Darwin. And

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.939
so the problem with that is this. If you look
at these two plants. This plant here and this

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.709
plant here, Linnaeus would have picked both
of those up and said, let's classify those

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.319
in the same group because the look a lot alike.
But the reason they look a lot alike is they've

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.439
convergently evolved. In other words they
look the same because they fill the same niche.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.639
Or they fill the same role. If we were to
look at this pill bug and this pill millipede

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.889
you would say they're classified the same.
Let's put them in the same group. However,

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.209
they're not related at all. They just look
the way they do because of the environmental

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.499
pressures that make them look that way. And
so that's why Linnaeus had a problem. That's

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:01.749
why scientists for a long period of time have
had this problem of grouping individuals according

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:08.599
to the way they look. But the rescuer in this
whole thing is DNA and genetic material. In

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.499
other words we can look at the the DNA of
individuals now. Or in this case we're looking

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:20.499
at, this is two dimensional protein electrophoresis.
So we're actually separating proteins. And

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.379
so we can look at how similar they are and
we can see oh, we're more related to a chimpanzee

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.419
then a gorilla and an orangutan. And we can
even lay out this phylogenetic tree. Once

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.760
we've done that, then classification kind
of comes right after that. And so basically

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.469
the system of classification is giving each
organism on our planet a specific name. And

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:46.010
that name is based on binomial nomenclature.
So all living things get two names. A genus

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.799
and a species. And so you are Homo sapiens.
But a wolf is Canis lupus. So what is this

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.719
organism right here? Well you might know this
as a cougar or a mountain lion or a puma.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:02.209
You might know it by one of the 40 different
names that it has. And I'm not even including

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.859
different languages. And so the problem in
science is coming up with a standard naming

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:12.099
system. So in the literature when we're talking
about a mountain lion, we know exactly what

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.289
we're talking about. And so basically this
is the way we classify life. We classify life

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.139
from life all the way down to species. And
so if you've been in biology for awhile, you

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:29.139
know this. I remember this in my head. Dumb
King Phillip came over from German soil. So

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.970
I can just say that without reading it here,
because I've learned, we'll pretend that this

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.020
is dumb King Phillip came over from German
soil, is just a way for your to memorize all

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.849
the different divisions in the classification
system. And so that is domain, kingdom, phylum,

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.699
class, order, family, genus, species. And
so when we talk about the scientific name

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.530
then we're talking about this last two right
here. And so let's go through the mountain

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.750
lion. So it's alive. So it's classified as
a living thing. It's in the domain eukarya.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.000
That means it has you know a nucleus inside
that. It's an animal. It's a chordate, so

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.990
it's got a spinal cord. It's a mammal. It's
a carnivore. It's a cat. And it's Puma concolor.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.300
And so that's going to be it's scientific
name. So when we write out what is this? All

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.800
scientists are going to write this out as
Puma concolor. And so that is it's scientific

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.900
name. Or we might just abbreviate it as this
in the literature. We also, I can't do this

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.000
in my writing, have to write this in italics
to represent it as that. And so all living

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.340
things on our planet that we've identified
as a species is classified according to this

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.810
system. Now the problem right now is that
the biodiversity on our planet is really depleting

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.229
quickly. And so we have species going extinct
faster than we can actually name them. But,

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.550
what is the naming system? It's based in latin.
And there have been some kind of changes on

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:02.550
that over time. But basically that's our classification
system. Again it reflects evolution. It tries

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.039
to be monophyletic. But again it's a science
that's rapidly changing as technology kind

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.220
of catches up with it. And I hope that's helpful.
