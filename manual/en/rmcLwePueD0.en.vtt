Hi, I'm Felicia Day.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.050
And I guess I'm most well known
for making web videos.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.200
My biggest fear about starting
Geek and Sundry was just the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.920
scope of doing like six
or seven shows.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.700
Your job as a web series creator
is 90% after you make

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.360
that video.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.360
Last year, 2011, I did The Guild
season five and I did

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.590
Dragon Age, and it almost
killed my soul.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.730
It was way too much.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.110
And when I had the opportunity
to pitch a slate, I was like

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.310
what in the world am I going
to be able to do?

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.409
But then I sat down.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.810
I looked at all the people that
I want to work with, all

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.540
the talented people who could
help me do what I do and bring

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.800
their own talent and
supplement the

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.060
things I don't do well.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.820
And I've just been
really fortunate.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.680
Doing web video was completely
coincidental to meeting my

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.780
co-producer, Kim Evey.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.480
She taught me my only
writing class.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.255
So I took this sketch class
because I was so

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:50.470
bored with my life.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.150
And I was so upset and unhappy
and depressed all the time.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.680
And I would journal about
how depressed I was.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.360
And then like a year later we
had lunch, and she said that

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.870
she was having a women's group
that met to motivate their

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.880
careers in Hollywood.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.420
And I was like this sounds
really stupid.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.840
All right.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.890
And I would show up every week
with my to-do list, and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.452
basically it would be like
I played World of

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:10.650
Warcraft this week.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.450
And all the other women were
trying to set up producing

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.850
projects and writing.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.520
And it was kind of a ladies
support group, which most

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.800
people do not know
about The Guild.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.190
That's how The Guild happened.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.760
And then one day one of them
turned to me and was like, you

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.470
really need to stop gaming
because that's the only thing

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.440
on your to-do list every week.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.700
I was like OK.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.860
By January 1, I'm going
to write the script.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.900
And I literally wrote for 12 and
a half hours on the 31st

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.500
of December because I was going
to make that deadline no

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.860
matter what.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.620
And that was basically
90% of The Guild.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.720
My grandfather was a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.250
physicist, a nuclear physicist.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.860
He always had the most
advanced technology.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.870
So he would give it to
my parents when he

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.640
was done with it.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.120
So I remember when I was
like six or seven he

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.770
gave us this laptop.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.120
And this laptop was
as big as--

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.700
I don't know.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.000
It was this big.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.725
It was not a laptop.

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:58.510
It had a screen like this.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.440
And it was green and white.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.190
And I was thrilled.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.150
This is the most advanced
thing I've ever seen.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.320
And my mom was kind of
a gamer, I guess.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.430
She bought all these Infocom
games that were totally text.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.780
And I remember getting on there
and trying to figure

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.030
these games at such a young
age that were way too

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.740
advanced for me.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.460
And that's how I started.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.700
I watched her play, and then
I just got addicted.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.070
But my favorite games, in
discovering all these

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.360
different games in producing
TableTop, has been the kind of

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.460
games where you really are
given a character.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.820
So clearly I don't
dress like this.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.660
I clearly don't comb
my hair every day.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.850
So all these things that make
me, they influence how I act.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.490
And I think they influence
everybody else, even if

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.390
they're not actors.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.430
Gaming is the escapes that will
help you find yourself.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.765
Put that on a t-shirt,
boy-yah.

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:48.450
Boy-yah.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.700
Oh, god.
