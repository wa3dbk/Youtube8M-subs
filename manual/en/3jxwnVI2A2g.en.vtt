00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.382
- [Voiceover] This is master
wurstmacher, Adam Gertler,

00:00:02.382 --> 00:00:05.166
and culinary director,
Michael Brown from Dog Hous.

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.173
Together, they created the
craziest hot dogs possible.

00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:11.036
The hot dogs you'll see
today are not on the menu

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:13.149
and are exclusive to BuzzFeed.

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.467
- These sausages are
experimental in nature.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:18.982
Some of them will and
should never be made again.

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:23.982
("Blast Funk")

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.074
This one is a shrimp and
jumbo lump crab meat sausage.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:32.821
The base is a puree of shrimp

00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:34.914
with a little bit of garlic,

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:37.331
kind of an Old Bay style seasoning,

00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:40.928
some fresh lemon zest, lemon juice,

00:00:40.928 --> 00:00:43.081
large jumbo lump crab meat.

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:44.321
- So I'm gonna show
you what we're gonna do

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:45.397
with Adam's sausages,

00:00:45.397 --> 00:00:47.185
and how we're gonna
present them for you guys.

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:49.258
Take this nice grilled seafood sausage,

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:52.122
purple potatoes, carrots, and corn.

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:54.804
I made an aioli with
Chesapeake Bay seasoning.

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:55.698
And there you have it,

00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:57.181
this is the Wicked Pissa.

00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:58.319
- Is this supposed to be sushi?

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:59.828
- It still smells like sausage.

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:02.312
- Yep.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:03.165
- Holy (bleep).

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.095
- A fancy version of a fish stick.

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:06.741
- Maybe a little too salty for my tastes,

00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.102
but it's still pretty,

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:09.544
I'm just gonna eat more.

00:01:09.544 --> 00:01:12.310
("Blast Funk")

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.333
- A Vietnamese style
pork influenced sausages.

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.949
So it's all pork, cilantro, mint,

00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:22.708
scallions, fish sauce, shallot.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:24.480
We're doing it as more of a banh mi

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.390
and we're calling it our Banh Appetit.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.975
- Just a little bit of hoisin sauce,

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:29.234
pickled vegetable mixture,

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:30.941
green lime mayonnaise.

00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:32.830
And there you have it,
that's Banh Appetit.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.989
- I'm really excited about this.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.411
I love Vietnamese sandwiches.

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.239
- I think that there's
maybe a missed opportunity

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:38.966
to put this on French bread.

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:43.111
- It tastes like a very unhealthy banh mi.

00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:44.167
- This actually tastes like

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:46.566
one of the more healthier
hot dogs I've ever had.

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.435
- It does taste a little
bit like a banh mi.

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:49.837
- This is my least favorite right now,

00:01:49.837 --> 00:01:51.604
but still a 10 out of
10 and would eat again.

00:01:51.604 --> 00:01:54.550
("Blast Funk")

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.651
- Duck, chicken, and turkey,

00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:58.744
and put it inside of a sort of like a

00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:00.491
kielbasa style sausage.

00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:02.504
So there's fresh thyme in there,

00:02:02.504 --> 00:02:04.149
lots of fresh garlic, onions.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.855
And then the sausage was smoked.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:08.354
- We've lightly wilted some pea tendrils

00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:09.471
with the foie gras fat.

00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:11.726
Onions, balsamic, and fig,

00:02:11.726 --> 00:02:13.778
and we've reduced that down to like a jam.

00:02:13.778 --> 00:02:16.013
Generously seasoned the foie gras.

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:18.551
We're gonna top that off.

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:22.334
Brown butter toasted hazelnuts

00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:24.083
give it a little bit of crunch.

00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:25.545
That's the menage a foie.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:28.490
- This is a sexy mother (bleep) hot dog.

00:02:31.043 --> 00:02:32.082
- Oh!

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:35.027
Oh!

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.760
- Yes, 10 out of 10 would eat again.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.081
- It's definitely like more in line

00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:42.153
with what I imagined
like a brat tastes like.

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:43.311
- It's sweet on top.

00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:44.592
It's tangy inside.

00:02:44.592 --> 00:02:46.380
- Everything is so good together.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.020
I don't understand what's happening.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.844
("Blast Funk")

00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:54.445
- I give you the Surf and Turfwurst.

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:57.795
What you have is excellent quality

00:02:57.795 --> 00:02:59.880
Maine lobster tail

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.068
and ribeye steak in a sausage form.

00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:05.451
- I'm gonna put a little bit
of wild arugula in there.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.097
Just gonna ladle a little bearnaise over.

00:03:08.158 --> 00:03:09.800
Crispy fried parsnip chips.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.745
And that is your Surf and Turf.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.256
- This is like something
that Willy Wonka would make.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.104
- This may be the first
one I'm not that into.

00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:16.998
- It's so good.

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:17.811
- This is lobster?

00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:19.152
- This is a luxury dog.

00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:21.163
I should be wearing a tuxedo right now,

00:03:21.163 --> 00:03:22.870
but I forgot it at home.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.222
("Blast Funk")

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:28.660
- Fried chicken is such an
American down home classic.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.834
How could it have possibly
have taken this long

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:33.028
for us to come up with
a fried chicken sausage?

00:03:33.028 --> 00:03:35.385
But that's exactly what
we did for Buzz Feed.

00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:37.214
We basically took the classic

00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:38.839
southern fried chicken flavors.

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:40.728
I'm talking about your
buttermilk marinade,

00:03:40.728 --> 00:03:43.451
your fresh thyme, your garlic,

00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.702
your mustard powder, your
cayenne pepper, salt, pepper.

00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:49.607
We put all that inside the sausage.

00:03:49.607 --> 00:03:52.878
We're using a little bit
of a vodka beer batter.

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:54.605
And then we're gonna fry the chicken

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:56.657
and then serve it with a waffle.

00:03:56.657 --> 00:03:58.695
- [Michael] Sweet maple and buttermilk

00:03:58.695 --> 00:04:00.179
kinda coleslaw dressing.

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:01.276
Pull that string out.

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:02.860
With a little drizzle of honey.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.014
Your fried chicken and waffle sausage.

00:04:05.014 --> 00:04:06.964
- This looks like the most American thing

00:04:06.964 --> 00:04:08.895
that I've ever seen.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.966
- It's like a warm hug.

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:12.084
- This is amazing.

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:14.259
- Always fry sausages,
this is what I've learned.

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.391
- This is the best thing I've eaten today,

00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:18.362
and maybe like will for
the rest of my life.

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:19.724
("Blast Funk")

00:04:19.724 --> 00:04:20.496
- I was thinking oh my God,

00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:22.183
I can't believe I'm
making dessert sausage.

00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:23.463
That's so disgusting.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:24.885
Why would anyone do that?

00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:26.023
And I started drinking,

00:04:26.023 --> 00:04:27.120
and then I thought,

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.005
you know what, why don't I
just put that in the sausage.

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:31.833
So we have kind of an Irish car bomb

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:33.276
influence in the sausage.

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:37.481
Cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, maple syrup.

00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:38.532
And then we finished it off

00:04:38.532 --> 00:04:41.031
with dark chocolate and marshmallow.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.449
- Ooey gooey, fun in this thing here.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.456
Brown butter pecan sauce.

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.521
Beautiful caramelized bananas.

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:49.104
The Wurst Dessert.

00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:50.614
- Time for dessert.

00:04:50.614 --> 00:04:51.569
- OK, this isn't...

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.504
- What?

00:04:52.504 --> 00:04:53.194
- What?

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:54.109
- There's meat in this?

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:55.470
- It does kinda taste like s'mores,

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.014
as weird as that sounds.

00:04:57.014 --> 00:04:59.493
- I'm gonna be telling my
grandchildren about this (bleep).

00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:02.012
- You can hot dog dessert.

00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:03.069
Proof.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.069
("Blast Funk")
