00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.560
Hoi
Today I’ll be doing a Louise O’Neill themed

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.330
double review video, in which I’ll be talking
about Only Ever Yours and Asking For It.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.080
Just so you know in this video I’ll be discussing
things like sexual assault, anorexia and eating

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.779
disorders, because those are the topics that
these books sort of center around.

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.919
This one has been out for about a year, this
one isn’t out until September. So we’re

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.009
going to start with Only Ever Yours. I found
out about Only Ever Yours through the Bookseller

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.909
YA prize, which it won. Some of my
friends had read it and highly recommended

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.810
it so I figured I would give it a go.
This is actually Rosianna’s old copy which

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.230
I will send over to the U.S. to her once I
film this review. So this book is about a

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.399
group of sixteen year old girls in a dystopian
world where women are basically created for

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.399
the very specific purpose of satisfying men.
And they have to live in the same building

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.850
their whole lives, which is sort of a school.
And there are these women called chastities

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.280
who look after them which in my head I sort
of imagined them as nuns.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.320
And all the characters in this book have the
names of famous supermodels cause that’s

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.410
who they are modeled after. The main character
is a girl called Freida and her best friend

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.020
is called Isabel. And they’ve been friends
for forever but when the book sort of begins

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.130
their friendship slowly starts to unwind.
And in this book you sort of follow all the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.130
girls going to their daily classes and going
through their daily lives just waiting for

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.270
the moment that they‘ll be selected as companions
although they can also become a concubine

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.610
or a chastity, but the ultimate goal is to
be a companion.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.350
They have to be on this sort of very specific
target weight so the only thing they worry

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.750
about is how thin they are and how pretty
they look. They are ranked on a sort of daily

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.640
or weekly basis they have to sort of take
a picture every morning and send it in and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.290
then people will rank it depending on how
pretty they look. And that rank is everything

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.840
to them and they’re also encouraged to constantly
criticize each other and call out the things

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.000
that they don’t like about the person’s
appearance. Reading this was really confronting

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.700
from the first page.
In between there are these pages with these

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.630
giant quotes from the rules for proper female
behavior by the original father. In the beginning

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.689
the man created the new women, the Eves. You
think it’s really horrid when you start

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.939
off and as you keep reading it, it just gets
worse and worse and worse. And then the boys

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.610
arrive to pick their companions and it just
completely flips out of control. Only ever

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.580
yours reminded me of Pretties by Scott Westerfeld.
Don’t know if you guys remember, it was

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.860
like one of those like first dystopian books
I ever read and a lot of the mindset that

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.800
the girls and in pretties the boys get taught
is fairly similar although not as extreme.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.120
So the setup of the sort of world where everyone
is waiting for a certain point where everything

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.709
will be perfect. What’s probably one of
the most disturbing things about this book

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.739
is while you’re reading it it’s a dystopian
setting and you think this is so far away

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.489
and ridiculous but all the little things in
there are things that are happening every

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.150
single day and that are already in our society.
It’s like beauty and lifestyle magazines

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.650
on steroids. The bullying that happens on
social media, the little cliques in high school,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.420
the way that girls are sometimes encouraged
to look down on other girls for however they

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.230
choose to behave. All they want to do is just
get out of the school and start their real

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.360
life. And so because of that there is such
a toxic environment and as a reader you don’t

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.330
really have a good idea of what goes on outside
of that world. So all these girls are named

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.140
after models and look like models and I wasn’t
quite convinced by that I think it would have

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.610
been fine with them just having normal names.
In the beginning it bothered me a little bit

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.340
but as the book went on there were more serious
things to worry about, so I didn’t really

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.980
focus in on that too much. I did find it quite
interesting that all their names start with

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.810
lower case letters, if to just indicate that
they’re all sort of the same and that they

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.330
don’t have a lot of value. There is this
really interesting thing that happens when

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.580
the boys get brought in and that is that they
get to play 70 minutes in heaven.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.519
So the boys get to select a girl and like
one boy gets to spend 70 minutes in a cupboard

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.420
with a girl. And the whole thing is that if
you’re a companion you don’t want to have

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.680
sex with them beforehand cause that’s not
what companions do, but it is what concubines

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.930
do. And so again there is this whole thing
that happens everywhere all around you where

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.629
it’s the girl trying to figure out how her
decision on what she wants to do sexually

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.400
will influence her reputation and her future.
I thought the ending was perfect, I don’t

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.099
want to give anything away about it but you
know it’s my kind of ending. I could definitely

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.739
recommend this book to everyone but have a
think about sort of the topic before you start

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.379
reading it and make sure that you’re comfortable
with reading about it cause this book is pretty

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.900
intense.
So next I have Asking For It, it is out in

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.690
September and it is set in a small Irish town.
The main character is called Emma O'Donovan,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.110
one night she goes to a party, she gets drunk,
she takes some drugs, and the next morning

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.510
she wakes up on her front porch and she doesn’t
remember what’s happened to her. And then

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.160
she discovers a Facebook page that is filled
with pictures that document what happened

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.390
the night before and basically she was raped
and sort of sexually assaulted in a variety

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.160
of ways and these pictures are just all over
the place.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.690
She’s piecing together the story of what
happened though these pictures and this book

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.440
is sort of about what happens to her and everyone
around her after this event. So you might

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.550
be familiar with the Steubenville case in
the U.S. where something very very similar

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.860
happened. This book is a really really quick
read but obviously it’s a very difficult

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.350
topic to read about. It deals with consent
and with victim blaming. I think it’s very

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.510
interesting that Emma is not a very likeable
character.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.350
It also very much goes into the thing that
people think that rape is something that happens

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.030
in a dark alley when you’re being attacked
by a stranger. And it also discusses sort

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.120
of how people’s opinion changes if for example
if the victim was under the influence of drugs

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.900
or alcohol or if they had sex the same night
with someone else, or if they don’t respond

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.000
afterwards in the way that people expect them
to respond. I felt like this was such an eye

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.680
opening but really painful read and I think
this just should be mandatory reading in high

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.900
schools. It’s a really important book and
I think it’ll make people think twice about

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.370
what they say and how they think about this
topic and also how the justice system works

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.090
in a situation where the laws haven’t been
properly updated to deal with things such

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.580
as social media as evidence. When you read
asking for it the only thing that kept going

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.820
through my mind is this happens a lot on various
scales and the way people respond to it is

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.690
shocking. And that’s why I think it’s
such an important book and I kind of recommend

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.400
that you go and keep it up when it comes out
on September 3rd.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.490
So those are my two reviews of two very different
but also very similar books by Louise O’Neill.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.060
I hope you enjoyed these reviews, let me know
in the comments, if you’ve read only ever

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.130
yours and what you think about it and if you’re
interested in reading asking for it when it

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.480
comes out. I’ll put some information about
the books in the description and I will talk

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.270
to you guys later. Doei!
