Hi everyone! It is Pierre-Edouard Ferry

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.800
I am a french freerider

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.520
I ride for Michelin
I also help them to develop the tires

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.000
As a freerider
I do not have the same expectation as downhill racer

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.420
For example when I am here in Terres Rouges or at the Redbull Rampage

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.780
I really need a tire I can really trust on

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.100
When I go down some really steep and technical sections

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.280
I have no room for a mistake because there are cleaves everywhere

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.080
For a terrain like today the Michelin tire I was riding

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.840
It is a really good tire

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.180
because here it is like super rocky with really sleek rocks

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.740
So I need like lots of grip from the rubber

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.140
This tire is really good all round tire

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.600
from really open and loose terrain

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.180
like sandy soft like this,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.840
to a terrain we have like in the woods,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.060
with like super tacky black dirt, rocks, routes you know,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.880
with very good rubber

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.500
Yes it is a really versatile tire

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.460
We need some special tires than we can trust

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.540
and if we can trust in the Michelin tires

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.920
like the speed and the stuff we are doing   

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.480
everyone can trust in
