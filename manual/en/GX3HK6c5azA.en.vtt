what up fish tank people fishtanktv.com
dustinsfishtanks bringing it to you on a

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.200
Sunday yeah species Sunday it's two for
one two from one species Sunday I got

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.139
two things I want to show you today
actually three I'm going to show you the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.160
bonus first how about that
Brian's over here is always on a Sunday

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.420
helping me out cleaning out the tanks is
this tank look fowl but guess what

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.230
happens when you're clearing a foul tank
you find some babies where they a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.590
brother got some baby rainbows in here
that um where this tank was downstairs

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.829
originally those real tiny rainbows I
don't know if it boesemani or Mela

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.910
Tenaya for the Fred Ricky's oh man oh
they can see that little guy coming at

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.399
us there's one yeah say little dude zoom
in there guys you see that so uh there's

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.520
two is two of them over here okay yes it
definitely got some babies in here which

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.829
we're kind of excited about we're also
kind of like great now I got to take

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.430
care of some more fish because we had so
many thanks and what I just get them

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.390
going so I wanted to show that this is
by the way a perfect environment for a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.810
big fish more or less I mean airstone
lots of just like algae to eat on and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.200
just plant just off they can just go
down there and housing all right so it's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.860
definitely good stuff that's the that's
a bonus part let's get to the meeting

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.950
potatoes let's head to the table show a
little something about Anubis Brides

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.659
over here and he knows his stuff about
anubias like more than anyone I know so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.290
I definitely want to have his input on
this video a lot of people been asking

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.380
me about how to split up tanks how to
split up sort of tanks what up boss

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.420
species so we're going to show you how
Brian would do it you had a tank that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.030
was only anubius for quite long do you
still have that all new via serviette

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.820
other species there's a few other
species alright alright but yeah for the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.450
most part pretty much like just I mean
anubius propagating it the old 125 I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.649
have inside we actually took all my
existing anubius and spread it out one

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.189
time and this is how we did it here so
I'll walk us through a bra you got the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.399
main you find the main kind of artery of
your plant and this is out of Steve's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.060
tank by the way this is doesn't like
come to me like this or anything okay

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.939
yeah you find your big main rhizome here
and what I was trying to do is cut right

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.270
beyond it so now we're using a razor
blade here we're not using scissors

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.510
right yeah razor blades going to give
you a really clean cut on it

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.420
then once you cut it and you just kind
of pull it apart pull the roots part and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.020
that's a piece you can split that in
half if you want them how far how far

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.200
down could you split that like that
little piece we just took off there how

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.840
many pieces could you really break it
into if you were desperate you were like

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.200
I got one piece of anubias I got to turn
into it like six I think you'd probably

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.190
get four out of us
comfortably for a show show where they

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.700
would be I mean we're we're winging it
here because you know it depends on what

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.860
you're trying to do with your aquascape
or whatever but like you got the little

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.060
nodes yeah you could probably take these
first three leaves here I would cut

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.350
right between them right in front of the
third leaf that's gonna give you that

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.550
three there and then I would cut again
here at the middle where it's kind of

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.920
starting to bend a little bit I would
cut it here that would give us about

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.400
five leaves here and we're looking for
natural breaks - I mean spots where it's

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.459
you know that's exactly right and then
on this side you can kind of see where

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.430
it's starting to shoot up this way you
cut it right there in front of that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.650
that's going to give you for peace if
you're desperate you could cut it again

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.130
here but probably won't leave this piece
alone and then what do you do with the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.769
leaves that look so so when you cut it
you leave them on there till new leaves

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.890
come on nucleus I don't ever take off
the leaves I always leave it on the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.769
plant will absorb the nutrients and
thyme is even with the believes looking

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.040
Krunk on like an Amazon sword where you
would want to take off the leaves and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.610
new leaves would be coming up exactly
myself I've always just left them on

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.989
there because they're so slow growing
even a leaf like this is going to do

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.340
some good on a new visa Commission so
yeah keep cutting man show a little this

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.299
all right so we got that on this one
here the plant started growing off on

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.600
its own little angle here so we're going
to split down here at the base

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.580
and pull another piece there you want to
make sure you're leaving roots on all

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.580
these pieces if you take a cent that
many roots it's going to be a lot harder

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.220
if you get it going again and then what
do you do with the roots bro would you

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.019
keep them long because I'm a trimmer but
myself I like to leave them longer I

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.340
guess you could trim them but the plants
already grown to absorb nutrients I

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.700
wouldn't really want to take them off of
the anubius since they're so slow yeah

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.380
all right this one here is kind of
difficult because it's like a big game

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:24.270
SG seeing you know we've actually got
two plants here together I think and for

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.720
me I just be yanking of the bride's like
now I get a razor blade to a right so

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.190
yeah and there's there's mixed debates
on that some people say like certain

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.729
plants you want to cut and certain you
want to rip this plant here was already

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.860
two pieces this wasn't even show that
all right by the way these will be going

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.990
out and some orders here in a little bit
so good for you yeah dude we got this

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.840
show that and then I want to talk
absolutely turn that into one two three

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.020
four yeah alright peace here can still
be split in half so that could still be

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.460
going but I mean you guys get the idea
they're coming along I mean that we just

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.599
you know break that I made it stand so
that's how you do a newbie Asst I want

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.080
to talk about the other species here I
want to talk about Kleinert bar swords

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.030
which by the way is available on
aquaticjungles right now I have a piece

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.990
of paper somewhere I wrote down with the
variety between the two our hotel right

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.530
there here we go it's a cross had to
look it up it's a cross between account

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.840
of doors Bart the eye and condors
jÃ¶rgen insists I don't know if I

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.160
pronounced was right and frankly I don't
care but Connor bar sword

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.110
I like these swords listen folks if
you've got a dirted tank like you owe it

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.620
to yourself to get a big six sword you
really do because they're big heavy root

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.060
feeders love eating all the excess
nutrients you know are not excess

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.800
nutrients they're they're big heavy root
feeder

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.770
hence the heavy roots and I've got a
whole big thing on roots I'm going to do

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.650
here in a little bit but on this plant
as far as dividing I'm actually not

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.350
going to cut it but I just want to show
this would be one that could

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.160
be cut if you needed to really do it see
how it's kind of got and point out kind

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.100
of what I'm talking about here so where
where would you cut this briar we've got

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.040
Kyle we're talking about maybe cutting
it here kind of getting this piece off

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.310
here exactly I pull the leaves out a
little bit you can kind of see where the

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.430
plant would match the natural breaks
that's what you're looking for and if

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.820
you don't have it don't do it like it's
like we're not I don't want to cut this

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.520
because I don't want it's not ready yet
so it's actually connected but

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.340
somebody's going to get a nice fat sword
in a couple weeks they can put in a two

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.330
but that's how you would with breaking
it up I will set in anubias a a Condor

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.790
bar sword or any Amazon swords check out
video 3:30 3:30 - I can't talk today 322

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.260
I did another species Sunday on a bunch
of swords a while back I like the Conor

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.580
barb sword available on aquaticjungles
excited about it have these real red

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.980
leaves in the middle and these will
actually once they get into a good

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.220
substrate become the main center all the
leaves to come out and then once they

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.680
get older they have like they keep the
green on the ends you got any thoughts

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.890
on the carnivore sure to keep them herd
out of it a real big one for awhile

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.450
didn't he is that an ocelot they get
bigger the guys along yeah so person

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.380
that's what we're doing and oh by the
way we're getting the 125 roll in here

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.160
we got all these plants over here we got
some onions in the face right here

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.600
onions on aquaticjungles now I'm rocking
this kind of jungle Val I'm real pumped

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.900
about it so I'm just having a real good
time I wish the temperature would either

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.150
stay hot or stakeholders I'm like back
and forth being sick so that's what's up

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:27.600
people having a lot of fun cut up your
anubias cut up your kind of doors if you

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.350
can later
