00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.230
The Bobcat soil conditioner has a number

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.700
of features that make it the right

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.950
choice for landscapers, because it will

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.809
cover many of their ground preparation

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.170
needs. It can level, clear debris, till the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.140
soil, leave a good seedbed, cut swales and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.810
work in tight quarters. It is functional

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.650
and durable. Rotating Drum: carbide tip

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.470
teeth give long life. Tooth placement on

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.260
the drum maximizes ground penetration.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.200
Easy replacement of the drum when the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.200
teeth do wear out. Individual teeth can

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.420
be changed if desired during the life of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.120
the drum. 60-inch and larger models have

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.539
the ability to lock the drum, so the unit

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.520
acts like a box blade for levelling the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.460
surface, or the drum can be put in a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.010
float position that lets the unit prep

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.770
the soil without disturbing the contour

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.039
of the surface. Removable Endplates: With

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.379
endplates, the soil in front of the drum

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.019
is carried along and can be used to fill

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.360
low spots. Without the endplates

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.880
material can be wind-rowed to one side,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.979
and picked up with the loader bucket.

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.280
Direct Drive Hydraulic Motor: The direct

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.979
drive motor has fewer moving parts than

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.650
competitors that utilize reduction boxes.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.350
Fewer parts lead to lower maintenance.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.439
The latest motor has guards and improved

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.259
seals to reduce the possibility of leaks

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.020
occurring from material such as twine or

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.659
wire wrapping around the drive shaft. In

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.659
the 60-inch models and above, the drive

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.180
motor allows the unit to work on

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.290
high-flow loaders. Front Bolster: The

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.079
front bolster offers a wide stance and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.450
enough distance between the wheels and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.149
the drum to allow substantial material

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.009
to be carried in front of the drum. It

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.579
also offers better grade control. The

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.430
ability to flip up the bolster provides

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.409
a shorter length for working in tight

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.840
quarters, and makes it easier to haul the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.540
unit on a trailer. Oscillation of the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.270
front axle provides better grade control

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.000
over rough terrain by keeping the drum

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.530
parallel to the ground,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.319
and minimizes elevation changes from

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.140
rises and potholes. The large degree of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.840
oscillation allows the soil conditioner

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.020
to be angled, lifted, and tilted forward

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.290
to create slopes and swales. On the 72-

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.080
inch and 84-inch hydraulic models, the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.290
bolster tires are foam filled. This gives

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.420
these heavier, hard-working units better

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.700
tire life and eliminates downtime from

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.010
flats. Manual and Hydraulic drum Angling:

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.160
60-inch and 72-inch models offer manual

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.440
angling of the drum and optional

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.370
hydraulic angling. The 48-inch drum is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.850
standard with manual angling, and the 84-

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.980
inch models come standard with hydraulic

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.130
angling. Manual angling offers three

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.459
positions. Between 0 and 25 degrees right

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.150
and left.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.670
Hydraulic angling is fingertip

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.519
controlled, and offers up to 25 degrees

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.280
left and right angling. Hydraulic and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.459
Manual Raise and Lower of the Bolster:

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.430
60-inch and larger models offer optional

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.829
hydraulic raise and lower of the bolster

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.209
and drum, and it is fingertip controlled.

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.340
Hydraulic controls offer on the goal

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.829
raise and lower of the bolster, letting

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.060
the operator cut or fill as necessary.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.470
Manual bolster raise and lower is

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.400
accomplished through a turnbuckle system.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.380
Manual bolsters can be lifted up and

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.650
locked into position with a pin. High

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.850
Flow Model:. 72-inch and 84-inch only.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.220
High flow harnesses additional

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.709
horsepower to give greater torque to the

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.440
drum, and lets the soil conditioner cut

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.470
deeper and faster even in hard pan and

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.049
clay soils. Because the loader high flow

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.750
only operates in one direction, a special

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.400
valve is installed on the soil

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.250
conditioner to allow high flow rotation

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.150
in forward and reverse drum rotation.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.919
This gives the high torque benefit of

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.160
high flow for all parts of the job. The

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.860
Bobcat soil conditioner is offered in

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.960
different configurations for various

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.000
carriers.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.069
Bobcat carriers include skid-steer

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.800
loader, compact track loader, all-wheel

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.580
steer, and the utility work machine.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.080
Standard Manual Angle and Bolster

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.430
Control with Optional Hydraulic Control:

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.889
60-inch to 84-inch hydraulic motor

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.590
driven models. Does not include the S70.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:56.039
Mini loader, S100, T110, and S70: 48-inch

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.050
manual angle and bolster control.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.000
Hydraulic motor driven. Versahandler: 84-

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.389
inch hydraulic angle and bolster control

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.400
hydraulic motor driven. Compact Utility

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.880
Tractor: manual and hydraulic angle

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.229
control, PTO driven, one directional model,

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.639
60-inch and 72-inch. Seeding, sodding, tree

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.979
planting setting decorative rocks, or a

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.139
number of other landscape opportunities

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.659
can be accomplished with the myriad of

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.310
other Bobcat attachments available.
