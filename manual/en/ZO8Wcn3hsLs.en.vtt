00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.200
It seems that in the context of mecha anime
main characters, the shy and quiet teenager

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.180
is the stereotype often attributed.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.160
It's not because they are so easy to make
fun of, but probably because the guy is so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.190
human and so prone to making mistakes or because
the fans can relate to the kid.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.820
One of these unsung heroes is Cage Midwell,
a 17-year old kid who makes his rounds on

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.180
the spaceship Bonaparte III, and he's your
typical run of the mill 22nd century deckhand.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.320
Once his ship is attacked by a powerful Orbital
Frame, however, his life takes a dramatic

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:25.360
turn, for better or worse.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.720
This is the premise of Zone Of The Enders
The Fist Of Mars, part of the Hideo Kojima

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.180
headed development that has taken the classic
mecha anime series and turned it into a widely

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.970
popular gaming franchise.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.890
If you value action over story, you might
not want to even look in this game's direction.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.550
The Fist Of Mars is highly story-oriented,
following the trials and tribulations of Cage

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.209
Midwell and his close friend Ares Enduwa as
their story unfolds through 26 chapters of

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:17.610
turn-based tactical gameplay.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.970
Just like in any other Zone of the Enders
game, you'll control Orbital Frames against

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.370
your foes, but you'll now be blasting and
swinging laser blades on a tactical grid.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.730
Anyone who has played the Banpresto released
Super Robot Taisen, or any Super Robot Wars

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.670
game for that matter, are probably drawing
comparisons to it right now, and you would

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.760
be entirely justified.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.620
Each Orbital frame you control has strengths
and weaknesses, and as the game progresses,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.620
they both come into focus more and more.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.060
With the help of Born In Space operative Deckson
Geyse, your team will get bigger and stronger

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.480
as you fight off the forces of Mars who want
nothing more than to enslave you and the BIS.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.570
What intrigues me the most about each battle
is what happens when you select to attack

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.060
an enemy, or vice versa.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.150
Within a certain amount of time, you must
target the enemy or dodge their attacks by

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.520
moving the cursor on your screen away from
the mecha as long as you can.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.630
It's an interesting way of going about a battle
rather than just selecting the action and

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:34.680
putting it into effect.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.280
Even if you want this game because of the
turn-based gameplay, you'd be missing out

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.710
if you didn't focus on the story, which is
beautifully written and thought out.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.540
It's evident that such a plotline is critical
to the advancement of the game, and it's almost

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.130
like reading a chapter of a manga before tackling
the quality gameplay.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.260
Even if you think Cage is a whiny bitch.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.820
I find the hack-and-slash Zone of the Enders
for the PS2 more fun to play than the GBA

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.010
The Fist Of Mars, however, and I definitely
want to make the argument that if I want more

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.730
story to what's going on, I'll settle for
watching the show.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.850
Dialogue can sometimes drag on a little too
long, and I'll skip ahead if I want to get

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.440
to the battlefield.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.430
In conclusion, if you love Zone of the Enders
as much as the next guy, I would recommend

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.160
The Fist Of Mars.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.000
To those who want an introduction to the series,
start watching the show first or get a good

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.650
dose of hack and slash for the PS2 before
pulling the trigger on this one.
