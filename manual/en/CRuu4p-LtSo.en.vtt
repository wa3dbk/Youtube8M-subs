00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.090
 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.550
 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.790
I don't think I'll ever forget, Kelleigh
was in a

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.900
little school, she was preschooler, we
noticed a growing discoloration on the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.150
right side of her

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.730
face, on her right cheek, on her right ear.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.140
It continued to get larger, it pulsated.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.780
We were sent for evaluation and

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.810
they had to look out of state to to find
help for us

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.590
and I got the phone call. The exact words
given to me were

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.680
that "your daughter has a
life-threatening,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.790
rare, inoperable, condition for which
there is no cure,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.200
and we're not sure what we can do,
but we need to see her

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.390
right away." That's when we meet Dr. Burrows and she truly was the only

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.260
person who

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.360
who gave us hope. I first met Kelleigh and
her parents in

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.649
2000, she has about six years old
and she'd been diagnosed to have an

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.320
arteriovenous malformation (AVM)

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.130
an arteriovenous malformation is a
complicated

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.500
abnormality of blood vessels, where the
arteries connect directly to the veins.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.730
And, that causes some harmful effects on
the tissue around it.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.410
So, we brought her back numerous times
over the years to treat

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.680
what was symptomatic. Because the AVM's effect her airway,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.610
she required a trachestomy when
she was 10 years old.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.540
She had life-threatening reaction to a
chemotherapy agent

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.570
and spent the week before her First
Communion

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.030
in the ICU and received

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.670
anointing the sick last rights on Monday

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.410
and then woke up on Wednesday in

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.420
told us that you need to get better so
that she could

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.330
make her First Holy Communion on
Saturday. And, she went with her

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.570
pretty little First Communion dress and
the same priest who gave her

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.880
last rights on Monday, gave her First Holy Communion 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.460
on Saturday.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.980
She is really a great, active

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.030
kid, and has a really supportive wonderful
family.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.850
The most difficult thing is probably not being able to do everything

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.920
I want to. Like, some of my friends can play sports

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.530
and they are like good at it but I have to
stop because I can't get as rough as them. 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.650
We are so lucky to have her

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.430
as our doctor, she wants to hear about
Kelleigh's dreams and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.150
Kelly actually wants to be a doctor. You
get to know them, you follow them from

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.450
early childhood until they're having
kids of their own

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.940
and that has been just incredibly fulfilling.
Though, what we've done is it's very

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.020
grassroots right now. but we've

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.340
start a Facebook page for Kelleigh called
Kelleigh's cause, we are committed to raise

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.220
the money that's necessary to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.660
beat this. We've been all over the United
States and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.120
everywhere we've been, everybody knows
Dr. Burrows so that gives us great comfort

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.650
knowing that

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.000
she's in the best hands. She says, for 12
years now,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.299
you take care of yourselves, I'll take care of her. 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.230
So, again, whatever it takes for us to
get to Children's Hospital of Wisconsin

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.110
to see Dr. Burrows, we will do whatever it
takes, our job is to get her here.
