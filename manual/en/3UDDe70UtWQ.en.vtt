00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.890
For more than 80 years, the aviation industry
has asked for Sherwin-Williams Aerospace products.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.100
Specifiers and painters in the commercial
military general and business aircraft segments

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.960
recognized Sherwin-Williams as a global leader
in providing certified products and for developing

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.520
new innovative products.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.599
Sherwin-Williams is also known for product
and technical support provided by a knowledgeable

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.949
and responsive team.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.160
Sherwin-Williams products provide an extremely
high quality finish.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.770
They are also designed for easy application.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.940
To help you achieve a beautiful and durable
finish.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:53.360
This video demonstrates the proper method
for applying a jet glow express paint system.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.680
Once you've done a thorough stripping of the
aircraft surface and applied a pre-treatment

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.540
to the stripped surface you're ready to apply
a primer.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.780
First select one of Sherwin-Williams corrosion
resistant primers and prepare it properly

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.400
by shaking it thoroughly and then mixing the
base and components and specific ratios.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.470
Refer to the product datasheet for the proper
mixing regime.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.070
Next check viscosity of the primer mix to
ensure correct application drying and performance

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.670
properties.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.990
Allow an induction period of 15 to 30 minutes
and check the temperature of the primer airframe

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.170
and paint hanger to ensure each is at room
temperature.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.230
After filtering the paint materials check
your spray gun settings and begin applying

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.049
the primer in one light continuous closed
film coat.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.250
When finished allow at least two hours for
drying at room temperature.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.530
Next take dry film thickness readings they
should be approximately 1 mill DFT for projects

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.330
requiring optimum finishes, such as on business
jets, ascending surfaces should be applied

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.039
epoxy or urethane options are available.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.530
For the sanding surfacer will require two
to twelve hours of dry time depending on which

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.220
product is used and its thick.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.610
After Drying the surface her coat should be
approximately four to six mills thick.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.900
Before sanding apply a guide coat to help
identify high and low irregular surfaces and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.450
areas needing sanded.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.760
The surface should be thoroughly abraded with
240 or 320 grit sandpaper or red abrasive

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.849
pads.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.770
Ideally the surfacer should be sanded down
to a minimum of around two mills.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.200
At this point, perform filling work along
scenes in rivets using Sherwin-Williams fill

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.069
Bond epoxy putty.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.690
When all filling and sanding is complete rinse
the plane's entire surface and allow it to

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.980
dry.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:11.740
Finally, blow down the plane with clean compressed
air and recheck the masking once again.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.599
Now it is time to apply the jet glow express
TopCoat.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:25.209
But first prepare the plane surface by blowing
it off and then wiping it down with Sherwin-Williams

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.590
prepaid wiping solvent.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.209
Now thoroughly Shake Your topcoat.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.239
Then mix the proper amounts of topcoat and
the components.

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.239
Tip for this process: Always add hardware
and activator into the base component and

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.410
stir.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.800
Then pour the activator of choice slowly into
the mix.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:55.390
Adjust the mix to the correct viscosity with
solvent and allow a full 30 minutes for induction.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.250
Remember to again check the temperature of
the mixed topcoat airframe and hangar.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.180
After the induction period.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.489
Filter the mixed topcoat into the spray pods.

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.060
Adjust your spray guns to the proper setting.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.030
Then begin applying.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.260
Using smooth sweeping horizontal passes.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.030
With each slightly overlapping the last.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.620
Typically two or three medium wet coats of
topcoat are applied to ensure it has good

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.940
opacity, flow, and leveling.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.910
Allow a 30 to 45 minute flash period between
coats.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.660
After a layer of topcoat has been applied.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.530
Allow several hours of dry time.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.120
The final topcoat thickness should be two
to three mills dry.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:58.150
After drying the Liberi striping process is
ready to begin.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.580
By following these guidelines it will help
you achieve outstanding results with Sherwin-Williams

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.500
topcoats.
