00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.880
The first Halo, was in the beginning planned to be realeased exclusively on "MacOS" and "Windows" Platforms.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.780
However, back then, Halo was a very different game.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.560
Instead of the First-Person-Shooter everyone is familliar with today,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.960
it was a Real-Time strategy type game, similar to Bundgie's previous game series called "Myth".

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.960
This early version of Halo was first shown at the 1999 Macworld Expo,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.260
and Steve Jobs himself even talked about the game on stage.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.000
(Steve): Jason Jones, who is the co-founder at Bungie, and the Halo project lead,  Halo is the name of this game,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.500
and we're gonna see, for the first time, Halo.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.720
The next public reveal would be at E3 in 2000.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.460
At this point, it was no-longer an RTS game.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.020
Instead, Halo now featured a Third-Person perspective.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:04.160
Soon after it was shown at E3, Microsoft acquired bungie studios, and Halo became an exclusive launch title, for the upcoming console, "XBOX".

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:13.540
It was first planned to be released in late 2000, but as they decided to transform it into a First-Person-Shooter, the game, and thus the console itself, was delayed.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.260
After years of development, the XBOX, along with Halo combat evolved, was released on November, 15th, 2001.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.860
There was a planned Halo game, simply called, Halo DS. Much like the name implies, the game was planned to be released on the Nintendo DS.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.220
In 2007, IGN even played a short demo of the game, which showcased features like, dual wielding weapons, among other things.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.120
However, due to licencing issues, the game was cancelled, and there are no plans to ever release it to the public.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.320
When Halo 2 was initially released for PC, modders quickly found game files with the file extension, ".ass"

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.300
What they also found, was that sometimes when you try to edit these files, this error message would be displayed.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.300
Apparently some developers at Bungie thought the file extension, ".ass",

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.580
was hilarious, and had to include an actual ass, in the game files. however this innocent prank,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.300
actually caused the game to be delayed, as Microsoft had to apply a new rating to the game, that included "Partial Nudity".

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.820
Basically, Halo 2, was delayed because of an ***hole.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.220
Just like Google has Google Now, and Apple has Siri, Microsoft has it's very own,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.320
intelligent personal assistant, that comes with windows phones. The name of this new AI software is,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.459
Cortana. Of course named after the AI character in the Halo franchise.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.429
And, this AI is also voiced by the same actor, who voiced Cortana, in the video games.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.369
Master Chief's appearance has long remained a mystery throughout the franchise. However, in Halo 4,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.200
his face is actually revealed, for the first time.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.180
Well, partially, at least.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.080
If you play the game on Legendary,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.420
the ending of the game will be slightly different.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:17.840
The reclamation, has already begun. And we are hopeless, to stop it.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.900
Even though Destiny was officially revealed for the first time in 2012,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.280
Bungie secretly revealed it in 2009, through an Easter egg, within the game, Halo 3: ODST.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.220
In the game, you can find a sign that reads, "Destiny Awaits." with a picture of the earth, and a mysterious white orb,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.320
floating above. Keep in mind that this was 5 years, before Destiny was even realeased.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.020
The Elite's speech in the original Halo, is mostly lines spoken by SGT. Johnson, played in reverse.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.840
for example, The Elite's infamous "Wort, wort, wort!",

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.680
is actually Johnson saying," Go, go, go!

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.180
On the same day that the first trailer for Halo 2 premiered back in 2004, members of the Gaming Community,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.460
Received jars of honey in the mail. on the jars where a link to the website,

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.740
ilovebees.com.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.080
And, observant viewers of the trailer, could spot the same same link, at the end.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.400
The address, would lead viewers, to a bee keepers website, that appeared to be hacked, in some way, with a countdown at the bottom of the page.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.460
People soon figured out, that the website contained a list of coordinates for various locations across the U.S.

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.160
At each of these locations,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.620
a payphone could be found, which would start ringing, when the countdown reached 0.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.440
If you picked up the phone, a voice would ask you a bunch of questions about Halo,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.309
and if you answer them correctly, an audio clip could be heard repeating over, and over again.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.360
Once enough people had done this, a number on the website would reach 7, 7, 7, and the game was over.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.820
Now, after all of this, as a reward, participants were given access to play Halo 2 multiplayer before its release.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.760
Basically, all of this was one of the biggest, most elaborate marketing campaigns, for a video game, ever.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.100
Bungie, is for whatever reason, obsessed with the number seven. In fact, they have something called, "Bungie day",

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:28.220
Which is celebrated on "July 7th", or the seventh day, in the seventh month of the year. because of this it can be found repeatedly.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.860
In the Halo franchise, and I really mean,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.080
repeatedly. for example, seven active Halos, seven terminals in Halo 3,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.060
Master Chief's ID number, is 1-1-7, John-117,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.600
consists of four letters, and three numbers, Seven! Slipspace consists of seven dimensions,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.440
the Chinese and Japanese character for the number seven, can be found on the M6D pistol.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.080
In Halo 2, there are seven covenant races, seven covenant vehicles, and seven drivable vehicles,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.180
overall. The ship "Forward onto Dawn" has a star with a 7 in the middle.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.340
Seven triangles on the Battle rifle, the announcement trailer for Halo reach was 77 seconds long,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.480
or 1 minute and 17 seconds, a reference to Master Chief's ID number, 117.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.730
Halo games have always had a bunch of ridiculously complicated, or just

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.970
interesting Easter eggs. For example, in Halo 3 there's actually an Easter egg on the loading screen of the game.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.820
It wasn't discovered until last year.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:38.000
Seven years after the game's release. the easter egg can only be viewed on December 25th, when you hold down both thumbsticks.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:56.360
In both Halo 2, and Halo 3, there's an easter egg featuring a real-life photo of a man in shorts.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:03.760
The guy in the photo is actually Bungie co-founder, Jason Jones. in both Halo 3 and Halo 3 ODST,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.280
you can find hidden characters, in various locations that look like "Monkeys" or "Cavemen".

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.800
in Halo 2, there's a secret weapon called the "Scarab gun", to reach it,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.070
You have to lure a banshee,

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:22.320
through a tunnel full of enemies. At the end of the tunnel, you had to damage it just enough, so it can fit through an even smaller tunnel.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.660
then, board it at just the right time, before it disappears,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.300
and then fly to the top of the structure, in the next level of the game.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.480
How the **** do people figure this out?

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:52.900
