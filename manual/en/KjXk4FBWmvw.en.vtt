00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:01.995
- Hi, Heather here again,

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:06.586
and today I am demoing
the Sheila wig by Envy

00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:08.745
in the color Amaretto Cream.

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:11.128
Now first I'll discuss
the color a little bit

00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:14.038
in case this wig isn't
quite your cup of tea,

00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:15.456
but you like the color.

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:19.131
The color on this one is Amaretto Cream,

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:21.191
which is a highlighted shade.

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:25.358
Amaretto Cream is a very
nice neutral cool brown,

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:30.518
that has dark blonde
highlights throughout.

00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:32.602
And the highlights are concentrated

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:33.995
more towards the front and the sides,

00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:36.913
but you will have some in
the back towards the top,

00:00:36.913 --> 00:00:39.433
which makes it look like
it's been professionally done

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.404
in the salon, which is very very nice.

00:00:42.404 --> 00:00:45.619
The bang on Sheila is relatively long.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.047
It's almost five inches in length.

00:00:49.047 --> 00:00:50.447
So you could have that cut

00:00:50.447 --> 00:00:52.579
if you wanna have a nice blunt bang.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.920
But the bang on Sheila is nice by itself.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.393
It's designed to be swept off to the side,

00:00:57.393 --> 00:00:59.593
and you'll notice when you do so

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:02.448
that it's not such a bulky bang

00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:04.657
that it will want to fall in your face.

00:01:04.657 --> 00:01:08.378
It actually stays put for the most part,

00:01:08.378 --> 00:01:11.349
which makes it a very comfortable wig.

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:14.252
It won't get in your eyes all the time.

00:01:14.252 --> 00:01:18.486
Sheila can be brushed back
for a nice slick look,

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:20.696
or she can be brushed forward.

00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:22.177
So you can take advantage of all those

00:01:22.177 --> 00:01:24.010
beautiful face framing

00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:27.454
razored ends.

00:01:28.318 --> 00:01:30.651
Which are really attractive.

00:01:31.928 --> 00:01:34.261
And I'll show you the sides.

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:39.614
See she falls right around
the chin and the jawline.

00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:43.511
It is a short wig.

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:46.334
And she is slightly longer in the back

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:48.449
than she is in the front.

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:52.634
So this particular wig has
a standard cap construction,

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:55.438
and it is actually a very cool,

00:01:55.438 --> 00:01:58.085
comfortable and lightweight wig.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.170
So once you put it on,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.694
it's very easy to forget
that you're wearing it.

00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:05.473
And so with that in mind
it's really easy to see

00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:09.277
why the Sheila is so incredibly popular.

00:02:09.277 --> 00:02:13.657
It's one of the most popular
wigs that Envy carries.

00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:17.293
The fibers are quite silky.

00:02:17.293 --> 00:02:19.493
And like I said they're very lightweight

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:21.384
which is an advantage over human hair.

00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:25.357
And the shape is essentially a bob,

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:27.387
so it's universally flattering.

00:02:27.387 --> 00:02:30.449
It's just got this nice long bang.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.116
And compared to other

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:35.719
layered bobs like this

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.238
that have this long bang,

00:02:37.238 --> 00:02:39.369
like for instance the Codi by Noriko,

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.992
I actually prefer the Sheila

00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:44.730
because the bang isn't so bulky,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.612
and because it's got a standard cap,

00:02:46.612 --> 00:02:48.988
it is more lightweight and breathable.

00:02:48.988 --> 00:02:52.727
I'll get a little bit closer
on the top of the wig.

00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:54.606
So you can see the hairline.

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:56.748
Amaretto Cream is a rooted shade,

00:02:56.748 --> 00:02:59.627
so it's darker right around here

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.310
to sort of obscure the hairline.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.017
I doubt anyone would notice

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.264
that you're even wearing a wig though.

00:03:06.264 --> 00:03:07.794
If you think that these particular fibers

00:03:07.794 --> 00:03:10.564
are shinier than you like,

00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:13.420
I recommend purchasing a dry shampoo,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.834
which is basically just spray talc.

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:17.194
And they smell beautiful.

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.699
The one that I use smells like mangoes.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.938
Just make sure you hold it
pretty far away from the wig,

00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:25.495
and then shake the wig out
when you're done applying.

00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:29.491
And I recommend only
applying it to the top layer.

00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:31.067
And that'll help dull the shine,

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:34.778
and it will refresh your wig
if you think it needs cleaned

00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:36.806
so that you can go longer
in between washing it,

00:03:36.806 --> 00:03:38.904
which is pretty important
with these synthetic wigs.

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:42.154
It'll help prolong the life of the wig.

00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:45.874
Additionally, it'll make
the wig smell awesome.

00:03:45.874 --> 00:03:47.665
So I would definitely recommend that,

00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:52.155
and once I secure a product
line or two along those lines

00:03:52.155 --> 00:03:53.928
I might be able to offer some on the site.

00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:57.461
But for now this is the Sheila by Envy.

00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.623
I'm gonna take her off so you
can take a look at the cap.

00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:05.123
And it's very easy to put on and take off.

00:04:07.987 --> 00:04:09.184
Rather than the rose lace

00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:11.975
that you see a lot in standard caps

00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:15.642
this one has an open wefted top,

00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:18.100
with a very soft

00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:23.743
felt piece that goes
right along the hairline.

00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:26.604
And the backs and sides
are also open wefted.

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:29.527
And the really nice thing
about the Envy wigs,

00:04:29.527 --> 00:04:31.449
just like Estetica wigs,

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.552
they have a very nice long elastic band.

00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:37.820
So instead of just being
able to adjust them

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.916
about a half inch like
you can on most wigs,

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:44.687
these can stretch out quite
a bit if you need them to.

00:04:44.687 --> 00:04:46.229
And that's really nice

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.179
if you have a large cap size,

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:53.678
or even one that's
average large like I have.

00:04:53.678 --> 00:04:55.671
It's highly highly adjustable.

00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:59.770
So even if you have a
traditional average head,

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.512
or one that's even small,

00:05:01.512 --> 00:05:05.105
you should be able to
adjust this accordingly.

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:08.688
And I'll show you how
easy it is to put on.

00:05:10.908 --> 00:05:14.250
Just wanna make sure that that front band

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.094
is right on your hairline.

00:05:16.094 --> 00:05:18.054
Find the adjustable ear tabs.

00:05:18.054 --> 00:05:20.940
Line em up with the sides of your face.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.857
Make sure they're flat.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.708
Run your fingers through her a little bit.

00:05:29.708 --> 00:05:30.582
And wah-lah!

00:05:30.582 --> 00:05:32.197
This is the Sheila by Envy.
