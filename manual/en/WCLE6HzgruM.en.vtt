00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.700
What's wrong?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.220
Nothing has to be wrong. I get to be cranky, okay?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.280
You've any idea how spent and tired I was before all of this?

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480
One day, all of this will be over.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.900
When that day comes, I'll make you feel safe again.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.020
I realize your brother is special to you but I lost people too.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.760
Yeah and we'll mourn them Caitlin.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.780
Later.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.840
If we want to live, we need Evan.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.180
Okay, look. I know what you're doing but I cannot and will not work with you looming over my shoulder.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.720
You're not the socialite, are you?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.780
You should change that.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.900
There's not many people left in the world to make enemies with.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.360
Let's say I fix this.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.600
Then what?

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.820
What is your brilliant plan on bringing the world back to normalcy?

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.960
Well that's beyond me.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.520
I guess we'll have to repopulate, which does put me in a heck of a position doesn't it.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.360
Tell me,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.360
what does the Jeremiah plan on doing once we're all gone?

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.720
A virus can't live without a host.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.400
That's where you're wrong.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.640
See, Jerry isn't a virus at all.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.080
Wait here.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.040
Drop it!

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.560
All right, relax.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.060
Drop it!

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.560
Relax.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.380
Put it down!

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.460
Put it down.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.880
Hey, I was messing with you, I'm new shift.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.720
Whoa killer.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.420
Wait up.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.560
Nick.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.540
This wasn't the Jeremiah, these are bullet holes.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.440
Well, we came looking for pricks.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.100
Sir.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.100
Bracken still hasn't returned.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.580
What do you mean he hasn't returned?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.800
It's been four hours and he hasn't checked in.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.940
Has anyone gone after him?

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.480
No.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.440
You hear that?

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.320
Yeah.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.880
Don't!

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.100
Turn it off.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.980
Shit.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.660
What's it say?

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.440
Turn it off!

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.120
Sorry.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.900
I can't.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.160
We're surrounded.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.800
It's coming from here.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.440
General Weston.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.140
Sir.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.460
We found him.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.600
Tell the others.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.520
Yes, sir.
