00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.710
Is that bling? 
It's blinged out.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.150
and when did you do this?

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.810
uh... thursday

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.550
no, saturday. 
So you're an expert? That was two days ago.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.100
Two days ago.
Okay.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.090
well what i did

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.690
step one get a safe piercing... 
And and do your parents know? 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.740
No. 
But all of YouTube knows...
Yes. Hopefully my parents aren't on YouTube.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.030
...they were like what is that, and I was like oh it's fake

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:01.110
Yep, it's just attached to my skin. That's all.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.860
So step 1, have a piercing kit

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.760
the one i got was from mspiercing.com 
I got it shipped, fast shipping, quick shipping

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.620
reasonable price

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.560
Is it sterile? 
They are sterile needles. 
How do you know? 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.260
It came from msshipping.com... 
Mspiercing.com 
Maybe the postman like... licked it.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.239
they were all in safe boxes and

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:24.920
uh... boxes make everything safe

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.289
So sterile needles, you need to have sterile needles

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.060

pins

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.520

they are not

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.360
sterile no matter how well you clean
them, you need to have a hollow needle with a 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.750
hollow center

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.210
