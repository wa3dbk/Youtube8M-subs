00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:07.790
Motorola DEFY+

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.870
Expected Q3 2010
16th August 2011.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.700
Motorola's announcement of the DEFY+ comes
the day after the surprising news that Google

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.680
has agreed to buy Motorola for a staggering
$12.5bn. And although the announcement of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.210
a single handset is not that important compared
to a massive takeover like that, the DEFY+

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.120
is still quite an important handset.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.489
The original Motorola DEFY was launched last
year, and it was the first Motorola smartphone

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:44.050
to make any serious inroads into the European
market for some time. As with the DEFY+, the

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.700
DEFY's almost unique selling proposition was
that this was a ruggedised but fully-featured

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.950
Android smartphone that appealed to those
customers who found standard smartphones a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.090
bit too fragile.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.680
Although the DEFY sold quite well, it had
a couple of major weaknesses - the processor

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.610
was relatively slow at 800 MHz, and the operating
system only went up to Android 2.2 rather

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.760
than the latest Android 2.3. The new DEFY+
builds on the old handset's strong points

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.090
and brings the DEFY line bang up to date.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.900
The CPU is now a 1 GHz unit and Android 2.3
ships as standard, with makes the DEFY+ much

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.420
more competitive under the hood. Motorola
have also given the DEFY+ a much bigger battery,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.290
with a 1700 mAh cell fitted underneath giving
up to 7.1 hours talktime and 16 days standby

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.700
time. You can never have too much battery
life with Android, so this is also a help.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.950
But of course the main feature of the DEFY+
is the ruggedness. Built to IP67 standards,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.619
the DEFY+ is highly resistant to dust and
water and the Gorilla Glass screen is scratch

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.860
resistant too. Don't expect it to be indestructible
though as big screen devices like this can

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.920
still break relatively easily if impacted
in the wrong place.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.140
The other features of the DEFY+ are pretty
much like the old handset, with a 3.7" 854

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.709
x 480 pixel display, a 5 megapixel camera
with LED flash and autofocus on the back,

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:26.189
an FM radio, WiFi, GPS and an electronics
compass and 3.5G support. Android 2.3 of course

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.950
comes with a comprehensive media player, web
browser, turn-by-turn navigation and access

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.989
to thousands of application in the Android
market. The DEFY+ is the same size and weight

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:47.400
as the old model, despite the larger battery,
at 107 x 59 x 13.4mm and 118 grams.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.340
Motorola say that the DEFY+ should be available
in the early autumn in Europe, Asia and Latin

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.150
America. No guidance was given on price, but
we would expect the DEFY+ to retail for about

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.630
â‚¬400 at launch.
