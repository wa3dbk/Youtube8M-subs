Come on Gumbo and Freckles lets sing a song for Holy

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.960
Hi Holy good to see you. That was a lovely song thankyou

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Holy we want to ask you something. Do you know who is the smartest one

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Freckels, Me or Gumbo

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I have a simple solution who ever answers the Question I ask the end

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The story I am about to tell you is the smartest of the 3, that sounds fair.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Alright! Long time ago in Cupernium lived a Roman Centurion or army officer

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.760
Who was Incharge of 100 Roman Soldiers

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.000
Once his servant was very ill. The officer have heard about Jesus

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So he told some of Jewis leaders to go and ask Jesus for help to save his servant

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
As soon as Jesus came to town, the elders went to him

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And told him about the centurions request.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They said he is a Good Man and deseves your help

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
He build a place to worship and he is kind to our people

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Jesus agreed to meet him. But before Jesus reached the officers house

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Some of his friends met him with the message from the officer. They said

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The officer have requested you not to trouble Yourself for him

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
He said he is not good enough You to enter his house

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He has told you, To say some  kind words from a distance

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Your kind words have thee power to travel miles

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
When Jesus heard the message he smiled

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
He turned to his followers and said

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I haven't found such faith in the whole of Isreal

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The friends then returned to the offiers house and saw the servant have been healed.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Wow! Jesus healed a man from a distance.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.960

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.000

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
