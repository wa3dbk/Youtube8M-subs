Hi guys! I'm really excited to share today's
nail tutorial because I've been getting a

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.709
lot of requests for it ever since I wore it
to Playlist Live. I loved wearing this super

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.480
cute 3D bow manicure and today I'm going to
show you just how easy it is to do!

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.380
By the way, I loved seeing all of your beautiful
faces at Playlist. Meeting you guys in real

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.089
life is incredible!

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:30.119
So let's jump right into the tutorial by getting
out our base coat. Always remember to apply

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.870
this before coloured polishes because not
only does it help your nail polish adhere

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.340
to your nail, but it will also protect them
from having the colored pigments in your polish

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.090
stain them.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.930
Next choose one of your favorite pink polishes.
I've been loving this creamy pastel pink,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.620
especially with Spring on it's way soon. Paint
both your index, pinky, and thumb using this

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.600
polish.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.150
Next choose a metallic gold for your ring
finger. This will make a gorgeous background

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.880
for your bow to be placed on!

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.939
Finally use a white polish to paint your middle
finger. This one by OPI is my favorite white

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.490
because it's super opaque and easy to apply.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.290
Now, for the leopard print, just use the brush
on your pink polish to dab a few random spots.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.190
Make sure to space them out and only do about 2-4
of them. Then, using a grey polish, place

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.030
a blob of it onto some tinfoil and then use
a toothpick to dip into it. Apply this color

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.190
around the pink to finish the leopard spots.
Make sure to only outline the pink partially

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.000
for best results. It's also a great idea to
use a stippling motion when doing this because

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.920
the polish will come off the toothpick in
a nicer way. I really like using grey here

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.030
rather than black because it gives the overall
design a softer look. Don't forget to add

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.580
in a few small grey spots to tie the whole
nail look together.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.090
Next we're going to add some little gold studs
to all of the pink nails. These ones are from

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.630
Sally Hansen's I heart nail art collection
and can be found at most drugstores. Just

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.010
add a little top coat to where you want to
place the stud, and then pick up the stud

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.649
with a toothpick that has a little bit of
top coat on it, and press it firmly on the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.890
nail. Now add a top coat over all of your
nails. This will seal in your design and add a beautiful

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.840
shine! It will also make sure that those studs won't be going anywhere.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.069
The final step is use nail glue to adhere
the 3D bow. Nail glue can also be found at

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.130
your local drugstore and it will have your
bow staying on all week. Just add a small

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.910
drop to your nail and then press your bow
onto the glue and give it a couple minutes

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.030
to dry.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.250
Also, I've placed a link in the description
box below to these 3D bows in case you'd like

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.760
to get the exact same ones that I did.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.910
If you give this nail art design a try, then please
share your recreation with me on Facebook,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.279
Twitter, and Instagram using the hashtag #cutepolish.
Take care and I'll seeya next time!
