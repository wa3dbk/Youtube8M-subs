&gt;&gt;Dr. Ketchum: In this segment of the female
reproductive system we’re going to be discussing

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.740
the ova and its development. What we’re
going to be discussing when we talk about

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.780
egg development, we’re really talking about
oogenesis. So oogenesis is the development

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.010
or the production of the ovum, okay, which
is the gamete for the fem—for females.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.700
All right, now oogenesis actually occurs in three
different phases. There’s the fetal phase

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.570
of oogenesis, there’s prior to ovulation,
which occurs at puberty—so this is what

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.960
starts at puberty—and then there’s the
third phase called after fertilization. So

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.150
we’re going to work our way through each
one of these phases. So we’re going to start

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.690
off with the oogonia in fetal development.
The oogonia is diploid, it’s two n, and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.239
this is considered the germ cell in the female
reproductive tract. So the oogonia undergoes

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.489
mitosis during fetal development, and remember
that the oogonia are fixed. The number of

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.810
those are fixed. And so once the oogonia undergo
mitosis, then some of these will actually

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.200
begin meiosis. So meiosis begins during fetal
development. Meiosis may begin but it does

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.800
not—it’s not completed during fetal development.
It is only beginning. So during fetal development

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:31.000
the primary oocyte is produced, and that’s
produced through meiosis. And then that primary

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.340
oocyte is going to do what’s called a mitotic
arrest. So the baby has been born; the baby

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.250
now reaches puberty. At puberty, meiosis I
is completed. Now let’s think about this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.140
for a minute.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.689
Okay, when I say meiosis I is completed, what
we’re saying is that at puberty one primary

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.900
oocyte per month completes meiosis I. So when
meiosis I is completed, a secondary oocyte

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.479
(which if you notice is haploid) and a polar
body. Polar bodies disintegrate, so we won’t

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.549
worry about polar bodies. They’re not important.
The secondary oocyte is what leaves the ovary

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.040
and enters into the uterine tube. So when
the secondary oocyte gets into the uterine

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.099
tube, one of two things can happen. Fertilization
could occur, considering there’s sperm in

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.849
the uterine tube, or fertilization might not
happen. If no fertilization occurs, then the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.049
secondary oocyte will continue to pass through
the rest of the uterine tube, through the uterus

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:44.400
and out the body. If fertilization does take
place, now meiosis II occurs. And once meiosis

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.100
II occurs then we’re going to produce an
ovum, and we get a second polar body as well.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.999
Polar bodies, remember, disintegrate—so
we won’t worry about those. On the oogenesis

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:03.700
diagram then, this last path or phase is after
fertilization.
