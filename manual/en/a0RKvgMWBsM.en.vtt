Hello everyone, this is Vector

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.169
and I have to say

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.409
really really clever.

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.160
OK, it's an endless runner style game

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.390
and it's kind of like Mirror's Edge, if you remember that title from Electronic Arts

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.980
that was big on the consoles.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.320
Fantastic concept game that kind of didn't sell particularly well I don't think.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.579
Vector kind of takes the game idea of parkour free running across this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.270
cityscape and takes it to a slightly new level. It is a 2D sideways scroller so unlike Mirror's Edge

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.440
which was very much

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.170
about the three dimensions.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.000
This though has something Mirror's Edge
doesn't have...

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.450
really good gameplay.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.540
So the idea is you are running away
from a bloke who is chasing you and you have to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.680
complete each level without the guy who's chasing you being able to overtake you.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.290
You'll have to leap, jump,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.460
avoid,you name it. So here's me and here's me running and you can see the animations are 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.020
absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately I've dropped on  to the first level again. My bad.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.310
The idea is you have to time all of your various jumps

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.549
swiping up at the right moment to claim the environment

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.820
and obviously staying away from this guy that's chasing after us. You have to slide,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.190
jump over objects climb walls you name
it basically. If it's involved in parkour

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.190
you have to do it here. But one thing I found really really good about this, is how

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.660
smooth the animations are for the character.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.340
They are absolutely exceptional and obviously a lot of work appears to have gone into 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.340
getting animations looking really authentic.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.060
Loads and loads and loads of levels
available in this game, this is just the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.060
first level. Gives you a sense of what you're 
kind of going for.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.350
And actually as you kind of 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.370
acquire money in the game

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.060
and points you can then unlock additional moves and I think there's about 30 odd

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.229
different moves in total by the time you complete the game.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.390
Really really exceptional, so here we go.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.009
That's the level completed.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.599
Things obviously get a lot more difficult
as things go along but as a game

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.299
concept goes, as

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.989
the art style the gameplay, this one's an absolute cracker and certainly well worth 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.049
picking up off  the Google Play Store now.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.069
This is Vector.
