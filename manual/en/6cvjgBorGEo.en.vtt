00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.080
It is your fourth time of

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.220
Filming The ICONtv

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.760
Aren’t you used to it by now?

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.680
I think it is a lie

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.380
If I say I don't get nervous

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.180
When I film this

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.060
I look really calm

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.060
But I just pretend to be

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.080
To be honest...

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.680
I'm super nervous!

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.080
People loved Beyond Closet

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.520
So much in 2014

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.640
So for the first time

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.280
We are opening an event

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.960
With Optical W

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.340
Who are really close to us

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.280
To have party

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.520
And to hang out among ourselves

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.320
And we will hold

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.320
A mini fashion show

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.380
For this event

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.980
So who are coming to this event?

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.880
The people who loved Beyond Closet!

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.840
Whoever that says the name of the brand at the entrance can come in!

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.840
We recently met Pil-soo

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.280
And he told us that

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.940
He doesn't like people saying that he looks like you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.940
I love sunglasses

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.960
But the reason I can’t wear it is…

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.380
People keep telling me that I look like the designer Tae-yong Koh

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.260
When I wear sunglasses…

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.720
I guess you don’t like

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.540
People saying that?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.520
I do like…

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.940
Actually I don't!

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.360
We are not alike!

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.360
Should I put on a pair for comparison?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.360
When I was his age,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.180
People passing by asked me

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.160
“What is your job?”

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.520
LOL Don't lie!

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.220
I get really mad!

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.280
When I hear those things…

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.860
I heard you will be DJing as well!

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.960
Because fashion and music

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.360
Are inseparable

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.180
So I am going to show all I'm capable of!

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.260
Where was it again?

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.960
Daelim Contemporary Art Museum?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.580
When we had our last party

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.020
We had so much fun!

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.100
When we turned on the music at Daelim Contemporary Art Museum

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.640
A police came!

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.500
It was the best!

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440
Will today's party be more lit?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.780
Since the venue for the last party was a museum...

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.680
The venue doesn't matter

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.620
I can party in a bathroom if I want to...

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.980
Hello?

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.880
Honey Butter Chip!

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.200
I love this!

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.820
Actually Woo-jae and Ji-hoon

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.320
Couldn't work together for this Seoul Fashion Week

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.820
Because…

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.080
I had prepared a show with a young, youthful theme

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.380
But I thought

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.620
Woo-jae and Ji-hoon looked a bit mature

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.860
But the clothes actually look good on them!

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.580
I should have made you do the runway…

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.780
Designer Tae-yong Koh

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.460
Has an ability

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.260
To make people feel good!

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.160
What are you saying?

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.640
For the next Seoul Fashion Week

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.420
That I am preparing

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.880
I can’t use the models with youthful atmosphere!

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.980
What have you been up to

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.960
Since the Seoul Fashion Week?

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.760
I worked

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.580
Actually I am always like that

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.180
After New York Fashion Week

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.760
I prepare for Seoul Fashion Week

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.360
And after that

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.940
Is another New York Fashion Week

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.440
And after that

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.160
I work on Seoul Fashion Week again

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.080
That means the New York Fashion Week is coming soon!

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.180
Yes! I have so much to do!

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.980
The final products should be out in less than a month and a half!

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.680
I think I know why you’re saying you’re busy

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.000
Actually I love

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.480
How I am so busy

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.080
Because…

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.120
When I look around

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.720
Some of my friends are going through some rough times

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.660
And some friends

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.860
Still have doubts in this industry

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.940
But I still haven't

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.720
Felt any of that

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.800
So what is your plan for this year?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.080
I think I will have a collection

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.380
In New York and Seoul

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.680
As a designer who represents Korea

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.860
And I want to show you

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.960
How I still care about designs

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.140
Whilst working on various things

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.020
To communicate with the public

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.680
The goal for 2015 is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.160
To meet the public

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.780
Whilst showing

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.380
How Beyond Closet grows globally!
