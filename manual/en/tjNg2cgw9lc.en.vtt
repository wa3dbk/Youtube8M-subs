(Music)

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.500
Welcome to Portrait in a Minute. Today,
we're at an offsite National Portrait Gallery storage facility.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.300
Behind me is a portrait of Elaine de Kooning by Elaine de Kooning.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.000
Elaine de Kooning is generally
characterized as an abstract expressionist

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.820
this work, her self-portrait in the
National Portrait Gallery collection

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.500
is a figurative work and leans more on
de Kooning's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.879
early training and her experiments as a
social realist

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.500
a brief visual analysis of this portrait depicts a handsome woman with

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.969
shoulder-length hair

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.000
wearing a large sweater, reading a book

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.670
in this room of artfully created objects a
weaving of some sort,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.500
a couple of photos, and some small pieces of sculpture.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.800
At her feet are what appear to be a
coffee cup and an ashtray.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.280
The overall palette

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.080
for this work is very earthy and the
subject's features

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.000
her hair and the wall behind her in soft
browns and tans.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.010
There are one or two
exceptions, the chief one

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.000
being the pink table behind her. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.369
The medium for this work is oil on masonite and it was created in 1946.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.200
Though this is an example of Elaine de Kooning's unevolved style in only a few years,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.630
remember this work is from 1946, she will

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.740
fully embrace a more abstract
portraiture,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.390
an example of which we see in her large
composition of President John F Kennedy

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.500
from a series of sittings with him in late 1962 going into 1963. 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.000
This work shows a much brighter palette and a much broader stroke

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.130
however, it captures a sincerity

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.210
an emotive intensity that is equal to

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.729
if not greater than her previous work
and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.100
it is in this more abstract way that de
Kooning

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.119
created her greatest works in
portraiture.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.119
This has been Portrait in a Minute.
