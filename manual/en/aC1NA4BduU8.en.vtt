Hello! and welcome to episode 2

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
This time we will talk about light

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.960
In the last episode we talked about cameras we recommend

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.720
And this depended a lot on the lighting

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.100
Even web cameras work well with a lot of light

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.980
That's right

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.080
Also this time we parted the video in three levels

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.420
Simple, medium and professional

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.080
We start with simple

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.880
Ok, Lene

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.567
As you can see, it it pretty dark in here

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.300
So the first thing we need to do is to add more light

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.600
The easiest is to use daylight

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.380
Find the closest window

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.514
And sit down in front of it

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.560
If it is cloudy

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.700
You will get a nice, soft light on your face

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.460
If there is direct sunlight

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.260
Use the curtains to soften the light

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.280
Anyways, it is simple and free

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.840
If you do not want to be dependent on sunlight

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.260
you need to find other solutions

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.640
For instance, you can use lamps you have at home

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.500
Find a lamp, like an office lamp

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.400
Place it in front of you

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.500
On an slight angle

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:08.899
Place it a bit higher

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.080
And point the light towards you

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.480
There you go 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.200
What can happen when you have a type of lamp like this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.820
You can get quite harsh shadows on your face

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.520
Therefore it is smart to use a bit of parchment paper

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.180
To soften the light

00:01:21.338 --> 00:01:23.338
Find a piece of parchment paper

00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:25.474
A small clamp, or a clothespin

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.340
Fasten it in front of your lamp

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.280
Now you will see that the light is softer 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.458
And there are not as many harsh shadows

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.374
The only problem is that it will steal some of the light

00:01:33.374 --> 00:01:35.100
So make sure that the bulb is bright enough

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.900
If you use a very bright bulb

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.594
The lamp can get so warm

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:42.934
That the parchment paper will catch on fire

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:44.913
So make sure that it does not get too warm

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.300
A solution to this can be to fasten the parchment paper

00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:49.914
On a seperate tripod, a bit away from the lamp

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.240
I have experienced that the light somtimes starts to flikker

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.435
How can you fix that?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.860
You can fix it by using a halogen bulb 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.900
which will give you orange light

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.160
This will most likely not start to flikker

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.854
This is a energy-saving light bulb

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.740
There is a higher chance of flikkering if you use one of these

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.980
This is also the case for fluorescent lamps

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.220
You can compensate

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.120
By adjusting the shutter speed on your camera

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.954
It looks like this

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.400
If you want to experiment with lighting

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.213
to make it look even better

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.860
You can use more lamps at the same time

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.560
First off

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.760
In addition to the lamp  with the parchment paper

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.240
You can add a backlight

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.760
This will give you a nice glow around your head and hair

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.960
This is the so called "Hollywood-look"

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.460
You do not need to add parchment paper to the lamp behind you

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.160
And if you want it to show in the shot or not

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.480
That is entirely up to you

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.480
If you feel that there is too much shadow on one side of your face

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.260
You can even this out by using a piece of aluminium foil

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.320
Put it on an angle so that the light is reflected towards your face

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.600
So be creative and experiment

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.228
so that you get the look you want

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:08.120
How cool!

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.714
So now we can just start to film?

00:03:09.714 --> 00:03:11.394
There is one more important thing we need

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.020
Oh! The sound!

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.680
That is right

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.020
That is what we are going to talk about in the next episode

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.720

Later Lene, you need to become a bit better first

00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:32.287
OK, I understand
