00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.250
There's a couple of different kinds of lenses
out there.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.570
The two specific distinctions are zoom lenses
and prime lenses.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.869
The difference between them is really simple.

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.609
Prime lens is just one focal length.

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.739
In this lens's case this is an 85mm portrait
lens.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.480
This is a zoom lens and its focal length is
70-200.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.070
Within this lens is the same focal length
as this lens.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.170
So why would you ever use this lens when you
can use this lens?

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.050
And the answer is pretty simple.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.450
It's just a matter of preference.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.030
This is obviously a much bigger lens.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.070
There's more to carry around.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.969
This is a lot more small and compact.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.970
Now a lot of professional photographers actually
choose to use prime lenses for a couple of

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.039
different reasons.

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.070
One is just one focal length that you kind
of get accustomed to.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.699
You become really comfortable with.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.179
But another reason is that prime lenses tend
to be a lot sharper than zooming lenses.

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.870
And that reason is because there are no moving
parts other than the focus.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.860
So you can get more glass and it gives you
better overall image quality.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.590
However, if I was shooting something like
say a basketball game, this really wouldn't

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.590
be a very good option.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.520
I would want to bring in this guy instead.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.400
Players running up and down the court, you
want to be able to zoom in and zoom out with

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.630
them, and get them in the center of the frame.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.380
A lot of old school photographers coming from
the film age also swear by prime lenses.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.060
A lot of these really famous Magnum photographers,
guys who are known Rangefinders, like Leica's

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.970
all swear by primes.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.770
Just because again it makes it a little bit
more of an art.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.880
You're moving your body around instead of
moving your lens around so you're actually

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.470
physically seeing things differently.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.860
Rather than standing there and zooming in
and zooming out.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.190
Personally I'm a prime lens shooter.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.130
I like the focal length 85, which is this,
and 24mm.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.190
I do also on occasions bust out a zoom lens.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.950
Another important thing to keep in mind when
looking to purchase either a prime or a zoom

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.450
is prime lenses will always be a fixed maximum
aperture.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.750
The aperture being the opening in the lens
that lets light into the camera.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.890
A larger maximum aperture, which is actually
a lower number, this one is a 1.8, means you're

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.300
going to be able to shoot better in low light.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.030
Primes generally tend to have a higher, in
reality lower, maximum aperture.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.730
Something like 1.4, 1.8, 2.8, those are really
good maximum apertures.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.640
This is a 2.8, where this is a 1.8.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.670
So this will do better in low light.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.690
But this is also a very good lens because
it's a fixed 2.8 from 70 all the way to 200.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.830
However, as you get cheaper lenses or more
affordable lenses, a lot of times that low

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.510
maximum aperture will actually jump up as
you zoom in.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.580
So it's not uncommon to see something like
a 70-200 like this, that instead of being

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.260
a 70-200 2.8, it will be a 70-200 3.5-5.6.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.710
Which physically means that that maximum aperture
is getting smaller and smaller as you zoom

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.710
in.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.490
Not super great for low light.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.700
For that reason, zoom lenses can be a lot
more expensive and do a lot worse in low light

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.700
situations.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.870
You also have to keep in mind that there are
a lot more moving parts on a lens like this

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.280
than on a lens like this because there is
nothing zooming here.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.810
In addition most prime lenses don't have things
like image stabilization that you'll find

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.920
with lenses like this.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.849
This is specifically made for sports photography.

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.849
So it has optical image stabilization.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:47.860
This does not.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.630
Again it depends on your subject and it depends
on your matter of preference and it depends

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.260
really on your pocket book.
