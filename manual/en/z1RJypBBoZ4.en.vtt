00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.120
Hello, this is Damion Rutherford with Truck-Tool-Box.com,
your

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.470
"made in the usa" source for aluminum pickup
truck toolboxes.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.720
Today, we're going to review the HD series
truck bed toolbox.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.740
The HD Series tool box is designed for heavy
duty, industrial use.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.540
It's the perfect solution for service trucks,
property maintenance trucks,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.520
tradesmen, contractors, and superintendents
to transport and store

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.970
valuable tools and equipment.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.120
Does this look familiar?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.620
reaching into truck, digging through a box
to get to your tools?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.870
or having to climb into the truck, then jump
down, over and over again?

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.440
Ever have a sore back or knees at the end
of the day?

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.570
...Or even worse, at the beginning?

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.750
You can avoid these problems with the HD Series
Truck Tool Box!

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.549
The toolbox drawers roll out easily, putting
everything you need

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.300
right in front of you, at belt height.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.010
No more jumping in and out of your truck bed
carrying heavy tools,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.350
which can easily lead to knee and back injuries.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.030
No more leaning or crawling into your truck
bed to get your tools.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.900
Just pull the toolbox drawer out, and it's
right ther in front of you.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.920
Best of all, you won't have to dig through
your toolbox.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.190
All of your belongings will be easily found
with the organized

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.990
drawers and dividers.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.740
The HD Series Truck Tool Box comes with several
other benefits

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.390
that you're going to love.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.479
First of all, Security.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.590
The "T" handle latch system on the HD series
toolbox compresses

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.890
into the drawer for a tight fit. The lock
in the handle keeps your

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.651
equipment secure, and let's you padlock the
"T" handle latch in

00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:02.880
the closed position. Never again will you
have to worry about tool theft.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.510
Burglers can't even access the handle!

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.229
Full Bed usage

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.620
The height of the HD series truck bed toolbox
is designed

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.370
to create a full deck above the wheel wells.
This gives you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.269
more space for storage across the entire width
of your truck bed.

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.689
Durable &amp; Tough

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.629
This F150 work truck is loaded with 2200 pounds
of weight.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.980
These truck toolboxes are designed to be used,
and are made to last.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.200
We back that up with our exclusive 3 year
warranty on the locks,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.810
rollers, and all moving parts!

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.329
