Hello, welcome to V.Point. Today we're talking
about this week's most popular article - romance

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.000
between two Harry Potter stars.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.260
I won V.Point this week with a story about
Luna Lovegood going out with Harry Potter's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.180
father in real life. So that got us thinking
about other relationships that should have

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.400
happened in Harry Potter.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.460
I'm shipping Crabbe and Goyle because they
already have a very close relationship, probably

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.130
a bit of sexual tension going on there. They're
really close, and you know, they obviously

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.340
have quite a lot in common. A lot of people
say that you end up dating someone that looks

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.720
like you. They'd probably make quite a nice
couple and can live happily, evilly after.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.940
Dolores Umbridge and Argus Filch the caretaker
because I think in years to come, when they're

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.010
both very senior, they'll just be one of those
amazing OAP couples who you invite to dinner,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.500
and they just sit there and bicker.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.600
Oh dear. We are in trouble.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.200
Filch is very miserable, and Umbridge is
very on it all the time, and I think that

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.260
would be really fun.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.360
Hedwig, which is Harry Potter's owl, and Crookshanks,
which is Hermione Granger's cat. Unlike many

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.710
people who think that Hermione and Harry should
have got together, I don't, but I think that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.130
both of their pets would have some of the
same values.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.240
I would also like to put forward Crookshanks
and Hedwig, but not for the same reasons as

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.450
Kate. I'd like to switch it up and make it
a threesome. I'd like to add on Nagini, Voldemort's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.000
snake. The three of them of them all have
something in common, and that is that they

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.340
like to eat rodents. Food is a big factor
in bringing people together. I know if my

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.670
husband didn't like spicy food, it'd be over.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.610
Bellatrix LeStrange and Cedric Diggory. Bellatrix
takes like goody two shoes Cedric off the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.620
tracks, and I've always kind of had a thing
for Bellatrix in like a freaked out, I love

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.400
you way, and I think Cedric would fall under
the same spell.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.280
Mine is actually Luna and Seamus because they're
both Irish, and I think they would match really

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.920
well together and gel, and they'd just have
an amazing relationship.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.480
Sirius Black and Harry Potter's mum, throwing
in some intrigue about who might be Harry

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.140
Potter's dad I think would be very interesting.
From what I remember of Harry Potter's dad,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.290
they look so alike that it'd be kind of unlikely,
but there's a bit of a rebellious streak that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.450
Sirius Black had and Harry as well, so you
know, who knows?

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.440
Rita Skeeter and Lucius Malfoy for my second
couple. They both are platinum blonde, which

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.830
is already a talking point. They've already
got that in common. They can share hair dye,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.650
and they're both really evil. Yeah, they're
both quite hot as well.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.690
I would like to officially formally ship #Dumblesnape
because we already know that Dumbledore is

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.550
gay, as JK Rowling has said, and Snape and
his relationship is very dark, it's very twisted

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.080
and passionate, I'm going to say. I know Dumbledore
and Snape are both technically dead, but I

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.800
don't see why that should be a problem.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.640
Turn to page 394.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.920
Dumbledore and Hagrid because Hagrid's kind
of your salt of the earth, rough and ready

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.940
gardener type, and Dumbledore is your big,
powerful, control the world if he wanted to wizard.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.420
You're a wizard, Harry.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.800
The elite with the down to earth chap from
down the end of the garden.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.940
Hagrid and Professor McGonagall because I
think they'd just get down and dirty and rough

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.680
and be at it like animals. It would be hilarious
to see McGonagall, who is quite strict and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.120
straight in the movies, to just be flung into
the air and just thrown all about the place.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.040
I think she'd enjoy it.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.460
Voldemort and Bellatrix LeStrange. It's no
secret that Bellatrix is in love with Voldemort.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.140
She will do anything for that man, but obviously
Voldemort's just not interested. He's just

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.690
into taking over the world, but I think if
he had let Bellatrix in, maybe he would have

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.660
ended up a nicer guy. Everyone could have
just gotten along and did their wizarding

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.069
thing. I think if there was a bit of a hook
up, he'd be less sexually frustrated, a little

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.830
less angry.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.190
Bring him to me.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.800
Lucius Malfoy and Dobby because Dobby's all
sort of little and gets bullied and stuff,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.510
but really they get into the bedroom and Dobby
would be mean and Lucius would be like a little

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.010
wallflower and Dobby gets his chance to dominate.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.860
Dobby and Voldemort. Dobby was born into a
life of servitude, but I think there's part

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.739
of him that loves doing that. Voldemort loves
being in control. I think the idea of Dobby

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.740
and Voldemort and a Fifty Shades of Grey spin-off
meets Harry Potter could make so much money.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.640
I think it's just a slam dunk basically.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.320
