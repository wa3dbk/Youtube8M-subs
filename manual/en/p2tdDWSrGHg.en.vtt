00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.160
Persona 4 Arena has fast rocketed to the upper
levels of fighting game fame.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.710
Folks were clamoring for its release, eagerly
anticipating a blend of Atlus RPG drama and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.570
Arc System Works fighting fundamentals.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.250
World Heroes... not so much.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.230
Sure, it got bonus points from me when I covered
the PSP port of the original - mostly due

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.960
to the sheer novelty of a robotic nazi combatant.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.620
Well, World Heroes 2 ups the ante, with six
new fighters, including... a football player?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.620
This is what we get.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.780
A football player.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.480
Fighting style: QUARTERBACK.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.760
Trust me, I’ve watched Roethlisberger throughout
his entire career, and QUARTERBACKS ARE NOT

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.850
THAT BEEFY.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.440
Besides, his eyes glow red underneath that
helmet.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.190
That’s gotta be James Harrison under there.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.170
Anyway.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.869
It’s your bog-standard fighting game, yet
another offshoot brawler made for Neo-Geo

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.740
arcade hardware in the ‘90s... and then
ported to whatever could possibly run it.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.560
You pick a fighter, you battle a slew of other
fighters, there’s a boss battle at the end,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.979
another boss battle after that... and then
he falls down.

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.130
Woo doggie.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.380
Even as a fighting game, it’s very much
on the simple end of things: you’ve got

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.530
one button to punch, one button to kick, and
one button to throw (or taunt, at extreme

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.530
range).

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.320
That said, you’ve still got a healthy lineup
of special attacks, though combo potential

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.480
is quite limited.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.189
Also, and this is among the stranger of the
game’s quirks: Many projectiles auto-reflect

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.520
on a block, which is just plain-out strange.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.990
Not really game-breaking, mind, at least not
as game-breaking as being able to spam command

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.890
grabs in the corner ad nauseum.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.240
To this end, there are counter-throws as well,
luckily.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.840
There’s also a deathmatch mode, which introduces
environmental hazards and would immediately

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.690
be laughed down the street for same, because
NO ITEMS FINAL DESTINATION.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.090
That is, if anyone really cared about World
Heroes.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.900
While the characters are kinda interesting,
be they expies of Ghengis Khan or Joan of

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.050
Arc, this is a game that was released side
by side with King of Fighters, Fatal Fury,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.459
Art of Fighting, Samurai Showdown, Mortal
Kombat II, Street Fighter II...

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.030
There was a glut of fighters in the early
‘90s, and not all of them could be top-tier.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.489
World Heroes, while innovative, just couldn’t
hold its own against such fierce competition.

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.580
Look on the bright side: At least it didn’t
get turned into Street Combat.
