00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:06.479
Alright, so you've got your flash card installed
in your camera, you've got your battery, and

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.950
now you need to take some pictures. Before
you do that, you need to put your lens on

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:21.390
your camera. So with the 40D, you have a cap
over the body of the camera, protecting the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.070
sensor and the shutter, from any light or
dust. You should keep this cap on the camera,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.280
anytime there's not a lens on the camera,
to protect it from getting dust in there,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.070
or anything else that might damage your sensor
or lens or mirror. So, to take this thing

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.770
off, what we're going to do is, there's a
button on the left side of the camera, if

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.820
you're facing the back of the camera. It's
going to be on the left side. And, what you're

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:02.090
going to do is press that down, and then twist
the cap off. It should just come right off.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:21.329
And what I've got here is a Canon 35mm, 1.4
aperture, fixed focal length L lens. Any Canon

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:32.009
EFS lens, there is a white dot on the body
of the Canon, where those lenses will need

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.510
to line up. But, any Canon EFS, any Canon
lens that is not an EFS lens, will have a

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.850
red dot instead. In this case, I have an L
lens, which has a red dot on the lens, and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.360
there's a red dot on the body. And those two
dots should line up when you put the lens

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.110
on the body, and then you can twist the lens
on. In this case, I'm going to be twisting

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.840
it, twisting the camera on, the lens onto
the camera clockwise. So, what I'm going to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:17.500
do is line up those two red dots, and then
twist the lens, until it stops. And you don't

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.490
need to press hard, it should slide in there
pretty easily. Once the lens stops, it's locked

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.660
in there, and you can't twist it any way.
It's just, it's there. If you want to take

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.580
the lens off, again, what you're going to
need to do is, press that lens lock release

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.020
over here on the, on this side of the camera.
And what you're going to do is press that

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.510
down, and then just twist the lens off counter-clockwise.
It should come off pretty easily. But, like

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.730
I said, you don't want to leave that exposed
for very long, so, either keep a cap on the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.730
body or a lens on the body. A lot of people
like to keep their lenses stored in a case

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.110
to protect them, instead of leaving them on
their camera body, because they're expensive.
