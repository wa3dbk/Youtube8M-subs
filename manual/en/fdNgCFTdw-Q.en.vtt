As program director,

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:17.109
I invite you to explore the Doctor of
Physical Therapy Program at Radford

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.980
University. The profession of physical
therapy

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.430
is an exciting and growing profession.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.329
There are a wide number and diverse
opportunities for employment,

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.890
from hospitals,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.789
to skilled nursing facilities,

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.559
school systems,

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:32.580
sports,

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.730
and for those who are entrepreneurial in
nature, you can start your own private

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.630
practice. Being a physical therapist, you
can have a positive effect on people's

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.750
lives on a daily basis,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.570
and the demand for physical therapists
outweighs the supply.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.440
It is a goal of the DPT program at
Radford to graduate physical therapists

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.750
to meet the needs and demands

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.760
of Western Virginia

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.310
and the region.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.800
So come and explore the Doctor of
Physical Therapy program at the Roanoke

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.360
campus, located in the Carilion
Community Hospital building, or check out

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.360
the program's website.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.620
I was always very involved with
athletics growing up. I even played at

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.510
Radford. And for me, with injuries I'd had
had and that teammates had, I'd seen how physical

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.590
therapy had changed their lives.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.820
And then you want to make sure you make contact before you start the machine...

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.070
We're getting a doctorate degree here at Radford,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.880
and it's a lot more than I think
just a normal, typical degree would be

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.670
post-college. We have to do a lot more. There is a lot of research-based 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.530
items and a lot more projects. Our
course load is very heavy,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.160
but to walk out of it with a doctorate is just
so worth it to me. You can walk

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.610
out into the field and you really do know
that you've gotten the best education

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.180
you could get, and you can give the best treatment to your patients.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.280
Slide it down,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.050
off this way...

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.310
The program

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.880
is based on the APTA vision for our
profession.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.170
That's to create autonomous, professionals who can

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.740
be active in the community and be focused
on treating the patient for their

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.550
individual needs. 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.150
By, again, building up
the receptor component of...

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.559
One of the greatest factors for our
program

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.499
is we have a very low student to faculty ratio,

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:18.870
so we can give them

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.630
more direct hands-on direction or
experience. Also, the faculty is quite

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.680
knowledgeable in

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.340
clinical practice and in research exposure

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.559
to give them the state-of-the-art techniques and
procedures that are out there.

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:35.429
When you start putting up your scenarios for what you might hear in the history 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:37.270
compared to the pathology...

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.400
Dr. Harper comes into our program with a lot of clinical knowledge

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.999
base as well as a lot of research knowledge.

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.599
He's very willing to stay with us after
class, during his lunch break, to make sure that we

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.739
really understand the techniques that we
are learning.

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.569
Classes are always very hands-on, making
sure that we see the practice, we try to

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.969
do the practice and then we teach it to
the rest of the class to make sure that we really do

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.400
understand what we're learning. When we get into a clinic, we can be seen as 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.899
confident physical therapists.

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:06.139
With my advanced degree, I plan on going right into
the field after I graduate.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.639
I would really like to be involved in an
outpatient sports clinic,

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.089
in which I can help others just like me get
back into their sports and really focus

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:14.299
on the whole

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.359
athlete side of physical therapy, the whole body, not just focusing on an injury.

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.539
I love physical therapy, because in this
field you can take what you've learned

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.290
through your advanced degrees and you can really apply it to peoples everyday lives.
