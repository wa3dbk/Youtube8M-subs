Hi guys, this is Make Me Up on Beauty Base.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.609
I'm makeup artist Lilly Keys, and I don't
know if you can guess, bur we're doing something

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:07.990
crazy today.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.230
Maybe something to do with Lady Gaga.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.620
That's right, her Applause music video.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:24.990
[music]
Okay, so with the skin moisturized and cleansed,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.570
I'm now going to start on the makeup, and
I'm going to be using this white color wash.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.570
It's by Snazeroo.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.800
You can get this from any store that sells
specialist makeup, or even joke or fancy dress

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.820
stores.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.290
So I'm basically just going to put my brush
in it like this.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.540
I want it to be dry, although you can mix
water with this to make it go a bit heavier.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.870
But we're just going to have a really subtle
white wash on the face, and really going to

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.210
concentrate it around the middle.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.220
Don't want to completely cover the face because
it might make her look a bit flat.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.549
So from the center of the face outwards we're
just blending, blending, blending, and I'm

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.020
going over the eyebrows as well because Gaga
does have white brushed eyebrows in this look.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.750
So I'm now going to take a disposable mascara
wand, and with a drop of water I'm just going

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:31.159
to mix it in this white pallet and I'm going
to go over the eyebrows.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:41.310
So as I've made a mistake, I'm just going
to clean up with a cotton bud underneath,

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.960
anywhere where it's gone on the skin.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.329
Okay, so for the mascara I'm using this one
by Eyeko.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.820
It's Black Magic Drama and Curl, and it's
got a really nice curved brush.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.850
So we're just going to be going over, just
going to be getting that into the roots, just

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.590
a nice couple of coats of mascara.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.100
Nothing too crazy.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.250
And the bottom lashes as well.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.650
For the eyeliner I'm using this liquid liner
by Topshop, and it's in Nightfall, which is

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.670
kind of like a navy color.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.531
Have to be really careful with this but look
how gorgeous this color is.

00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:27.350
This is absolutely perfect for this Lady Gaga
look.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.720
So what I'm doing is just do a lovely flick
on the top lid only.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.610
Lady Gaga's look isn't very precise or neat,
but I am doing quite a precise eye line because

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.640
we're going to go crazy on the paint colors.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.680
So for the paint pallet effect that Gaga has
all over her face, I'm going to be using this

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.200
pallet from Kryolan.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:58.170
It's called Super Color and it has these primary
colors and some brown grease paint in it.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.900
So what I'm going to do first is the blue.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.780
I'm going to go for a light blue first.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.210
Just going to be taking this brush from MAC,
and you kind of have to feel like you're painting

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.360
an abstract painting, so every one of you
that tries this at home can do something different.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.950
It hasn't got to be a precise science.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.370
So we don't want to be too crazy.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.260
I'm just kind of going to go with what I'm
feeling.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.730
I'm using kind of in between dabbing and feathery
strokes because I want it to look not too

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.730
stylized.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.070
It's a bit of a strange on, this, but really
fun to do.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.650
So next what I'm going to do, because I don't
have a navy blue in this pallet, I'm going

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.600
to mix this light blue with this grey.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.360
Doesn't really matter what colors you use.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.450
You could just go crazy.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.690
And I'm going to kind of splodge it onto the
side here for kind of a different effect.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.860
I'm kind of feathering it out slightly at
the edges so it's not too precise.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.960
Still with the blue on my brush, I'm now going
to go for the green, and I'm going to take

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.510
the green right on the cheek here.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:22.389
And you really want to make the colors super
bright.

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:30.490
Okay, so I'm now going to mix this light blue
with a white on my pallet here, just to give

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.910
it a paler blue for this side.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.240
I'm just going to take it across the lid a
bit more.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.319
And now I'm going to be taking the same blue,
but I'm going to mix it with black to get

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:51.240
a dark, dark blue effect.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.360
And I'm going to put this right in the eyebrow.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.529
Now I'm going to take this yellow color, really
saturate my brush, and on this side I'm going

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:13.199
to do a nice yellow splodge right here.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.810
With the yellow still on my brush, I'm going
to go into the red because I want to get an

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.419
orangey effect.

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:34.620
I'm now going to go more into my red, really
saturate the brush with the red, and I'm going

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.620
to go right under here.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.680
I'm also going to do red lips with this look,
but I really want the smudge of red lips as

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.389
well, so I am actually, still with the grease
paint, going to do this, and then we're just

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:51.529
going to smudge this whole lip out.

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:53.699
You can use your fingers as well, just to
get the really cool smudge effect.

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:03.440
So with the smaller brush, the cream shadow
brush, I'm going to be going into my white

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.559
again, and I'm just going to be putting some
white highlights, just like a little speck.

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:14.830
You can always mush this in with your finger.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.699
For the lipstick, I'm going to be using this
one from my pallet.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.199
It's called Rich Red and it's by MAC.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.849
So we want to get a real pillar box red for
this look.

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:35.090
Let me saturate my lip brush, and we're just
going to get some really glossy red on these

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.090
lips.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.639
Now Gaga hasn't done her lips perfectly at
all in this look, because that's the whole

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.639
look.

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.199
It's just, you know, she's just kind of whacked
it on.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.639
But I am going to do a little bit of a, you
know, precise line, not being too precise,

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.159
but I don't want it to look too Jokeresque.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:07:01.639
So we're going to be following the lip line
with the brush.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.610
I hope you guys had fun following this video
and trying to recreate this crazy look of

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.979
Lady Gaga's.

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.639
