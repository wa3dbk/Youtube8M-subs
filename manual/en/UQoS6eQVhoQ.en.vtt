00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.790
Hey, is that-
Yeah, that's the 3 day PAX pass ticket I won.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.879
Far out man, you're so lucky. Wait, didn't
you have to draw a picture of League or something

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.420
about it?
Yeah.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.870
Can I see it?
Sure.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:27.870
That's it? That's the picture. You just out your face on Draven's body. That's disgusting.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.300
You won a 3 day PAX pass for that?
Well yeah.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.000
Far out man, I quit.
What do you quit?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I quit life. Roll the video!

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.979
Ziggurat is an fps dungeon crawler with both
an old school feel and philosophy. There are

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.539
some rogue-lite elements such as perks and
procedurally generated areas, but the focus

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.860
of the game and its difficulty stems from
your skill in combat. You have to dodge volleys

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.460
of enemy fire with twitch reflexes and have
the special awareness to detect threats from

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.000
all angles. Throw in a frenetic and propelling
pace and you get a neat package. Ziggurat

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is a treat for gaming purists and fans of
classic shooters like Heretic.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.219
Journey to a mysterious island, for the Legend
of Grimrock has returned and defeated the

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.619
curse of the sequel. Legend of Grimrock 2
is bigger and better than its predecessor,

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.020
but retains the same premise; an old-school
grid based RPG with a modern aesthetic that

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.359
favours the thinking player. There are puzzles
that will test the most adept of minds, and

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.280
so many secrets that a second playthrough
wouldn't uncover them all. Even the combat

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.920
is an art of the mind; revolving around tact
and fast decisions. Grimrock is also a dungeon

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.500
crawler, with vast caverns to explore and
many fierce enemies to encounter. This is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.000
a proven series that is only improved upon
by this sequel.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.020
Screencheat is a Melbourne project that's
making cheating ok and that has one hell of

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.510
a creation story. During this year's Global
Game Jam, the developers found that their

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.540
original game was plagued by screen cheating.
Rather than be deterred they were instead

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.940
inspired to make a game in which you have
to screen cheat to win. This is accomplished

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.690
by making all players invisible, so that the
only way to find your enemies is by screen

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.780
cheating to see where they are on the map.
Screencheat is an ingenious celebration of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.000
a lost art without the scruples.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.400
Freshly graduated from Steam early access,
Dungeon of the Endless is ready to encapsulate

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.700
you in its endless charm. The game is a multiplayer
roguelike with an endless stream of random

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.650
dungeons that creates a suspenseful curiosity
about what's in the next room. Strategy is

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.890
prominent thanks to a successfully implemented
tower defence system, as well as RPG stats

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.980
and upgrades. Fun fact, this is the third
game made by Amlpitude Studios with endless

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.960
in the title. First there was Endless Space,
then Endless Legend and now Dungeon of the

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.590
Endless. It seems they really don't want things
to end, but if they keep making games this

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.400
good neither do we.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.300
The greenlit Door Kickers is a top down RTS in
which you lead a SWAT team through a series

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.790
of raids. Missions consist of you plotting
out the movement of your team, sending them

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.750
in and then making on the fly changes. The
missions can be as quick as a minute, but

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.690
are difficult and often need to be reattempted.
You may have not checked corners, gotten in

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.680
the way of a teammate's line of fire or failed
your specific objective. The objective changes

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.370
with the different scenarios. It may be a
hostage scenario in a small apartment that

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.620
doesn't suit shotguns or a dope raid in which
alerted enemies will destroy evidence. This

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.590
all alludes to the astonishing tactical depth
of the game that can only be appreciated by

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.200
sinking time into it. Door Kickers is great
and the standout pick for this month's best

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.880
indie game. In our opinion of course.
If you're going to PAX Australia this weekend

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.970
we hope you enjoy.
Thanks for watching, my name's Laurence.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.000
And my name's Josh; we'll see you next time
here on Indieformer.
