Hi my name is Marlynn. I'm with Fire
Mountain Gems and Beads, and today

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.019
I would like to teach you
the right angle weave.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.150
To begin the basic stitch,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.720
all you need to do is string

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.180
four beads onto your thread.
Today I'm using Nymo but you

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.710
can also use another stringing
material like Fireline.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.910
Once you have your four
beads on the thread,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.200
just go ahead and tie a basic
knot to secure these four beads.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.000
You want them to stay where they are
so you can work off of this pattern.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.680
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.030
Now, if you'll notice the beads lay

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.940
basically in a square.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.180
We need to work our way to the
other side of this square,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.180
so we are just going to
run our needle and thread

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.400
through two of these beads.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.950
This will set us up for working
along in the basic stitch.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.140
Now, since you have your fourth
bead already on in this pattern,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.840
you are just going to go
ahead and add three more.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.540
You will then pass your needle and
thread

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.540
through that one bead.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.370
When you pull this up forming a loop,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.850
you'll see that your other square

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.500
is attached to the first one.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.550
Now to continue the pattern on,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.550
you need to pass that needle and
thread through two more beads

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.200
and as you can see,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.280
this now forms the square

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.440
and you will just continue
working in that same basic way.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.570
Once you have reached the length of
a bracelet or necklace, whichever

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.780
you have decided to make,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.910
you can also add a second row.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.090
You will work that second row back along

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.389
the first row that you started.

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.779
After you have learned this basic stitch,

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:18.099
then you can embellish them in the
different ways that you see here.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.709
So, this is the right
angle weave stitch and

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.359
I want to thank you very much for coming
to the Fire Mountain Gems and Beads studio.

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.699
Please come back again.
