00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.850
This is our school:
ISIPCA.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.789
This school trains future specialists
in perfemury

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.519
cosmetics and flavouring.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.279
We are Master degree students

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.279
and we have a project!

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.290
Within our class,
we are 20 students in perfumery,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.939
20 in cosmetics
and 20 in food flavouring.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.410
Under this project,
we have two years to create and launch

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.410
a range of three creative and innovative products 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.070
linking our specialized fields.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.100
We are working on creating and producing
a voluptuous perfume,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.860
a sensual cosmetic

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.180
and an irresistible product to taste.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.820
These creations will be gathered
in a presentation case,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.040
final goal of our efforts.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.560
We have already done a large part
of the work, 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.220
we created dynamic workteams,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.400
elaborated a concept,
imagined our own universe,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.750
defined our products.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.070
and then,
we developped these ideas

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.170
formulated the composition of each element.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.070
Made one trial, then two, then a hundred

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.000
until we achieved the perfect balance&nbsp;!

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.990
This project is self-financed
so our sponsoring team had to convince

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.880
partners and donors

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.470
to support us

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.600
in realising our objectives.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.460
After a year and a half of work,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.380
we still have lots of things to sort out

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.360
to enter this last stage

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.590
We are counting on YOU!

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.190
Beginning of July,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.100
we will finally debut
the Digital Dreams project

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.750
during a launch party.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.350
We will show the presentation case
to all the professionnals&nbsp;:

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.940
we will have to suprise them

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.660
and prove our creativity

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.810
not only by the innovation of our work

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.560
but also by the success of the launch party.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.090
Thanks to our partners,
we achieved to move forwards

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.100
but there are still 5 months left,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.209
Full of challenges
that we will be able to face thanks to YOU&nbsp;!!!

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:08.950
Support us during these last efforts,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.269
and it will be a pleasure for us to share with you 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.479
the results of our work and passion.
