Songdo, a new city, is being built from the ground up in South Korea.  By the year 2016, more than 365,000 people will live and commute here.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:35.000
A major challenge to Songdo’s success, is how will all those people get around?  The answer: a compact and accessible city designed so efficiently, planners across the globe are taking note.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
[SCOTT SUMMERS] This is an international city that is to attract people from overseas, as well as attract Koreans from other cities.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
[STAN GALE] Where in the world can you get on a plane that’s 18 minutes from your doorstep and be in Shanghai in an hour and a half, have lunch,home in the evening?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:41.000
[STAN GALE] We’re a walking city, we’re a compact city.  We find if that if people need to walk more than 10-15 minutes they will tend to get in their car, so from Central park all of our venues are within a 15-minute walk.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:57.000
[PETER LEE] Sustainability was a critical feature for the city, so we maximize the green space and place the parking spaces underground. We try to give preferential parking spots to fuel efficient vehicles.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:19.000
[SCOTT SUMMERS] People can use multiple types of transportation. We have 25 kilometers of bicycle lanes here in Songdo. And by 2016, there'll be an express train that links our development with Seoul and we'll cut that travel time down to less than 30 minutes.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:31.000
If you want to be part of the Northeast Asia hub, this is the location. We offer a quality of life that is much different than the developments in Asia as well as other parts of the world.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:44.000
As the world's population increases, the demand for newly constructed cities with highly efficient transportation systems will also rise.  Songdo shows what's possible.
