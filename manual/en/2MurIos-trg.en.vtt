00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.580
hey what's up everybody this is Dom and
today we're checking out my favorite a

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.290
jailbreak tweaks January 2014

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.740
and be sure to hit that thumbs up button
if you wanna see more videos like this

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.799
in the future so let's go ahead and jump
right into a year

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.960
and the first week we are checking out
is pluck to you

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.070
and is available in the BigBoss repo for
99 cents and it'll give you an easier

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.310
way to access your music from the lock
screen

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.670
or control center so as you can see in
the bottom corner here we have the sort

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.359
of music

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.699
icon here in every tap and hold on that
we pull up a nice little switcher that

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:31.920
will allow us to add

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.420
music to a current playlist so I going
here and select some songs

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.030
and get that all queued up 13 tap on
down the music well immediately start

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.500
playing

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.570
in the order that we added them with in
plot to you

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.940
now like I said you can also do this
from control center so we pop control

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.410
center we have the same little icon here
and if you tap on that you can pull up

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.890
your

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.129
artists and playlists and we can add
tracks to a current playlist

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.320
as well there are some settings for plot
to you the ability to change the icon

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.800
color

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.010
and a few more options but overall this
is a great jailbreak tweak in a highly

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.540
recommend checking it out

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.720
next up we're checking out springtime
eyes three and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.900
this is available in the BigBoss repo
for $2.99 or

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.240
199 if you owned a springtime eyes to
you and this is basically the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.009
ultimate way to customize your I less
device as you can see we have tons of

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:21.939
settings in here

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.030
you can customize everything from the
animations to the icon sizes

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.759
hi different UI elements there are so
many things that you can do is bring to

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.310
my sry

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.900
and I highly recommend this for anybody
that wants to tweak

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.170
out I O S and give it a custom look of
course all changes require

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.420
eerie spring but as you can see here
once we're back up and running

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.439
I had changed the device quite a bit to
look a little different

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.110
and we have bigger icons here we have a
different looking dock that I can now

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.939
add six icons to you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.899
there are just so many different ways
this video does spring demise

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.909
3 no justice at all I highly recommend
that you go check it out

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.420
if you're looking for an excellent way
to customize I'll s7 this is probably

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.780
going to be the best one

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.920
moving along here we are checking out
itouch secure and this is available in

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.209
the BigBoss repo for $4.99

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.750
this will autofill passwords inside a
aP's or website if you use Safari

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.739
autofill

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.959
and it works very very well so once
you've set up a nap in as you can see

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.209
you're using the tumbler ap as an
example

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.160
once you are logged into it once itouch
secure will kick in

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.220
so as you can see if I tap on the
password field we have disagreed glow

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.290
and we have a little finger print the
corner and if I touch my time to the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.400
touch ID sensor

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.800
my password is automatically feel then
and I can go ahead and tap on the login

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.640
button here

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.310
but that is not all the itouch secured
us this tweak what also press

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.190
the OK button for you so literally you
just have to enter a new username

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.519
and touch your finger to the touch it.
sensor you what automatically be logged

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:53.910
in

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.760
to whatever app or website that you are
using cell let's go ahead and give this

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.560
a shot here

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.319
I'll go ahead and enter in my username
and cap on the password field

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.470
touch the touch ID censored on here the
bottom and boom we are logged right in

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.519
it's a great week and it works very well
so I highly recommend you check out

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.220
itouch secure if you're looking for an
easy weight is securely and your

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.890
passwords

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.470
in aP's or web-sites next up on the list
we are checking out

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.610
classic switcher available in the
BigBoss repo for 99 cents

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.900
and if you're getting tired the I O S
seven style

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.370
app switcher this will bring back
something that you're probably a little

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.530
more familiar with

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.040
so once we have the tweak installed as
you can see here with a double press the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.080
home button we bring up something that's
a little more comfortable for everybody

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.200
that's used in iowa's device prior to
iowa 7

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.049
we can close aP's in the same way but
there are also some other features that

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.959
come along with classic switcher

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.099
first off we do have the ability to add
more rose to the app switcher so let's

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.720
go ahead and tap on to hear

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.700
and then you'll be able to see exactly
what I mean and there are also some

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.640
other options in here as well but

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.790
let's go ahead and check out this double
row app switcher here

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.030
and as you can see it works just as
advertised

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.989
this is a great week if you're not into
the new card style layout

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.810
up the app switcher found in Iowa seven
so I definitely recommend checking it

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.590
out and like I said it's available

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.630
in the BigBoss repo for only 99 cents

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.570
the last week we're checking out in this
list is bio lockdown available

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.759
in the BigBoss repo for 199 in this is
arguably one of the best

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.919
touch i det weeks that you can download
this will allow you to restrict access

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:30.470
to

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.070
aP's to certain features to preference
panes all kinds of things and it's all

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.860
done right here within the Settings app
so

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.100
as you can see I have a couple
restrictions set in every go inside a

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.910
restriction

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.290
weekend limited to certain fingers set
up in touch I D

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.949
when we're on certain WiFi networks or
even using a standard pasqua

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.100
so it's pretty simple to setup and very
easy to use so as you can see I have

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.690
rearranged

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.759
icon as restriction and if I tap and
hold on the icon we are forced to use

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:58.280
the touch

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.860
ID sensor to unlock that feature and
then I can move the app's round

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.120
the same goes with locking app so I have
the App Store set as a restriction and

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.199
if I try to enter it

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.190
I'm going to be forced to use touch ID
to authenticate that action

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.210
like I said there are times a features
available for by lockdown

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.680
you can lock up different %ah goals you
can lock different aP's

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.800
you can lock different settings pains
you can pretty much lockup anything

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.039
on your device and only be able to
access it with

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.419
touch ID so it's a pretty cool tweak and
I highly recommend the check it out

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.360
this video does absolutely no justice
because there are times at features

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.250
available so

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.850
go ahead and check it out and you can
find by a lockdown in the BigBoss repo

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.509
for a dollar 99

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.060
that about wraps it up for this video
everybody these are my favorite page

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.500
weeks in January 2014

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.660
and hit that thumbs up button if you'd

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.180
