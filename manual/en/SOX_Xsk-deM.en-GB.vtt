00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.380
This is the first time I've volunteered with
The Vegan Society. I've been to a lot of vegan

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.381
social events over the past few years cause
I realised I didn't know many vegans and I

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:19.270
really wanted to find more, talk to them about
their experience of veganism, discover more

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.350
what I could do as a vegan so when I saw the
opportunity to volunteer today after I met

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.080
Rob through vegan meetups, I said I'd love
to go, I'd love to volunteer at a festival

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.140
and he came back and said yeah great, we're
looking for volunteers on The Vegan Society

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.059
stand. I was a contact for The Vegan Society
when I lived up in Glasgow. I was volunteering

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:49.440
for a few years before I was accepted into
my Volunteer Development Coordinator role.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.230
We don't have as many resources as we would
like to have so volunteers really help us

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.049
achieve what we want as a charity and as The
Vegan Society. We wouldn't be able to do it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:19.171
without them. I met Alex when I responded
to the Facebook advert and came into the society

00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:26.369
and Alex met me, nice little smiley lady.
I gave her a phone call, she was really friendly

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.619
and polite, couldn't really decide where her
accent was from but we figured it out in the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.009
end. She made me feel really welcome, the
office was a really nice environment. The

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.600
more I started thinking about it, I'm a stay-at-home
dad and now that my child's at school I have

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.340
got this gap every day of a few hours where
I don't necessarily have something that I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.729
need to be doing and it was really quite easy
to approach them and volunteer my time, see

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.680
what they wanted to do with it. Volunteering
for The Vegan Society seemed to be the next

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.340
logical step, a way to, I guess connect with
more people and you know, spread the vegan

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.109
message a little bit further. It's really
helped to build my confidence and to build

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.720
my skill set and I'm really looking forward
to getting a great reference from the team

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.080
when I move to further employment. I think
the roles I've been given have definitely

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.170
changed, I started off with just the easy
stuff like putting things in envelopes and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.842
occasionally doing post and the role has developed.
It's just tied to what ever person you are,

00:02:30.842 --> 00:02:33.350
what you enjoy doing. You can actually volunteer
from home if distance is a problem, if you're

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.122
not local to the actual Birmingham-base of
the organisation. You can apply any of the

00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:44.570
professional skills that you have in a range
of things really. It could be something from

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.610
the website, it could be something for the
magazine, could be something to do with design

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.440
or illustration, there are a number of skills
that could be applied where distance isn't

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.190
a problem. Really, whatever needs doing gets
done with the help of volunteers as I understand

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.850
it. In my job I used to work with the public
a lot and as the time's gone on and my role's

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.880
changed I worked them a lot less so it's been
really great today to actually be able to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.120
talk to different individuals once again.
People are just so interesting with their

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.740
different stories, their different angles
on things. Being a vegan isn't about doing

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.770
things in isolation, it's about the whole
vegan community and wider community who you

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.240
can connect with, get their different viewpoints,
find out what it is, what their perceptions

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.470
are and what your perceptions are and try
and find some common ground. It's lovely working

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.730
with Vegan Society staff, they're all really
friendly, there's a lot of new people who

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.500
come on The Vegan Society recently and you
know it's been great, making a connection

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.120
with them and yes, we [inaudible] and that
works out really well. Sometimes you walk

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.073
in and it's all very quiet, everybody's got
their head [inaudible] and I think "ooh what's

00:03:49.073 --> 00:03:51.200
going on?" and then somebody will say something
and everybody will just start laughing because

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.200
it's a very happy office. I always feel really
well respected, really well appreciated at

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.291
The Vegan Society. Every task I do is met
with a thank you and often baked goods. You

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:09.570
can get involved by going to our website,
there's a volunteer section in the Take Action

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.840
pages of the website. You can email me at
volunteer@vegansociety.com. There's a lot

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.570
of information about our volunteer roles on
the website so you can probably find something

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.910
to suit you there but if not then email me
and we can work something out anyway.
