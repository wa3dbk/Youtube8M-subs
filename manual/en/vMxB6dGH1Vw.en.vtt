00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.169
after the initial preparation of the rotator cuff repair

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:16.659
including the breed moderate your cup
enlighten abrasion of the two bra city

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.289
the rotator cuff repair is measured

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.970
utilizing the graduated probe

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.289
this is up for centimeter tear

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.749
with an l shaped configuration

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.650
for me

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.480
getting the pattern of the chair

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.810
is the most important thing initially

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.350
now we move on to creating

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.350
the trains artist tunnels

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.530
we use spinal needle localization

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.870
to get appropriate placement for the and
 collateral tunnel for placement of the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.870
are thrown comer

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.470
the saab loans now demonstrates

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.250
that the sutures have been placed in the

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.380
arthur tunnels

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.020
with the rotator cuff repair

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.020
held reduced those sutures are passed
through the moscow tenderness junction

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.970
the lateral trans asi sutures are
brought out to a single portal

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.440
and tagged

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.700
the medial trans aussie sutures

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.799
are now placed

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.130
portals that are not used for the 
remainder of the rotator cuff repair

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.550
so they're out of the way

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.180
the next step

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.290
is to place our anchors distal to the
footprint

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.239
and proceed with the tension band repair

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.909
jumping back to the surgical video

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.539
we are passing the cranes aussie sutures
through the appropriate position of the

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:24.539
rotator cuff

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.469
the tension men repairs been completed

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:35.790
in sa bones

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.909
and the measurement step

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.649
for the graft

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:48.649
has now commenced

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.120
we're starting the tension band repair

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.120
in the surgical video with placement of
the anchors distal to the footprint

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.329
boot trans r c s

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.519
medial sutures are brought out through a
single cannula

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.519
in preparation for suturing the media
 limb of the graft

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:27.469
here to clamps are place to place the 
graft intention while being sutured

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.239
meanwhile in the surgical video the
tension band repairs been completed

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.649
we are now measuring

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:46.649
for the graft itself

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:01.119
to keep the sutures parallel in the same 
cannula

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:05.159
we sometimes will retrieve them one at 
that time as shown here

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.010
or retrieve them all at once but make
sure they're parallel

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.699
these are now sutured through the graft
 and tidy tether

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.479
as shown on the

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.029
sab on speedy o

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:20.149
the surgical video is ready to deliver
the graft seen coming into the summer

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:25.359
communal space

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:30.499
this is done by pulling on the lateral 
limbs of the trans asi sutures

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.610
dosent richard mallory treat

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.279
out the single cannula

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.680
the tide over the bony bridge

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.409
creating uniform compression

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.449
of the entire rotator cuff repair

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.639
and reinforcement with the craft

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.270
we see in the saab loans video

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.870
delivery of the graft

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.699
into

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.100
the summer camille space through a
single cannula

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.269
by pulling on the lateral sutures

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:04.969
in the surgical video

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.150
we're moving ahead wid

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.259
placing the lateral sutures

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.350
to place uniform tension

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.139
on the graft allowing uniform
compression

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:22.139
of the entire footprint

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.490
this same procedures being completed

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:40.490
in the saab owns video

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:42.880
and the last suture

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.810
being placed

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.520
in the surgical video

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.860
here we have a completed

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.709
repair with uniform tension and
compression

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:57.319
of the entire rotator cuff care

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:57.809
and footprint
 of the rotator cuff repair
