Desteni Interdimensional Interview: Am I Dead? - The Moon

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.220
Hi this is the moon and, I'm here to say that: I'm not dead

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.640
and that I'm, very much "aware".

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm, currently, it is- it's fascinating in terms of the, manifestation of 'night and day'.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.150
which is, myself as the moon and "the sun", I'd say, in terms of, what is..

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.320
happen, is also the unification of the universe, as one.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.610
The sun, representing 'the day' as 'expression', where is the evening

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.350
as the moon as myself, as the structural manifestation.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.290
Which has been, 'much separated' in terms of even as human beings,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.710
individually manifesting in existence as itself.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.770
A basic reflection of..human beings within themselves.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.480
Which is a separation between male and female, where 'within' human beings, where

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.140
the left represents the female, expressive- application.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.180
and, the right representing the male structural- manifestation,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.140
and even, if you look at, let's love within human beings.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.340
and now, human being in itself if you're a female, which represent the female expression.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.740
and the male, which..represents the male structural manifestation.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.270
and in terms of 'relationships' in this world, it is, males and females the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.100
mal- the female expressive coming together with the male, manifestation, as one.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.910
and that's what perceive 'oneness' to be..in the manifestation of 'relationship'.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.010
Which is seen as 'within consciousness', which is not the way it is suppose to be.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.380
So it will be interesting to view in this process, of what will actually really happen.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.760
within existence as it's entirety, as human beings start..

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.280
within themselves, realizing the oneness of both male and female, removing that.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.260
and just standing as 'I am'.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.680
Where structural and, expression, comes together as one,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.040
within each and every single human being.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.940
I wonder what will become of 'existence' because

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.450
existence is a basic reflection, manifestation, of..human beings, in and of this world.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.650
So, this is the moon.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.040
That's my perspective of, the current manifestation existence and of 'myself'.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.570
So, let's see if..

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.180
One, as 'I am', will manifest.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.940
Thank you very much. this is the moon.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.200
Oh! another point, it's interesting that, the shape of, the moon

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.620
and the sun of planets is..

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.030
the manifestation of an 'O', of one.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.820
Just an insight, would be interesting, as all, the ones come together.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.230
Thank you very much.
