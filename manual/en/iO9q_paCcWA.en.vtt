00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.860
Meat is an excellent source of protein

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.179
and quite tasty.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.429
But at what cost?

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.519
The resources required to feed nine billion people
meat, are vast.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.279
Even if it's just the wealthy ones.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.579
Many people are rejecting the cruelty of factory farming

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.980
and practices like live animal export.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.659
And though they haven't been surveyed, 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.619
it's likely the billions of primary
providers,

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.350
cows, sheep,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.040
pigs, fish and the rest, are dead against it.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.610
Could synthetic meat be the solution?

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.560
It is meat, not tofu-based meat
substitutes.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.909
And despite the name, not really

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:45.920
synthetic.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.670
It's actual animal cells. 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.810
Tissue engineers take a sample from a live adult animal and
ideally that's all they have to endure.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.960
Then they grow the adult stem cells

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.920
in vats of nutrient rich broth,
convert them to muscle cells, because

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.890
meat is muscle, and grow the mono-biodegradable 
scaffold.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.910
The only hitch is muscle cells need
exercise to survive

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.730
and you can't run these ones around the
paddock.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.400
You can stimulate them with tiny electrical impulses,
but on an industrial scale, 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.930
it's prohibitively expensive.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.670
Research continues.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.640
Thus far, the biggest cut contains millions

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.740
of cells and is roughly the size
of a contact lens.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.689
But when synthetic meat becomes a mainstream
reality,

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.050
will you eat lab-grown steak?

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.300
And will knowing that no animals were harmed in
the making of your burger,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.900
change the way you relate to animals?
