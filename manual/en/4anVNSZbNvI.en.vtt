00:00:02.032 --> 00:00:03.238
- Yeah!

00:00:04.607 --> 00:00:06.160
(struggling noises)

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.109
(playful music)

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.743
- I really don't know that
much about gymnastics.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.303
- My goal today is to do a cartwheel.

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:12.635
- I've never been able to do a cartwheel.

00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:13.680
- I'll probably fall a lot.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.839
- Think there's a trampoline,

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.027
so I'm looking forward to that, too.

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:17.641
- Hi, welcome to Broadway Gymnastics.

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:19.938
I'm Coach Cara, and we have a group of

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:21.377
beginning students here.

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:23.007
We're gonna get them out
of their comfort-zones,

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:24.475
and have a good time.

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:27.861
- Well look at that!

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.670
I think we all forgot
that Nick is a cyborg.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.424
- Finally accomplished
my high school fears

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:34.310
of climbing a rope.

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:36.750
(grunting)

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.720
- Yeah so, we just warmed up apparently,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.428
and I don't think I can do anymore.

00:00:40.428 --> 00:00:43.793
- Tuck that chin in, hands
on the floor, big push.

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:49.653
- I have this fear that I'm gonna go back,

00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:51.162
and I'm gonna roll, and my head's gonna

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:52.746
snap off of my body.

00:00:54.644 --> 00:00:55.431
There it is!

00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:56.569
- Your hands go down sideways,

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.412
and you're just gonna kick all
the way over, like a rainbow.

00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:07.459
Turn it into a forward roll.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.065
Tuck your chin in.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:13.063
(coaches and students speaking)

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:17.847
(grunt)

00:01:17.847 --> 00:01:19.506
- Gave me a hard time, you'll be fine.

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:21.311
- Whoa!

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.295
(Woman screams)

00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:24.321
(clapping)

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.151
- And just try to turn
your body on your toes.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:32.984
- [Woman] Oh, the squat.

00:01:32.984 --> 00:01:33.942
(laughing)

00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:35.635
I'm so sorry.

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:39.767
- Lift, lift, lift, lift, lift, touch.

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:41.633
- [Blonde] I don't know what
I'm supposed to do from here.

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:43.722
- Nope, nope, nope.

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:45.503
- Nope, nope.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.170
- Easy.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.176
(martial arts sound effect)

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:52.871
- This is how cats sleep all the time.

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:53.771
- [Nick] I know.

00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:55.465
- I wanna save my energy
for the trampoline.

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:56.757
I know there's gonna be a trampoline.

00:01:56.757 --> 00:01:58.019
I'm not gonna waste my time on

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:01.410
these log walking, whatever.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.505
- The great thing about a gym like this

00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:05.393
is there's a bed everywhere.

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:07.622
Anywhere you wanna go to
sleep, you can go to sleep,

00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:09.740
'cause you get tired
from doing gymnastics,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.649
and then they have a bed for you.

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.321
Yeah, spoon me.

00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:15.266
- Okay, oh, I need to be in the small.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:16.195
- Get in this.

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:16.978
- Oh yeah.

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:25.492
- [Coach] Shot jumps, shot straddle jumps.

00:02:25.492 --> 00:02:26.701
- Butt, toes.

00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:29.442
- [Man] Oh Matt.

00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:33.604
- Whoo! So high, it's terrifying.

00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:36.994
- And bend them, try to turn.

00:02:42.793 --> 00:02:43.819
(laughing)

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.893
- [Man] Your goal is to get
as many steps in a-- there!

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:48.930
- [Woman] Yeah!

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.766
- [Man] Wee!

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:52.659
- Today, I didn't
accidentally kill myself,

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.852
or anybody else, and
I call that a success.

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:56.854
- I conquered a lot of my fears today.

00:02:56.854 --> 00:02:58.412
I feel like superman.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:01.203
- Once I let go of the
fear of breaking my neck,

00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:02.754
I actually could do some things.

00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:03.979
- Oh, favorite thing was the trampoline.

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.192
I know it's not an original
answer, but it's the best.

00:03:07.192 --> 00:03:08.136
You see how high I got?

00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:10.702
I got so high.

00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:12.428
(happy upbeat music)

00:03:12.428 --> 00:03:13.409
- My body's failing.

00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:16.020
My joints are all broken.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.668
I'm gonna crawl my way to my car.

00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:25.375
- She said that swinging is
not encouraged, but it's fun.
