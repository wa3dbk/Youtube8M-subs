00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.840
In the grand tradition of flashlight
brands using the word

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.540
"fire" in their name... Surefire, Trustfire,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.589
Ultrafire, Uranusfire, Batteryfire,

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.739
Housefire, Hairdresseronfire...
Manufacturer Thorfire

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.450
has successfully introduced an
atomic age miracle called the

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.830
KL02 keychain light.  All while flying under
the radar of

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.220
the lawyers at Marvel Comics.  While many lights have simple reflectors

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.249
Thorfire has decided investing billions in
dome technology

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:35.559
would help it stay on the cutting edge
of keychain light technology-

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.179
at least this year... Because of the domes
ability to scatter light

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.579
softly around a wider area.  That was a
smart decision!

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.260
Plus it tail stands well, so you can use
it as a tiny candle

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.199
just in case you think regular old candles
are for dorks.

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.889
At just 2.2 inches long the KL02 can run off of

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.729
throwaway CR123A lithium batteries or
the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.499
rechargeable 16340 lithium ion
battery.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.840
The CR123a battery is capable of outputting

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.130
55 lumens and the 16340

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.490
3.7 volt battery outputs a whopping 120
lumens.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.110
Simply untwist the miracle device, place the battery in, and

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.730
twist close until it lights. Amazing.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.220
I also did a time-lapse runtime test
for people who like long continuous shots

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.310
of lights dimming.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.540
Using a 16340  battery the light runs

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.430
over 9 hours before a recharge. But you
only get usable

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.170
light for a few hours as you can see in
the video. Anyway this light

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.680
small and simple, so was this review

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.990
some longer protected cells may have a slight problem fitting

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.090
So using a CR123A throw away battery

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.290
would probably be a bit better because
it should be shorter in length.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.510
Well I did have some problems and sadly it no longer lights

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.300
for more than a few seconds.  So

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.220
no further testing can be done.  I hope
your experience is better than mine.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.440
The KL02 I was provided for review by

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.770
Thorfire.  Thanks for watching my
channel and don't forget to subscribe if

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.880
you like this video. Even though it

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.280
was pretty friggin boring.  Thorfire KL02 Keychain light review.
