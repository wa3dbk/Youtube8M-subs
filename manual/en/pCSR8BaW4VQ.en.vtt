00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.240
domestic drones flying over the united
states uh... over the next

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.890
years or within the next eight years

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.650
the association for on manned vehicle

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.990
which is a drone

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.150
trade group

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.900
uh... recently doubled

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.900
it's lobbying activities in terms of of

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.240
and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.920
apparently uh... we find it has uh...
found a powerpoint presentation put

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.120
together

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.500
five one of their top lobbyists

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.130
uh...

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.490
which maintains an official partnership
in congress would represent a buck

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.380
mckeon republican california

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.610
and henry quite are democrat from texas

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.430
and dozens of other lawmakers

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.280
who were the driving force behind

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.460
the broadening

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.140
of the allowance for use of drones in
our skies

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.280
page five of this powerpoint drone

global conflict particularly u_s_ and
allied and uh... nation involvement in

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.830
future conflicts will either positively

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.539
or negatively influence market growth
for the industry

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.599
now the words hopefully these drawings
that were making i won't be used to kill

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.169
too many civilians or at least

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.059
be reported as killing too many
civilians

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.620
so that that would have a negative
affect on our growth potential in this

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.999
country

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.739
