00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.250
Our Mosaic hand mirror has dried over night.
Now we're going to prepare it for the grouting.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.530
First I'm going to place our cookie cutter
in here. We're going to use this to help hold

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.190
the shape while we're grouting and you want
to just tape that in with a little masking

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:27.430
tape. The cookie cutter will be like a shield
for the grout. It will space it nicely and

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:36.070
evenly all around. We'll just tape that all
away around with a little bit of masking tape.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.930
Then you want to check the position and see
if it's in the right place that you want and

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:58.190
that the mirror is showing all the way around.
Next we'll prepare our grout. Just tuck in

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.520
those pieces. Next we'll prepare our grout.
I have a plain white grout here and I'm going

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.250
to color it with some acrylic paint to give
it a little bit of a blue color. First I'll

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:23.299
add the water and you'll want to stir that.
We're trying to get a consistency of like

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.170
frosting or they say a buttery consistency.
Add a little bit of water at a time because

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.900
you can add too much water easily and then
you end up having to add more and more of

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.090
the powder. You just want to mix that until
it's nice and smooth. This is a little bit

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.571
thick but since I'm going to be adding some
paint to color it, the paint will thin it

00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:51.860
out a bit. So I'm going to leave it thick,
I'm going to add a little bit of this acrylic

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:09.729
paint and we'll mix that in. Just mix it until
it's completely even, nice and smooth. Just

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:18.700
add the color into it until you're happy with
the shade. Now when its dries, it usually

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.849
dries lighter than the color that you see
when it's wet. So keep that in mind when you're

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:31.770
doing your color. It's also a good idea to
try out when you?re doing a project and you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:39.209
don't want to make any mistakes to pre-mix
some grout and let it dry and make sure that

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:46.300
is the color that you want. I'm finished here
adding the color. It's nice and smooth and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.379
I have a nice thick consistency like frosting.
You want to make sure you wear gloves while

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.879
you're doing this because the grout can be
harsh on your hands.
