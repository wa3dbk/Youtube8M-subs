it after long landsat family had biwi collection
video

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.919
this is going to be part one of the probably
split into maybe two three parts and you know

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.589
you'll see when they do come up

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.510
but im anyways here is game number one donkey
kong country returns

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.439
not just give my quick opinion each game

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.439
and uh...

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.989

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.800
these games and will recommend some i'd just
what

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.890
docket no country returns obviously a big
kick from last fall uh... this is

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.480
easily one of my favorite games and turned
away

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.100
so here's the front and back

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.990
at dr cohn giddy column obviously rated the
not much really

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.750
economic

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.510
you know people make makes clear abt

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.200
anyways this is a neat very very fun game
and there's nothing that i can say about this

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.700
kid

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.879
uh... you know it's just like mario if your
fam mario you'll love this game and down

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.770
you know it's a very in the style of the game
i love how you know

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.480
you know back from the old days yesenia saddam
even gameboy advance teams they made ports

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.400
on

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.920
but on this is you know over freshen game
to play

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.480
imperial ave if whether you like mario pokum
on sonic whatever this is that you know gracie

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.300
and even if it had any again nearer to tartikoff
gives him a shot

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.650
uh...

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.680
said at least next game one that's hard to
find some or all stars

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.030
you know i obviously have four of the best
mario games of all time inclusive marlboros

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.310
aspire broza las levels which is really japan
supermarket rose to and super mario brothers

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.870
to america and then super mario brothers three

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.590
some of the services inc members mid march
twenty fifth anniversary

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.350
uh... whose only thirty dollars to give for
classic mario games on one day's and you not

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.869
be so you can use the we're mon-fri controller

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.520
and you know you as it had the um... classic
martin as arcadia mitchell

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.460
sewing elsa got a cd and a little hard booklet
which i actually never opened

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.950
so um...

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.690
scott babette

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.569
mario super sluggers very good game uh...

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.569
the problem is is that idon't like out you
can't really keep track of the any statistics

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.420
whatsoever

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.450
which is a bit troublesome for myself because
i do like to keep track of what batting average

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.439
and stuff

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.359
so i'm this is a priest ripped a game in terms
of statistics

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.879
and on those being saved

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.269
uh... obviously a mark eighty cell of baseball
than you would see unlike now tend not to

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.539
be you know

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.969
two k leather never so it's a bit

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.409
it's a bit stripped but nonetheless you'll
have a lot of fun with that one

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.939
so he got metroid prime trilogy here very
rear game uh... i may have a video you know

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.809
deterrence gain more in the future

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.969
but you get a collapse of exclusive bonus
content

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.269
obviously this is a slipcover and do you have

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.609
tire box which is kind of

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.629
dismayed at like a metal like material and
it's it's really it's a cool box i mean this

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.540
is um...

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.040
analysis a box but you know

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.509
it's a box and omg will not be able to find
really anywhere else

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:12.239
study says that if i understand prohibiting
supper for that but in

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.769
yet metroid prime natcher primed to and then
metroid you know from the we accurately right

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:18.479
now

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.809
but i've i played metric product but i'd love
it

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.929
uh... disney sing it

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:23.910
um...

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.249
this is a gift which i really don't appreciate

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:31.859
but you know i guess the sickest and uh...
that's my sister she plays this one

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.549
disease saying a party it's alumnae

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.279
i don't write within the idon't reckoned in
this game at all

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:42.749
because the fact that i keep disney you know
i can tell that's awesome

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.899
always disney people jonas brothers in you
know all that

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.789
an expression microphone that came with the
case that the unresponsive it does come with

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:50.379
one

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.519
so that's a good deal actually

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.739
uh... digits revolution fun game do you have
a you know a little arm

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:57.759
yet the mat

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.669
and you go reviews we balance board or you
can give you don't have to use we balance

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.900
board or the mat

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.299
just kind of one

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.139
so you have three options there at the board

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.609
uh...

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.480
finding is a game controller

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.889
sold to classic tangents revolution got that

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.289
and then you know for this video his last
game that we party um... as you can see i

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.110
mean if you could tell it's in a surrender
apso actually have not got this game i got

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.020
it for my birthday august last year uh...
late last year and i haven't even opened it

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.940
yet

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.860
so i can say too much about this game i'd
know what looks pretty fun

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.639
promises that it is pretty preoccupied with
games like sonic colors and he was super smash

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.689
brothers brought up a couple of alternatives
around here

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:45.090
but i a m

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.789
not a bad game can't complain and i've actually
claire friends houses but yeah i won't file

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.620
