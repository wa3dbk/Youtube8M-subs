Before you apply to any university here you have to have some English level. That's why

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.650
we went to some English language schools.
I had two Australian tutors, teachers, and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.710
when I was deciding which university to choose
they advised me Curtin Singapore because it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.500
had and it has a strong reputation.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.400
[Russian Language]

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.100
What I like the most about lectures at
Curtin Singapore is that we just don't study

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.360
theory, pure theory, so you have to take
into account all the events that are going

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.700
on in the world and we always discuss them
because this is the real application, this

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.140
is where your theory would go into practice.
Here at Curtin Singapore you can meet a lot

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.480
of different nationalities. You learn how
to communicate with them, how to interact

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.480
with them. I like Singapore a lot because
it's very green, it's a very nice country.

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:14.530
I have two favourite places, the first one
is Orchard [Road], especially during holidays because

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.409
they will decorate it and especially when
it's dark, you just walk in through all those

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.420
lights and it seems like you are in a fairytale,
it's totally another world, it's not Singapore.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.460
And my second favourite place is Botanic Gardens.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.670
It's really beautiful and what's most interesting
is you can be walking on the path and then

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.020
suddenly a big lizard will just cross this.
It's really interesting because Singapore

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.400
seems very modern with all those very modern architecture that would have lizards in their parks.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.600
If you're just interested in exploring the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.270
city, exploring the country itself, then it's
very interesting. They have Little India,

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.270
they have Chinatown, they have all different places. You can have a street, Indian temple,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.159
Chinese temple, Christian church. It's really
fascinating how they just interact with each

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.800
other because religions are so different but
then at the same time they are on the same street.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.189
I came to Singapore with my brother and my cousin.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:32.900
So we were staying quite close to University, only 15 minutes walk. We found accommodation

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.980
quite easily, it didn't even take a week. I will recommend Curtin Singapore

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.269
to other students and I have already done
that. My friend came from Russia and she is

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:51.269
studying now here. And my older brother also
graduated from here, and we will be having

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.200
our graduation ceremony soon together.
