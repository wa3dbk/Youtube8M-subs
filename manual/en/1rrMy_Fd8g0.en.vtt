00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.510
Here is the page has been made in our
previous videos. its just an example

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.199
webpage made with CSS styles

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.269
and DIVs to separate the different parts of
the page about. You can see it works quite

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.099
nicely

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.059
however it's only good as an example for
this to be useful we need to turn this

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:25.779
area: the contents area into

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.529
a template. Now, if I pick the section
here down at the bottom where it says DIV

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.410
contents it highlights round the edge

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.220
of that section

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.420
I can turn this into an editable region.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.020
I go to Insert

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.140
template objects and I pick Editable Region.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.350
Now, it says "do you want to turn this whole page
into a template?" And I say yes I do

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
think you - OK - and then we give the
name

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.820
contents to this little editable region
and click ok

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.740
how this whole area is the only pit that
people will be enable to

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.090
once we've converted this into templates
are going to go to save as template

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.670
and i'm going to give it unnamed black
template

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.780
towns kicks saying

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.430
okay links yes

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.600
and he can see them here is a cold up in
the context of files without template

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.420
inside it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.740
as close up uh... closely success this
i'm not interested in those anymore they

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.080
spit

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.190
when i am interested in all these files
so let's close a template

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.210
and get it right any page set final and
you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.850
and instead of going to blank page we're
going to go to page from template and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.150
you can see here

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.890
i've got my site my template i'm going
to pick create

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.770
now this makes the cheap ticket of our
page

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.950
based on the template

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.570
papa heading as page one

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.799
as it is just an example canady as it is
let's call it page one

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.399
hate saying

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.450
and you can see it appears to have
missed it just means that i was so you

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.709
can see the whole

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.579
titles

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:15.919
let's close fat

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.129
let's go to another new york file nyi
page from template

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.190
and create

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.659
they can get to know that you cook it

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:30.089
change the heading to page two sewing
and this is our page two

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.009
but still it page two

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:37.849
and save and i'm going to create man

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.469

you'll notice it is again a little black

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.599
menu link and that's because is no link
in delegates that style when we tried to

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.379
link

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.029
so i'm just going to

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.229

into the different pages that i'm

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.790

diplomatic that styles does for a schism

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.569
turned this into a link

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.290
becomes the toppling in our menu that
fantastic

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.959
