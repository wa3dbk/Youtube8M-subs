00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
"Cancer as an Autoimmune Disease"

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.050
When people get heart
or kidney transplants,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.960
they must be given
immunosuppressive drugs

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.660
to prevent rejection
of the new organ.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.880
What do you suppose
happens to cancer rates

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.790
in those individuals who are
immunosuppressed?

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.820
Well, for some types of cancer,
like skin cancer,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.970
the risk goes up,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.470
which supports the so-called
immune surveillance hypothesis-

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.480
the idea that our
immune system acts

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.420
as a natural defense system
for keeping cancer under control.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.260
This could explain why, as we age and
our immune function declines,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.719
our risk of cancer goes up.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.750
Here's a video of our immune system
in action.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.280
That big oval cell in the middle is a
cervical cancer cell,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.019
and those little round cells are our T
cells delivering the poison pill-

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.159
setting off the cancer cells'
self-destruct mechanism.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.620
And there it goes;
bye-bye, cancer.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.590
That's the apoptosis,
or programmed cell death,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.000
that I'm always
talking about.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.690
Note this so-called renaissance of the
immune-surveillance hypothesis

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.190
was more than
ten years ago.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.720
The problem with the theory
is that for some cancers,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.850
immunosuppression
decreases cancer risk.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.590
After a kidney transplant,
your skin cancer risk may go up,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.080
but your breast cancer risk goes down;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.430
your rectal cancer risk goes down.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.240
Why would people with depressed
immune systems have less cancer?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.290
This led to a new theory, kind of the flip
side of immune surveillance-

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.740
the thought that,
in some sense,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.870
"cancer may be considered
an autoimmune disease."

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.580
See, the only reason the
immune system is even able

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.160
to pick out cancer cells from
non-cancer cells

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.170
is because tumors express
foreign-looking antigens

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.769
(immune-stimulating molecules).

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.530
Why would tumors do that?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.320
Why would cancer cells go out of their
way to wave a red flag around,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.120
saying hey, come get me?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.230
We think it's because
cancer tends to thrive

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.290
in a setting of
low-level inflammation.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.580
There's lots of examples of chronic
inflammation leading to cancer-

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.750
like ulcerative colitis
to colon cancer,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.330
chronic pancreatitis
to pancreatic cancer,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.450
chronic hepatitis turning
into liver cancer,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.450
stomach inflammation
to stomach cancer.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.640
Oftentimes, inflammation,
the body's immune response,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.770
can further cancer's agenda.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.470
By inciting an immune response,
cancer creates its own inflammation,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.330
which may stimulate angiogenesis,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.210
help bring blood to the tumor,
and help it grow.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.470
So, the curve may look
something like this.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.520
A low level of inflammation
stimulates cancer growth.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.550
But, if the immune system
really catches on, then,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.570
it can actually start hacking away
at the tumor, and slow it down.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.600
This may explain a mystery
surrounding Kaposi's sarcoma-

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.530
a cancer affecting those with AIDS.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.870
When you start treating AIDS, and the
immune system starts to recover,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.170
you can actually see a
flare in the cancer.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.390
So, what are the dietary implications of
this new autoimmune theory of cancer?

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.969
Stay tuned.
