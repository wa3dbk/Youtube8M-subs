00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:21.050
There have been some great games born from
tech demos.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.859
Usually they still have that feel about them,
more about flash than substance, like the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.529
"Game" experience was tacked on just to satisfy
an expectation while you enjoy the graphical

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.009
prowess of this new shiny box.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.329
Goat Simulator, though, operates kinda differently.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.329
Built originally as an absurd joke by Coffee
Stain Studios, the video of this goat running

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.109
around, breaking things, and generally causing
havoc inside a glitchy-as-all-hell physics

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.530
engine was hilarious in its strangeness, and
immediately had folks clamoring to play the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.530
"real game."

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.230
But there was no real game to Goat Simulator.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.200
So, being the enterprising sort (and noticing
the line of folks with money in their hands

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.429
and a demand in their hearts) Coffee Stain
tacked on some vaguely game-like mechanics

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.850
and BOOM.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.600
Goat Simulator was born.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.460
Goat help us all.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.119
So you're a goat.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.229
You have no backstory, and neither does anything
in this town.

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.170
Y'see, that'd make you care about these things,
and that's not what Goat Simulator's all about.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.909
Goat Simulator is about BREAKING THINGS and
BEING A GOAT.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.610
You can lick things, you can beat up things
by headbutting them, and you can occasionally

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.170
use bits of the scenery to jump on or get
ahead.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.170
That's about it.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.340
The entire appeal is in making a mess of things,
exploring, and racking up score multipliers

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.680
by breaking things in new and interesting
ways.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.380
And, y'know, watching the hilariously broken
physics cause all sorts of issues, from a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.409
dude's leg jutting out of the wall of a convenience
store to just... this, the hell that is climbing

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.820
up a ladder.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.400
Because let's face it, if goats ever learned
how to navigate ladders... there'd be none

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.729
of us left.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:10.149
There isn't much of a goal in Goat Simulator,
either, except for the few achievements you're

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.200
offered as a basic way of directing the lack-of-plot.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.180
Mostly it's a toy, a chance to unwind, and
to have fun with a game that absolutely refuses

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.510
to either take itself seriously or patch any
of the eleven bajillion bugs you're going

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.700
to come across.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.410
Really, making sense of the whole thing is
a greater challenge than anything you're going

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.030
to find on these city streets.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.610
But that's certainly not going to stop you
from looking, is it?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.290
I didn't think so.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.650
This is about as freeform as gaming gets,
absolute liberation from the need to do anything.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.360
And it's all because of a deranged goat.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.569
If you really need a goal, though, you've
got a time-trial mode where you're tasked

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.739
with racking up the highest score in a minute.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.260
Bleating optional.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.090
Goat Simulator doesn't pay all that much attention
to its graphics or sound, because... well,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.310
it just doesn't.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.280
Hell, it'd probably be more jarring to see
a game this mechanically broken with excellent

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.319
graphics and sound, because THEN it'd be a
disappointment.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.100
Instead, you get a weird, blippy, repetitive
audio track, passible if lackluster models

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.590
and textures, and a button to bleat on command.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.709
And honestly, that's all you need.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.959
The controls will take some geting used to,
but soon you'll be tearing through the streets

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.250
and getting mauled by oncoming traffic in
no time.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.450
And if you do suffer the fate worse than death-
vis, being stuck in the geometry and unable

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.250
to get out - all you gotta do is hit respawn
and BAM.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.650
You're back out on the streets, terrorizing
passersby.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.731
It looks like the stupidest game of the year,
and frankly, it is the stupidest game iof

00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:46.731
the year.

00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:50.340
But that's exactly what Goat Simualtor was
going for, and so by their twisted definition,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.810
it does absolutely everything it set out to
do.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.840
Don't act like you're not loving it every
second of it, either.
