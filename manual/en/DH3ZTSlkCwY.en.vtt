My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'll be showing you some of

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:12.130
the new features in Mac OS 10.5 Leopard. Ok
screen sharing. Really, really cool. So we're

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.030
going to go over here, click on Mac HD, open
it up. You can see under our shared devices,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.760
you can see my Mac Mini, you can also see
my PC here. So I'm going to click on Mac Mini.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.000
It'll actually look like, let me back up here
a little bit, as a side note if you look at

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.661
the Mac icon or the PC icon under Mac it's
really kind of funny. Hit connect as. If you

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:42.370
look really closely you can see that it's
a PC with the blue screen of death. The Windows

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.469
fatal exception error. It's kind of a little
joke. A built in Easter egg. Back up on that,

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.530
though. But you go to Mac mini, or under whatever
computer you've got, I've got a Mac mini.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.011
I'm going to, first of all I can see all the
drives on that computer, but I can go to share

00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:05.171
screen and do more than just see the drives.
This is really awesome. So I've got an application

00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:10.960
that quit unexpectedly, so I'm just going
to relaunch it. And I'll deal with this later.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.909
But this is my Mac mini, and I'll show you,
I can actually resize this window if I can

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.579
get a hold of it. Of course, obviously, it's
a little hard to use it at this point. It

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:28.939
actually even exposes, but it is there if
I want to make it really tiny and just watch

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.610
what happens. I'm going to make it nice and
big, so we can see what's going on here. I'll

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.679
actually full screen it, whoops. And so you
can see everything that's all junked up on

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.789
my desktop. I can actually highlight stuff.
I can go into the trash; I can play with the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.680
stacks on the Mac Mini. There's my Mac mini
stacks. I can look at all the applications,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.950
I can start up applications, and I can open
up iTunes on my other computer and go through

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.869
my entire iTunes catalog like that which is
kind of cool. I can open up aperture and edit

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.420
photos. I can send pictures to myself. I could,
this is actually kind of neat, not a real

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.530
good practical application for this but it
sure does look cool. I can go under file sharing.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.620
I could share the screen with my Macbook while
I'm looking at the screen of my Mac mini and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.620
create a real neat optical effect. And there
it is. The endless window. Kind of nifty.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:39.260
The good this is is that it's totally seamless.
So you don't even really, you don't have to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.350
consciously control click to go off the screen
or anything like that. Or I could still go

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.850
over here and click on my photo stack, and
then go right back in to here. There's logic,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.650
and go to this hard drive and do whatever
I want. This is really awesome, and you can

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.540
actually do this over, you can set it up where
you can dial in from anywhere. So I can have

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.040
my Macbook at Starbuck's and I could have
a Mac mini at home, and I could realize that

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.500
I forgot to email myself a file from the Mc
mini. So I could log on to the Mac mini and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.520
send myself the file, and it's just perfect.
So that's probably my favorite new feature.
