00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.430
Now we're talking about customizing your picture
style on the Canon 40D. All you need to do

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.700
is make sure that your camera is turned on,
that it is active by pressing the shutter

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.060
button half way down and then press the picture
style button at the bottom of your camera.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.279
That picture style menu will come up. What
you can do is take one of these preset picture

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.140
styles, say portrait or landscape or neutral.
What we're going to do now is just go ahead

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.700
and use portrait and then press the info button
which is right next to the picture style button.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:48.989
That will take you to the detailed settings
of that particular picture style. There are

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.559
four settings or variables in each of the
picture styles in portrait. Sharpness has

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:07.030
been lowered a little bit and contrast, saturation,
and color tone are all sitting pretty much

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.450
right at the middle. So what I can do here
is scroll through, and let's say I just wanted

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.680
to sharpen the photo, the portrait, a little
bit more. In portrait mode you probably don't

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:30.210
want your skin tone to be extremely sharp
because it brings out all of the imperfections

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.950
in the skin but in our case here we're going
to go ahead and increase the sharpness a little

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.979
bit. I'm going to go ahead and set it there.
Now our sharpness has been changed one stop

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:54.460
up, here from the original default setting.
You can see that right next to the place where

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.590
I've set the sharpness is a grade out marker
for where the default setting was originally.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.379
Now if I decide that I don't like this setting,
what I can do is scroll all the way down here

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:17.590
to the bottom where it says default set and
by selecting this button it will automatically

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.189
return the settings of the portrait picture
style back to the original settings. So if

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:32.370
I select that, you can see that the sharpness
setting has been reset back to its original

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.049
setting. So if I want to come back up here
again and change, let's say contrast and maybe

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.760
I want to make the picture a little bit more
contrasty and I move it up there a couple

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.639
stops. Go ahead and press set, that changes
the setting there. If I want to save the setting

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:57.629
what I can do is just go ahead and press the
menu button up here on the top left side of

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:06.139
the body. Now that changes our portrait picture
style. The contrast is now set to two instead

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:13.469
of zero. I've selected that picture style,
that's the style I want to shoot in and now

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.209
we're ready to go.
