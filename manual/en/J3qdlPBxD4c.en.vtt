00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:35.696
When I see a girl in heels

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:43.661
I imagine you in black skirt, red lips

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:52.175
I imagine you'd look sweet, so cold

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:56.017
Like a flower that never withers

00:00:56.017 --> 00:01:00.629
Meet me there late at night

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:08.660
A piece of sweet chocolate cake

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.034
Flowers for you

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:16.941
Lightly sprayed perfume

00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:18.362
Louder (Shout it out)

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:20.288
That I want you in my arms (Shout it out)

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.125
That I want to kiss you (Shout it out)

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:23.202
Please look at me

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.329
Your hair

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:33.244
Keeps flowing

00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:43.176
When I saw you in front of me

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:47.578
Everything stopped

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:53.186
Your heels so sharp, I might be stabbed

00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:56.204
All I can do is watch you

00:01:56.204 --> 00:02:00.762
How painful, I'll lock you in my arms

00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:10.408
A piece of sweet chocolate cake

00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:14.992
Flowers for you

00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:18.706
Lightly sprayed perfume

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:20.134
Louder (Shout it out)

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:22.030
That I want you in my arms (Shout it out)

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.032
That I want to kiss you (Shout it out)

00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:25.516
Please look at me

00:02:29.824 --> 00:02:31.212
Your hair

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.062
Keeps flowing

00:02:42.778 --> 00:02:44.684
Take out coffee, toss it to the wall

00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:46.873
Rooms get messy anyway, don't bother

00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:48.629
Slower, the more we're in a hurry

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.346
Nails digging into my back

00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:57.144
I see you and I turn as hard as stone, get it?

00:02:57.144 --> 00:03:00.070
You're like Medusa, no no, not that you're ugly

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.183
My body language talks, no need for words

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.055
You're so tall baby, come down now

00:03:16.448 --> 00:03:20.104
A piece of sweet chocolate cake

00:03:20.104 --> 00:03:24.659
Flowers for you

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.467
Lightly sprayed perfume

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:29.832
Louder (Shout it out)

00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:31.727
That I want you in my arms (Shout it out) 

00:03:31.727 --> 00:03:33.665
That I want to kiss you (Shout it out)

00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:34.849
Please look at me

00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:40.630
Your hair

00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:44.564
Keeps flowing
