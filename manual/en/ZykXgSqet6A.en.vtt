00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.420
Hello everyone! Today we’re going to learn
about the Solar System.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.860
As you know, the Sun is a star, one of the
many stars that form the Milky Way. 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.430
But for us, it is the most important star shining
in the sky.&nbsp;

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.420
Planets move around the Sun, and so do comets
and asteroids. 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.580
Well, the Sun and everything that revolves around it is what we call the Solar System.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.250
The most interesting things that we should
know about in the solar system are the Planets.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.710
Let’s look at them, starting with the ones
closest to the sun, and then getting further away!

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.280
The closest planet to the Sun is Mercury...

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:09.339
then there is Venus... then comes the Earth.
Yes, our planet where we live...

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:20.209
Then there is Mars... Jupiter,
the largest planet... Saturn... Uranus...

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.910
and then the furthest away is Neptune.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.700
As you can see, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are closer to the sun and also smaller than Jupiter, Saturn,

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.940
Uranus and Neptune.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.780
One important thing you should know
is that the journey that all planets make

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.380
around
the sun is called an orbit.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.380
Now, a question: do you know where
the days of the week... get their names from...?

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.640
Well, if we think about it for a minute...
the Moon,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.110
which is not actually a planet itself, but
Earth’s

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.340
natural satellite...
gives it name to Monday...

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.340
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday come from ancient British gods

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.990
that were related to the planets Mars,
Mercury, Jupiter and Venus...

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.830
Saturday gets its name from Saturn....
and of course, the Sun itself gives us the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.970
name Sunday.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.920
So if you remember that there is also Uranus,
Neptune and our own Earth,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.490
then you know all the names
of the eight planets in the solar system.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.430
Easy, eh?
So, goodbye for now, everyone.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.090
