00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.260
Okay so I have established a basic framework
on here just as a point of starting and I

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:15.930
know that this is going to be the line that
represents the back edge of that table. Everything

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.150
will be measured in terms of that location,
and if I look at my drawing and measure things

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:33.530
out I can pretty well tell that that pot will
land about this location for the top curve

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:51.039
of that little pot. So I'm just going to rough
sketch it out. It goes below the table and

00:00:51.039 --> 00:01:00.149
now I have the first part of my composition
sketched out and that's not a bad place to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.790
begin. Let's see if I can find the other things
that are going on relative to the position

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:19.570
of this one. I can see that this, the back
vase, is about in here and it's coming in

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.030
right along the edge of that golden rectangle
section and it ends a little bit shorter,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.870
and then we've got another larger pot that
relative to there I can see that the pot sticks

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:47.030
up a little bit and is rounded and just touches
from where I can see it here and is pretty

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.730
much even with the bottom here. So I'm just
using this as a framework in order to establish

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.580
the basic shape, and I'm going to go ahead
and let this pot fall outside of our frame

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.500
because what I want to do is I want to make
sure that kitty is about in the right place

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:23.370
and right now that kitty's back is sitting
right in here. So our kitty is landing with

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.489
its heart right about in that golden rectangle
inner section.
