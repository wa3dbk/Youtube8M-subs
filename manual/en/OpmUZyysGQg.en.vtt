TONY RAMIREZ: Hi, my name is Tony Ramirez
and this is the high-definition movies and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.030
players. All right, before we go any farther,
let me explain again the definitive answer

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.720
on TVs. If you're going to be watching the
HD content on your TV, you're going to have

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.050
to have an HD TV of course. So, let me go
through a recap on all these things if you're

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.230
confused by these I's and P's and 480 and
720 and 1080, here's a recap on how things

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.140
work, how thing used to work and how things
will work right now. So, on your standard

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.871
television, whether it is a wide screen standard-definition
TV or one of the square TVs that we've all

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:43.739
had in the past, this is the basics. We have
480i, all right, now what this is 480 lines

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.690
of resolution. Now the "i" stands for interlaced
and what it is--if you can see these blue

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.859
lines that I have here, it's every other line,
so interlaced is like this. You have your

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.609
one, three and five. And then the color bars
would be your two, four and six. Now, how

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.330
the signal is, is there's 30 frames a second
but they're split up in 60 cycles. So, it's

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.110
actually flickering, just like this flicker,
flicker, flicker. So that's what the "i" stands

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.970
for, the interlaced will be flickering. So
that's why if you put a camera up to a TV,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.800
you'll start getting all those weird lines
like that. So this is a good depiction of

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.200
what the "i" stands for in 480i or any of
the other I's which we'll get to. Now "p".

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.440
Now this is your standard DVD. If you have
a DVD player that used to have progressive

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.340
all over the place, the "p" is progressive
or picture or photo however you want to call

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.730
it. So the "p" is actually just like you're
seeing it here. This is an actual size of

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.120
480. This is showing you the entire picture.
So how this would be is almost like you see

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.100
it in the movie theater. It's actually picture,
picture, picture, picture, picture. So that's

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.240
your 480p on a standard-definition TV. Now
we going to HD resolution. There is no more

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.000
720i, there's just 720p. Again, this is the
exact size of the 720p on a 1080 TV which

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.520
we'll get to you in a second. So we have 720
lines of resolution, progressive and the actual

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:09.450
resolution is 1280 x 720. So, on a 720 TV,
you'll get the resolution of 720 lines progressive,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.099
progressive, progressive, progressive. This
will give you a better picture quality. Now,

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.969
all the way up to 1080, this is the big one.
HD resolution of course is 1920 x 1080. Now

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.120
here of course is 1080i. Just as I described
with the 480i, is it's interlaced. You can

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.710
see the lines a little bit better now, but
of course, it's one, three, five and so on

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.420
and then the black lines here are two, four,
six, eight and so on. So this is your standard

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.810
TV if you're getting a signal from the satellite
or cable, whatever it is. Your interlaced

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.230
is actually doing this. You can do "p" as
well, but they're really not broadcasting

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.620
it, not yet. Now, for HD DVD and Blu-ray,
everything is being broadcast or sent out

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.239
signal wise at 1080p and of course, like I
mentioned before it's progressive, progressive,

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.980
progressive. So for the best quality, you
want the "p" on there, the progressive, and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.680
you want the highest number. So here it is
at 1080p.
