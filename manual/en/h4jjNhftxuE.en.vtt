MATT GRAHAM: Now, you've changed the strings
on your guitar but you've got the old strings

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:12.099
that you took off as well as these clippings
that you've just removed from the headstock.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:20.929
I want to talk a little bit about the disposing
of these properly. With both, you can start

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:31.160
with the old strings, you can wind them in
a--just a loose bundle like this. And I have

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.730
an old practice guitar at home. It's kind
of my second-string guitar and sometimes I'll--if

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.290
these sets have a little life in them, I'll
just put them on that guitar. Sometimes, it's

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:57.100
kind of an old-folk legend that you can actually
boil your strings in vinegar and water, and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.150
it removes a lot of the oils and the dirt
that gets in between the grooves of the strings

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.229
and caused them to lose their life. It will
freshen up the sound of these old strings

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.420
a little bit to do that but, yeah, generally,
unless you're going to slap them on an old

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.149
practice guitar, you can just get rid of them.
And the way I would do that is you wind your

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.909
old strings and then you would take your clippings
and very carefully, because they have so many

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:33.390
sharp ends, you just kinda wrap them into
a loose bundle as well. It's just going to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.270
make them more compact. You don't want to
throw these into like a plastic garbage bag

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:50.259
or a paper waste basket because they might
poke out of the trash bag and cut somebody

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.380
or poke somebody on the leg or the arm. And
so I like to take them, all my bundled strings

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.679
that I'm going to throw out, and just put
them back into the box that the new strings

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.260
came from and that will keep those sharp ends
from poking out and getting in your body.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.940
And then I'll throw them away and enjoy the
sound of my new strings.
