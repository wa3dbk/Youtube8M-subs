Hi, I am Jason Mac Genius and we are going
to talk about file sharing today between computers.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.450
Basically, to start with the external options.
You have a flash drive which is usually USB

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.010
and it will hook right into a USB port. And
this will allow you to transfer files quickly

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.090
and easily between computers. And the flash
drives will work between Mac's and PC's with

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.710
no problem. And then you've also got external
storage which is an actual hard drive, and

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.669
this is a smaller two and a half inch hard
drive, enclosed in a case, which is also like

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.299
the flash drive bus powered, which means when
you plug it in, it is powered by the bus on

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:41.589
your computer. So, you don't have to worry
about carry around extra power cords or power

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.030
adapters or anything like that. This just
plugs straight into the computer. And those

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.989
are really nice portable options that you
can use. And, you can pick up those hard drives

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.679
usually anywhere between $80 and you can pay
all the way up to $300 for them, for the larger

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:03.640
capacity ones. But, a 40 gig drive runs about
$100, the smaller drives. So, those options

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.680
are the quickest and most readily available.
And, you can also do file sharing on your

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.361
computers. To do this though, what you first
need to do, is you need to go into your system

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:19.820
preferences which can be accessed down here
by this panel on the dock. I am just going

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.000
ahead and do that. We are going to go to "Internet
and Network". Open "sharing". And, we are

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.009
going to click on "personal file sharing"
and you can see it is starting up here. And

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.579
there is also some other options here, but
we are just going to leave the personal file

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.200
sharing on. And you've got some other options
in here for your firewall. And what we like

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.960
to do is, you can turn the firewall on and
it is as easy as a click, it is build into

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.009
the MacIntosh operating system. And then you've
got your Internet and you can share your connection

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.539
if you are sharing. If you are sharing Internet
access through your computer you can basically

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.680
make your computer basically a hub and to
do that, you just turn on your Internet here

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.371
and you share it through your ethernet or
build in firewall. We are going to leave Internet

00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:27.170
sharing off for now. And in your firewall
pane, if you go to your advanced button here,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.629
you are going to see some stuff. And this
is build into the system once again, you can

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.580
enable stealth note which ensures that uninvited
traffic receives no response. And that is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.569
what I usually do and that is a pretty secure
thing. And, our file sharing is on and that

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.530
is how you setup file sharing on a MacIntosh.
I am Jason McGenius talk to you later.
