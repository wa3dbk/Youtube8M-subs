00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.399
The marine organism we are going to identify
now, is the Indigo Hamlet. The Indigo Hamlet

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.290
is one of the smaller members of the seabass
family of fish. But, it is also one of the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.540
more recognizable and identifiable fish that
you'll see exploring the coral reef. Some

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.320
references describe them as having broad bright
blue vertical bars over their white body.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.140
But since they are mostly bright blue colored,
I prefer to describe them as a bright blue

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.410
fish with narrow blue to blueish white irregular
vertical bars over their body. Their face

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.290
is almost always completely blue as are the
ventral fins. The tail, dorsal, pectoral and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.840
anal fins are usually clear. But the challenge
is finding this fish. They are common only

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.710
in a few areas around the Caribbean. These
areas include the Cayman Islands, the Bay

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.770
Islands, Honduras, and Jamaica. They are occasionally
seen around the Bahamas and Belize and rarely

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.149
seen elsewhere in the Caribbean. They range
in size from three to four inches and reach

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.080
a maximum length of five and a half inches.
When you find one, it will generally be alone,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.420
as they tend to be solitary animals that range
over a limited, territorial area. They are

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.470
also a relatively deep dwelling fish, usually
found between thirty and a hundred and thirty

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.970
feet. Although there are reports of them on
reefs as shallow as ten feet. Indigo Hamlets

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.479
spend most of their time cruising along the
reef, staying relatively close to the bottom.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.400
If it feel threatened, it will quickly retreat
into a hole in the reef. Some Indigo Hamlets,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.210
however, are curious, and will retreat a short
distance and then turn to watch a diver. So,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.680
close approaches are possible if one moves
cautiously. Indigo Hamlets feed primarily

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.610
on zoo plankton and other tiny marine organisms.
They will also occasionally munch on small

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.990
bony fishes. Most of their diet consists of
small crabs, isopods, mysids and shrimps.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.080
Indigo Hamlets are synchronous hermaphrodites.
This means they possessed both male and female

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.680
sex organs at the same time, and both are
fully functional. This does not mean however,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.379
that they fertilize their own eggs. It simply
means that when two Indigo Hamlets mate, they

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:24.169
take turns fertilizing each others eggs to
ensure genetic variety continues in the species.

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:28.870
Spawning occurs when a pair of Indigo Hamlets
swim together towards the surface, releasing

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.639
their gametes at the apogee of their rise,
and quickly returning to the safety of the

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.950
bottom. That's the Indigo Hamlet.
