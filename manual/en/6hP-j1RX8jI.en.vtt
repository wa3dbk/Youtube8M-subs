00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.670
Hi, I'm Christie, with
Duck Brand duct tape.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.480
Today, I'm going to show you how
to make a holiday tree ornament.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.790
This is an advanced craft that should
take about 45 minutes to complete.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.230
The materials you need for
this project are green, red,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.840
and chrome duct tape, a green pipe
cleaner, poster board, and scissors.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.760
For the first step,
take your poster board

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.810
and wrap it into a small cone that
will be the shape of your holiday tree.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.660
And then cut along the bottom so you
have a flat surface, which, actually,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.750
it's about the size of this right here.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.350
And I've already gone ahead and covered
the entire cone with green duct tape.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.560
Next, we are going to make
the duct tape loops that

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.570
are the branches on your tree.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.290
So, again, I'm working
with green, and I'm

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.310
going to pull off about
12 inches of tape.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.349
And lay it sticky side up,
flat on your cutting board.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:08.650
I'm going to rip the same amount
of tape, again, about 12 inches.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.830
And I'm going to lay it
sticky side to sticky side

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.360
to create a duct tape fabric.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.130
I'm going to trim the edges off
here because my second piece was

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.040
a little bit shorter.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.800
And now you have a two-sided
strip of duct tape.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.650
And I'm going to cut
this into thirds, so

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.020
making two cuts, one here and one here.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.070
It's OK if they're not all
perfectly even because we

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.220
are going to be folding them over,
and you won't notice anyways.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.420
So I'm taking my three strips and just
stacking them on top of each other.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.940
And now I'm going to cut
two-inch sections of this strip

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.250
to create the individual loops.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.490
I have now taken a piece of
duct tape about five inches long

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.050
and ripped it into thirds.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.810
So I have it laying sticky side up.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.650
And I'm taking one of my two-inch pieces
of double-sided tape that we just made

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.880
and first laying it down about halfway
through the middle of the tape,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.310
and then the bottom half have
right above it, still leaving

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.080
a layer of adhesive
on top running along.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.460
And we'll continue to do this,
leaving a little bit of a gap

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.270
in between each of the
pieces that you put on there,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.870
running all along to the
end of the piece of tape.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.400
Now I have a couple of
these completed, so I'll

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.070
start to show you how to
actually apply it to the cone.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.350
And we're going to start at the bottom.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.950
So lining up the bottom of the
loop with the bottom of the tree,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.280
stick the tape on like that.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.190
And work all the way around the bottom.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.280
I think that would be the easiest way.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.770
Once you reach the second layer,
just like we've done in our sample,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.050
we overlaid the loops in between
the one that's right below it.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.740
So you have a layered
look, and I'm just going

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.030
to continue to do this until my
entire cone is covered with loops.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.450
The next step is to
create the hook where

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.090
you could actually hang it on a tree.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.030
So I'm starting with a
piece of pipe cleaner,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.850
and I'm going to cut
about four to five inches.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.000
And I'm going to fold it into a loop
and just put it on top of the tree.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.790
I've also already ripped off
a small piece of duct tape

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.642
and then ripped it in half
so it's a little bit thinner.

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:32.540
And I'm just going to wrap this
around and tape the pipe cleaner

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.030
to the top of the tree.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.190
I already went ahead and
created little ornaments

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.241
that were just from a duct tape
sheet that I cut out into squares.

00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:44.240
If you can't find a sheet
or you don't have one,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.940
you can also just roll out duct tape
and use a crafting knife or scissors

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.110
to cut the little pieces out.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.420
I also actually made a star.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.400
And I'm just sticking it to the top.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.780
And that's how you make
a holiday tree ornament.
