Hi, I'm Johan Svahnstrom on behalf of Expert
Village. The first thing you're going to do

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.839
when you choose to set up your snake tank
is to find the appropriate enclosure for the

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:15.219
type of snake that you are going to get. If
you're choosing to buy a baby snake, one of

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.430
the colubrid, it's like a corn snake or a
king snake or something like that, it's sufficient

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.970
to start of with one of these plastic shoe
boxes. Actually the smaller the better in

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.511
the beginning so that the snakes feel comfortable
in their new environment. If your snake is

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:37.030
a little bit larger than a baby colubrid,
like a yearling colubrid or even a full-grown

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.680
smaller-size colubrid like a California king
snake or even a baby python maybe. You might

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.789
want to choose a little bit larger of a cage
in the beginning. This size here is approximately

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:56.260
a twenty gallon wide tank, however it's custom
built so it's a little bit different than

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.190
what you might find in the stores. This enclosure
is good for a baby python, a baby boa, or

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.121
a medium-size colubrid for the first year
or two. If you are getting a snake that is

00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:13.000
a little bit bigger than a baby colubrid or
a yearling colubrid, maybe a full-size corn

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.040
snake, full-size king snake, full-size milk
snake, or even a yearling boa or python - a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.330
twenty gallon long tank might be appropriate.
It is important that it's a twenty gallon

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.850
long tank, not necessarily a high tank because
they do like a lot of floor space - the species

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.640
that I just mentioned. This tank here would
be perfect for a full-grown colubrid and you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.490
actually never have to change it. You could
keep this for the full life of the snake.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.930
If you're buying a tree snake such as an Amazon
tree boa, an emerald tree boa, or a green

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.820
tree python, you're going to have to look
at the height of the cage more than the length

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.530
and the width because those animals spend
ninety-five to a hundred percent of their

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:12.220
lives in branches so they do need a high cage.
If you're getting a large colubrid or a mid-sized

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.200
boa or python this cage here is a perfect
enclosure for them. It's a fifty-five gallon

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.969
long tank that will work great for those species
that I just mentioned. We are going to use

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.590
this tank today to show how to put it all
together to get a perfect enclosure for your

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.830
mid-sized python or colubrid.
