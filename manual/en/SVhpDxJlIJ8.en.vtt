Welcome! I am DJI Evangilist Randy Jay Braun.
In this video, I'm going to talk about safe

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.410
flying practices. Now this video is mainly
for new flyers those of you who just took

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.680
your phantom out of the box. And to help me
today, i've invited Mitch Bergsma. Come introduce

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:33.780
yourself Mitch. Hi, My name is Mitch Bergsma.
Mitch is an extreme sports enthusiast, a very

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.160
popular YouTuber, and a heck of a great phantom
pilot. Thank you Mitch. Ok let's get started.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.360
Know your responsibilities as a pilot. Read
and understand the FAA's guidelines for model

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.619
aircraft. These include the following: never
fly over 400 feet in altitude, always remain

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:58.839
at least 5 miles from an airport, never fly
over urban areas or large groups of people,

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.579
and keep a direct line of sight on your phantom.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.920
An important part of flying safely is to establish
your home point. Be aware of you surroundings.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.990
Look for trees, look for power lines, look
for powerful antennas.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.070
Hey Mitch! Mitch! Get outside with that! Fly
safe buddy! Go!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.040
Also, give your phantom plenty of time to
warm up. You'll know it's ready when you see

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.880
a single flashing green light.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.220
Here are a few additional tips for safe flying.
Check all three batteries. Check the battery

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.420
in your phantom. Check the batteries in your
transmitter, and check the charge of your

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.420
wifi extender. Next, turn on all of the components
in the proper order. Turn on your transmitter

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.910
first, turn on your wifi extender next, and
then you can turn on your phantom.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.760
As a beginner, please orient the phantom properly
when you take off. You want the green lights

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.950
facing you and the red lights facing forward.
When you fly, also as a beginner, try to keep

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.870
that same orientation with the green lights
always facing yourself. Try not to fly over

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.910
a hundred feet away or a hundred feet in altitude
too soon. And finally, just keep this phantom

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.600
in front of you as you fly.
