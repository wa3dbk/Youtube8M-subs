00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:21.020
Well, this is not what you're used to. You get to see my face!

00:00:21.043 --> 00:00:29.030
We've got an SLS AMG today, and after many requests we're going to try presenting and see how it goes!

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:40.062
It's minus 5 degrees celcius outside, with tires fitted with about 3mm of thread, so we'll try to take it easy today.

00:00:50.035 --> 00:01:01.039
It has 571 BHP from the 6.2L V8, and hooked to the seven-speed double-clutch gearbox from the Ferrari California is a match made in heaven.

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:10.060
It is incredibly direct and feels like much more than 571 BHP. This thing is a beast!

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:37.054
The noise is insane. When you floor it, it just keeps going and keeps getting louder.

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:41.054
I'll demonstrate by some donwshifts.

00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:56.024
Sometimes it seems like there's somebody in the trunk with some gas, and sprays this on the exhaust.

00:01:57.038 --> 00:02:00.003
Some nice backfire.

00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:32.075
And of course it looks amazing as well.

00:02:50.029 --> 00:03:05.074
Those gullwing doors, i don't care what you think. They're a litte flashy, a little bit unpractical, but it's still better than those lambo-style doors you can get on your Corsa for 500 euros.

00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:21.087
This car is supposed to compete with the Porsche 911 Turbo and the Ferrari 458 Italia.

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:31.082
With the 911 Turbo you could just as well get in your neighbours car and Ferrari is still coping with some image issues.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:39.099
And with this car you can see that people appreciate it. They appreciate the styling, the sound and they come up to you.

00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:44.047
And that's gotta be worth something...

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.052
...and it's fast too!

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:14.061
All this power does come in handy when joining the traffic I must say!

00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:19.082
[Enjoying himself]

00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:51.031
We've just experienced the appreciation people have for this car.

00:04:52.038 --> 00:04:55.024
We were pulled over because we were speeding a bit.

00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:59.057
But he just wanted to take a closer look at the car.

00:05:00.052 --> 00:05:02.038
So we were let go.

00:05:03.057 --> 00:05:08.031
Highway patrol drives a new 5-series these days so I think the crisis is over!

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.013
Keep in mind, this is the first time we do anything like this.

00:05:20.064 --> 00:05:22.059
Take that with you in your comments.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.001
We are open to any pointers you may have, but in the end we do all of this for you!

00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:28.024
Right?

00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:31.011
Yeah what a shitty job we have.
