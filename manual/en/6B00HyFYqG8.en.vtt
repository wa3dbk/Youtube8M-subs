i am a start with the fattest picture you'll
probably see today

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.960
uh... it's a picture of a dog and the reason
why this is relevant is because right now

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.359
rio de janeiro

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.839
is suffering from huge floods in fact uh...
that eighty reports that the rains dobbs uh...

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.699
in the past couple days are the equivalent
of the amount of rain that uh... usually falls

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.899
within a month looking so they're huge mudslides
lots of floods and so far six hundred fifty

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.530
five people have died

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.890
one person who died is a person by the name
of christina maria santana

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.820
and this picture that you see right now is
a picture of a dog who visits her grave every

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.540
single day narrow a lesser dog obviously now
that's your dog

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.210
are

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.760
of it are one thing that can bring it to your
thinking about it and that's why people become

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.730
so it has been done there so long hill

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.140
that's why michael vick which should still
be in jail

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.840
predict that

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.450
uh... getting object

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.260
uh... but yet of course that that's what it
called a man's best friend arc

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.320
and he said they're waiting for your register
says the world that we need people to really

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.189
confused on the verge of mice

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.960

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.420
ibid

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.970
that was fun moment there's

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.550
it an appointment of a going back

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.370
or john bainer depending on your life you
know what it is it's because you know where

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.750
you see people think

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.130
were used to people and seeing him in a motion

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.549
and for us is the most normal thing in the
world but when you see in animal feeling emotional

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.310
nome is on their idea would increase gundogan
made from a zip code is crazy and i don't

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.500
know why i watch him he liked anna's cotton

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.650
she was a rational person world bank no people
on the line saying that you know what you

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.110
grow tax than they become party or family
and that's why i can't because they're not

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.479
played in terms of

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.280
they really are loyal to amin that sits

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.659
it's farther g's and other animal but

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.029
look at that heat that dog is not getting
fed by that owner anymore

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.619
that's always come back

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.129
he's come back because in is all the way

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.419

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.989
and uh... and i i i'm not a dog order

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.390
uh... but i get it back now were resident
on here

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.550
was a u_s_ peace

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.389
that had different point of view

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:32.069
not know how long advanced alaska has a question
so that's all you do u_s_ supporters and and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.319
the people the simpsons report they decided
to bring this tentative i'd oppose wonder

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.989
is it

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.449
you feel that for the dog owner as old as
i hear like you know as as we were does i'm

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.639
not analogously becomes asking where gilkisson
on some of the

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.189
the motion

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.049
hitting up over you know when it is it's it's
yet you feel bad for the dog but i don't think

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.069
that's the reason it tears i think seeing
that

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.159
that level of loyalty needs touching it's
more touching and depressing mezzo you know

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.949
that picture for some reason like really hit
me and uh... itself course time for me to

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:09.839
