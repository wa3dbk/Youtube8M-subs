"Jim, what do young people worship today?

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:03.959
What do they hang onto?

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.139
What do they believe in, what do they hope
for?"

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:20.130
"I can't speak for, uh, young people, probably
uh, my guess would be the things they always

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:42.070
celebrated just kind of a joy of existence,
self discovery, uh freedom, I think it's amazing."

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.320
Young Vigilante, rappers gotta up the ante
You see I'm feeling antsy, something like

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.770
I'm peeling panties
I'm getting close to blow

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.090
Cup runneth over, uh, four-leaf clover huh?

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.940
Naw this is God's will
Never been lost here, I've forged my own path

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.190
Now you do the math, don't get caught inside
our cross hairs

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.460
Yea I've been exhausted, but I never lost
it

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.519
Taking the long road, man y'all wonder what
it cost him

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.560
Thousands to millions but I still feel awesome
Don't do this for a dollar, although I need

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.380
it to progress
Bars hold weight, uplifting, y'all see my

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.280
arm strength
Hooks, lines, and thinkers, I ain't fishing

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.069
for no compliments
I'm just trying to save my audience, lyrical

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:24.290
disarmament
So forth and so on again, they say I'm trying

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.420
to play God again
I'm just a freedom writer, with the heart

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.530
of ten, yeah

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.130
How do you gonna stop, how you gonna stop,
how you gonna stop a rider

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.369
See what I stand for, is what I live for,
and what I'd die for

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.369
Freedom Writer

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.049
When the last needle drops, and every record
stops, we will be the survivors

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.590
See what I stand for, is What I live for,
and what I'd die for

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.590
Freedom Writer

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.599
I ran into a young man in his green and khaki
school uniform

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.459
White ear buds, head phones on, headed home
To the Iberville Projects, where right across

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.659
the street
I just left a meeting with the Mayor and Spike

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.809
Lee
Trying to figure out a route to stop black

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:04.590
on black killing
And value the life they living and escape

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.560
mental prison
Meanwhile, lil' homie recognized my face (Dee-1!)

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.450
He called my name, ran across the street and
then we embraced

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.010
He took a moment to tell me he was a fan
And about his future plans to be in the same

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.650
position that I am
I said, 'Shorty, you know I went to school,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.650
right?'

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.650
He said, 'You graduated and taught middle
school, too, right?

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.489
But I just saw your video on MTV 2, right?'

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.150
And honestly, that's what gave me the motivation
to write

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:40.180
He said, 'Thank you,' then we parted ways
He just inspired the inspirer, that's why

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.180
I'm giving praise
Dee-1

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.180
How do you gonna stop, how you gonna stop,
how you gonna stop a rider

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.180
See what I stand for, is what I live for,
and what I'd die for

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.180
Freedom Writer

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.160
When the last needle drops, and every record
stops, we will be the survivors

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.810
See what I stand for, is What I live for,
and what I'd die for

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.810
Freedom Writer

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.750
Deep inside my mediation, seconds from detonation
I had a revelation, that I could possibly

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.359
be the one to restore the nation
Or the generation, I'm getting sick of waiting,

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:10.523
I must practice patience
Screaming 'F the world,' the F stands for

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.523
Free
I'll stand for you, if you stand for me

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:15.720
Not gonna lie, my confidence be fleeting
But then I read the news, we are only human

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.140
beings
We struggle in our bubble, we need something

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.879
to believe in
I've scuffled with rebuttals, but I see your

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.640
interest piquing
Quick come inside the huddle, I got something

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.689
really subtle
R.A.R.E.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.719
Nation is the vessel, O.M.A.R. is the shuttle
We taking it to newer heights, trying to shine

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.670
a newer light
Media's the medium, we trying to serve up

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.499
food for thought
O.M.A.R you are not alone, R.A.R.E.

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.549
Nation moved up on the block
Dee-1 and Palermo Stone, I promise you we

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.249
got it locked
I promise you we got it locked

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.780
Dee-1 and Palermo Stone, we gonna take it
to the top

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.829
How do you gonna stop, how you gonna stop,
how you gonna stop a rider

00:03:51.829 --> 00:04:04.920
See what I stand for, is what I live for,
and what I'd die for

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.420
Freedom Writer

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.650
When the last needle drops, and every record
stops, we will be the survivors

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.859
See what I stand for, is What I live for,
and what I'd die for

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.219
