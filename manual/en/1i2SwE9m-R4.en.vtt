00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.370
What's the difference between a stock suspension system and an Eibach system?

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.600
With Eibach, your vehicle not only looks more aggressive,

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.220
it also gains more-responsive cornering and improved stability.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.400
How much better?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.320
We're about to show you 3 testing maneuvers:

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.360
A slalom test, a full-on braking test, and a divided-traction braking test.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.010
Our driver, of course, is a professional.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.450
On the left, you see a current BMW 3-series with the stock BMW suspension system.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.080
On the right is the same model, but with an Eibach Sport System Plus:

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.150
A full-on sport-suspension package

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.500
with precisely matched springs, dampers, and anti-roll bars.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.260
We will also show you a more conservative approach,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.850
replacing the stock springs with Eibach Pro-Kit springs alone.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.420
Pro-Kit performance springs lower your vehicle up to 40 mm,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.170
Sport-System Plus springs, as shown here, lower it up to 50 mm.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.820
At Eibach, striking the right balance is key.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.090
We never lower a vehicle so much that its overall performance and handling are compromised.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.620
We run this slalom at a steady 45 mph.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.550
the road surface is slightly wet, which will make things a little more challenging.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.500
Here is the standard suspension.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.990
Look and listen to how the vehicle handles:

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.150
[ tires squealing ]

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.610
Next: the Eibach Pro-Kit performance springs.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.380
[ tires squealing very little ]

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.330
And third: the full Sport-System-Plus.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.110
Listen here as well:

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.880
[ tires not squealing ]

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.230
No more squealing tires, but instead an obvious improvement.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.090
All our kits lower the vehicle's center of mass,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.130
the Eibach-tuned dampers and anti-roll bars of the Sport-System-Plus

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.110
reduce body roll even more.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.940
Let's watch again:

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.940
The lower center of mass reduces weight transfer

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.310
and improves performance and control in braking as well.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.090
We will do maximum-effort braking, again from 45 mph.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.730
With the stock suspension, the front end "dives" dramatically, while the rear rises

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.270
concentrating excessive weight on the front tires and brakes.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.240
With Pro-Kit performance springs the diving effect is significantly less.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.340
And now, Sport-System-Plus.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.470
At maximum breaking the body stays almost horizontal --

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.670
thanks to precisely engineered dampers and springs.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.890
And the less the front goes down, the more weight remains on the rear tires,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.230
resulting in a significantly shorter braking distance.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.900
What happens when you have different traction on each side?

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.570
Here, the right side is extremely slippery,

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.770
while the left side is on normal pavement --

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.330
-- as though the right side of the car is aquaplaning.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.610
With the standard suspension

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.740
the vehicle swerves wildly when the brakes are applied.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.150
The right wheels have less grip, so the car starts to turn.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.350
But on the soft stock springs, the car's mass follows the tires too slowly,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.620
allowing the car to swerve back and forth.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.450
Now with Eibach Pro-Kit springs:

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.490
The car is much more controlled, even in this challenging situation.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.430
Eibach Sport-System-Plus:

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.050
The car's motion is being kept stable by the stiffer performance-tuned springs,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.210
anti-roll bars, and Eibach-tuned dampers.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.930
Eibach suspension technology makes your car more stable

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.980
and more controllable -- under virtually any condition.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.470
The only world-class components engineered with

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.240
The Will To Win!
