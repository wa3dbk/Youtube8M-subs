Hello my name is Max and this film is all about me.

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:30.210
I am six years old and my brother Thomas is 11 years old.

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:39.397
I have a condition called hy...po...hidrotic ecto...

00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:45.710
hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:50.092
I am the only one with the condition in my family.

00:00:51.654 --> 00:00:54.402
Dad, can you explain what my condition is?

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:58.842
Well it’s a genetic condition, and a genetic condition you are born with.

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:06.343
Your body is made up of genes, and genes are the instructions that tell your body how to grow and how to work.

00:01:07.343 --> 00:01:13.528
In your case one of your genes didn’t work properly so you have ectodermal dysplasia,

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:16.842
and some parts of your body are different to other people’s.

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:24.716
So your hair, Max, is very fine and very sparse and doesn’t grow as much as Thomas’s, does it?

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:29.466
I mean Thomas has to get his hair cut all the time but you don’t have to have your hair cut as often as he does.

00:01:30.843 --> 00:01:33.030
But you still gel it up and spike it up, don’t you?

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:40.343
Now your teeth, you haven’t got any teeth, have you?  That’s part of your condition as well.

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:44.094
Some of the children who have this condition, their teeth don’t form properly,

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.593
and for you, you haven’t got any teeth at all.

00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:52.344
Now because you haven’t got any teeth we have to watch what you eat quite closely,

00:01:52.716 --> 00:02:01.780
and so you have to eat a lot of soft foods, and some different foods to Thomas because you can’t chew them or bite them.

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.656
But an apple, you couldn’t bite an apple, could you?

00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:09.528
That still doesn’t get you out of cleaning your gums!

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.843
Dad, why is it that I get hot sometimes?

00:02:15.496 --> 00:02:21.620
The reason you get hot is because your sweat glands haven’t formed properly,

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:26.121
and sweat glands help control your body temperature.

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:31.528
So when you get hot, people normally sweat and that cool’s people down.

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:35.772
But because you can’t sweat we have to cool you down in other ways,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.209
so that’s why we have lots of drinks and lots of cold water to get you cool.

00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:48.531
So when you play football, because you’re running around a lot we have to make sure that you’re not getting too hot,

00:02:49.462 --> 00:02:55.086
so that’s why when we go to watch me and mummy have the water sprays to keep you nice and cool,

00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:57.022
and we cool you down very quickly.

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:02.717
So Max even though you have this condition and you’re different to some other children,

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:07.656
you can still play football and you can still do everything all the other children do.

00:03:09.658 --> 00:03:12.781
We just have to make sure that you don’t get too hot when you do it.

00:03:14.032 --> 00:03:22.280
I am very sporty; I am very clever; and I am very good!
