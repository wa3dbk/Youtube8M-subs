&gt;&gt;Matt Lieberman: Good morning. I’m Matt Lieberman, and this is Forcefed. What did you hear correctly?

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.640
Damn right. Open wide and gobble up this plate
o’ knowledge!

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.140
Boom!

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.160
[MUSIC]

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.720
America. Land of the free, home of the brave,
and birthplace to bacon-wrapped bacon. We

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.110
have the biggest portions, the biggest appetites,
and the biggest wet asses. Wait, that might

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.060
just be a porn I saw once.
The Center for Science in the Public Interest

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.960
has just released their Xtreme Eating Awards
winners for 2014. Now I say winners, but these

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.570
are the most unhealthy dishes at restaurant
chains around the country. Now, many of you

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.840
have already divided into two camps, and I
respect both of them equally: The people who

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.500
are like, “Disgusting! I can’t believe
that people have been eating that!” and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.620
the people who are like, “Great! I’m going
to conquer all of these. Bring it, Lieberman,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.489
you culinary pansy!” Okay, you don’t have
to yell.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.660
The Cheesecake Factory is the most well-represented
restaurant on this list, with three, count

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.390
em, three entree entries. First, their Bruleed
French Toast, dubbed “The best french toast

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.960
ever!” in the menu, is “Extra thick slices
of rustic french bread baked and grilled golden

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.860
brown, topped with powdered sugar and served
with maple-butter syrup and bacon or grilled

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.360
ham.” Look at this picture. It doesn’t
look like a lot, but this one plate contains

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.540
2780 calories, 93 grams, or five days worth,
of saturated fat, 2230 milligrams of sodium,

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.220
and and 24 teaspoons of sugar. According to
the CSPI, you’d have to swim laps for seven

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.380
hours to burn off this one meal.
Next up is their Farfalle with Chicken and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.170
Roasted Garlic. Oh, that doesn’t sound so
bad! Chicken is lean protein, yeah, pasta

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.049
isn’t great for you, but how bad could it
be? Well when you add pancetta and their roasted

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.340
garlic-parmesan cream sauce, you wind up with
a fat and salt bomb that has 2410 calories

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.840
and 63 grams of sat fat, and 1370 mg’s of
sodium, which is just under a full day’s

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.259
worth. You’d have to jog for a solid 5 hours
to burn this puppy off. Sorry, not puppy,

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.259
adult saint bernard.&nbsp;
Closing out Cheesecake Factory’s offerings

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.520
is a slice of Reese’s Peanut Butter Chocolate
Cake Cheesecake. As you must imagine, any

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.890
dish that has cake TWICE in the name is bad
for you, with 1500 calories and 43 grams of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.780
saturated fat. One slice is like eating a
whole Sara Lee Classic Cheesecake topped with

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.500
a cup of Breyers Chocolate Ice Cream.
Another stand-out entry is Joe’s Crab Shack’s

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.340
Big Hook Up platter, which comes with Fish
n chips, coconut shrimp, crab stuffed shrimp,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.610
hushpuppies, cole slaw, and something called
Great Balls of Fire, which are seafood and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.420
crab balls full of jalepenos and cream cheese,
coated in panko breadcrumbs, fried, and served

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.560
with ranch. Now, even I’ll admit that all
of that sounds awesome, but this dish has

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.560
a whopping 3280 calories, 50 grams of saturated
fat, and 7610 mg of sodium. That’s a five

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.540
day supply on one white plate! No! Put it
down! Stop it!

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.300
NO BALLS OF FIRE! STOP! No balls of ice either.  Actually ice is okay, cause it's just water.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.060
Now what is number one? Brace yourselves.
Red Robin’s slogan is Red Robin dot dot

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.880
dot Yum. This dish is more Red Robin dot dot
dot Um?

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.000
Good for you Lieberman.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.380
Ya nailed it.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.099
First of all, Red Robin is best known for their bottomless steak fries, a never
ending tater trough that accompanies all of

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.590
their burgers, which you can Monster-size
for $1.99. Well the Monster-sized version

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.440
of their A.1. Peppercorn burger, which is
topped with bacon, pepper jack, A.1. peppercorn

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.340
spread, tomatoes, and crispy onion straws,
combined with even just one serving of the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.129
bottomless fries and the Monster-sized Salted
Caramel Milkshake, comes out at a gut-busting

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:30.819
3540 calories, about 2 days worth, 69 grams
or 3.5 days worth of saturated fat, and four

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.459
days worth of sodium, about 6,280 milligrams.
That’s like eating seven McDonald’s McDoubles

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.339
and four cups of coke. You’d have to power-walk
for 12 straight hours to burn it off. HELL NO.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.080
Now, I wanna hear from you. What is the worst, most disgusting, sloppiest, fattiest thing you've ever had at a restaurant.?

I'm Matt Lieberman and I want you to eat these things, so I don't have to.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.580
Yeah!
