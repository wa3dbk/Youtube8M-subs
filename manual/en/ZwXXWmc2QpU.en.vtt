00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.840
ELIZABETH STREB: They call the action Streb.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:13.480
And we think it stands for strength, trust,
risk, energy, body.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.830
[Music]

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.320
My studio in Brooklyn, my laboratory, is called
Slam! and that stands for Streb Lab for Action

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.699
Mechanics.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.770
It's designed to be open source.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.369
it's all public, all the time.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.789
Y'know, sort of modeled after a 7/11 rather
than a church.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.570
I'd love it to be a public park.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.961
I want to see if there's some equation that
would create a vibrant space that was all

00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:45.130
public all the time and I chose Streb Extreme
Action and we would share that space with

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.739
Kids' Action, which now has something like
350 kids a week come through there and our

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.489
rehearsals and some of our shows would happen
there.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.649
And a rental program.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.489
I was very interested in seeing how my dancers
could rehearse while kids were flying around

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.050
and renters were there with their lyra and
their hoops.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.780
I wanted to demythologize the practice of
making work and bring back in some of the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.109
people that as a young artist, y'know I couldn't
keep out because I was working in cheap spaces

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.450
that had a lot of traffic.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.040
So going back to that has revitalized my practice
and also I keep meeting all these people.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.130
They come in y'know.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.579
They're kids from a high school in the Bronx
or they're a family that met us in Wyoming

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.459
when we were touring and it has been a vivid
exchange of information.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:43.539
I think also the notion—the notion that
there's maybe three things going on at the

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.969
same time while I'm rehearsing in the middle
of the day with my company.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.740
I don't know who those people are.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.009
We just glance across the space and acknowledge
each other and each others' practice and in

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.610
this osmotic way, learn from it.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.859
It's just been a very invigorating idea my
question now is the messages embedded in the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.349
surface of the outside of buildings like you
talk of Lincoln Center or Carnagie Hall or

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.560
City Center or BAM, etcetera etcetera are
in those fabrics.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.560
Those materials.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.680
Y'know, glass and wood and brick.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.209
And I guess the final thing I'd say that I
thought was most critical was what do I offer?

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.489
I was trying to take what I've made in the
high art world y'know because I had to have

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.280
a reputation to do this type of this experiment
and I wanted to throw that product, that movement

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.159
that I call pop action, back onto the slop
of the street.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:46.190
No one cared and respected it at all to see
and examine what relevance it might have and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.890
I also wanted to understand issues of class
and I came from the working class, I was adopted

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.690
at two years old and my father was—my adoptive
father—was a mason and it was not, it is

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.250
not like that in the dance world.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.640
Anyway, I am very very interested in diversifying
the audience.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.849
And the audience I just don't mean race and
point of view.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.990
I mean class and I believe that the theater…
it's difficult to have a very working class

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.300
person, it's not impossible, to go into a
theater and feel comfortable.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.360
So I want that to be true of SLAM.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.969
I want them to walk in there and just think
it's their space.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.079
They pay taxes and they own it.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.420
I believe it's critical to keep it public,
keep it open to intruders and I actually think

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.719
the equation of strangers and interruption
create magic.

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.760
There's not an idea that exists that can't
be interrupted if it's a good enough idea

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.890
it'll come back to you and I think that that
makes the space vibrant because what's more

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.230
critical than construction workers building
a building.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.590
Everyone's watching them.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.680
Why can't I be watched?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.380
I'm never going to talk anyone into believing
this is critical and it increases our vital

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.670
life signs and our happiness quotient and
all that.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.620
Again, we're still gathering data.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.620
I can't prove anything.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.390
We just notice how much fun it is to go to
work.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.010
I'm Elizabeth Streb.
