00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.670
So you're engaged, you're planning your wedding
and you're thinking about how to honor your

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.420
parents, for your wedding. And at your wedding.
Well, my name is Lori Randall with Simply

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.620
Divine Events. And I'm going to tell you,
how you can honor your parents, at your wedding.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.000
At your wedding ceremony, one idea to do is
actually wearing your mother's wedding gown.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Or maybe you can wear a piece of her wedding
gown. And somehow incorporate it, into the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.240
design of your wedding dress. Another option
to do, is getting a picture of your mother's

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.790
bouquet. And bringing it to the florist and
making a replica of her bouquet. And show

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.530
them that. So that way, you can be honoring
your parents. And honoring your mother and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.940
her marriage. Another thing to think about,
when you are looking to honor your family

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.889
and your parents. Is maybe, reading a poem
or reading during your wedding ceremony. Talking

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.760
about your parents and doing a dedication,
to them. If there is any deceased parents

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.209
or grand parents. Ask the Priest or the officiant
to recognize them and honor them, within your

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:08.510
ceremony. Some other things that I've seen,
people have done to honor their parents at

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.930
their reception. Or even at the ceremony.
They'll put on the guest book table, pictures

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.780
of their parents. They might have a picture
of their parents at their wedding. And then,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.280
they might have a picture of you. Maybe, at
your engagement shoot. Putting both sides

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.282
of the families. If you have divorced parents,
you might want to think about a having a picture

00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:33.850
of the groom. With his parents. Or having
a picture of the bride with her parents. Or

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.200
you know, with the father and the mother.
That way you're kind of, including everyone.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.930
But you're not making people feel uncomfortable.
You can also, when you're, if you're saying

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.001
a toast or speech. At the rehearsal dinner.
Thank them, you know, talk about your parents.

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:54.110
And how much you know, love and support they've
brought into the two of you. Also you can

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.940
host a wedding Sunday brunch or Saturday brunch,
if you have it on a Friday. Or just a brunch,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.840
after the wedding. And thanking them in, first
their support and then for throwing this wedding

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.989
for you. You can also just give them a small
gift as a token. And thank them and honor

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.019
them. So again, my name is Lori Randall, with
Simply Divine Events. And I hope this gives

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.959
you a little bit of insight. On how you can
honor your parents, at your wedding.
