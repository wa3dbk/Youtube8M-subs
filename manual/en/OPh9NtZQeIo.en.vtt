00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.500
Hey fellas I'm finally done my latest project check it out

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.740
I built myself a 2X12 cab based on an Orange design

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.760
It took me a couple months off and on with some help from my dad

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.210
I took a ton video along the way showing you all steps that I took to make this

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.879
cabinet

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.690
and hopefully I can fill in some
questions for the rest of you. At the end

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.300
I'll do a cost breakdown and hopefully a demo

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.309
and give replies to any questions that
people have

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.830
check it out. So here's my design

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.750
It is 66 centimeters wide 30
centimeters deep and 54

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.809
centimeters tall

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.969
Or 25 inches wide 12 inches deep
alright so that's the wood

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.510
2X4 of Russian Birch plywood

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.630
 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.360
One is  11.5mm the other is 18.5 mm so that translates

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.830
to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.290
1/2" or 3/4" inch plywood
alright so that's the difference in

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.540
thickness so the word

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.259
originally had bought half-inch and I was
concerned that it wasn't going to be strong

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:20.820
enough

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.170
So I went back and i got a piece a
three-quarter

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.409
for the outside portion of the box the
battle front and back will be with the

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.409
half-inch

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.960
the ends are cut and now we are going to create box joints

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.860
and get it all glued together

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.860
 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.860
 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.610
 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.610
 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.790
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.160
 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.740
the box joints are all made we end up
making three quarter because

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.400
a that's the bit that we ha.  So there is a
few more than

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.870
maybe we should had but, i think its
ready to get glued down

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.350
there was a bitter filing involve of course
but its going to work

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.920
 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.930
the supports are on it. It's all square and
we're just gonna wait for the glue to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.390
dry

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.390
and we're going to cut the front that
baffles maybe

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.060
just getting ready

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.180
to put the spacers on the front. There
was some debate

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.469
whether or not we actually needed the
spacers on

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.629
or off and after some searching around

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.209
I decided that I was gonna put some on.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.290
The consensus is ... maybe

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.810
you might need them ... you might not. I guess the general idea is 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.950
if the grill cloth is too flat then you
might get some flapping depending on the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.650
air flow coming out of your speakers

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.989
if you standard it off a bit that is supposed
to eliminate it

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.430
so since this is from scratch that's
what I'm gonna do

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.430
glue that on  ... than spray it

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.820
 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.820
 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.820
 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820
 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.330
 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.330
 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.300
We are going to glue in the

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.759
back supports for the baffle

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:07.759
Soon as Iget some glue out of here "lol"

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:15.630
 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.630
 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.620
S I've already marked it out, how far the depth is for the back panel 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.669
we're leaving a small space there so i
cant tip in

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.300
the front baffle for the speakers then nail it form the side

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.300
to keep it secure

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.330
so here's the front speaker baffle

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.520
it's ready to spray-paint. I just knocked in the T nuts

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.979
and

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.250
then I'm going to cut out the back baffle

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.250
my basic design. An oval. I found it on the
internet somewhere

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.210
couple people had the same design and  I thought it was pretty awesome so

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:15.210
I am going to get started cutting that and then after that give it a spray

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.229
okay fellas so here's the final

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.259
box I just gave it a quick sand over

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:40.880
it's pretty much finished. Baffles
are ready to go I'm gonna spray paint

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.759
everything today

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.889
the only significant problem I really
ran into

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.699
was the corners ... which will not make a
difference at all

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.820
if you can see that

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.550
I didn't run it through the router very
well so they're a bit shy when I pieced

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.639
it together so we had

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.340
some wood filler there ... not really a big
deal but

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.900
have an extra step

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.340
but you won't see it anyhow. I just have
to

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.479
decide what I'm gonna do with the handles I ordered some round ones

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.680
I'm not sure I really care for
them. So I ordered some other ones and I'm

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.970
waiting for those to come in.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:27.010
Then I'll cut the sides for the handles. it's
gonna be way too heavy to carry around

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.940
without handles on it obviously

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.090
I don't really care for those top straps.
that's a bit much for a 2X12. So

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.800
alright let's get started with the
spray painting.
