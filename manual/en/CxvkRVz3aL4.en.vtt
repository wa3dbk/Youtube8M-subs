00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.333
Amera was created on 7  october of 2002, 
becoming the first non-europe server, 
it was located in USA.

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.333
On this new world, refugees from Antica
and Nova had seen an opportunity to restart
their lives and perhaps become an icon of Camera.

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:13.333
Some players were already in the Amera
TOP EXP race and the first level 100 was Boboms.

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:18.333
So the players had started to create alliances
to take Amera over

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:23.333
In one side were the refugees members of
a famous Antica's guild: Hokuten.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:28.333
At the other side were the Amera's
peasants, they had to gathering themselves
against the power abuse guild Boondock Saints (Hokuten)

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:33.333
One of the leaders of that peasants
was a great and oldest knight of Amera
Lord Tydus.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:38.333
However they got crushed by BDS
and that guild reigned on Amera for a long time

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:43.499
till the leader of BDS, Star Scream,
get hacked by his previous owner

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.066
he got mad about the situation Amera was in
and has begun to kill himself (Star Scream hacked)
until level 42

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:54.466
That was devastating for BDS because
Starscream was really dangerous and key player

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:58.899
along with Jkiller, another powerful mage
that was deleted afterwards because of destructive behavior

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.900
soon had left only a few guild member
as the eldest elder druid of Amera: Homunkulus

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.466
By the way, he was the biggest merchant and thief
of all tibia's history: Alex of Antica.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:15.832
Homunkulus had some rare items
like horned helmet which he has acquired
in the nowadays Bright Sword quest

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:22.466
the incredible fact about is that
he made the quest when he was only level 14
and on those times didn't exist chests reward
so he had to talk and discover with the NPC.

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:28.132
Nonetheless, that massive players getting
deleted or banished was the end of BDS.
But the things hasn't stop here.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:34.599
Meanwhile, a young warrior was
getting respect in Amera's land.
His name? Eternal Oblivion

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.533
He had also fought along with the Lord Tydus
and friends against the BDS tyranny and after
their end, it was created the guild Defiants
which EO joined

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:47.899
This is the start of a new story, 
a legend has just born, he'd
make Tibia, Amera and Knight be 
synonimous of his name.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.200
he was outstanding in his skills, had got
TOP Global and on his own world in Sword 
(108!!), Magic Level (9!!) E Shielding skill (107!!) 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.366
On this picture we can see
he getting level 100 in Amera yet

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:55.433
moreover, he was the first level 150 to 300 in Amera
and the first level 250 in Tibia, that's why he had
stayed on the king's throne for a memorable time

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:04.799
Like all big legends, they all have indispensable
friends like his best friend: Will hunting

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:18.266
they had helped each other several times,
had divided they armors, itens, house and
also WH has helped EO to buy the rare
Demon legs from Vegeta San

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:24.332
There was also lot of important
Defiants member like Gugo, WH, Calax, etc.
They have won several wars and accomplished
numerous quests.

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:49.033
Defiants vs Demoralize

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:19.733
Here we see WH and EO going to Demon Helmet quest,
unfortunately WH dies due to EO's exeta res miss.
But for our surprise, he soiled the quest very well.

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:14.833
Eternal Oblivion blocking Orshabaal.

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:29.866
Eternal Oblivion against all in a Test serv!

00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:34.866
However, their end were close like BDS's death.

00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:39.866
Starting by the Eternal Oblivon who sold
the character in 2006~2007

00:05:39.866 --> 00:05:44.866
Will hunting had sold his char and
got deleted afterwards

00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:07.466
The women's representer, Gugo, also sold
her character and got deleted afterwards

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.900
in a short time, other players would cross their
records like the legendary druid Mateus Dragon Wielki
turning out in the new Global TOP EXP on 20/02/2007

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.266
and his fellow countryman Seromontis,
getting Magic Level 10.

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:34.999
This was the history of the Amera's legends,
on which two generations had fought against each other
for the victory

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.766
And the winner would lose to the 
future generation, because this is
the memorable Tibia's cycle.
