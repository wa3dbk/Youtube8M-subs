00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.040
I need to know how to increase Xbox One internet
speed.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.530
Dump Comcast, though I know that’s an achievement
in and of itself.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.150
I do not have Comcast, thank goodness.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.140
Cancelling them is the ultimate gamer achievement
these days because it is so hard.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.520
One of the simplest suggestions is making
sure it is set to download updates to the

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.660
console when it is in the instant-on mode.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.300
That avoids connection slowdowns because it
is trying to download updates while you’re

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.860
trying to play.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.070
How do I check that setting?

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.450
Go to home, menu, settings, power and startup,
instant on mode.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.790
If you’re willing to sacrifice time for
the planet, put it on power saving mode and

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.480
know it takes longer to start up and install
updates.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.430
The games try to update, too.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.820
It’ll do that anyway.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.950
So log in, go to the my games and apps section,
and look at what is downloading and what is

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.470
ready to start, so you know what you can play
now and what you need to wait for.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.360
It seems like I have to wait for everything.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.110
Maybe your wireless everything house is interfering
with the wireless connections.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.540
You could switch the wireless router channels
to minimize interference with cell phone hotspots

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.750
and wireless security system components.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.130
Or I could switch to a wired internet connection
for the Xbox One.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.770
That sounds so retro when you say it.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.970
You could also check to see if someone is
downloading Game of Thrones, or projects off

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.930
GitHub and sucking up all the bandwidth.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.729
I do not expect that activity to be any greater
than usual.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.390
So try playing games off the disc instead
of entirely online, so that it can use the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.590
local data source and speed up game play.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.390
I like to play with my friends, and the group
play can slow things down.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.770
Check the NAT settings on the router and make
sure it is NAT 2, not NAT 3.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.530
The security settings can slow things down.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.850
But if I set it to NAT 1, it’ll run fast
until malware gets in and slows it down.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.840
A better solution is changing the MAC priority
settings on the router to give the Xbox One

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.499
priority over other devices; it only affects
things if multiple devices are being used

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.409
at the same time.

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.170
What about QoS settings?

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.079
You’ll have to check the router’s manual
or manufacturer’s website on how to configure

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:31.780
its quality of service settings to give the
Xbox data packets priority and minimize disruptions,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.280
though QoS settings can add data to packets
and slow it down.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.609
You know, telling everyone else to go wired
for their internet connections is looking

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.069
like a good solution to my slow connection
problems.
