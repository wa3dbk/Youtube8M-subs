LT Jennifer McNab: I'm a mother of three and I have 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
two girls and a little boy and their ten, six and two. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And... my two year old's like "my mommy works on a ship". 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What got me here, my dad was in the Navy. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There was just something about it. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I remember visiting him when he was working and I just 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
thought it was really neat just to say, 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
"Hey, my dad's in the Navy". And so I sorta followed 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in his footsteps and here I am. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I have a lot of my junior corpsman, you know

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I call them my kids too, that come up to me and tell me about 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
issues that they're have and things like that. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I think because I'm a female and because I am a mom, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
they feel they can relate to me and they tell me some 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of the personal things that are happening in their lives. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The biggest thing is just taking care of your people 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and they'll take care of you. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
LCDR Patricia Johnson: My kids they love these cute 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
little songs and they always want me to dance with them. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So we, we do that. Those are the moments I appreciate 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
because we're basically like a well oiled machine 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
during the week. It's chaotic but it's doable. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
[background voice] 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Being in the military, there's a camaraderie cause 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you're at work so much and you're in these difficult 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
situations together you're kinda like this is your pseudo 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
family away from home. But we always have this one thing 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in common - the mission. And we come together, we get it done, 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and then we come back and do it again the next day. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
CAPT Cedric Pringle: I wouldn't say it's unique to the Navy, 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but you know, it's easy for us all to get along when we 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
have a pretty common goal. There are people who are tasked 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to do different things and everyone has a role onboard, 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but we all come together for a common--common vision. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
LT Jevon Jackson: When you're young, I was seventeen 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
years old, you know, cars and women were the new things. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I wasn't focusing too much on school. So my mother 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
insisted, demanded that I would go to the recruiter. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
She said "Pick one". And for me it was a Navy recruiter. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
With a ship, you need every department to get along, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
to move, to make it functional. To support, ah for missions 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
assigned. Ah the ship just becomes a building at the pier 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
without it. We are a collective force and it just 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
became amazing to me that I'm a part of this big 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
environment and I'm allowed to apply myself.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
CAPT Cedric Pringle: I was four years behind my brother 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
who went into the Navy as an enlisted man. I was always 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
following in his footstep. Even to the point were he just 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
retired here in 2009 and asked me to be the guest 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
speaker for his retirement. So I just thought that was 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
really, really neat. Ahhh and it added closure to his 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
portion of his Naval career, but I'm carrying the torch for him.
