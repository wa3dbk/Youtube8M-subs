00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.760
Biting can be a serious problem in a pet rat,
although it's extremely uncommon and extremely

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.639
rare that a rat is going to develop a biting
type of behavior.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.710
It does definitely happen.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.430
In the majority of time, this is rat that
has not been properly socialized.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.190
It has not been handled from the time it was
very young, or it's a rat who's personality

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.750
is just being skittish and being fearful,
and it tends to be more of a fear biter then

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.570
an aggressive biter.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.839
In these cases these rats one: Are important
to know that they are biters to be prepared

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.850
and to warn other people.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.449
They're also important to work towards trying
to decrease the behavior and potentially eliminate

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:48.449
it.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.160
Many people have found that with time and
patience, learning techniques to work with

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.360
the rat, understanding when and why they may
be prone to biting, that they can actually

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.850
desensitize the rat from becoming a biter
or from continuing the behavior of biting

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.920
and get them to the point, where the rat will
actually trust them enough to not feel the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.390
need to fear bite.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.240
Basically, it requires a commitment, time,
and patience, and the desire to actually have

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.250
this rat become one that's not going to bite
or nip for no reason.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.740
Oftentimes, people learn that they can use
bite-proof gloves or they can use a hand towel,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.119
or something on the rat to prevent them from
being bitten while they work with handling,

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.020
desensitizing them and getting them used to
not having to be fearful.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.680
The biting is not a very common problem.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.170
In most cases, if a rat is a biter somebody
is warned about that or somebody has learned.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.140
Hopefully, they let other people know.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.469
As well as, let people who may potentially
handle the rat know so that you can take extra

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.990
precautions to deal with them, and also work
with training them out of the behavior that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.859
probably started when they were very young.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.500
It may be difficult, but in most cases, you
can work towards developing more a more trusting

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.520
bond.
