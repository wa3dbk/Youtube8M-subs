Hi, this is Scott Vallance with Expert Village.com.
If you like to you can visit my website at

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.650
vipphotographic.com. Today we are going to
talk about storage and care of film. Basically

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.090
what you want to do is using 4 x 5 film process
put it in an archival sleeve and then store

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.480
it where there is no heat or not a lot of
heat and very low humidity. This will keep

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:52.030
images in good shape for years and years.
Before 4 x.5 film is processed, when you buy

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.239
it at the store and you are not going to use
it for a while, take it and put it in your

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.200
refrigerator. I keep it in a vegetable bin.
It works well and nothing gets spilled on

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.630
it. Also once you shoot your film and it is
going to be a few days before you can process

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.570
it, stick it back in the box and do the same
thing. Just mark the top of the box with what

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.720
is inside, what the exposure was and how many
sheets are in there and stick it back in the

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.170
refrigerator. You should keep 35mm film in
the refrigerator until you are ready to use

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.490
it. Leave it out of the refrigerator for at
least 90 minutes before you put it in your

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:38.240
camera so that you don’t have exposure problems.
Once you expose it and you are not going to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.270
process it for a while, stick it back in the
refrigerator. Keep it in good shape. Once

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.040
it is exposed, find your archival plastic
sheets again and stick them in there. They

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.340
have them for slides and negatives. They will
keep your film nice and dust free. 10 or quarter

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.159
film, the same kind of thing goes. Before
you shoot it keep it in the refrigerator,

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.310
after you shoot it and you are not going to
process it immediately, stick it back in the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.660
refrigerator and date it so you will know
when it is good. That’s it. Thank you very

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.950
much.
