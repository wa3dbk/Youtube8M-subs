00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.740
first of all up lathe introduction to
that'll never happen no more quite

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.710
slowly

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.610
on the screen you'll see both my hands
don't run follow too closely because

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.500
later we'll look in more detail

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.520
this is just to give you a flavor of
what's happening how the hands of moving

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.350
introduction is transcribed pretty much
as blake played it

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.230
so it's important to trying to follow
the notes trying to follow the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:34.230
the idea and tryin achieve the the
rhythm which is very very important

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:25.399
but

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.889
let's take a look at the courts that we
use with that'll never happen though

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.109
more

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.319
we have to you

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.229
g_-seven into very asians

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.769
pays seven

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.319
the seven

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.299
c

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.449
and he flat seven

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.669
hold a sequel

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.839
now will break the introduction down
into freezes

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:53.039
will split the screen to show my hand my
right hand and the tablets are the same

00:02:53.039 --> 00:03:00.039
time in this way

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.779
once again operate very slowly

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:27.779
triumph over television

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.619
one thing to note is that

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:56.529
because blake played this based note
card

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.179
it's important that use a all of you
hand

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:04.729
the damn the bass strings dislike proves
it is

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.959
on his monotonic base

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.079
we alternating the bases

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.149
liners

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.989
morning

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.400
damn with the farm

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.400
feelin doc watson's dot

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.329
ad

00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:37.439
spirit

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:44.439
has take a closer look at what happened
to see how we treat the stamping of

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:18.139
these are the last three milk replay in
the last section

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:20.990
missus will carry on

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.990
for the second section

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.899
bill so notice that when i'm picking
width

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:46.460
two fingers

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.439
Deep River Blues Lesson http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4lMZxM5AFQ
Jim Bruce Channel http://www.youtube.com/user/acoustictravellersl

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.939
this is all fortunately as part of my
style

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:56.709
it makes for a little instability

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:59.319
try not to do is try to keep your

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.150
middle finger and the next finger on the
soundboard in this way

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.699
and play the strings with this finger

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.929
and this finger independently ppm

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:11.560
clyde john that

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.460
but i can do this so when i play

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.870
two strings and concession with the
first in the second finger

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.099
inevitably my the finger lifts off the
sample try not to copy this

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.470
and i will take a look at the first two
that'll never happen no more

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.000
as before you'll see my right hand with
the temperature and slightly different

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.539
format this time

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.749
and after each section showing my right
hand then you'll see my left hand and

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:44.359
the courts that we use in the city

00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:47.729
it's not exactly a as blake played its
milk for them

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.199
there's a lot of erased in there to show
you have to play around with it once

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.689
you're comfortable with it

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:57.060
but i keep the flavor and the bouts with
his own pool to play

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:04.060
take it easy gridlock

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:30.679
then

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:40.059
man
