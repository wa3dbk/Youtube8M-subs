00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.279
Today on our 2012 Jeep Compass well be installing
a Curt tee connector vehicle wire harness

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.700
with four poll flat connector, part number
C56129.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.260
To begin our install well first open up the
rear hatch and then well need to remove the

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.870
rear taillight assemblies.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.800
Starting here on the drivers side, well go
ahead and remove the two fasteners that secure

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.039
the rear taillight assembly.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.900
To remove the fasteners well use a flat blade
screwdriver and pry out on the center section

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.210
and then remove the entire piece.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.809
Note: This is a two piece fastener so the
center section can be completely out and then

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.449
remove the second half.

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.250
Now with the fasteners out of the way we will
go head and gently pop the rear taillight

00:00:41.250 --> 00:01:06.600
lens towards 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:35.860
the rear of 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:03:33.030
the vehicle 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:43.720
releasing 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:04:50.730

00:04:50.730 --> 00:06:55.830
