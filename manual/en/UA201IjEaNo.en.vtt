00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.040
they were talking about artificial
intelligence and by buying i don't want

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.309
it back to the conversation i had with
john earlier about robots now we were

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.400
talking about killer robots during this
particular conversation we were talking

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.780
about sex robots

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.220
something that john isn't reply

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.150
uh... let's keep our utility kept
bringing it up during our life he's our

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.099
guy status in the started this is a good
story right okay so obviously was

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.090
mentioning

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.169
ek

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.640
when we did that story in the second
hour and jake and i came off as little

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.399
judging danielle like we having sex with
a robot you know what about you and your

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.200
action this and that and salad

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.610
talking about how artificial
intelligence will make those sites

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.780
robots so similar to wedding

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.170
supplemental beyond necessary that i'd
been definitely one of the did not think

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.260
people have their relationships with
their route that i think you know the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.140
difference a good third and then a
little robot will do exactly what you

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.059
want to do a little more cautious
buttons does ask if i was not

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.000
you're not so attractive

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.960
out by god i can't help myself wonderful

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.180
uh... ok my interest in uh... affects
robots in relationship to the robots did

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.490
not principally about myself

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.750
right on the standing of what people are
like and i think that when they become

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.160
widely available

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.060
it's just going to be too difficult for
people of turned out it's not strictly

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.310
sexual thing

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.670
a look at it like what's going on in

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.430
of the state of panic feel bad for down
in japan but

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.180
these alike on i've those other things
like that they're getting popular not

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.530
just with young people were also told
people for companionship

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.760
that robots eventually candy companions
people love their little rumors will

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.460
uh... vacuum cleaners

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.130
i think they we're in that sense of no
but they might

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.299
in my tickets their friend at some point
if you talk back to them

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.039
it's easy to say oh it's not really
think you know things as really believe

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.070
those things

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.159
but the human mind is not is driven by
free will is most people think most of

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.990
the what we see is free will is a
rationalization after an emotional

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.800
reaction to something

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.040
it's mostly faked rationality

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.550
we can take it for about still but would
you be willing to have a relationship

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.319
with the robot

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.189
i would be open to the possibility of
having most i'm not going to be the only

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.320
one or maybe the first time because i
was certainly will build a four-day

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.319
left

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.799
you would be obliged playstation like
mary around though i mean that's enough

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.709
that i'm not quite there without a sound
john's point like if they're here you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.889
have

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.549
like that

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.349
why sexually defector but don't take
life but the robot out there that the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.159
whole point of having a fuckin robot we
don't know anything about the death of a

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.609
human that's that's what i'm saying that
you can replace human interaction with

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.870
the robot that has artificial
intelligence i guess you can write and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.350
my sister you can convince yourself

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.460
that it's a real but at the end of the
day it's not a real person who has a

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.639
spontaneous reaction to something that's
happening in your life codes spontaneity

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.529
allow i think they look at the leaders
of the political deterring test at and

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.559
what they do is they have you
communicate through computer to a person

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:07.139
or robot you'll know which

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.759
in eight years they're trying to create
artificial intelligence second full

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.109
all etickets at least fifty percent of
people talk with them into thinking it's

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:14.999
a human

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.669
it's been getting better and better over
time

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.719
it's not long off if it's uh... in my
party been passed where robots are able

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.269
to four u three text interface of
thinking you're speaking to a human

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.089
if you can put that type of artificial
intelligence on the other side of this

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:29.159
book chat window

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.530
wanting to put inside of a robot face
that looks human every once in awhile

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.739
catch john in like the janitors closet
talkies series identified with co dot in

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:39.939
there

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.689
trying to be an orgasm series
