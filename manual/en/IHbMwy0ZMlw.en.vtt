Hey everybody this is Christina the AmputeeOT

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.149
do you know what this is for and why you should have one?

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.230
This is a small Allen wrench

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.210
that you use to tighten the foot or adjust the foot on your
prosthetic leg

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.180
if you look at a prosthesis you'll
notice that it's

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.930
pretty much in a straight line up and
down this way

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.000
and its also in a straight line up and
down this way

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.059
if its adjusted properly. Barring somebody
having

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.580
flexion contractures are interesting anatomy or other reasons

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.090
typically this is the way a prosthesis
is going to be set up

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.160
Now you might be wondering how does a
prosthetist get

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.950
prosthetic leg set up properly so that
its straight up and down. 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.469
The way they do that is by adjusting the
four screws that are on the bottom

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.500
of the socket or on the top of the foot.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.989
These screws are not just used to secure
the foot to the socket they're

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.039
also used to adjust the angle of the
socket and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.570
the angle of the foot - that is the dorsiflextion

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.479
plantarflexion inversion and eversion
of the foot with respect to the socket

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.160
the four screws that you see there are
called set screws

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.040
and you adjust them using an Allen wrench
like this one.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.900
here's what it looks like on the inside
you can see the four sets screws in there

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.790
and on the bottom socket is what's
called a pyramid

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.259
now watch carefully what happens if I adjust the set-screws on this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.860
prosthetic leg.  When I turn this screw in, you dorsiflex the foot, that is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.040
close the angle between the socket and the foot

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.380
like if you were to pick your foot up
from the ground

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.430
and if I screw in this set-screw back here the socket moves this way

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.510
or you plantarflex the foot. 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.340
and if I
screw this one

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.729
the socket will move this way, and if I screw this one

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.340
the socket will move this way. So that's inversion and eversion.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.560
it's very useful to know how to adjust
your prosthetic foot because

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.989
A: sometimes the set screws come loose
and it's good to know how to tighten them

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.680
and B: it's nice because if you want to
change shoes

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.730
and your shoes are of a slightly
different heel height:

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.140
then you can adjust your prosthesis to
to make it work

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.380
for you instead having it be mis-aligned

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.040
which is what would happen if I
change shoes there were different

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.150
heel height: so for example if I want to
have shoes that have a heel liked this

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.600
then I would adjust this backwards

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.130
using this screw to plantarflex it
more

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.480
to make this come back into
alignment with respect

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.380
to the line that is drawn right here. One thing that you definitely want to do

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.170
is always put Loctite on the
set-screws and I mean the non-permanent.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.900
Loctite

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.090
what that will do is keep your set-screws
from coming loose but allow you to

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.730
loosen them

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.010
if you need. thats really important it's
also a really good idea if you've never adjusted

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.750
your prosthetic before to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.000
either take a picture the arrangement
of the set-screws

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.700
or write them down so that you know if you

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.370
mess everything up and can't get your socket the way you want it after

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.239
adjusting it you can always go back to
it exactly the way it was before

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.359
if you take pictures and just replicate
exactly what your was already

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:32.829
set up to be

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.250
So say want to set up this prosthetic leg
to be specific to an activity

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.880
for me I can use aerial silks or
tumbling which is a class that I take in

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.130
which we don't wear shoes

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.990
So I take the shoe off..

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.400
This doesn't quite feel right

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.609
When I don't wear a shoe. It feels right when I'm wearing a shoe

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.720
and feels wrong when I am not wearing a shoe. The reason for that

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.010
is the heel height difference. This shoe has
about a three-eighths of an inch heel

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.080
and if I use it without a shoe then there is a 3/8ths of an inch difference. 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.370
So now instead of bein straight up and down my

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.180
socket is tilted a little bit backward and
so what I want to do to adjust it is

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.970
bring a little bit forward to bring it
back in alignment

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.830
So I'll do that. 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.999
Get straight leg!

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.700
There we go...

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.980
Don't forget your Locktite... which I forgot

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.960
now my prosthetic leg is aligned
properly for walking barefoot

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.700
If I want to go back to wearing my shoe I'll adjust this

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.780
Put my shoe back on...

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.760
Your prosthesis is probably the most important thing that you own

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.010
and it would be really really uncool if

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.030
you couldn't wear it because you adjusted it wrong because you watched

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.490
my video so definitely make sure

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.520
you're pretty confident that you know what
you're doing

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.980
before you do it or at least make sure
to take pictures

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.090
of the way that your prosthesis is
already set up

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.830
so that if you do get it adjusted and it
doesn't quite work right

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.300
and set it back to the way it was.
Honestly I feel like most people could

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.680
probably adjust their own prosthesis if they

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.580
really needed to, and having that
knowledge is especially helpful if for

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.140
example your prosthetist lives two hours
away

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.190
or can only you week from Saturday and

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.890
you need your leg adjusted now. it's only four
set screws so it's not super complicated

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.770
but if

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.990
you have trouble for example figuring
out which direction to turn your

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.450
screwdriver on pretty regular basis

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.480
or you may be aren't even aware until
right now that

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.620
screws have directions then you might
want to save it

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.510
for the professionals. Okay everybody I
hope you enjoyed this video

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.550
if you have any questions you can leave
them in the comments section below you

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.410
can subscribe if you like I put out new videos every Wednesday
