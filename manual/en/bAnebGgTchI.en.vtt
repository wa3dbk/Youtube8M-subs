00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.060
Today I'm going to give you some hints and tips and advice on how to prepare

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.410
and write your personal statement. The personal statement is the most important

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.100
part

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.730
of the UCAS application form. Every student who applies to university

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.749
has to write a personal statement, and this is a written document

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.579
regarding yourself, why you want to study the course that you've chosen

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.359
on the UCAS form and also a bit about yourself

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.219
- your hobbies, interests, skills. What makes you stand out

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.359
and what makes you different? Why do you deserve a place on the course?

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.660
The personal statement

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.859
is 4,000 characters long, so that means

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.570
it's between 500 - 550 words.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.960
You have to write it at font size 12, no more no less

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.250
so in actual terms it's one side of A4

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.539
printed or typed up. You have to write it in Word

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.710
and then you cut and paste it onto your electronic UCAS apply form

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.619
which is completed online

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.320
on the UCAS website.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.950
The admissions tutor

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.010
will be making a decision on your application

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.180
and it's based on your personal statement,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.650
your predicted grades

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.350
and also they will be looking at your GCSE results

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.080
and your reference. Your teachers, your subject tutors

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.930
will be writing a reference to back up your application form.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.780
So, how to tackle the personal statement? It's a good idea for you to write

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.580
a list

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.760
of things that you've been doing in the last three or four years

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.640
You don't need to go back

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.040
further than three or four years, because it's not really relevant to what you're

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.250
doing at the moment

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.310
So, things that you have done to do

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.259
with the subject that you wish to study, so any evidence of further reading

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.580
- maybe you've been on an interesting visit

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.430
that's to do with the course that you want to study. Maybe you've read an article somewhere,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.040
or you've been receiving a magazine or a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.970
journal that's to do with the subject. Something

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.470
that's inspired you,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.360
something that's really interesting and different, but it has to be academic as well.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.519
An admissions tutor is very passionate about their subject,

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.360
so if you can share that enthusiasm and passion with them,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.880
with regards to the subject

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.420
then you will definitely get noticed on the personal statement.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.560
And they will be looking for evidence of skills.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.769
These skills are good communication skills,

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.350
problem-solving skills, working
independently

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.120
working as part of a team, being creative,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.710
your ability to deal with

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.330
quite a heavy workload times and also

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.290
that you can meet deadlines. And maybe
things that you have

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.610
on top of your academic studies.
You may have a part-time job

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.850
and that reflects the fact that you are

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.720
dependable, that you have good communication skills,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.730
good problem solving skills and also
that you are reliable

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.130
The

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.370
admissions tutor who will be reading your personal statement

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.710
will have a little checklist by their side where they will be looking for

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.510
evidence

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.280
of these important skills. They will also want to see something new,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.610
something different, so make sure

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.860
that your personality is reflected

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.100
in the personal statement. They will read hundreds, maybe thousands

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.270
of repetitive, dull personal statements

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.570
so try and keep yours interesting.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.170
You don't need to use elaborate English, be yourself.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.050
Don't lie! If you lie, and are asked into the university for an interview

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.530
then you may get into some bother. If you've been lying on your personal statements they

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.440
are usually going to ask you questions

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.720
that derive from what you've written
down. So if you've been lying

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.980
you're going to get caught out. So be
original, be yourself,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.340
and be positive. What's important for you to remember is

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.530
the admissions tutors read a lot of these,

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.780
and they come from

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.030
17 &amp; 18 year old students who may be nervous

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.569
who may not think that they deserve a place on the course,

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.110
but please be positive, be confident that you are

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.870
going to get an offer. There's more of a reason for them to accept you

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.970
than to reject you. They want to see the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.360
the same passion in regards to the course
and they themselves will be excited

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.840
to actually teach you if you have an
outside interest

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.409
in the subject that you wish to study. What an admissions tutor would like to see

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.080
is a confident applicant, so students who use words such as

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.039
I am confident, I am hardworking, I am
passionate

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.949
Using a positive tone is very important

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.130
Please don't use the word 'hope'

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.509
as it doesn't show that you're really enthusiastic and positive about your

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:18.300
ability

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.469
to study the course. Using confident language

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.610
will make your personal statement stand out.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.860
I think the students who are successful with their personal statement

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.580
are the students who demonstrate that they are actively

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.030
involved in the subject in school but also outside.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.970
And the way of demonstrating this is to give evidence of further reading

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.370
and going further than the syllabus. Going further than what you have to on the  A Level course

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.690
or in college on your BTEC

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.080
or Access Course.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.320
That's what makes an outstanding personal statement.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.910
