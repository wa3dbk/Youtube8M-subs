00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.200
Morning, guys! Say hi to John, my new friend.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.884
Well, he loves to have breakfast, dinner, lunch… all things sitting right here.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.260
Well, I was talking to John about how excellent my first day in London is going to be.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.520
I’m doing the traditional side of London

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.160
which is going to be the fish and chips, grouse baked potatoes. 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.220
And then we’ll do a modern side.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.920
Hi!

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.620
What a fabulous entrance to the restaurant!

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.600
So this is one of the local street artists who did this.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.380
And we’ve got some on the other entrance as well.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.520
And then the wallpaper… this is Chapman brothers, Jake and Dinos Chapman. 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.200
So, this is…um… a good entrance, you know.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.720
It’s a bit… it’s a bit naughty.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.700
Yeah, haha! It’s really naughty!

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.240
And this is a large space… 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.060
and in here we have, you know, the small sculpture. 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.560
Hahaha!

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.440
...which is the menu. 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.320
Which is so small that you’ll be scared when you look at it!

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.780
So, so the menu is in the, in the case.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.360
In the case? The chicken and the steak? Right there in front of us.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.040
And chef, this is, again, a marvellous piece of art.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.780
So… I see you doing a lot of art with food.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.660
Maybe what we can do is…

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.600
I will taste the grouse and then I will see you in the kitchen to learn the recipe.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.140
Absolutely!

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.220
So well, I think I kind of know what all has gone into this dish. 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.620
But let’s meet the chef and discover what’s really on it.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.540
In the gravy, I’m going to add some of my Oyster ale.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.640
So this year, you know, we have traditional roast grouse

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.960
which we serve whole, uh, with all the accompaniments but sauce.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.740
And then this year we’ve done a baked potato…

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.880
With the grouse?

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.300
Yes, and this is a starter. So, you know..

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.220
it’s a half sized portion with the breast, and the legs. 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.520
And chef, when you roast it do you, like, marinate the grouse with something?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.260
No, no because it’s got a very unique flavour.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.820
So you don’t want to kill it!

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.660
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.460
and we don’t even have it hung, you know

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.420
there’s a lot of game birds, they hang them.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.720
Just an old fashioned thing.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.520
So… a grouse, a partridge, a pheasant, they all have unique flavours.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.460
So we’ll have to keep the unique flavour. 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.040
And I was reading that you also keep the liver… very important!

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.040
Yeah, so, the livers, we hang on to it.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.200
 I’m going to cook a couple of the livers and mix it with the… the baked potatoes. Potatoes? Hmm.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.140
Wow.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.080
And the livers are very, very small. But… it’s got a lot of flavour. 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.200
So you’re smelling the bird… I’ll do that.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.940
I’m going to dig into the oyster ale.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.680
 It’s never too early. It’s nine in the morning..

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.660
but cheers to chef!

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.460
So… so yeah, so this dish is really quite simple.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.320
And the sauce… it gives the corn a nice seasoning. 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.940
So we’re using corn in this sauce? Yeah.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.420
After the corn is added to the gravy, grouse is actually put in the oven for 25 minutes with potato skins as well.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.680
Ooh, this oyster ale is really nice!

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.880
And, well, the liver is then sealed gently on the pan.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.560
So… uh, we already have a roasted breast with us… yeah… of grouse. 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.393
So you’ve kept that intact?

00:04:57.393 --> 00:05:01.053
 Yeah. We haven’t, uh, removed the breast from the carcass. 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.160
No… not yet. So now I’m going to take the breast off..

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.960
 and then in a couple of minutes we’ll have a complete dish.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.360
It smells beautiful.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.880
And here, the leg meat. And the livers… 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.980
we’re going to put this back in there.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:25.340
So, crispy potato skins stuffed with potato, which is mixed with grouse legs and liver.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.640
And some of these game birds, not grouse, but they, they like to feed on corn as well. 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.160
Oh hi! Well, I’m reading one of the oldest Indian cookery books in Chef Mark Hix’s library. 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.780
Just imagine, he has like a bunch of Indian cookbooks here..

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.320
I’m counting at least 20-25 of them. 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.040
And now you’re going to see his whole library… it is huge! 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.480
All right, so… yes, it’s a passion. Yeah!  Passion.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.600
I couldn’t have had a better start to my food journey, right? 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.840
Chef Mark Hix has gifted me two of his lovely cook books. 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.760
Look at both of them. Both talk about traditional British food, regional British cuisine.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.680
At the same time Chef Mark Hix’s great collection. Well, I am lucky!
