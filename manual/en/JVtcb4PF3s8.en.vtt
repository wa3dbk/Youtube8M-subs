00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.681
Aquaman here with Water Wisdom sponsored by
WaterFilters.NET, Today’s product is the

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:14.570
OB-35 Brita Water Pitcher. This is a great
little device. You know, if you can’t have

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.199
a water filter built in under the sink, if
you can’t install a whole house system,

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.770
or you just simply don’t want to go to the
trouble of it, if your an apartment owner,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.480
or rather a renter, a condo renter of some
kind, or if you just want the portability

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.989
factor, the Brita OB-35 is an excellent choice.
A couple of the features; it has an 8 cup

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.579
capacity, you fill, you know, you pour water
into the top and it passes through this filter

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.610
cartridge that I still have in the wrapper
here. It passes through the filter cartridge

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:01.780
into the lower chamber and holds 8 cups. It
has a built in digital filter change indicator

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:09.439
right here on top. You just depress the start
button and hold it down and little bars, four

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.420
bars appear. 1,2,3,4, and then they flash,
and you’re ready to go, and it’s just

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.779
a timer. One bar will disappear every 2 weeks,
because the approximate filter life of these

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:30.990
cartridges is 2 months. So, when the 4 bars
are gone, you will be seeing an indication

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.381
here on the screen that it’s time to change
your cartridge. So, you change your cartridge

00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:41.860
out, it’s really easy, it just twists into
place, just locks in place inside. Just stick

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.549
it in and twist it in place, and then press
the start button, and hold it down, and reset

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.950
it and your ready to go for another 2 months.
Going to need to do a couple things to put

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.859
this cartridge in, before you take it out
of the wrapper you should wash your hands,

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:03.719
and this is true really with all filters when
you change them. You don’t want whatever

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.759
is on your hands to contaminate your filter,
so you’re going to wash your hands thoroughly,

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.780
and then you’re going to take the filter
out of the package and then you need to soak

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.069
it standing upright in water for about 15
minutes, and there’s a couple things happening

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.569
there. One thing, you’re getting rid of
air bubbles, the other thing, you’re rinsing

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.269
over the contaminant, there’s some dust,
some carbon dust from the granular carbon

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.290
that’s going to get washed away by that
soaking process, and you’re just seasoning

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.459
the filter and getting it ready to go. Then
you’re going to rinse the filter under running

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.489
water for a few seconds and then you’re
good to go. You can install it and run water

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:55.379
into the top chamber and let it filter through
and pour yourself a fresh clean glass of water.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:02.019
This filter system removes a number of contaminants,
not just chlorine taste and odor, but also

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:10.219
heavy metals like copper and mercury and cadmium
and a couple others that slip my mind right

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.079
now. We’ll have all that information for
you on the web site, and just a really good

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.680
filter. The filter media, the reason that
it’s better than your average carbon filter

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.209
is, it’s not just carbon. It has granular
carbon, but then additionally to that it has

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.430
an ion exchange resin. That’s a little bit
complicated but I’ll try to explain it.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:41.620
Imagine a little bead and that little bead
has sodium particles on it, and along comes

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.110
some nasty contaminant that is attracted to
that bead, and it attaches and then the little

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.579
sodium particle falls off and goes into the
water, they trade places, they exchange, ion

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:01.989
exchange resin. Obviously that will wear out
over time, which is why the filter cartridge

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.590
has a 2 month life, and so it removes those
contaminants and you just chuck it and put

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:18.199
a new one in its place. The replacement cartridge
is part # OB03, and that’s sold in a 3 pack,

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.490
so they come 3 in a package, the replacement
cartridge do. Great little pitcher, they’re

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.090
sturdy, lightweight. This one is really nice,
because it’s got a nice slim line design.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.300
So, they’ve given it more holding capacity
by making it longer like this, but it’s

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.479
still slim so you can slot it into your fridge
without it taking up a lot of space. Another

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.039
nice feature is that the entire thing can
disassemble for easy cleaning. Watch this:

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:57.550
take this lid off, pull that out, tah dah!
You can clean this whole thing out, scrub

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:05.729
it up nice and simply drop this back in and
put your lid on and you’re back in business.

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.990
Isn’t that a nice feature? They thought
about what they were doing here. I’ve owned

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.419
one of these before. I’ve got an under sink
system now, but in the past I’ve owned one

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.449
of these, and the water is great quality and,
you know, it’s a great entry level model

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.949
for someone who thinks “you know I just
want to see what this whole filtered water

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:31.960
thing is about” or for someone who needs
the, you know, portability or the impermanence

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.890
of a system that isn’t installed permanently
under the sink or at the whole house level.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.709
That’s the OB-35, thanks for watching!
