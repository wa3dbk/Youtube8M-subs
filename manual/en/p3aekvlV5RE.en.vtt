00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.080
The "Song About the Dnieper River"

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.480
The soloist is the Honored artist of Russia - 
Leonid Kharitonov.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.040
In the coastal vines,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.320
on the high steep slopes

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.000
We loved and grew.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.440
Oh, Dnieper, Dnieper,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.040
you are broad, powerful,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.000
The cranes are flying over you.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.000
Oh, Dnieper, Dnieper,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.960
you are broad, powerful,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.000
The cranes are flying over you.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.480
You saw the battle, Dnieper-Father River

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.360
We went on the attack under the mountain.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.200
He who died for the Dnieper,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.000
will live forever

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.240
Since he fought like a hero.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.200
He who died for the Dnieper,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.720
will live forever

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.240
Since he fought like a hero.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.800
The enemy attacked us,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.120
we left the Dnieper.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.000
The deathly battle thundered like a storm.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.320
Oh, Dnieper, Dnieper,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.680
you are flowing far away,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:20.640
And your wave is like tears.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.000
Oh, Dnieper, Dnieper,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.800
you are flowing far away,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:47.000
And your wave is like tears.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.000
From your rapids the enemy drinks the water,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.800
And he choked with that water.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.080
The glorious day has come,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.760
we are going forward

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.480
And we'll see you Dnieper again.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.240
Let the blood of the fascists hounds

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.800
flow like a river,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.000
The enemy will not take the Soviet land

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.800
Like the spring Dnieper,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.600
all enemies will be swept away

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.120
by our Army and our people!

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.520
Like the spring Dnieper,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:36.000
all enemies will be swept away

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:48.000
by our army and our people!
