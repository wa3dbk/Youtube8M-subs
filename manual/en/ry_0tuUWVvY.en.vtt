00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.709
Hey everyone, I am DJ Shy, explaining to you
on behalf of Expert Village, on how to mix.

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:12.809
Now, first, of course, in order to learn how
to mix, you have to get to know your mixer.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.650
This is your mixer. So, these buttons here,
this is the high, which is also known as a

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:31.539
treble, the mid, and the low. The low is also
known as the bass. These are your EQ's. So,

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.661
having that said, you can turn of your trebles,
so that all bass is heard. So, you turn off

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:44.190
the treble and you only hear the mid and the
bass. This is good for mixing because sometimes

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.450
you have two conflicting basses and they are
striking at each other, it is going to be

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:58.290
a jumbled sound. So, some DJ's like to take
out one of the basses and let the other song

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:08.830
for that bass to ride. With mixing, you also
would want to listen to the snare and the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.740
snare has a treble sound. In your headphone,
you might want to turn down the bass and listen

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.730
for that treble, in order to mix. So, that's
where the high, mid and bass comes in handy

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:31.380
in order to mix. You just turn off or lower
turn off, or higher, the treble, mid or bass

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.980
in order to mix more smoothly or manipulate
the sound. So right now, I have a song that

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:53.080
is playing. O.K., now I am going to take out
the bass. This is what it sounds like without

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.710
the bass. Now I am going to put the bass back
on and take out the treble. The bass is really

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:13.209
heavy. And now I am going to bring it back
to normal. And that is an example of how you

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.390
use the treble, mid, and bass.
