Hi, it's Susie from Nail Care Education

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.710
And I've had so many questions and requests on how to prep the nail for Acrylic or Gel.  Whatever service

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.859
you're doing is the same.  Exactly the same. So today,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.779
I'm going to show you how to prep the nail for an acrylic nail or a gel nail. Whatever you're doing. Okay?

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.779
Let's get started.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.289
So I'm lucky enough today to have a live model.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.679
Thanks Ann. The reason why that's important and not using a fake hand is because, it's a natural organic hand.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.229
I'm trying to show you how to prepare the natural nail

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.359
for polish, gel polish, gel sculpted nail, and an acrylic sculpted nail.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:53.009
That's important because whatever product you're using on the nail. We prepare it exactly the same way for every

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.579
single service, even if it's a polish application or if it's a gel nail or a gel polish.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.219
We want to prepare it the exact same way. So, the first thing we want to do. We're just going to cleanse the nail.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.470
Okay, just clean it with a little bit of alcohol, and I put my glasses on so I can see.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.529
Okay, so I like to use a cuticle stick and the first step I do, is pushing back the cuticle.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.460
You just want to push it back because you want as much room to put your application on there, your gel polish or acrylic,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.620
whatever you're doing. You want to get as much surface area as you possibly can for your application.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.640
Okay, and now some people use these metal implements. They're great,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.119
they have this roundness on the corner.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.109
You can see that this blunt kind of round end that literally fits

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.580
right snug into the cuticle area and you can gently push it back .

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.830
A lot of places will flip it and use the other end which is the sharp

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.029
scraping side. Now be really careful with this because this is a natural nail

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.210
and it's attached to a person

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.440
we don't want to scrape it so hard that it actually kind of hurts or

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.738
even pits, or ruins the natural nail in any way, so you what you're trying to do is you just gently scraping it.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.379
It can look like it's really hard sometimes

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.619
but we don't want to press really hard actually and we're just scraping off the organic

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.919
skin around the cuticle that's kind of stuck to there.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.329
That is not where polish wants to stick. Polish or any primer

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.209
or acrylic or anything going on there will not stick to that. There's any lifting that could be one of your reasons

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.899
So we're just going to gently take off that little

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.720
stuff.

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.059
Okay, we're going to prep the nail by buffing with a file

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.729
So the higher the number, the finer the buff. we don't want to put a fine buff on here when we're applying

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.560
Acrylic nails or gel nails on top of here or even the gel Polish the reason being is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.790
because if we do it to smooth

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.756
The product won't stick. So we do want to get a bit more of a grit to it I like to use the 180 which is

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.540
a medium to a bit more of a grittier file

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.700
See, I like the files these ones which I couldn't because they're quit soft. You can really get it into the corner of her nails

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.460
Or the roundness. There's really no corners. I suppose

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.759
So when you're doing this you're taking off while the oil you're not going deep there's lots of layers of the natural nail

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.560
So, you're just really gently buffing the surface of the natural nail

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.060
To prep it before you put whatever product you're putting on it.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.190
So, you want to get all the little corners, get all the way around. If you leave any little shiny area that

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.239
Also could be a reason why any one of your products is lifting. okay?

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.380
You can do this with a drill as well. I would use an arbor band

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.329
I would not use a coarse arbor band. I would put a medium or a fine on it.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:05.519
The products are so excellent nowadays. They adhere so well. with the primers and preparation, you could almost

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.809
forget this step with some people and you still might have it stick.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.980
But this will be for sure if you do this; you won't have any lifting.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.240
Okay, that nail looks very happy and ready to go.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.300
So, you just want to get rid of the dust. you can just use a little bit more

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.670
alcohol to do that and the next step is I like to use a prep step I use this one by INM,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.100
and I literally just generously paint it on. You can hit the skin and everything

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.279
It's a dehydrator gets rid of the oil cleanse the whole surface gets rid of the dust.  Really important, you

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.850
Don't want any dust around there whatsoever, and then the next step is your primer. I'm not a big fan of acid primers

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.249
I like more of an acid free. Low acid primer

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.399
You don't really need those ones if you're prepping the nail really well you really don't need too harsh of a primer at all

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.770
And then you can just put the primer ever so gently

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.100
Little just a couple of swipes and it will absorb

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.859
And [silca] read into the area you want you don't want to use too much primer because you don't want to over saturate the nail

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.729
If you do that

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:21.629
After a while the primer can get into the clients cuticle area into the nail plate, and it can actually cause some issues

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.909
You know may be months years down the road

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.579
But you don't want to over saturate this when we really gentle with your primer application and now this

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.069
bad boy is ready for an acrylic application. So, that's how you prep a natural nail.
