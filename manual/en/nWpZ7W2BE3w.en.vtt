00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.099
Hi, how are you?

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.460
Today I am going to talk about the Ming Aralia, known in Brazil as "Happiness Tree".

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.180
this beautiful plant thrives very well inside

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.180
Usually you find, in the same pot, 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.540
the male and the female

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.800
and everybody has difficulty to know

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.760
which is the male

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.080
and which is the female

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.450
I will teach you a trick

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.700
the female is this one, is has small 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.250
and delicate 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.550
leaves

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.700
like every woman she is more femine and delicate

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.880
the male

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.280
is this one, he has thicker and wider leaves 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.530
like any man he is strong and sturdy. 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.910
These plants come from different countries,

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.520
different origins.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.650
The female has a semi herbacious texture and comes from Polinesia, India and 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.610
Malaysia.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.650
If you plant it in the garden

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.440
it can reach up to 2m high

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.580
and its foliage is very decorative.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.830
The male

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.910
is a woody shrub and comes from the Pacific Islands

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.120
and can reach up to 5m high

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.030
if planted in the garden.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.640
It is a semi shade plant

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.650
so if you want to plant it in the garden

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.220
put it in the most shaded area possible

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.580
in your garden or inside the house. It is a beautiful plant

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.830
you cultive it, change pots, and it keeps growing, growing  

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.460
and growing, 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.460
and I have seen many hapiness trees

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.540
that reach the cealing

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.040
and when it happens you start

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.360
Oh my God! What now? My plant!

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.510
What should I do? It does not fit here any more...

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.310
You can prune!

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.680
It likes good soil and water at intervals

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.620
You do not need to regar every day

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.900
it does not like being soaked.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.619
Here in Brazil it hardly bloom

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.329
but in the origins they usually bloom, here

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.699
unfortunatelly

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.239
they have not adapted enough to bloom

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.949
If you want to change it, and put in a bigger pot

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.979
use the basic substrate, I will leave a link in the end of the video

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:32.199
to the video where I teach how to make this substrate, ok?

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.439
It is a interesting plant because some people complain of

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.709
the smell

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.799
it is funny, I have this one and another bigger one inside the house for many years

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.659
My husband is a pointer and has a nose 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.049
that can smell everything, is hell,

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.129
but he has never complained of this tree.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.209
People say that it she exudes a smell to remind us to be happy

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.609
Maybe that is why it is called happiness tree

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.299
Interesting, isn't it?

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.239
So, if by any chance, you tree start smelling

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.749
you know now, 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:14.029
make a reflection about your life and try to discover why you are unhappy.

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.769
Look for motives to be happy, and I am sure you are going to find some!

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.309

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.950
Flowered kisses

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.950
