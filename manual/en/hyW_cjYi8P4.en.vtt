Furniture Repairs Made Easy

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.230
This is our entryway

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.410
bench and antique ride and today what I want to do I want to show how to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.159
how to repair some of these damages. We need 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.099
a rough patch, a soft patch

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.630
and

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.480
the plastic card,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.090
the hard one and a wax stick

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.330
and a touch up pen and and pretty much

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.260
all these items

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.290
available locally at your grocery store or
hardware store. Before we start

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.869
and go ahead and work on that

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.220
we look at the surface

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.170
the first thing is to check on 
the color tone,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.900
of the pen to see it's matching

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.860
to the surface that we will repair,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.870
and it's a very very good match,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590
here we have a lot of holes

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.580
and it looks quite damaged and what you do is you take your wax stick

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.880
and you rub in some wax

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.060
and see how easy it is to fill it? Now we can see I've filled all these 
holes of the damage

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.729
and to test it now

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.110
the plastic card drive or whatever you have,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.210
I just put the sharp edge here,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.140
that on the surface and we remove 
the excess wax.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.300
Take your pad and you rub

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.060
in the grain direction,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.560
and you clean up

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.740
all the excess

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.030
wax on the surface,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.670
it looks really amazing, there are just a few spots
where substrates of the wood

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.850
is looking through,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.850
and what we do,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.100
we take our white touch up pen,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.340
dab a little bit,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.050
on the surface and just take your time

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.000
look at how nice that looks,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.690
you let it dry for about two or three hours

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.220
and then you can use it.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.980
We want to repair our Montego pedestal table

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.299
in our Mahogany finish. We want 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.400
to repair that really deep

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.619
damage what we have here, we have the 
mahogany color tone here

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.770
burnishing here

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.509
the dark area here, so the way we start out is
first

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.699
Color tone

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.549
all the very deep scratch

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.919
with the Mahogany tone, you do that very very light, and rub away the excess material

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.139
so you've blend it in right away.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.669
What we do

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.870
first is we rub very hard with a lot of pressure,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.449
and just fill it,

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.579
and then you remove the excess material,

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.499
look at how clean that looks here.

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.829
And then on the edge you just take your pad,

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.900
and recreate the way you use the table edge,
and now you can see the difference

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.869
from the Mahogany, expecially on the edge.

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:46.369
We will start off first with a black edge,

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:48.849
and we feather in the color tone,

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.949
and now we're using our 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.299
mahogany color tone marker,

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.239
we do very very small dabs, and 
it blends in 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.039
to the surrounding surface.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:03.059
Okay now we are done, with great results repairing 
the furniture,

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:04.619
It looks amazing the final result.
