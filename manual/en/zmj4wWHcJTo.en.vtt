00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.150
Hi, I'm Kathy Santo with Iams.
Today, we're going talk about

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.420
what to do when you bring
home your new puppy.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.930
We'll cover everything from
supplies and preparation

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.500
steps, to the car ride home,
the first few days, how to

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.420
introduce him or her to
your family, and more.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.860
Before you bring your puppy
home, prepare yourself with

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.280
the following supplies--

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.740
premium puppy food to get your
new puppy off to a good start.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.020
Stainless steel non-tip
food and water bowls.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.220
Identification tags with your
puppy's name and your contact

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.450
information.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.650
A collar and a leather or nylon
six foot leash that's

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.040
1/2 to 3/4 inches wide.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.030
Stain remover for accidents.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.990
Brushes and combs suited
to your puppy's coat.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.190
Dog shampoo, toothbrush
and toothpaste.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.110
High quality safe chew toys
to ease teething.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.110
Flea, tick, and parasite
controls.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.210
Nail clippers.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.760
A room, or at least a place he
can call his own, like a cage

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.340
or a crate that will
fit his adult size.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.970
And, of course, treats.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.670
Once you have the supplies,
it's time to

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.200
puppy-proof your home.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.830
Raising a puppy is a lot like
raising small children.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.580
They get into everything.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.320
Some of what they get into can
be hazardous to their health,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.950
so start preparing for your
puppy's arrival long before

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.150
the actual date.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.860
You'll thank yourself later.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.130
A helpful tip--

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.870
get down on your hands and knees
to view the world like

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.960
your puppy will.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.290
It may help you to find things
that you wouldn't have seen

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.070
otherwise--

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.050
electrical wires, small objects
hidden under couches

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.860
and chairs that can be
swallowed, or hiding spaces

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620
where a small pup
could get stuck.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.120
There are sprays that can be
applied to furniture legs,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.060
woodwork, and other movable
items to help deter your puppy

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.170
from chewing on things you don't
want him to chew on.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.350
Are there rooms your puppy
should be restricted from

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.180
entering until he's better
trained and more reliable?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.770
If so, install a baby gate or
keep the doors to those rooms

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.010
closed until your
puppy matures.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.900
Exercise pens are excellent for
you when you're home, but

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.190
busy or unable to fully
dedicate yourself to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.200
supervising your young pup.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.240
If you're about to make dinner,
for example, rather

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.280
than crating your dog or locking
him in a puppy-proof

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.039
room alone, set up an exercise
pen in the kitchen with you.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.170
This will allow him to get
used to being around your

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.450
family's routine, while also
staying out of the way.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.460
It will also allow him to feel
like he's part of the family.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.000
Once your house is ready, it's
time to bring your new family

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.130
member home.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.530
You want to do your best at
keeping this from being an

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.850
overly stressful experience
for your puppy.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.030
So it may not be the best idea
to bring the whole family,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.730
especially if you have
excited young kids.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.960
Also, keep in mind that the
vibrations, sounds, and the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.130
movements of your car can be
very scary for a young pup and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.500
make them nervous.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.580
On the first trip home, it's
OK to have a passenger hold

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.520
your puppy in a soft blanket
or towel on their lap.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.520
After the first trip home, you
should begin using a crate to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.400
travel for both the dog's and
the other passenger's safety

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.190
in the car.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.080
Try purchasing a dog seat belt
that's specifically designed

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.070
to restrain and protect
your companion

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.720
in case of an accident.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.010
The ideal time to bring home
a new puppy is when

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.370
the house is quiet.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.320
Do your best to minimize the
number of visitors stopping by

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.340
the first few days, so you can
establish a daily routine by

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.060
following these steps.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.040
Step one--

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.670
before bringing him in the
house, take him to the area in

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.180
your yard that will serve as
his potty and spend a few

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.320
minutes there.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.910
If he goes, praise him.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.860
If not, proceed into
the house.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.340
But be sure to take him to this
spot each time he needs

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.830
to go to the bathroom.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.010
Step two--

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.800
take him to the room which will
serve as his new den, and

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.940
if using one, set
up his crate.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.230
Put bedding and chew toys
in the room, and let him

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.480
investigate.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.740
If he chews or urinates
on his bedding,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.450
permanently remove it.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.620
Understand that a young puppy
is not like an adult dog.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.510
Treat him with patience and
constant supervision.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.320
The way you interact with your
puppy at this age is critical

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.700
to his socialization.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.100
Use these tips.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.710
One-- you should spend a little
extra time with your

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.240
new puppy on his first day
home, but you want to

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.890
acclimate him to your regular
routine quickly.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.940
If necessary, hire a dog walker,
or ask a neighbor to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.370
come take him out at regular
intervals during his training

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.300
period and going forward
as your pup grows up.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.080
Two--

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.010
supervise your puppy
at all times and

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.770
interact with him regularly.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.530
Three--

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.750
be alert for signs, sniffing and
circling, that he has to

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.320
go to the bathroom.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.839
Then take him out immediately.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:20.660
Four--

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.990
establish your routine.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.580
A young puppy has no bladder
control and will need to

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.860
urinate immediately after
eating, drinking,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.310
sleeping, or playing.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.840
At night, he'll need to relieve
himself at least every

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.090
three hours.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.000
Five--

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.660
don't punish an accident.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.140
Never push his nose in the
waste or scold him.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.280
He won't understand.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.870
And they learn to go to
the bathroom when

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.020
you're out of sight.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.820
Six--

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.566
praise your puppy every
time he goes to

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:45.020
the bathroom outside.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.850
Seven--

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.500
feed your puppy a formula
designed for puppies.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.490
Like a baby, he needs
nutritious,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.150
highly digestible food.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.940
Eight--

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.880
have the contact info of your
local veterinary office

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.490
readily available in case
of an emergency.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.900
For those with children, another
extremely important

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.760
part of bringing home your new
puppy is making sure your kids

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.750
know how and how not to
handle a young dog.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.210
If your children are young or
aren't familiar with how to

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.650
handle puppies, you need to
spend some time with them

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.580
during these first few days
explaining commonsense rules

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.300
on how to play with the puppy.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.320
For example, tell them that dogs
have sensitive hearing,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.730
so it's important not
to shriek or yell.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.310
Puppies, in particular, need
a lot of rest, just like a

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.660
growing child.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.050
Limit puppy-children play
sessions to 15 to 30 minute

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.650
periods, two to three
times a day.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.340
You need to keep an
eye on a puppy.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.270
An excited puppy can be strong
when he jumps and play bites,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.670
which can be too rough
for young children.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.610
Always supervise interaction
and separate them

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.070
if play is too rough.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.650
If you have other pets, you'll
also need to spend some time

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.990
getting them used to having
each other around.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.730
At first, it's best to keep
resident pets separated from

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.110
your new puppy, but only
for a few days.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.040
After that time, let pets smell
and touch each other

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.890
through a slightly
opened door.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.530
Do this several times over
the next few days.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.720
After that, give the resident
pet access to the den area

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.950
with your new puppy.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.480
Supervise their meeting, and
go back to through the door

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.460
meetings if trouble arises.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.000
Exercise pens can also help old
and new pets get used to

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.230
each other's presence in a
restricted and safe manner.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.100
Lastly, what you'll need to
do is get the puppy into a

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.240
veterinarian for an initial
puppy examination to make sure

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.720
he's in perfect health.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.420
I'm Kathy Santo with Iams, and
I hope that you found this

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.100
helpful as you welcome your new
addition into your family.
