Hi, I'm Eugenie. Today I'm making Coffee Tuiles, Crisp French Wafers.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.280
For this recipe, you will need:

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.700
coffee, confectioners' sugar, water, flour, and butter.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.700
First, in a bowl add in 1T water, 1T warm espresso, and 3T warm melted unsalted butter. And mix well. 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.000
Then stir in confectioners’ sugar. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Finally sift in 3T all-purpose flour. And whisk until homogeneous. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.600
The batter will be very liquidy. So chill in the refrigerator for one hour.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.000
On a silpat, or a greased pan, make disks with a teaspoon of batter. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Bake in the oven preheatd to 300° F. (150° C.) for 10 to 12 minutes, or until dry and set.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Out of oven, immediately transfer the disks to a rolling pin. And press the ends of the wafers to form roof tiles.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.100
Voila, coffee tuiles, crisp French wafers. Basic French pastry.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.300
These are great with ice cream and custard pudding.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.300
