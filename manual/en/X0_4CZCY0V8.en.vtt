00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.950
Marian university's first year program
provides students every opportunity to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.700
be successful in and out of the
classroom.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.000
The program focuses on four principles of success

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.720
active involvement and learning, utilizing campus resources

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.180
social interaction and collaboration and
self-reflection.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.240
The role of the first year program is very focused on two
specific things. One the first year

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.840
seminar where we work with the students in the classroom that first year

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.140
to help them become good critical thinkers.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.460
The second part that we focus in on is the first year experience

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.800
which happens outside the classroom providing opportunities for their growth.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.280
Marian definitely
designed the first year program to help you succeed.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.680
It really helped me utilize
my time management skills.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.980
Marian University and the first year program
really helps students discover who they are.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.100
The first year program pushed me to
do different things and it pushed me out

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.840
of my comfort level and I feel like it's
a main concern of many incoming college

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.130
students is meeting people. The first
year program really helps you do that.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.360
The first year program is going to be so
much of a big help.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.560
We will guide you to the resources in addition to that you'll receive a first-year student leader

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.840
who will be that peer who will guide you
and answer any questions that you may have.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.100
The student mentor aspect of the
program was a big help.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.079
The thing that helped me the most out of the first year
program was the critical thinking model

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.620
and I've used it ever since.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.240
The strongest aspect of the first year Experience Program is

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.120
the connection that you will make with your faculty member.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.160
The faculty are great

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.700
they're very friendly

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.040
they're very one-on-one with you and east to get along with.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.900
Night or day, you can contact them and they will answer back.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.040
I would never thought
you know my first year I would get to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.980
know so many faculty and staff in just a
couple of months

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.420
[music]

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.940
Size of Marian University really
helps me get to know my teachers and helps them get to know me.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.620
It's a smaller campus and I didn't want to have to deal with not knowing people.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.620
My dad still
asked me today if I wish that I had gone

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.850
to a bigger school than Marian I tell
him no I'm definitely satisfied with my

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.580
choice of Marian University.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.480
I was very surprised by the different techniques and tools they offer.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.040
Marian provides every opportunity for me to be successful.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.080
In the classroom on the field and the clubs organizations we challenge

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.660
and support them to grow and develop as
future leaders.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.360
One word sums up Marian is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.860
Wonderful.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.600
Friendly.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.880
Passionate.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.120
Transformation

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.220
Marian University is a great place for students to come because they get a great academic experience and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.240
there's a lot of one-on-one attention
and help.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.440
Check out Marian University. It's the best decision I've ever made.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.900

what was more than what i was living in

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.640
in chicago and fortunately I found it
here

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.660
