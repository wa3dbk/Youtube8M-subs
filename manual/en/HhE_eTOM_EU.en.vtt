Chocolate Martini Recipe

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hello, welcome once again 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to TheFNDC.com’s YouTube channel.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I am your bartending host, Jöhnny Dîablø.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And today, we’re making the Chocolate Martini.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What you’re going to need: Godiva Chocolate Liqueur,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
dark creme de cacao,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
half and half,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
vanilla vodka, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and Kahlúa if you want it. It’s optional.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, chilled martini glass —

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We’ve got a shaker full of ice,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and we’re going to add — start by adding

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 One and a half ounces of your Godiva Dark Chocolate Liqueur.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That one was half of an ounce.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Okay, one and a half ounces of the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
creme de cacao.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
De Cocoa? I don’t know.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Somebody please teach me how to say that word correctly.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Okay...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
1 ½ ounces there.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Okay, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
One ounce of vanilla vodka.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is Smirnoff vanilla vodka, which I use 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
in about half the drinks I make.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You’ll need 1 ½ ounces of half and half.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Alright, and then just a —

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I’m just going to add a splash of Kahlúa.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If you don’t have any on hand, that’s OK.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Just a little bit.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
OK, shake it up.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Nice and cold.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Strain it out...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Ooooh...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Look at that. Goodness.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Goodness in a cup.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Add a little bit of chocolate shavings,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
which I got ready beforehand.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I think that is a winner.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That is a winner.
