00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.010
Excuse me. Er, I was at Tesco's and a friend
of mine, well, he's not a friend of mine,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:17.200
an idiot of...He threw my shoe on top of the
shop of Tesco and I need to get it back down.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.630
Can you come and help me?

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.079
No. Fire Brigade won't do that. You'll have
to contact Tesco. They've got access to the

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.329
roof.

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.000
Why they no sure me a ladder up there I get
it down?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.900
No, Fire Brigade won't come out for that.

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:35.220
So what do you want me to do? Walk around
with no feet..on my shoes?

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.780
Go into Tesco's and ask them to go onto their
roof.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.160
Fire Brigade.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.750
Hi. I don't know who to call so I am calling
you so you can help me.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.010
Okay.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.010
I have this squirrel, this squirrel that has
climbed through my window in my bedroom and

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.800
it's behind my wardrobe. But it is impossible
to move it. It is a big squirrel.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.150
Right. So the squirrel has come in your house
and gone behind your wardrobe?

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.580
Yes.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.110
Ok. And it's trapped behind the wardrobe then?
Yeah? So you have a squirrel trapped behind

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.100
your wardrobe.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.340

noise is..and I'm staying on the ground floor.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.770
Right..

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.280
And the noise is going on and on like you
know when you use the washing machine and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.280
it's going tumbling. It's going on and on
and it's leaking. I don't know what to do.

but we tried it and it's not working .And

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.799
