00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.580
\f0\fs24 \cf0 We finished sheet mulching in
November 2010, and from there the whole goal

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.680
was to just let it sit for a good five months.
\

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.550
\
We held a design charrette on campus, which

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.930
involved a over hundred different participants
coming from all different departments on campus.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.900
We had students, faculty, administrators,
then we had people from the local community

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.050
and even students from other colleges who
drove over an hour and half to get here all

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.520
on a saturday afternoon to participate in
the design of the campus permaculture garden,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.660
which is huge ya know just the fact that we
had that many people come on a Saturday to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.230
design a garden just really shows the movement
and the momentum that this project has created

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.230
in the local community.\
\

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.470
What I didn't know was how inspiring the undergrads
would be to me. So, I'm a slightly older grad

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.500
student and I'm the only one in the group
and all these twenty somethings are kind of

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.330
blowing my mind with there energy. There's
this renewed energy towards healing the earth

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.530
issues like food systems that are broken and
agriculture systems and just living in a manner

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.170
that's more sustainable and I feel like the
students really get that already and it's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.700
been fun to watch.\
\

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.210
When we started uncovering you know some of
the wood chips and exposing some of the cardboard

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.710
that had about half way broken down at this
point. The soil seemed very alive. We noticed

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.810
that there was a whole fungi network that
had taken place. We noticed there was worms.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.990
About 15 to 20 worms every square foot. \
\

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.950
So what we're talking about here are some
of the things that we're putting in the planting

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.880
whole. The basic um premise or the operating
assumption is that we're trying to create

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.120
an environment that's optimal for the plants
to manifest their full potential. So our objective

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.830
is to get a healthily functioning digestive
tract to have access to all the food it needs

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.870
so that plant can grow you know strong and
healthy. So we want to have a full nutritional

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.090
profile mineralogical, biological, etc. of
everything that plant would like to have so

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.550
it can realize it's yield growth, flavor,
nutrition, pest resistance, attributes.\

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.840
\
So there's a lot happening right here it's

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.370
a people space, it's a production space, it's
got areas where storm water is being infiltrated

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.870
off of the sidewalks, it's got water tanks
for collecting rainwater at some point. so

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.490
it's going to do a lot of different things
and not just be food production for the dinning

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.490
commons.\
\

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:11.220
The permaculture garden here is a little bit
less about nutrients and serving students

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.520
the food, although that's critical to the
education which I think is the main purpose

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.520
of this garden.\
\

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.599
Hands on experience and class room experience
are two completely important things, I think

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.599
they have to work together.\
\

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.010
Student's really want to participate. They
want to get out there and gain first hand

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.930
experience in food growing and working with
water and the landscape and building houses

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:44.770
and maintaining all of our human systems.
And folks just crave this experience of learning

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.770
by doing.\
\

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.739
What's incredible is that UMass is one of
the first public universities in the entire

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.440
nation that's doing permaculture like this
directly on the campus and making it extremely

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.590
accessible for students everywhere to come
here to get involved to grab a shovel in between

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.370
classes and really be a part of their campus
sustainability initiative.\

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.110
\
So now we're at this point where we've planted

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.770
a lot of things probably about fifty to a
hundred different species and we are just

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.019
on our way to making this permaculture garden
that's going to be a model for campuses across

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:50.529
the entire nation.\
