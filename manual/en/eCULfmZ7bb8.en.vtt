00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.535 line:92%
&gt;&gt; The focus of attention

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:05.304
for science aboard the
International Space Station is

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:08.841
from NASA's Marshall Flight
Space Center in Huntsville,

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:13.345
Alabama, and standing
by there is Lori Meggs

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.881 line:92%
and she has an update for us.

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.283 line:92%
Lori, you have some results

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:21.020
on some exercise
experiments on board, huh?

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:23.456 line:92%
&gt;&gt; Lori Meggs: That's right.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.825
Do we run differently in
space than we do on earth?

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.526
Well, the answer
may surprise you.

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:29.762
A study called Treadmill
Kinematics looked

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:33.899
into how astronauts run on a
treadmill on the Space Station.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.202
I recently spoke
with or ran with?

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:40.673
No, I spoke with principal
investigator to learn more.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:44.910
&gt;&gt; The idea behind the study
was to collect motion capture

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.814
and ground reaction force data
from astronauts as they exercise

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:51.851
on the Space Station in
order for us to be able

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.587
to quantify these and
then compare those motions

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.355
to how they're performed
on earth.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:58.124
&gt;&gt; Lori Meggs: So how did
it actually work on station?

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.525 line:92%
&gt;&gt; It was very simple actually.

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:03.095
All we wanted to do was capture
data during an actual exercise

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:04.797 line:92%
session for the astronauts.

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:08.000
We collected data six times
from each of our subjects

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.302
and essentially all they
did was place a video camera

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:13.606
up to view the side while
they performed their exercise

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:14.773 line:92%
and the treadmill that's

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:17.109
on the Space Station
automatically captures the

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.677 line:92%
ground reaction force data.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:20.412
So we would down
link the video data,

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:21.947
down link the ground
reaction force data

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:25.217
and then we would start
computing what the peak forces

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.253
were and what the joint
motion patterns were.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.888 line:92%
It's very straightforward.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.123
&gt;&gt; Lori Meggs: How many
subjects did you end up with?

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:34.760
&gt;&gt; We had 8 subjects;
7 males and 1 female.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.362
&gt;&gt; Lori Meggs: So tell me
do we have results yet?

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.630 line:92%
&gt;&gt; We do have results.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.732
There's a couple of things
that are very interesting.

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.801
The first is that the running
style or the running motion

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:46.438
that we use in space is pretty
much the exact same running

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:48.407
motion that we use
on the ground.

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:51.377
So people run in zero
gravity the same as they run

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.013
in 1 gravity even though
they have to wear a harness

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:57.049
and a bunch of that
connects them to the floor.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.185
On the surface, that
may be a so what?

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.553 line:92%
Well, there's a big so what.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:03.923
First of all the exercise that
they do on earth we can say

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.658
that the way they're going
to move in space is going

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:09.128
to be the same so we can start
to have better confidence

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:13.299
that the way we exercise or the
way we prescribe our exercise

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.535
on earth would be the same as
in space, but more importantly

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:19.805
and this is where motor control
experts may be interested we

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:23.042
have things in our body
that we use for control

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.477
such as the [inaudible]
that rely on gravity.

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.947
These data suggest
that either when we're

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.415 line:92%
in zero gravity we turn

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.951
that information off
or we override it.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.420
So, it's not an important
control mechanism,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.056
and I think for people
studying how the brain works

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.792
and how the brain controls
motion this is a really big

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:43.662
study or really big result
because in the past most

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.397
of these studies where
people have tried to look

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:48.300
at how gravity affects motion
have really been focusing

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.769
on smaller motions like
reaching and grabbing something

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.839
and this is the only time that
we have a large scale amount

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.875
of data with a pretty
large motion like running

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.044
where you've got multiple
joints moving very quickly.

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:00.613 line:92%
To me it was pretty amazing

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:04.516
that the people pretty much
run the same exact way in space

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:05.718 line:92%
as they do on the ground.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.786
&gt;&gt; Lori Meggs: What are
the earth applications

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:09.054 line:92%
for this experiment?

00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:11.323
&gt;&gt; We had to collect some
pretty sophisticated data

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:12.758 line:92%
in a very difficult location

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:16.562
and we developed some ways
using single camera video

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:19.665
and being able to convert
that data into coordinates

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:22.501
that we could compute
joint angles with.

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:24.903
These are techniques that
could be used by practitioners

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:27.439
in any area where
they can't afford

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.776
or they can't bring a
$100,000 motion capture system

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.311
to where they are doing
their data collection.

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:35.881
They could do what we did
for sports or for rehab

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:36.915 line:92%
or anything like that.

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:38.484
So we've developed
some methodologies

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.819
that could be useful for
people on the ground.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.221
&gt;&gt; Lori Meggs: Anything else
you want to say about it?

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.356
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the ground reaction
force data that's the other part

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:48.260
this is what's really important
for the exercise efficiency.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.397
What we find is that the
exercise forces that you get

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.532
in zero G are much
less than in 1 G,

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:55.200 line:92%
but they increase with speed.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.202 line:92%
So, what we want and would

00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:59.438
like our astronauts
to do is run faster.

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:02.474
If we can have faster running,
maybe they do interval training

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:05.110
where they run fast and
rest and run fast and rest,

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.247
they could get a better
response for their bone growth

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:11.450
than if they run in slower speed
for a longer period of time.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.451
&gt;&gt; Lori Meggs: What's
the reaction to that

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.620
when you tell an
astronaut run faster?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.654 line:92%
[Laughter]

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:17.056
&gt;&gt; Some of them they
think that's great

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:19.491
because they're runners; some
of them maybe aren't so excited

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:21.994
because that's not their
favorite sort of exercise,

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:23.629
but we're hoping that
we can show these data

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:24.730 line:92%
to the astronauts now.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.498
So, instead of us
just saying run faster

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:29.768
because we think it's good,
we can show them run faster

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:32.271 line:92%
because we know it's good.

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.173
&gt;&gt; Lori Meggs: And if you would
like to find out more about this

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:36.842
and other human research
investigations,

00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:40.212 line:92%
go to nasa.gov slash station.

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:42.715
We have an astronaut
there at the helm today,

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:45.584
a [inaudible] operation's
director T.J. Cramer [phonetic]

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:48.287
directing the team of
flight controllers here busy

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:50.055 line:92%
at work on a Friday.
