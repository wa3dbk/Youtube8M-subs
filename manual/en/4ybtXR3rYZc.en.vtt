00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.940
Hey! Welcome back to the MrExcel netcast.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.940
I'm Bill Jelen.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.730
Basically we start out with massive amount of data.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.740
How are we gonna analyze as well.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.080
Let's fire up a pivot table.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.070
See if we can solve this problem.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.700
Hey! Welcome back to the MrExcel netcast.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.640
I'm Bill Jelen.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.689
Okay! Now, I have a quiz for you today.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.560
I'm gonna ask the quiz first, that we can think about it.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.000
Tell you the story behind the quiz.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.180
The quiz comes from David in California.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.680
David passed this tip along.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.409
We have a cell here, the cell has a formula.

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:36.320
I want you to convert that formula to values using exactly three keystrokes.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.820
Not,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.000
[ctrl + C], edit, paste special values, which is 5.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.960
How can convert that formula to values in 3 keystrokes?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.960
Now, let me tell you how this came about.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.280
You know, I'm on Facebook and LinkedIn and so on and a few weeks ago.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.620
I found my

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.900
manager from 1988.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.700
The guy kind of responsible for starting my whole Excel career.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.000
His name is Mark.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.530
He worked up in our finance department

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.500
and he hired me out of the IT department and that's really...

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.320
For the next several years.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.180
Where I started to use spreadsheets a lot and became very, very good

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.200
at Excel and Mark now works in Chicago.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.810
I was doing a seminar in Chicago, a few blocks from Mark's office and so Mark said yeah!

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.320
Come on out, and we had a great time catching up.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.110
But then Mark called in three of his sharpest Excel guys.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.760
And I challenged him to a little competition.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.229
He introduced me as MrExcel and said that if they could stump me.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.940
They would win an expensive dinner.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.099
Now, of course you know, so that it's game on.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.610
Right and I try to pull out some of my favorite Excel tricks.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.080
You know like how do you copy that formula down to all of the cells.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.160
Well, you know, as you know if you've watched this podcast.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.260
You double click the fill handle and the three guys are like,

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.080
well that doesn't count.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.349
What do you mean? It doesn't count?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.840
He says well, you're using the mouse.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.820
Hey! You don't need to use the mouse when you use Excel.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.839
I'm like

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.410
you're right.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.980
You don't need to use the mouse when using Excel.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.490
You're actually a lot faster,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.759
so there

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.479
it was kind of like playing dueling Excel, right.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.240
So, they said you don't have to use the mouse at all

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.580
equal 2 + 2 and that formula.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.110
Here's what they do [left] [end]

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.069
[down] [right] [X] or anything and [up]

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:13.840
[ctrl + C].

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.209
And then [ctrl + shift + down arrow] and because we put the X there, we select the whole range and [ctrl + V].

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.180
I'm using the mouse you know, it would actually be

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.069
interesting to see which is faster double-click the fill handle

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.880
Or do that whole keystrokes.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.169
If you did the keystrokes time and time again,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.930
I bet there'd be a very fast way to do that.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.680
Okay!

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.090
So, you know I had to come up with some other trick, that didn't involve the mouse and then

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.800
Dave from California said all right! Here's one.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.400
How do you convert that formula to values in three keystrokes.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.700
Now, I had to think about it for a second.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.280
I came up with it.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.300
I thought it was an interesting trick.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.119
So, I did put that on Facebook, the next day.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.440
You know, here's the quiz.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.720
How can you do this and a few people came up with interesting ideas.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.140
A lot of them had it.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.080
Although, what I do like about this, is

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.980
Greg

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.660
says he uses application dot [on] key to do it in one keystroke.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.240
Hooray to Greg!

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.890
Now, let's come back and take a look at Dave's solution

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.760
and then we'll also take a look at Greg's solution.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.190
So, here's what we're going to do.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.680
We're gonna press the [F2] key.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.059
The [F2] key puts that cell, in edit mode and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.209
then once we have a cell in edit mode if you press [F9],

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.439
it converts it to the current value and then press [Enter] and it will convert that cell to Magus.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.860
Let's take a look at Greg's method which you know, is actually even better.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.350
Greg goes into visual basic and in

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.859
the workbook open, of his personal macro workbook.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.100
He uses application dot On key,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.260
and it assigns it to a key.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.639
So, I used here [ctrl + shift + V] and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.600
said that when we do that.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.640
We're going to run a procedure called paste values and then in module one,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.359
it's a one line macro,  right here, paste values.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.970
So, I need to get rid of that.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.280
It's a one line macro selection dot value equals selection dot value.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.669
So, now here

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.400
we will have this formula.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.780
So, I have the formula, just press [ctrl + shift + V]

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.900
and I convert those formulas to values.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.340
So, there you have it.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.059
A couple of different ways

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.520
to very quickly convert a single cell from formulas to values

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.070
and of course, let's just

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.200
for completeness here.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.780
I'm going to show you my favorite way of doing this.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.760
If we have a whole bunch of formulas.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.809
Now, this is using the mouse, go to the right edge right click and

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.899
drag that somewhere because we right click and drag

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.540
we then have a new pop up menu with copy here as values only.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.040
If you need to convert them to values,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.510
right where they are, drag right drag left

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.660
copy here as values only.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.940
So, there you have it.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.460
Want to send a shout-out to Mark.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.320
The manager who got the whole thing started.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.920
Also his three Excel guys and Dave for the cool Excel tips, today.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.240
We should actually declare you know,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.820
"a national use Excel without the Mouse day"

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.149
and watch how fast everyone that goes.

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:58.529
It's true if you don't have to reach out to the mouse, once you learn all those great keyboard shortcuts.

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.620
It's a much faster way to go.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.199
Wanna thank you for stopping by, we'll see you next time for another netcast from MrExcel.

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.558
Thanks for stopping by, we'll see you next time for another netcast from MrExcel.
