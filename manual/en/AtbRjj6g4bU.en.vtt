00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.249
stephen from washington state

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:08.629
welcome to the program just wanted to
play a couple more setting real quick

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.330
uh... here illegally in your interview
with the can-do attitude and uh... he

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.309
can throw expat whatever the group
called yeah

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.140
uh... you made a really you made a
really good point appeared about how

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.499
uh...

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.739
quoting art actual terrorism and
requiring sacrifice from the top ten did

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.659
not mortally equivalent to

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.230
taking away food from local people and i
think that

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.250
patni at the uh... brought up more often
and also i noticed that in

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.110
seventy thousand page of the tax code we
didn't have a single proposal

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.560
what exactly he would change 'cause the
changes are right you can also

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.809
specifically with the cuts to medicare
or social security

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.109
but when it comes to uh... tax uh...
changes just uh... descent open and will

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.800
cut the loopholes

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.390
but yes you're right that mean that the
the far more important point is that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.960
what what is the movement is the meaning
of the word sacrifice

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.600
i mean what what do you do that a as
someone who makes four hundred thousand

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.790
dollars uh... annually

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.120
or makes a million dollars annually who
has ten million dollars worth of assets

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.400
or is making their money uh... from
investments and are paying a lower tax

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.140
rate what is it that constitutes
sacrifice for them

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.600
on the same level uh... as someone who
is making thirty thousand dollars a year

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.840
in retirement

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.110
and they have to forego things like

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.300
senior a movie the luxury of senior a
movie or

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.890
the idea that well a couple of times a
week i'm just gonna have uh... rama

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.850
noodles

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.340
in my retirement

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.460
wet winter what is that word shared sat
which is that even

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.350
me what is the word sacrifice to me at
that point for those people

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.460
there is no separate sacrificing
anything

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.310
you're not going to change their habits
thereby ini

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.400
well i was gonna buy that not hundred
thousand dollar maserati and now i think

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.119
i'm gonna get the eighty thousand dollar
model

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.909
any evidence that was the list where
which is not the case at worst

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:15.199
edit what days are really a sacrifice is
not really a sacrifice is that shared

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:19.839
sacrifice i mean give me a break gimme a
break but we're prepared by democrats

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:20.489
wicker

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.870
did find a way to put it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.499
more simply i mean it

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.499
if you take all incoming and million

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:32.099
quieted i'd rather denying are you still
living a pretty are some wire with nine

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.499
million dollars when they come

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.339
from uh... you know it

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.510
itself all there

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.839
away i know it was in touch

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.429
once you get the left and things get
really feel the feel little if you
