00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.460
Yesterday we were showing you a few places
where the holes were a little too big in the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:12.589
walls. There is one right there, and then
here is another down here. So what we are

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.840
doing to make sure that when the inspector
comes and everything is going to be tight

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.210
and in the right places, we're going to go
ahead and have him patch those little holes

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.570
to make sure that everything comes out right.
So right now he has gone ahead and cut a hole

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.129
a little bigger and a little more square and
he is going to go ahead and stick a "One by"

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.059
behind the wall. What he is doing is he is
creating a sort of a half stud for the drywall

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.710
to screw in to so he is going to go ahead
and he is going to screw that piece into the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.309
existing drywall and then he is going to create
a small patch that he can screw in to that.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.160
So this is a pretty cool way of patching the
wall if you have a small hole and you don't

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:12.241
want to demo open the whole wall to patch
the whole thing. So what he has done right

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:19.260
here is he has created a brace of wood against
the drywall supported by the drywall to screw

00:01:19.260 --> 00:02:15.840
in a small patch.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:29.600
See and that is the basic idea is you go ahead
and screw one in on one side and then have

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:44.010
an electric one and screw it in on the other
side too. This is one of the other ways of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.489
patching that way.
