00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.770
Hello! I am glad to welcome you at my kitchen!

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.520
Today, we will cook a dish out of strawberries again.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.249
Recipe #2 is Strawberry Lemon Slush.

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.900
I don't know why it is called "slush" but I like it.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.219
If you have any guesses - write in the comments!

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.699
For this recipe we take:

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.210
250 g strawberries, 1 cup ice,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.449
1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 lemon and a sprig of mint for garnish.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.069
Also we need 2 whisking containers.

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.370
Or 1 cup and 1 jug.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.980
Getting Started!

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.900
I take a small whisking container.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:49.000
Place 1/3 of strawberries into it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.140
Remove strawberry caps.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.910
We don't need it.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.400
How beautiful! I want to it eat!

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.360
Take a cutting board.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.960
I have big pieces of ice.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.300
I have to break it into small pieces.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.370
Ran away! Nothing wrong.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.030
Add to strawberries.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.750
Take a blender.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.250
Use blade "meat mincer".

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.070
With two-blade cutter.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:36.460
Blend on first speed, until almost smooth.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.160
We made such puree.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.600
Ice with strawberries.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.400
Leave blender on the table.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.350
Set aside the whisking container.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.920
Take the remaining strawberries.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.160
Remove and discard caps from remaining strawberries.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.720
Place them into another whisking container.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.890
Add the juice of half a lemon.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.059
Pre-remove the seeds to avoid their falling into container.

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.429
One seed is fell.

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:20.979
I'll look for it.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.909
Add the powdered sugar.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.029
By taste.

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:32.269
Want more sweet - add more. I add all.

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.939
Set the blade "multi-blade mincer".

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:44.009
Blend on high speed about 30 seconds or until almost smooth.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.200
We made a beautiful colored puree.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.259
Pour strawberry with ice here.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:08.349
Stir.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.929
Slush is ready!

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:15.929
Turn off the blender.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:26.800
Pour into glasses.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.729
Garnish with a sprig of mint or whole strawberries.

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.599
And an umbrella, because it's called Slush!

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.019
- Taste! Which one do you like more?

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.199
- This.

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.859
- Like?

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.159
- It tastes better than strawberry-banana smoothies!
- Why?

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.200
- Because it is sweeter.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.619
- That's the whole secret: I added more sugar here!

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:59.179
Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.000
