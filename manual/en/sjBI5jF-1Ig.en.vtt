00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.069
Hey guys, what's up? A couple of days ago my friend discovered an Easter egg

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.269
in the Command Prompt. I have not done this Easter egg yet,

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.360
but he says it's pretty neat and he wrote down the instructions for me to follow. So I'm gonna do that.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.410
If you guys haven't opened up the Command Prompt up yet, open it up now.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.599
The first step says to type in help.

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.949
And view the basic assortment

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.920
of commands, so [gibberish]

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:33.929
Next, he says to type Phil in. Huh.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.260
Phil is not recongnized

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.789
as an internal or external command. Oh oh.

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:44.000
He says that would pop up, okay? So...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.329
Next he says type help again and go to 'P'

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.760
So lets locate the 'P'

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.270
Oh oh.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.430
Oh my God! Look! PHIL : Have you seen Phil?

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.750
What?

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.420
what?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.970
Okay, next it says...

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.730
It doesn't really say anything next actually. How do I get more

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.409
information on this? Type 'help command-name'

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.300
Okay?

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.920
Help

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
What was it? Was it Upperca-- PHIL Okay

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.690
So

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.050
Phil

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.760
Whoa! whoa whoa.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.180
What is this? There is nothing left on the instructions

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.270
So...

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.570
Not really sure what to expect. "Did you see Phil?"

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.340
'Phil who?'
