really fight

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.799
right which is

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.819
which is called larry demand a family with
the low end of that one of those party in

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.689
farah exactly devised all straight but i think
that totally the wrong strategy

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.799
issue to come out and said a lot of all

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.199
about a vote

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.769
fifteen have a few rocket and

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.159
they know nothing to do

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.450
i plan to go off and somebody i and stayed

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.779
yeah because i think about that for a second
thing

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.569
like i don't know much about japanese political
views because you don't hear about it that

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.309
much as the

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:08.159
is that the news about him having a wild parties
comes out everyone's like oh my god here by

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.050
jeffrey wild parties on his yacht

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.809
like okay

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:15.219
here's why does that matter two things matter
if you're running for uh... office in the

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:16.439
united states

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.810
of what your religion

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.270
do party too hard

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.879
if if your answer is not a lot

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.209
but and if you party too hard

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:24.980
you're done

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.209
you have no chance

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.479
you

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.799
now that that you can

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.089
one other phase of the students said that
she is the shoes serving antisymmetric

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:40.589
and while he knew she was serving the dream
she noticed that this river bud but he said

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:44.159
was giving immoral sex right

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.339
how what's news with both

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:50.930
but the fact that the i mean i dispose micah
green font of all time at all evening i regret

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.449
is that i would love it

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:53.819
spitball before

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.449
i mean come on the earth the ruling organized
is to say it does leaves and then it'd be

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:00.159
like

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.789
and you know what they're saying

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:05.909
we have sometimes of what we haven't talked
to you know when i said right right

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.879
and uh... you know what the funeral but maybe
the effects of the earth

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.679
are often scarred revisited

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:17.239
at people like that i think that that we did
that for some reason but i agree with you

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.070
i like it if someone was bold enough to go
on television give a press conference

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.470
and say something like that idea like okay
i don't know your stance is on anything that

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.030
you got my vote like that

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.800
you figure also if you're honest enough about
your heart party here you'll be honest about

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.770
other things

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.460
and i'm thinking about you haven't already

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.759
yet and he said he didn't do it oecologia
from object you got back on a hot your present

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.030
mike tyson like that everybody has reportage
you didn't do it

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.009
draw what else are you having a

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.229
