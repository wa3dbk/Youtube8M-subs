00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.000
Well first of all Langley Interiors

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.001
primarily is a family business

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.502
so this is our 40th Anniversary

00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:07.803
which we are really really excited about

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:09.804
and because of that we are doing

00:00:09.805 --> 00:00:11.305
what we do best and making three

00:00:11.306 --> 00:00:13.506
brand new rooms for our showroom.

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:19.007
We like to think that we've got a

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.008
centre of excellence for interiors

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.009
Peter is extremely good at managing

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.010
and designing interior space

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:33.311
most people think of interior space in terms of

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:37.312
just one aspect of it but we can

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:38.813
pull all of it together.

00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:42.014
Soft furnishings, we manufacture the furniture,

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:46.015
Peter does all of the interior design and layouts,

00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:55.016
I like to think of it more as a boutique

00:00:55.017 --> 00:00:57.017
for bedrooms, bathrooms and

00:00:58.718 --> 00:01:00.018
and other areas.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.319
And as you wander round the showroom

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.620
its very difficult I think to take it all in

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:06.621
in one visit.

00:01:06.622 --> 00:01:08.322
The detail that is in here

00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:12.323
does take a while to just

00:01:12.324 --> 00:01:14.024
soak it all up.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:17.725
And of course the devil is in the detail.

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:20.026
Everything that our clients want

00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:21.427
we pull all of the trades together

00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:24.428
the electricals, plumbing,

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.429
plastering, decorating,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.630
the whole thing really.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.831
We pride ourselves on being an interior designer,

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:34.532
not just furniture manufacturer these days

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.433
so we do actually help clients to source

00:01:36.434 --> 00:01:38.034
accessories for the room

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:40.235
everything in the whole showroom you can buy,

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:41.536
or if there is something in particular

00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:43.237
that you want that will

00:01:43.238 --> 00:01:44.238
go with your room

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:45.939
then we can help you source that.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.940
We are a local wine merchants

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:52.141
specialising in top quality wines by the case,

00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:54.742
and we are proud to be here this evening

00:01:54.743 --> 00:01:57.043
to support a wonderful evening.

00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:00.044
Well I'm Ian Walsh and I am a company called

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:02.045
IWI watches, and I manufacture

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:04.046
my own watches.

00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:08.047
This watch I designed on the theme of like Mods,

00:02:08.048 --> 00:02:10.048
like Paul Weller and things like that,

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.249
I actually gave Paul Weller

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.650
one of these watches last year.

00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:15.151
Because I've been here for 12 years

00:02:15.152 --> 00:02:16.152
as a sales manager,

00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:17.353
then generally at Langley's we believe

00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:19.154
that we've got to offer good value for money,

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:20.155
something different,

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:22.156
and give the customer what they want,

00:02:22.157 --> 00:02:23.557
satisfaction at the end of the day.

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:28.158
We drove past about three months ago,

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.459
and I talked my wife into coming in

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.960
to have a look around,

00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:35.061
and Peter is now doing three bathrooms,

00:02:35.062 --> 00:02:37.062
three bedrooms for a full house

00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:38.463
that we are building in the garden.

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:41.464
You need to come and see this because

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:44.165
its not like the magazine or the website

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.166
you've got to feel it, touch it, experience it

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:49.167
because the quality is just out of this world.

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:50.168
Yeah, yeah...

00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:51.168
I've not seen anything like it.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.469
Its absolutely brilliant.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.470
Its special, its different,

00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:57.471
its designed to fit what you want

00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:00.072
you don't have to buy a package from

00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:01.373
someone that is a certain size

00:03:01.374 --> 00:03:04.174
he'll build anything to fit in any room.

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:09.075
We are definitely a very unique showroom

00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:10.476
people who come in here

00:03:11.077 --> 00:03:12.077
we are very proud to say,

00:03:12.078 --> 00:03:14.478
say this is the best showroom in the country

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.479
and that I hear it time and time again

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.880
and it just fills me with pride

00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:20.681
to be able to work for this place

00:03:20.682 --> 00:03:22.682
and work within this family company

00:03:22.683 --> 00:03:24.683
and produce something that is so beautiful,

00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:27.084
so unique that people get a lot of

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:29.085
pleasure out of in their day to day life.
