00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.749
your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.879
we're going to learn Kashmiri fried

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.310
rice, this is usually done with leftover rice

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.040
also you can just use any cooked rice to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.830
make this and they call it Tud Tud Bhata

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.540
I cannot pronounce it right but it's a

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000
Kashmiri fried rice on which they put

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.300
a fried egg and serve and it is superb, you know

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.759
first we're going to make some fried egg so

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.370
just pour some oil in a pan and we're

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.100
going to make some fried egg and now season

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.200
the way you like I'm going to just put

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.670
some salt and some chili powder that's

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.430

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.610
