00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.840
Determination of Density of Solid

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.880
The density of a material is defined as its
mass per unit volume. If ‘D’ is the density

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.180
of a body of mass ‘M’ and volume ‘V’,
then D= M/V.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:42.220
Here our aim is to determine the density of a solid which is denser than water

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.680
by using a spring balance and a measuring cylinder.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.600
Materials Required:

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.900
Iron stand, spring balance, lock, cuboid,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:11.360
wooden block, stone, measuring cylinder, a beaker containing water, thread and scissors

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.980
Procedure:

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.800
To determine the density of an object, the mass of the object has to be measured.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.020
Hang a spring balance using an iron stand as shown.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.030
Suspend a lock on the hook of the spring balance.
Observe the mass of the lock carefully and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.310
note it down.
To measure the volume of the lock, a graduated

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:49.100
cylinder of proper size and capacity is used.
Fill it with water up to a particular level.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.690
Note the reading.
Cut a piece of thread, tie the lock and then

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.680
immerse the lock slowly in the graduated cylinder
containing water by holding the free end of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.620
the twine. The lock displaces water and the
water level rises. Note the current position

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:17.629
of the water level. Find the difference between
the final and initial levels of water which

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:24.810
will give the volume of the lock immersed.
Now we can determine the density of the lock

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.810
by using the formula:
Density= ( M/V which is equal to (mass in

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.430
gram)/(volume in cm3 )

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.020
By the same procedure we can also find the
density of a stone and a wooden block.
