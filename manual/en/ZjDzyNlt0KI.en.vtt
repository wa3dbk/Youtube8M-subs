00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:04.576
&gt;&gt; Did you know that two thirds of
adults and one quarter of adolescents

00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:06.696
in Michigan are overweight or obese?

00:00:07.816 --> 00:00:14.136
As obesity and its associated conditions of
type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:18.266
and poor bone and joint health are
on the rise, so does our knowledge

00:00:18.296 --> 00:00:21.386
about sugar sweetened beverages
and their effects.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:26.496
Sugar sweetened beverages include carbonated
soft drinks, fruit flavored drinks,

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.946
sports drinks, energy drinks and
even sweetened teas and coffees.

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:35.676
Studies have shown that these
beverages, empty and nutritional but full

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:40.526
of calories can contribute
to serious health issues.

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:45.526
Sugary beverages are a trap for many of us
because it's easy to consume a large amount

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:48.176
of calories from them without even feeling full.

00:00:48.336 --> 00:00:55.846
One 12 ounce can of soda is about 150
empty calories with 10 teaspoons of sugar.

00:00:57.046 --> 00:01:04.426
If someone drinks one 12 ounce soda each day
for a year, it adds up to 76 cups of sugar

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:10.546
with a possible 16 pound weight
gain; that's why the University

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:13.406
of Michigan health system is
taking a stand when it comes

00:01:13.536 --> 00:01:15.816
to promoting healthy choices in our community.

00:01:16.936 --> 00:01:21.716
In November 2013, we stopped
serving sugar sweetened beverages

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:26.146
and began offering healthier choices
in our hospitals and health centers,

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:28.646
administrative buildings and medical school.

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:34.596
Though any patient, visitor,
employee or student is welcome

00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:37.166
to bring their own sugar sweetened
beverages into our buildings,

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:42.976
it's our hope that not offering these drinks
is one step toward creating an environment

00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:44.856
where people can make healthier choices.

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:50.626
