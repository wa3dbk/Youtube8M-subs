bjbjz Walter: Now, folks, I have to admit
to you that I lied to you. It's not we are

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.040
cooking grilled honey mustard chicken. It's
Jan is, and I'm standing here watching. Jan:

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.940
That's right. Walter: I've got a bone to pick
with you before we start, though. I know the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.340
chicken's boneless, but I've got a bone to
pick. Jan: What's up? Walter: You have it

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.130
smelling so good in here. Jan: This stuff
does smell really, really good, and what I

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.980
love about this most is that it's lightning
fast. It takes moment to do. Walter: My kind

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.200
of stuff. Jan: Well, and in this case I used
chicken tenders, and I stuck them on skewers

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.790
just because my kids like stuff on a stick.
It doesn't do a thing other than that. Walter:

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.720
Yeah. Jan: And the sauce that I do has four
ingredients. Walter: OK. Jan: I've got about

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.620
a quarter cup of honey. I think when I wrote
the recipe I said a third of a cup of Dijon

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.900
mustard, but don't pay attention to what I've
got in the bowl. I actually decided that I

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.780
like using the spicy grain mustard. Walter:
Yeah. Jan: I like that better. I've got a

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.060
little touch of steak sauce, about a teaspoon,
and just a few drops of Worcestershire sauce.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.680
Those together make... Walter: That's what's
making it smell so good in here. Jan: ... it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.430
smell so good, and those savory ingredients
really do a number on the honey, which cuts

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.220
the mustard. Ha ha. Walter: Ha ha. Jan: Ha,
ha, ha. Walter: I'm going to pretend you didn't

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.020
say that. Jan: [laughs] Walter: I mean, that's
bad enough I'm might have said it. Jan: Isn't

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.860
that bad? Well, it works. All right, so we're
going to mix this up, and it doesn't have

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.530
to be perfect. One of the tricks with this,
if you have an outdoor grill, you can actually

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.200
use this stuff as a marinade, and I love the
flavor, but since we're grilling inside, the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.700
sticky honey gets in the grill pan and it
will turn into a black sludge, which... Walter:

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.330
Is not good. Jan: ... not that I would know
about the black sludge. I read about it online.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Walter: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jan: Yeah, yeah.
So you want to wait until they're almost finished,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:52.450
and you just brush a little of this on here,
and it will caramelize. Walter: And look as

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.710
pretty as it smells. Jan: It does. I like
this for my picky eaters, because it is so

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.310
pretty. Walter: Well, because I've always
been known as a picky eater, pick almost anything

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.479
and I'll eat it, is what that means, but I
can understand that this would get anybody.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.060
There's nothing in here to not be thrilled
about having in here. Jan: No, there's not,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.640
because it's low in fat. It's lots of flavor.
It's super fast, super easy. This is my emergency,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.389
'Don't get home on time" dinner. Walter: And
if it happened to be that the chicken breasts

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.989
were on sale or the chicken tenders... Jan:
You'd do the whole thing. Walter: Buy the

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.349
chicken breast, cut it into long strips, and
it's fabulous. Take a look at the centerpiece.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.540
The centerpiece is going to show you how nice
it is. Look at that. Now, that with a green

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.910
salad? I mean, Jan, that's all right. I don't
care what you say. Jan: It is pretty good.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.939
Walter: You need, you desperately need to
get this recipe, folks. We could tell it to

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.209
you and you would immediately know what it
was, but write and get the recipe. Write Chef's
