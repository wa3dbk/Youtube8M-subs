Hi everybody this is Blank Dino

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.399
and today we're gonna be learning about
egg molding. Specifically egg morning

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.099
for bento.  If you've never done it before, what you do is, you make boiled eggs and place

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.040
them in a mold

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.570
and they come out in cute shapes and

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.750
I hope you have fun!

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.750
The first thing you'll need to do is get egg molds.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.529
I got these on Amazon and I'll add a
link in the comment on where to buy them.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.960
Fill a pot with water.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.960
Turn on your stove, and place the pot on the burner.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.539
You want to get jumbo or large eggs

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.750
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.500
Add some salt to your water

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.300
carefully and one at a time place the
eggs into your water ones that has come to a boil.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.180
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.240
be careful that you didn't add too much
water or the pot will

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.369
overflow when you add the eggs.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.360
after you add the eggs set a timer for
eight minutes

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.360
while the eggs are boiling add ice to a bowl and then add water.  Leave it in the sink.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.009
Once your timer goes
off

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.080
Remove the eggs and place them
carefully

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.180
one at a time into the ice water

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.380
 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.930
After they've been in the ice water for about 10 minutes remove them

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.420
and peel them

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.420
I like to tap the egg a few times on
the counter before peeling

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.640
it helps make it easier.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.580
Once you have your egg peeled take that bad boy and put him in the mold

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.700
Now if you have a jumbo eggs like I do
we're gonna have some egg

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.459
squeeze out the side so it might be good to use a large size egg

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.319
Once you have your egg on the mold

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.660
place it back into the ice water this will allow the egg to set and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.510
stay in that cute shape

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.360
Do this for all of your eggs and all of your molds.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.959
 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.220
after about 10 minutes you can take your
eggs out on the water

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.030
and open the molds.  Now if you used jumbo eggs or large eggs like me

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.230
you're going to need to use a small paring knife to cut away the excess bits of egg

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.709
These pieces of egg are still edible

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.370
so you can eat them as a snack.
Carefully cut away the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.409
sides so that the egg edge is smooth

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.040
But don't cut yourself

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.609
because that is bad

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.060
 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.129
then after you're done cutting the edges remove the egg from the mold

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.230
and here you have our finished product

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.280
A heart and a star

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.069
