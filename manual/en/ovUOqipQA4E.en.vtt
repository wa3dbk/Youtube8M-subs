My name’s Lisa Winn and I’m studying the
masters in Publishing here at Kingston.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.910
I was most interested in the course… one
because it’s in London, which I always have

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.920
wanted to live in London; it’s one of the
few schools that actually offers a masters

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.270
in just publishing – a lot of other schools
offer creative courses but not directly geared

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.220
towards publishing, and I was definitely interested
in that.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.010
We’ve studied every aspect of publishing,
whether it’s been rights, editorial, marketing

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.279
and publicity, even at the evolution of publishing
a little bit of the background and history

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.991
from the 19th century up to today.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.110
It’s been very fascinating.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.010
I definitely enjoy all of the teachers on
the course because they are very knowledgeable

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.080
about the industry – they’ve all worked
in the industry themselves and so they do

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.010
know what they're talking about.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.870
And I’ve also enjoyed the master classes
that we’ve had.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.340
We’ve had a lot of opportunity to have outside
professionals come in and teach us about their

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.330
careers and how they got started in publishing,
and what they view is the best thing about

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.960
publishing and where publishing is going in
the future.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.050
Yeah, it was a little bit of an adjustment,
more so than I thought it would be, but Kingston

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.130
was very helpful, their international programme
here is fantastic.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.730
I was able to find accommodation quite easily,
and it’s been great getting to know everybody

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.640
from all over the place.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.580
I’m definitely, definitely looking to get
into trade publishing.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.060
My experiences here have definitely helped
to streamline my career goals.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.090
Before I came here I was not exactly sure
what department or what type of company I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.960
wanted to work for, but now that I’ve been
here it’s helped me to really focus on my

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.541
future, about going into a big company like
Penguin or Random House or Bloomsbury and

00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:37.990
really progressing in that direction.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.980
I would just say it’s been a very fun opportunity.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.650
It’s very conveniently located to London,
which has been a huge amount of fun for me

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.490
because I love big cities.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.180
It’s helped me to get to know a few of the
professionals in the industry.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.909
I’m actually quite excited to work with
my supervising person over my practical project;

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.370
he’s very well connected in the industry.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.200
I think it’s just been a pleasant experience
all around.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.799
I would say it’s been a great experience
for me.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.770
The institution’s fantastic in helping people
come over here.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.649
They helped me with accommodation and really
settling in.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.080
It’s been a very pleasant experience and
I would definitely recommend it to anyone

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.671
who’s interested in coming.

00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:14.690
