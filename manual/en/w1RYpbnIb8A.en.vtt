When I was younger my mom had this crazy where
she thought cutting my lashes would help them

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.360
grow longer. Little did she know her old wive’s
tale didn’t work. I’ve dreamed of having

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.740
these long, luscious, fluttery lashes my whole
life. I’ve tried things like wearing fake

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.660
lashes but those ended up tearing off my lashes
even more. I haven’t gone as far as trying

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.230
those perscription ones because not only are
they expensive, they’re full of chemicals

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.829
that I don’t really feel comfortable using.
So I’ve found a better way using all natural

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.579
ingredients that I can find at my local health
food store!

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.609
I’m going to use a small empty container
like this vial to hold my serum. First I’m

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:53.319
going to fill it ¾ the way up with Castor
Oil. Castor oil contains vitamin E, minerals,

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:59.139
proteins, and antibacterial properties. The
natural fatty acids in castor oil make it

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:04.031
a really good hair conditioner. DId you know
that castor oil is also used to boost the

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:10.100
immune system and cure abdominal issues? One
dose of this will help things move along.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.869
I’m going to fill the rest of my vial up
with the sweet almond oil. The use of sweet

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.710
almond oil to promote hair growth dates all
they back to ancient Egyptian times. It was

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.590
used in combination with castor oil to help
hair grow faster and cure baldness. The main

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.460
benefits of sweet almond oil are that it acts
as sealant and hair protector.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.370
I recommend using sweet almond oil because
it’s widely used for cosmetics but you can

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.039
also use almond oil that’s used for cooking
too. They’re processed differently but both

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.039
still effective.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.840
I’m going to close my vial and give it a
good shake. Mix everything up, then using

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.249
a clean cotton swab, I’m just going to dip
it and then swipe it on my eyelashes. I like

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:58.200
to do this before I go to bed every night
after I wash my face so that it really absorbs

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.790
into my eyelashes. Do this for three weeks
every night and you’ll notice a huge difference.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.100
Your lashes will be thicker and slightly longer
too.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.510
I challenge you to try this three week experiment
