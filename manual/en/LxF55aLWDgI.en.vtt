hey this is kevin's korner and i'm kevin
Tetz host of the  of the Paintucation

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.110
instructional dvd series

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.670
You know a successful paint body and 
restoration project has nothing to do

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.500
with magic

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.970
it has everything to do with hard work and
work that you put in before during

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.259
and after your project and that's why
it's nice to have a partner like the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.999
Eastwood Company that has all the tools
that you're ever gonna need to do all of

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.880
those things

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.410
and what we're gonna be talking about
today is what happens after the paint is

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.230
dry

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.710
more importantly, correcting some of the
defects that happened during the drying

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.190
process all that stuff but falls into
the paint job

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.850
in short, color sanding and buffing

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.400
now this hood has been shot and cleared
quite a while ago it's fully cured so

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.480
it's ready for buffing and there's a
couple of pretty gnarly vestments like this

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.770
one right here this is a typical dirt nib
that falls into the paint

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.270
while it's drying

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.080
you can feel it when you run your finger over
it and quite frankly it looks really bad

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.030
on this black paint job but you don't
have to live with it and there's easy ways

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.500
to fix it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.070
however, there is a process that you need to go
through

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.270
i'd just like doing your body work you want
to do your shaping first this is no

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.029
different

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:17.750
but basically we're shaping it or playing
it or planing it from the top down and these guys

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.320
are a really nice option to have

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.330
in your tool arsenal 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.910
these are run files or nib files

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.340
they come in a couple of different
shapes and grits

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.750
they're fairly course

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.960
this ones got a contoured bottom side

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.320
and this is fine

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.359
this is course

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.499
they have different applications but
they're all great tools to have in their

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:39.470
own right

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.230
the course file is perfect for planing
runs

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.880
a fine tooth file is perfect for
something like the dirt nib we're working

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.090
on

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.340
and one of the convex shapes on the bottom is
perfect for contoured shapes

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.400
if you don't want to take the corners

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.960
now the course file moves a lot of
material very fast not necessarily what

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.540
we need now with our tiny dirt nib

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.070
the contoured guy, well we're dealing
with a flat surface so we're not going to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.170
use him either

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.889
this is perfect for what we're trying to do

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.689
cool thing about it is there's and arrow
here that'll tell you which direction you

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:13.749
need to plane

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:14.949
and it goes against

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.439
the grain of the teeth

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.469
basically what you do

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.049
center center up your dirt nib

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.599
you can hear it

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.599
you can hear it work

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.399
and you can see what's happening you can also
see the gnarly scratches on either side of

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.069
the dirt nib

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.930
but it's leveling it, planing it off

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.930
Right there I can't even feel it but I can still see a bit of a ring around it

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.819
i can't even feel that

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.929
so now we're ready for the next step
which is a little bit of six hundred

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.379
sandpaper

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.949
and before I start sanding I'm going to clean this surface off with a bit of water

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.569
it just gets any grit or any dust that's fallen
into it while you've been working

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.699
getting ground down into this pain

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.629
got six hundred grit wet

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.009
i'm not to use my fingertips i'm not can
use my fingers as an interface pat i'm

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.969
using a soft lock

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.629
wrapping my paper around

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.229
that way i know

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:33.229
that a flat surface recreating what i want to
be

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.869
flat surface. Once I'm satisfied with the six
hundred grip and I know because i'm looking

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.569
i know i don't see any more divots

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.799
I can move up to one thousand

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.769
soft foot

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.919
don't create finger tips as a matter of
fact

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:11.479
here's what i'm talking about

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:16.160
Not good. So we use our interface pad again.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.820
And I keep on going up in stages until i
reached twenty five hundred grit or three

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.639
thousand grit and then I'm ready for
compound and the final buffing

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.240
now this is just one small aspect of
surface repair on a finished paint job

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.840
the painucation color sanding and buffing DVD goes into great detail on 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.580
this and

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.090
many more procedures so do yourself a favor, go to Eastwood.com

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.229
pick up a set a nib files and some
other color sending and buffing supplies

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.789
and get to work. You'll be winning trophies at the car show in no time.
