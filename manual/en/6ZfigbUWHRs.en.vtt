00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.199
We've gotten a new car, a Renault Twingo.

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.969
Nice, and it's even a black one.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.740
This car has stood still for 3 or 4 months. We had trouble getting it here.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.869
The brakes were stuck, we got them loose by hitting them with a hammer.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.869
Now it's here, and im curious if it runs. Let's see.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.680
Like a new one! You wouldn't believe that it stood still for so long.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.680
But it realy stood still for so long and now it just works.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.150
I don't know if any of our viewers knows anything about Renault.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.790
But i don't realy know what kind of engine this is.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.940
I suspect..

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.660
a 1,1 or a 1,0 or something.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.560
No window wiper.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.970
Few dents.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.880
Brakes are stuck.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.630
But aside from that..

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.630
I think it's a good car. Let see if it drives.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.260
ÃŒ must say i've never been enthusiastic about french cars but

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.850
it has power steering, it's all there.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.610
Fancy car.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.440
Electric windows.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.360
That's amazing.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.900
I thought that one would open too,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.290
that's a shame.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.970
O wait!

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.970
This is there to open that window.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.880
o there is a surprise package.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.240
It was a thirsty owner who this belonged to.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.190
See here.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.999
More beer.

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.549
Never been smoked in this car.

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.819
Now i understand why they got rid of it, the ashtray was full.

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.539
The seats are a coral reef.

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.139
Here is a sandwich.

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.989
Look at this thing.

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.150
This is worse than the chicken golf.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.169
But it doesn't smell as bad.

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.300
See the pests in this car.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.279
Not normal.

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.980
Hey let's put it outside.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.799
Let's do that.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.089
So we can paint it.

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:49.029
Nice, ow...

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:02.569
It's closed.

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.259
Yes, nice.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:23.289
It's not new anymore already!

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:26.479
Indeed, flat tire.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.599
After 100 meters two flat tires.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.409
French tires i think.

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:33.599
Crap.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.339
Do not look a given horse under the hood...
- That's not possible because that's been sold.

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:41.939
Our signature on it, nice.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.100
Now the car is realy happy.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.379
Realy happy.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:02.449
With new alloy wheels man!

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:06.929
O no! That's not that guy of the Ford KA!

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:10.579
Who is that?

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.769
My buddy, my friend.
-Sheba.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.389
I didn't know Koen could drive in a Twingo.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.959
Well have to see if he can.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.959
Yes, that's true.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.849
Did you hear that, screeching tires on the dirt.

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:38.820
A TEAM!

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.909
First test is a sucses.

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.300
Nice

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.300
Sheba want's out.

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.139
NO!

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.840
Sheba! Sheba!

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.610
My friend.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.770
You lost your copilot.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.650
The KA felt better.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.160
But it has power steering, an electric one.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.860
Hey, dude..

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.770
Electric windows front and back.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.389
Not in back.
