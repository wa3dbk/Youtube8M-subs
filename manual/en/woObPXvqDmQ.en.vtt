00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.620
Much of your study time will be
devoted to rehearsal and repetition

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.670
of the information and skills
that you need to remember.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.500
In this video I intend providing you with
some suggestions as to how to do this well.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.850
G'day, and welcome to
Crystal Clear Mathematics

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.260
where it IS easier than you think!
I'm your host, Graeme Henderson.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.420
Broadly speaking, there are two kinds
of things stored in long term memory -

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.230
facts and skills.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.350
Facts are stored in what
researchers describe as declarative memory

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.530
and they require conscious processing
in the frontal lobe of the brain.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.600
Once facts (the what and the why)
have been introduced to your long term memory,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.540
they are retained best if you can engage in
what is called 'elaborative rehearsal' of them.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.440
This means that each time you think
of these things,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.180
you try to make more connections between them
and other things that you already know.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.590
You do this by doing extra reading,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.880
solving extra problems,
discussing them with other people

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.380
and being creative and analytical
in the way that you think about the facts.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.140
For example, if you wish to remember
Pythagoras' Theorem better,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.370
you could find a book or two in the local
library that had something to say about it,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.250
or go searching the Internet
for something interesting,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.610
or find a different textbook
or past exam papers

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.210
or a puzzle book
with different kinds of questions in it,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.890
or chat with your teacher or tutor about other
ways of understanding or using the theorem,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.200
or you could use it
to do something interesting

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.840
like erect a bridge over a creek
or build a tower or some such thing.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.150
Be creative but safe and have fun.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.609
This, by the way,
is where 'nerds' get up to mischief.

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.920
You should be trying to develop new ways
of looking at the same information

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.209
and new ways of analyzing
the same situations.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.120
I actually like reading history and finding out
how mathematics was used throughout history.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.569
This helps me learn about its connection
with art and hygiene and food

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.569
and discovery and explosives and medicine
and so on - I think you get the idea.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.260
If you've found some interesting insights
about any mathematical topic,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.650
feel free to share them
on our FaceBook page

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.980
or in the comments section
below this video.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.469
Suggestions are always welcome!

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.319
The second part of the puzzle
is how to deal with skills.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.849
Now, skills are stored in what
researchers call procedural memory.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.159
This is where you remember how to do
things that require a set of automatic steps.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.459
These include motor skills like walking,
kicking balls, or swimming,

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.760
or gymnastics, et cetera.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.180
When you see Olympic divers dive
from the ten metre tower,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.510
they're using procedural memory.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.700
They practise each skill
until it can be done efficiently

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.840
and almost without conscious thought.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.319
Some researchers describe this

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.790
as moving skills from being reflective
(that is, requiring thought)

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.859
to reflexive
(that is, NOT requiring conscious thought).

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.590
All skills are perfected by rote rehearsal.
That means lots of practice.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.590
A large part of all mathematical skills
should be stored in procedural memory,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.999
in other words,
you need to practise them

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:55.180
until you can do them accurately
and efficiently and speedily.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.549
Believe it or not, for a good mathematician,
there is very little conscious effort

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.909
in solving a relatively complex
linear equation involving fractions,

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.609
because the skill has been practiced
and practised and refined.

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.989
The key here is the same one that will apply
to any skill that you want to master -

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.199
it's not simply practice
that makes perfect,

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.590
all that practice really does
is make things permanent!

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.789
The more accurate saying is that
PERFECT practice makes things perfect.

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:34.789
And so said Vince Lombardi,
a very famous United States football coach!

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:39.160
In other words, whenever and wherever
and whatever you're practising,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.629
try to do it properly and well
without taking shortcuts

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.770
or being sloppy about it.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.470
In mathematics, this means

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.910
practicing setting your work out
properly each time.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.360
Here are some rather practical suggestions
about how to practice

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.840
and rehearse your skills well.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.800
First of all, learn what is perfect first
and practise that.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.990
Avoid practicing things
you don't fully understand.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.560
All you're likely to do is succeed
in making bad habits permanent

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.699
and then they're very hard to change.

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.340
You should therefore listen
very carefully in class

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.409
and learn to set your work out clearly
and in distinct steps (or procedures).

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:28.240
In other words,
learn things properly in the first place.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.680
Correcting bad habits is difficult
and it's demoralising.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.650
Secondly, learn from an expert
rather than on your own,

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.919
unless you're very good at mathematics.

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.699
This is why I don't agree with
students' learning their own method

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.740
for solving arithmetic problems
until they've been taught first

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.020
to master a useful algorithm.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.849
They're then free to explore
all kinds of other options.

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.030
Unfortunately, many students
learn bad habits without guidance.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.169
It is a bit like asking someone
to learn to snow ski

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.180
by going up the chair lift
for the very first time

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.949
and 'working it out'
on the way down the slope.

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.400
It is much, much better
to receive instruction

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.949
and to learn your good habits early.

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.520
The third thing is to remember that

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.310
you need to understand
(that is, have sense and meaning)

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.270
and be motivated
(that is, have value and relevance)

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.629
in order to learn well.

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.539
And, if you truly understand your work

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:35.360
you should be able to analyse new situations
to see how to apply your current knowledge

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.710
and should be able to analyse your work
to see where you could improve upon it.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.879
I hope these suggestions help you become
more aware of how you learn

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.960
and help you plan your study accordingly.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.240
If you would like to read more about
how to learn mathematics let me recommend

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.710
"How the Brain Learns Mathematics"
by David Sousa.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.949
You might ask your school librarian
to obtain a copy for the library -

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:06.699
purchase it from Amazon
or The Book Depository for example.

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.069
The beginning of the book discusses

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:12.050
the results of recent research
into how the brain learns mathematics.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.960
And the remainder of the book discusses
how teachers can use this information

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.210
to better prepare lessons and to help students
of different ages learn better.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.810
We have now concluded
our three discussions about memory.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:33.240
In my next video I will share about
six attitudes worth cultivating

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.509
in order to improve
the effectiveness of your study time.

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:41.879
This is Graeme Henderson encouraging you
to become familiar with your memory

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:45.909
and encouraging you to learn how to learn.

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:48.889
