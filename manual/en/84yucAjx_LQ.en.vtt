00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.110
Robo Techâ€™s GM Passlock Bypass

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:31.930
Robo Tech was called to a 2002 Pontiac Grand
Am, with a 3.8 liter engine. The tech said

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.620
that as he was driving, the&nbsp;"SECURITY"&nbsp;light
came on. There did not seem to be any effect

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.720
on driving. After the road test, he re-started
the car without any problems, and the security

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.339
light was not on. Later on, he started the
car again, it ran for a couple of seconds,

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.500
and then stopped, with the SECURITY light
flashing. The car then would not re-start

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.629
anymore, and the SECURITY light remained on.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.260
The information database said regarding the
security Passlock, after attempting to re-start

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.190
the engine, if the SECURITY light flashes
or stays on, wait ten minutes with the key

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.979
in ON until the light goes off. Then, turn
the ignition to the OFF position before attempting

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.350
to start the engine again.
This information worked, and the vehicle started.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.380
Unfortunately, a few weeks later, the tech
said he had to go through the same procedure

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.979
to get the customer's car started. At this
time, the customer said he wanted the Passlock

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.840
bypassed, and not repaired.
Well, I am Robo Tech and don't really get

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.579
involved with Jerry rigging automobiles. It
is beneath my intellect! So, I decided to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.460
call in my cousin, Roby Martin, an expert
at nothing, axcept cutting wires.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.570
Hello, I am Roby Martin. Follow me on this
one, as we perform a high class GM Passlock

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.240
bypass.
It turns out that, the most common culprit

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.439
for Passlock faults is a Security module in
the ignition switch, but there are several

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.990
other possible causes for this Passlock problem.
Anything which causes the apparent resistance

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.640
in the circuit to change by a significant
amount will trigger the security system, and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.780
cause the car not to start. This means that
before cutting any wires, you should make

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.010
sure that something much simpler is not the
answer.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.720
Once I determined without a doubt, that the
problem with the system was a faulty Passlock

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.170
module in the ignition cylinder, I decided
to then bypass the system using a pubic hair,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.299
oh no, I meant the resistor method. This would
make the system behave as though there were

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.540
no problems at all.
The Passlock Security System is quite simple.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.000
When the Body Control Module is programmed,
it measures and stores the value of the signal,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.110
on the Yellow Wire on pin 6, of the center
connector, using the black wire as a reference.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.730
From then on, each time the car is started,
the Body Control Module checks to see if the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.710
signal on the yellow wire, matches the stored
value. If a key is not inserted into the ignition

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.519
switch, and the lock cylinder is not rotated
to the on position, the value of the signal

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.629
will be incorrect. The Body Control Module
will then send a signal to the Engine Control

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.269
Module, telling it to shut down the fuel injectors.
The resistor is embedded in the Passcode module,

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.650
which is part of the ignition switch cylinder.
Any key that will allow the cylinder to be

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.580
turned to the on position will work, and the
only condition that must be met, is that the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.970
cylinder must be turned to a position where
a magnet engages a hall-effect switch, which

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.250
connects the embedded resistor to the system,
allowing the Body Control Module to read the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.290
signal value on the yellow wire and determine
if it is correct.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.579
You can avoid paying 300 to 500 dollars to
change the lock cylinder, by performing a

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.630
simple modification on your vehicle. But before
you start, you should make sure that your

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.060
vehicle is one that uses this system. The
information database should read, after attempting

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.530
to start the engine, if the SECURITY light
flashes or stays on, wait ten minutes with

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.810
the ignition key in ON, until the light goes
off. That phrase is the key to knowing that

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.720
your system can be modified in this manner.
I knew that this procedure worked on this

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.661
car, so I then proceeded with the modification.
I started by disconnectin the battery, then

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:28.630
disconnected the Grey center connector from
the Body Control Module, and pulled it down

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.860
so as to access the wires that go to the ignition
cylinder. Pin A6 of the connector will be

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.220
a yellow wire, and pin B6, which is directly
opposite, will be a black wire. These are

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.290
the two wires I was going to work with. Here
you can see these two wires issolated.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.260
I then stripped the insulation off about half
inch on the black wire, leaving it bare so

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.330
I could solder to it. Then, I cut the yellow
wire about 4 incjes from the connector, and

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.330
stripped about an inch of insulation off the
end of the wire, which goes to the connector.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.690
I also taped up the other wire end, bent it
back, and push it back into the bundle out

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.080
of the way.
I then slid a 2 and a half inch piece of shrink

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.050
tubing over the yellow wire, so that I could
later use it to cover the resistor I was about

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.850
to solder into the circuit.
I took a 2.8 Kilo Ohm one quarter watt resistor,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.220
and wraped one end of it around the stripped
part of the black wire several times so as

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.670
to have a good contact and then soldered the
joint. I arbitrarily chose to use a 2.8 Kilo

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.170
Ohm resistor. We will later be programming
the Body Control Module to recognize the resistor

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:44.740
we chose, so it doesn't matter what size you
use. It can be anything from 470 ohms to 11800

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.100
ohms. I then wraped the stripped end of the
yellow wire from the connector, around the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.440
other lead of the resistor, and solder it
in place.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.210
I also slid the shrink tubing up so as to
cover the resistor, and applied some heat

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.900
then black electrical tape to insulate the
bare part of the black wire where I soldered

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.530
the resistor to it.
After taping the resistor I plugged the grey

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.340
connector back into the Body Control Module
and re-connected the battery negative terminal.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.281
Then when I tried to start the car, it started
and then stop after a second or two, with

00:06:17.281 --> 00:06:22.870
the Security light on. That's OK, because
now I had to re-calibrate the Body Control

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.300
Module to the 2.8 Kilo ohm resistor.
I did that by turning the Ignition key to

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.810
the off position, then turn it to the on position.
The security light came on, so I waited about

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.060
10 minutes with the key in ON until the light
went off. Then, turn the ignition to OFF before

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.780
attempting to start the engine again. At that
time, the Body Control Module would have memorized

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.580
the new value for your resistor, and the engine
started.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.750
This bypass procedure went well and the customer
forgot about the Passlock problems forever.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.880
By the way, to get better access to the wiring
on the car, I also removed the Glove box.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.080
This was quite easy, just two screws at the
top edge, and one on each side hold it in

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.550
place. But, make sure to carefully disconnect
the glove box light, and re-connect it when

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.650
re-installing.
This case study shows that Robo Tech is not

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:38.720
the only smart dude on the block. Roby Martin
can also solved automotive issues.
