00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.810
TOM: Did that convict stay
over here last night?

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.110
JIMBO: Yeah.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.520
LEON: What are you
still doing here?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.020
DINO: Said I could say 'til
things cool down.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.270
They haven't.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.550
LEON: That was pretty cool.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.060
I got great news.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.890
I'm going to ask Dino
to move in.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.320
TOM: Oh wow, that's great.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.950
Maybe you should ask the rest
of the Manson family too.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.720
LEON: He is full of useful
information.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.195
You know, he said in the clink,
he could trade my candy

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:27.502
ass for a pack of Newports.

00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:30.420
Look, later we're going to do
homemade tattoos out back, if

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.944
you guys want to get
down with that.

00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:32.950
TOM: Oh, yeah, sure.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.495
I want a tribal one.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:35.680
JIMBO: It's gonna be
harder to get that

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.170
J-O-B. SUZY: Oh!

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.150
Speaking of jobs, I wanted to
send your resumes out, guys,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.610
so is there anything
you're good at?

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.150
Are you good at anything?

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.300
Anything at all?

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.670
TOM: Oh.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.250
You know what?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.050
Look for a circus performer
for me.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.370
You know what?

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.820
I am really good at juggling.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.320
SUZY: Good.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.010
Yeah.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.740
OK.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.150
I'll keep my eyes open
for circus performer.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.112
Leon, what about you?

00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:02.760
LEON: Mmm, I'm gonna
stick mainly to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.970
manual labor, I think.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.450
I work well with my hands.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.450
SUZY: OK, cool.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.610
On your resume, though,
it says you're

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.508
a philosophy major.

00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:09.982
LEON: Mm-hm.

00:01:09.982 --> 00:01:10.930
OK.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.950
Well, if you see any openings
for a philosopher, you can

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.880
submit me for that too.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.694
SUZY: Cool.

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:15.510
OK.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.900
And Jimbo.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.400
JIMBO: Mm?

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.260
SUZY: What can we do to get
you some job placement?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.560
JIMBO: Oh, I'm good.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.930
SUZY: But I'm here to help.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050
JIMBO: I have an interview,
so I'm set.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.110
SUZY: What-- what day?

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.960
JIMBO: Today.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.730
SUZY: Well, what time.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.360
JIMBO: Sometime between The
Price is Right and Maury.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.750
SUZY: Shoot, you better hurry.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.910
Are you gonna-- you gotta
shave that beard.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.490
JIMBO: This beard?

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.752
No way, ho.

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:35.584
SUZY: Se?

00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:36.000
JIMBO: No.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.921
Just ho.

00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:38.800
SUZY: Um, OK.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.520
But you can't go in there
looking like that.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.490
I mean, you gotta do something.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.860
JIMBO: Oh.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.300
Obviously.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.450
I'm not crazy.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.110
I'm just going to paint
it to match my face.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.710
SUZY: Oh, wow.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.300
Never thought of that.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.830
JIMBO: Not many people have.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.750
[BUZZING]

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.690
LEON: So do you think the spider
tattoo on the neck is

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.660
the right statement to make?
'Cause I"m thinking, if I got

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.120
one of the American Apparel
deep V's, the sloping

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.560
neckline, it would
actually look--

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.090
DINO: Yeah, no, I'll tell you.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.840
A neck tattoo, it represents a
guy that has done real time.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.300
It says you've made it through
the system and you are not to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.450
be fucked with, so.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.390
LEON: Yeah.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.810
That's me.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.682
DINO: Yep.

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:17.150
LEON: How about-- how about
this teardrop tattoo?

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.800
That's pretty cute.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.645
I could do one of
those, maybe.

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:20.895
DINO: Oh, you mean
one of these?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.182
You gotta stab someone to death
to get one of these.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:30.420
LEON: Oh, that's no problem.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.313
I've been wanting to stab
Jimbo all week.

00:02:33.313 --> 00:02:36.080
TOM: (EXAGGERATED BABY TALK)
You're such a good boy You're

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.230
such a star.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.260
You're a star!

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.510
You're a star.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.030
We're all a family, OK?

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.030
We are all--

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.450
Rowdy!

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.290
Rowdy, go away, OK?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.860
You're ruining our rehearsals.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.930
NEIGHBOR: Why don't you
give me that old dog?

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.680
We can go out in the woods
and die together.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.850
TOM: All right.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.330
Enough with the depressing
talk.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.450
Look, you're depressing
my dog here.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.510
He just passed out and died.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.470
JIMBO: Ta-dah!

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.470
How do I look?

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.715
TOM: You look like an idiot.

00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:10.220
NEIGHBOR: He looks like
a colored girl

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.690
with a blonde pussy.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:29.408
