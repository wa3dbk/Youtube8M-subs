00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.780
Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.780
Scott Lewis here for Wirefly.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.570
Today Iím here to bring you a cell phone
schmackdown between the brand new Windows

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.450
Phone 8 operating system and the Android operating
system 4.1.1, better known as Jelly Bean.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.820
On todayís schmackdown weíre going to be
comparing the operating system, not the phones,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.641
but just so you know what phones we have,
we have the Galaxy Nexus for Sprint and the

00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:23.590
Nokia Lumia 822 for Verizon.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.610
Letís go ahead and jump into Round One.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.880
Round One is going to be about customization
of the Android and Windows Phones 8 operating

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.880
systems.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.520
I picked customization to be the first round
because itís very important to a lot of smartphone

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.999
users right now, and itís the main reason
that most people chose their Android device

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.780
in the first place, and some new features
of the new Windows Phone 8 operating system

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.890
have really focused on that.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.030
As you can see on our Windows phone we have
small, medium and large size tiles.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.710
This is something that you can customize,
so if you want to choose and make your calendar

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.920
smaller, simply press and hold and youíll
get the unpin and adjustment arrows.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.819
Weíll go ahead and hit the adjustment arrow.

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:58.769
Itís going to make it the medium sized tile.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.390
We hit it again and itís going to make it
the small size tile.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.499
Or we can go back to the large size tile.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.670
If you wanted to change a different one you
would just tap on that particular one and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.890
once again you can change it from the different
sizes.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.799
With the Windows Phone 8 operating system
you also have live tiles which are similar

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.150
to widgets on you Android device.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.770
You can see my People hub right here, or my
weather tile as well as photos will constantly

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.770
rotate and update.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.439
It makes it easy to keep in touch with some
of your information.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.250
Like I said, itís very similar to a widget
on your Android phone.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.070
With your Android phone you do have choices
as far as the size of your widgets as well.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.260
Right here we have a Google+ widget, and if
we press and hold youíll see that it comes

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.120
up with our little dots that we can make it
small, medium or large.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.119
Thatís our large, thatís our medium, and
that would be our small size widget.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.159
Another part of customization would just be
your normal customization.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.570
You have the wall paper and then the background,
the white background on Windows Phone 8 is

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.859
something that you can change from white to
black if you like a darker background than

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:57.859
the white.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.439
You can also change the color of the tiles
on the Windows Phone 8.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.040
Android phones have all kinds of different
wallpapers.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.039
You can use anything from your regular picture
gallery.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.229
They have preset wallpapers, and even live
wallpapers, wallpapers that move.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.870
The live wallpapers take up a little bit more
battery life, but if you like, once again,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.030
to customize your phone you can download additional
ones from the Google Play Store.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.400
One of the other basic features that you can
customize is the ringtone or alert tone.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.170
Both phones will come with a selection of
ringtones and alert tones.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.120
You can always download additional from the
Google Play Store, or the App Marketplace.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.730
That wraps up our customization round.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.390
One thing I wanted to touch on, real quick,
though is there is the ability to route both

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.959
of these phones to remove some of the limitations
that the manufacturer puts on the software.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.010
Thatís not something I recommend for the
average smartphone user, but if youíre looking

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.810
to increase performance or do any kind of
custom ROMs, both phones will be able to do

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.810
that.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.290
With that being said, the Round One winner
is going to be Android.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.170
Round One really boils down to the difference
between widgets and live tiles, and which

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.230
one you like better.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.830
I like the selection of widgets that are available
a little bit better than the options for live

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.330
tiles, and itís a little easier to search
for them, versus trying to search for live

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.400
tiles.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400
That wraps up Round One.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.340
Letís go ahead and move into Round Two.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.569
Round Two is going to be about navigation
of the two operating systems.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.311
Most people are familiar with the Android
operating system which uses pages that you

00:03:08.311 --> 00:03:09.560
can scroll through.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.330
You can lay down the different widgets and
applications as you scroll through.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.159
With the Windows operating system is an up
and down scroll.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.580
You scroll right through the different applications.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.980
To get to your list of applications for the
Windows phone youíre going to slide over,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.040
and this is going to be every application
thatís on the phone.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.220
With the Android operating system weíll hit
the center button here.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.340
Thatís going to take us to our App tray,
and weíre going to scroll through the different

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.319
pages of applications.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.209
My preference is on the page style notification
verses the list, so the up and down you just

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.439
keep scrolling through.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.349
I like the page view better.

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.410
When navigating and trying to find out information
on your phone, I think the Android operating

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.879
system has a big benefit over the Windows.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.939
It has the notification center that you can
pull down.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.790
It will display things like unread emails,
text messages and other alerts.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.620
Windows Phone 8 does not have a notification
center.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.540
It was something they were talking about in
the original development, but for one reason

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.270
or another it didnít make it onto the final
version of the operating system.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.840
You never know if that might make it into
a future update for the Windows operating

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.840
system.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.269
If thatís an important feature for you, make
sure to keep an eye on the Windows Phone 8

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.269
website.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.990
Thereís one feature that did make it into
the Windows Phone 8 operating system that

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.199
I really like.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.260
I have two small children and very often Iíll
hand them my phone to make sure that theyíre

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.030
entertained if weíre in line someplace or
if weíre on a long car trip.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.180
The Windows Phone 8 operating system has something
called Kids Corner.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.340
Youíre going to swipe across, and then youíll
swipe up.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.490
Essentially itís adding a second user profile
to the phone.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.570
You can see we have some music on there, some
different games that you let them access.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.520
The benefit to the Kids Corner is that they
only have access to the applications that

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.530
you select.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.360
The benefit is they wonít accidentally send
a crazy text message to a coworker, or accidentally

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360
call your boss.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.039
I think the Kids Corner is a very nice feature.

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.900
To get out of it youíre just going to hit
the Lock button again to make it go to sleep.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.350
Youíll wake it back up and youíll slide
to open.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.600
Then by entering your password you have the
full operating system available to you.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.610
This is going to go ahead and wrap up Round
Two, the navigation round.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.419
For me this roundís a draw, because thereís
some different features that are available

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.581
on both phones that you really need to decide
which one is right for you.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:19.800
Do you think you would benefit most from the
Notification Center, or the Kids Corner option

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.370
on the Windows Phone 8.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.620
The other thing you need to think about is
do you like a side to side swipe view with

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.960
different pages for different applications,
or do you want them all on one list that you

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.250
can scroll right through?

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.069
With Round Two a draw, Round Three is going
to be very important.

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.310
With Round Three weíre going to cover applications
for the Windows Phone and Android phone.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.590
Thereís a big difference between the amount
of applications that are available for Windows

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.830
Phone and Android phones.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.900
The Google Play store has more than 600,000
applications available, where the Windows

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.630
Phone store has a little under 150,000 applications
available.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.810
Both phones have a similar search experience,
and they also display the search results in

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.810
a very similar way.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.199
Youíll see itís in a list view with some
ratings as well price, if thereís a price.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.010
The benefit you get with the Windows Phone
is that it has a try option.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.550
If you go into Angry Birds here, which costs
$0.99, you can actually try it before you

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.550
buy it.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.870
I think thatís a very nice option.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.449
You can try out a game or an application to
see if it actually works and does what it

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.139
says itís supposed to do.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.870
Another benefit that the Windows phone has
over the Android phone is that it has Microsoft

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.870
Office integration.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.060
You can actually open Microsoft Office here,
pull up files and edit them right on the phone.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.560
There are applications that will do that for
you in Android, and you can download the viewer

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.639
for free, but it will cost you around $15.00
to get an application that will allow you

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.479
to edit those files.

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.229
Another application that the Windows phone
has integrated into it, it has XBox integration,

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.470
so you can actually pull up you games.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:45.900
It will have you Avatar and you can actually
play versions of games that are specifically

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.639
made for your Windows phone that sometimes
have special boards or features that arenít

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.849
in the original game.

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:55.410
With that being said, because of the big discrepancy
in applications, sometimes you donít get

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.160
the applications that you want with a Windows
phone.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.250
An example of that would be right now, as
of this video, thereís not a Pinterest application

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.590
available for Windows Phone 8.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.600
Youíll have some third party applications
available, but nothing officially from Pinterest.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.979
That wraps up Round Three.

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.500
While I think the Office integration and the
try out option are great benefits to the Windows

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.040
phone operating system, the sheer amount of
applications that you can get with your Android

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.960
phone, and the fact that you get all the high
profile applications gives the benefit, or

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.660
the round, to the Android phone.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.889
Our Round Three winner is the Android phone.

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.150
That means our overall schmackdown winner
today is going to be the Android phone.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.830
I think the Windows Phone 8 operating system
is a very good operating system.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.070
It might be a good intermediate step between
an iPhone to an Android phone.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.650
Itís very intuitive and very easy to use,
and it might lend itself to a first time smartphone

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.860
user a little bit better than an Android phone.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.430
That wraps up our schmackdown today.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.449
One thing to keep in mind, though, is if youíre
looking for a Windows phone or an Android

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:49.320
phone make sure to check out Wirefly.com.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.849
We have a great selection on both operating
systems, at great prices.

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:55.930
Like always, make sure to leave your comments
on our Wirefly YouTube channel, and if you

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.500
liked the video make sure to give it a thumbs
up.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.099
My nameís Scott Lewis for Wirefly.

00:07:59.099 --> 00:07:59.849
Thanks for watching.
