ay ho (wtf??) today i'll be reviewing an iphone
application that i'm obsessed with this week

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.339
it's called "myfacewhen". it's an application
on how to make gifs or gifs whatever you call

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.190
it.
if you are a technology noob like me and you

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.650
don't know how to make gifs (i'm just gonna
call it gifs)

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.440
to post on tumblr or whatever on your website.
it's very easy. it has two options. you can

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.440
either create it or discover. right now i
have,.. for this one, someone asked me today

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.210
"do you want to go to gym today" and i'm like
"no no no no".

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.730
um u can message it to people, you can tweet
about it, you can email it. of course you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.649
can delete it if you don't want it anymore.
but the thing is.. um

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.920
and you can easily create yours. just click
create. um

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.920
and then you can use your camera to record.
right now i can record. stop.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.990
create a video, yes
and then save it. and then i can message it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.700
to someone, email it or tweet it obviously.
the thing is it's not free. it's a dollar.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.490
99 cents but a dollar
umm you can't facebook it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.490
when u message it to someone , it kinds saves
it to your iphone.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.810
when you get to your iphone gallery, you can
choose the option to facebook it or tweet

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.090
it again, right?
but it doesn't work. facebook doesn't support

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.380
this
so yeah. if you wanna joke around with your

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.380
friend or tweet.
if you think it's worth 99 cents, go ahead.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.450
but this is the current application that i'm
obsessed it with.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.880
so i'll be doing an iphone application review
video every week so if you like it, please
