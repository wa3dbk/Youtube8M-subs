00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.269
All right, so now I've got my colors selected.
And I cheated a little bit just because I

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.160
wasn't too concerned about which colors I
used in this particular project because I

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.059
am just showing you. So, I chose things that
I had scraps for. That is the nice thing about

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.850
stained glass is that if you are careful you
can preserve a lot of scraps from prior projects

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.510
and use them in the future. So, I looked through
my box of pieces and instead of using these

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.770
nice big pieces I showed you earlier that
are untouched, maybe I will save those for

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.701
a future project that is a little more planned
out. And for this demonstration I'm just going

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:39.150
to see what cool scraps I had. So, I had a
nice pretty piece of blue, I don't know if

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.250
you can see that but it is a nice sort of
a, I don't know if it is a true cobalt blue.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.950
So, this is a piece of cathedral glass, has
some texture to it. I had a little scrap of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.079
this kind of swirly green and white, very
heavily textured cathedral glass also. It

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.320
is kind of opalescent, some opalescent in
there as well. Some just clear cathedral glass,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.270
it's a little bit dirty, I'm going to have
to clean that for sure. But, it also has some

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.700
texture and some swirl to it. And then, this
is a pretty big piece but as you can see I

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.280
have already used it for another project where
I was cutting some fancy curves. It is possible

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.069
to cut curves. This is also a piece of cathedral
glass with some texture to it. So, I am going

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:27.299
to use these four colors. My yellow, my clear,
my swirly kind of green, and my kind of cobalt

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.460
blue. And then remember I said I made this
design so I could use one of these melted

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.789
marbles in the middle. I am going to use this
little red glass melted marble in the center

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.649
to give a nice little red focal point there.
So what I have done now, remember I have already

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.389
numbered the pieces of my puzzle. And what
I have done, you can't read it from there

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:52.380
obviously, but right here I have kind of written
my plan. Which says that pieces one, twelve,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.289
thirteen and fourteen, these kind of roundish
ones, I'm going to use this scrap for it.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.139
Another way I sort of cheated is that this
scrap happened to already have a nice little

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:07.249
curve to it, and because curves are a little
bit more difficult to cut I thought, oh well

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.939
maybe I can cut one of these pieces out of
that and already have my curve there. That

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.780
is one of the neat things about stained glass,
you can be thinking about the most economical

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.830
way to use pieces and sometimes you can find
a use for a scrap you've got. So anyway, I've

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.680
got my plan. I'm going to do these kind of
rounded pieces in the swirly green. I am going

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.329
to do pieces four, five, eleven and twelve
in kind of this clear cathedral glass. I'm

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.150
going to do seven, eight, nine and ten, these
four in here, in the yellow. And then I will

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.130
do these rectangles, these three and six in
the blue. So I have that plan all written

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.040
out. The next thing I am going to do is cut
my pattern.
