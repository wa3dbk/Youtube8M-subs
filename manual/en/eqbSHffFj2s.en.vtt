00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.580
My name is Christine Marquette and I'm a registered
dietitian with the Austin Regional Clinic.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.200
And I'm going to talk to you about how to
determine your percentage of body fat. There

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.679
are actually several different methods to
do this. What used to be thought of as the

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.450
gold standard was underwater weighing. However
this is a very difficult way to actually measure

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.290
your body fat. Typically what has been done
is the person is submerged in a tank of water.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.000
They have to blow out all of their air. As
much air as they possibly can. And their weight

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.950
was taken before they were submerged and their
weight is taken as they're in there. A calculation

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.090
is done to actually determine their percentage
of body fat. Another method that's a lot more

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.810
common is to use skin calipers. This can be
fairly accurate if you have a good handler.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.370
If the person is very well versed in actually
pulling the skin at the proper amount using

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.580
the caliper to measure how much the indentation
is various parts of your body. Usually they

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.641
will measure your back, the back of your arm
at your triceps, also the back of your calf.

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:07.810
They may do some in the front, your lower
abdominal area. Again, they'll do a calculation

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.580
that takes into account your age and your
weight as well as your gender. That's the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.290
most common method. Another method is by electrical
impedance. And this is a method that people

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.140
can actually do themselves at home. There
are a lot of scales that you can buy on the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.960
market these days that have basically metal
pads on the scale. You step on it barefooted

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.030
and in addition to giving you your body weight,
it will also tell you your percentage body

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.549
fat. This isn't a very accurate method. Particularly
on the home units. Another newer version is

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.630
called Dexa. This is a dual electron method.
And it's basically doing a scan of your entire

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.770
body. And it looks like this is going to become
the new gold standard. You actually get a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.880
view of your entire body. You can see your
skeletal system, you can see the actually

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.920
muscle mass and then you can see the lighter
parts that are the fat mass. So again, this

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.130
is actually becoming the new gold standard.
The most accurate way of determining your

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.540
body fat. There's a couple of estimations
that you could also use on line. Something

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.770
called the Navy Circumference Method. This
is using a tape measure. You measure in men

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.290
their abdomen, in women it's their waist and
hips. Both genders also measure their neck.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.510
And you enter it into their actual website.
You also put in your age and then the website

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.709
actually gives you an approximation of your
body fat. And then another website does a

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.790
similar thing. However, besides using your
waist and hips they also use your calf and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.989
they do not use your neck. Again, those are
approximations just based on your weight,

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.900
your gender, your age and tape measurements.
But a few different methods for determining

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.060
your body fat.
