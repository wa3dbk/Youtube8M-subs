Hello and welcome back. The American novelist, Jodi Picoult, has sold millions of books all over the world, gripping readers with ethical dilemmas and human drama.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Her latest novel is another thought provoker; centred around the Holocaust, it explores the issues of forgiveness, justice, and revenge.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.538
Jodi's with us now

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:23.000
Jodi, those are three pretty big topics, aren't they?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Jodi: Yes

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:27.084
Do you want to set it out for us? 

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:43.406
Jodi: Yeah, I would be happy to. So 'The Storyteller' is really the story of Sage Singer. She's a 23-year old baker in a small New England town and she's a bit of a recluse; she has a scar on her face, she doesn't get along with people and she's attending a grief group because her mother recently passed away.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.000
Jodi: There she meets an unlikely friend, 95-year-old Josef Weber, who is everyone's favourite adoptive grandpa, retired teacher ... a good guy in the town.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:01:02.417
She's never met him before and he asks her for a favour. He would like her to help him die - not because he's ill, but quite the contrary. He thinks he's lived this long is a punishment because he used to be a Nazi and he thinks he deserves to die.

00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:13.621
The question is, since Sage's grandmother is a Holocaust survivor, if she chooses to help him, is it mercy, forgiveness, revenge, justice?

00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:15.007
BBC Host: What a question!

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:21.742
BBC Host: It is an extraordinary story because you go through the points of views of various different characters, including Sage's grandmother

00:01:21.742 --> 00:01:22.242
Jodi: Yes

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.560
BBC Host: It's quite horrific, some of the details, isn't it? Did you speak with lots of survivors?

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:47.583
Jodi: I did. I did research with multiple Holocaust survivors, and of course, hearing them tell their stories and crying with them, and reliving them, was extremely emotional and difficult. There was a man named Bernie whose father was shot to death in front of him.

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:52.514
And his mother promised him that when it was his turn to go, he'd be shot through the heart and not the head, so he wouldn't see any brains.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:09.620
There's a woman named Gerda, who survived a forced 350 mile march, she says because she was wearing ski boots in June when she was taken from her house and she made it through a winter trekking all that way. She was one of 150 women who survived, 4000 began.

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:18.812
There was Mania, who studied German in school and became fluent, wound up having that save her life multiple times during the war because she was in secretarial positions
