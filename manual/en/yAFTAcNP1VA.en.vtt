00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.190
What's going on?

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.020
What's going on guys? I'm Scott from Scotthermanfitness.com

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.319
and today I have a special treat for you we're here at Answer is Fitness gym.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.320
Now Answer is Fitness is my home away from home,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.469
and unfortunately I haven't been here for a while since I've been in New York.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.139
But I'm back at home. I'm in my gym

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.390
And I'll walk you guys through my back workout today, so come tag along, and I'll show you how I do my thing.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.519
All right, so each machine I'm going to do I'm going to do three sets of six to eight repetitions.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.380
First we're going to start over here with the lat pull down

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.320
Now I'm gonna drop it and do a burn set

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.040
You want to do the burn set right after the heavy set

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.080
All right, so now here we are at] the reverse lat pull down,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.140
we'll do the same thing, three sets of six to eight repetitions

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.049
followed by a burn set, now for anything like me, and you weigh less than what you're pulling down

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.029
I have a little trick to help with that, so first start off get nice tight grip

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.840
Now a good reason why to have a spotter when you're working out is, where I only got seven on that

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.929
I could have forced out one more repetition if I had someone to just give me a little bit of help on that eighth

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.100
As long as you push as hard as you can whether you have a spotter or not you will gain strength.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.760
Now let's go to the next one. All right next we're going to do a lower row

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.040
and do three sets of six to eight repetitions.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.169
Now I want you to pay attention because the way to do this exercise is you need to sit up the whole time

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.919
but I don't like to waste energy, so what you're going to do

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.610
most people will start off like this, and then pull get the shoulders back and lined up

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.109
and then do the exercise, I don't do it like that, it's a waste of time.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.550
I like to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.550
set my weight

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.070
stand up here

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.410
then come right down to my butt

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.139
Down, my feet down straighten my core

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.520
and that's how you give a low row.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.509
All right next we're going to do some deadlifts, same thing six to eight repetitions

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.020
now make sure you pay attention to my lower back because it's very important that

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.399
you maintain an arch back while going down and up.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.459
Okay, let's get started, hands shoulder length apart

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.220
back arched, knees bent.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.890
The only guy who smiles when he works out. All right guys

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.309
I'm going to wrap the back workout up with some lat push downs, again

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.890
six to eight repetitions

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.740
Now make sure you maintain an arched back slight bend in your elbows

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.890
keep your wrist straight head up, and then come down like this

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.860
bring the bar right down to your thighs

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.980
and keep everything flexed.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.089
Awesome! So remember, three sets six to eight repetitions

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.559
