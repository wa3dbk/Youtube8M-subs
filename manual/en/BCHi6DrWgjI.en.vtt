No, I can't.
Yes, you can.

00:00:05.345 --> 00:00:07.747
What the fuck is klingon?
Like the &lt;i&gt;star trek&lt;/i&gt; guys?

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.316
Yeah, he can speak
their language.
No, she's kidding.

00:00:10.384 --> 00:00:12.918
No, I'm not.
Why are you being shy?

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:15.271
- Yeah, don't be shy, tim.
- It's just-- it's made-up.

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:18.307
This guy who plays
the wizard at work
is a trekkie. I don't--

00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:21.743
Don't be shy. Tell them what
you said to me last night.
No.

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:24.480
Say what you said
to her last night.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.800
[ speaking klingon ]

00:00:29.737 --> 00:00:31.437
You gotta be kidding me.

00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:34.589
It means, "I like to
mate after battle."

00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:36.459
- That's not what I said.
- Yeah.

00:00:36.527 --> 00:00:38.527
No. No. That wasn't
the one I said.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:40.562
This one means,
"kill kirk"...

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.400
And also "hallelujah,"
depending on the context.

00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:46.702
You must have got it
confused with, uh--

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.305
[ speaking gibberish ]

00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:53.209
[ laughs ]
honey, that is good.
You know what that means, tim?

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:55.994
Well, I do. It means,
"get the fuck
out of my house...

00:00:56.063 --> 00:00:57.996
Before I chop
your fucking head off."

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:08.657
Mark, he's a knight.

00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:11.426
He's just a fast-food knight.

00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:15.631
I should get going.

00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:29.245
Thanks, uh,
for the cereal.

00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:32.364
I had a lovely evening.

00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:35.067
By the way, it says
"balls" on your face.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.205
- Asshole.
- My mom did it.
