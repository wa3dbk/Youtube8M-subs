00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:48.948 size:88% position:44%
BRACING MYSELF TO SHIELD YOU
FROM A HAIL OF BULLETS.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.550 size:69% position:66%
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
VERY GALLANT OF YOU,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.218 size:84% position:58%
BUT YOU CAN STOP BRACING.

WELL, THE BAD NEWS IS,

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:06.299 size:78% position:39%

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.667 align:start size:59% position:41%
AND THE GOOD NEWS?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.269

WE'RE NOT HANDCUFFED TOGETHER.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:11.337 align:start size:19% position:81% line:78%

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.739 size:88% position:56%
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT ROOMY.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:14.340 size:84% position:58%

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.013 align:start size:69% position:31%
CASTLE, WE ARE LOCKED
IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.815 align:start size:69% position:31%
IN LONG-TERM PARKING.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.149 size:69% position:66%
IT'S GONNA BE HOURS
BEFORE ANYONE REALIZES

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:24.317 align:start size:63% position:38%
THAT WE'RE MISSING.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.286 align:start size:53% position:47%
WHO DO YOU THINK
IS GONNA FIND US?

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.822 size:75% position:38%
I JUST FEEL,
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS,

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.623
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE FAITH.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.294
YOU PRESSED
THE PANIC BUTTON, DIDN'T YOU?

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.029 size:72% position:36%
WELL, IF THERE WAS EVER
A TIME TO PANIC,

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.264 align:start position:0% line:85%
I THINK THIS WAS IT.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.264 align:start size:19% position:81%
I AM--

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.833 size:81% position:41% line:85%
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME.

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.833 align:start size:19% position:81%

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.735 size:78% position:61%
I AM NOT GONNA BE RESCUED
BY YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.937 align:start size:41% position:59% line:85%
MOVE, CASTLE.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.937
