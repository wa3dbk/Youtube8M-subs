00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.979
Hello from your friends at the National Weather
Service.

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:09.070
My name is Christine Riley and my name is
Suzanne Sims and we are both forecasters at

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.770
the office in Monterey.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.049
We would like to fill you in on the latest
information regarding a series of storm systems

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.980
forecast to impact the region beginning Wednesday.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.050
This image shows precipitation from four different
forecast models for Wednesday afternoon.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.759
It is rare to see all of the models in such
good agreement with regards to timing of rain

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.999
giving the forecasters high confidence.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.740
Here are the forecast rainfall amounts through
early Friday morning.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.890
Generally, the region will see between a half
of an inch to an inch of rain.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.440
Some of the higher elevations and areas along
the coast will likely see between an inch

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.790
to two inches of rain with this first round
of rain.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.590
There will also be gusty south winds Wednesday
afternoon into the evening hours, with occasional

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.500
gusts between 15 and 30 mph.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.790
On the top panel you will see forecast precipitation
for Thursday afternoon, indicating a clear

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.920
break in the rain.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.590
The bottom panel displays precipitation for
Friday afternoon, with both forecast models

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.609
indicating another significant round of precipitation.

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:17.321
Forecaster confidence is a bit lower with
regards to timing of the rain on Friday, with

00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:19.630
only slight differences in the models.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.100
However, confidence is still medium to high.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.770
Given that the area is expecting two significant
storm systems, rainfall totals by early Sunday

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.580
morning will be quite impressive.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.600
In general, much of the area will see at least
one to two inches of rain, while many coastal

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.939
locations and the north bay could easily see
three inches of rain.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.030
A few higher elevations along the coastline
could see upwards of four to five inches between

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.380
the two storms.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.829
In addition to all of the rain that is expected,
winds on Friday afternoon are forecast to

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.329
be much stronger than those observed on Wednesday.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.870
By Friday afternoon, wind gusts between 20
and 30 mph, with occasional higher elevation

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.179
gusts to 40 mph will be possible.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.160
These winds will be present all day Friday
into early Saturday morning.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.970
These prolonged gusty winds will create various
hazards which I will talk about on the next

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.510
slide.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.160
With the abundant rain and strong winds forecast
over the region Wednesday and Friday, there

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.920
will be numerous impacts to the region.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.909
Brief heavy downpours may reduce visibilities
and result in ponding of water on roadways,

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.860
making driving difficult.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.150
In addition, with saturated grounds from the
rain, gusty winds may result in downed trees

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.739
and power lines.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.290
It is important that you continue to monitor
the weather closely for the latest information.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.079
Please pass this information on to your friends
and family to keep them weather aware.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.709
