00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.179
Salutations celestial sight seers!

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.970
I'm David Fuller, welcome to Eyes on the Sky;
what's up this week?

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.630
Around 10:30 at night, look for the orange-colored
red-giant star Antares in Scorpius towards

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.750
the south.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.529
The "body" of the scorpion sits above this
bright star, and is punctuated by three similarly

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.739
bright stars - Acrab at the top, Dschubba
in the middle, and Pi Scorpii on the bottom.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.019
Let's go globular hunting first, shall we?

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.760
Look at the middle star, Dschubba.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.969
Though appearing single, this is an interesting
set of four stars, the largest and brightest

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.829
one having undergone a bit of variability
in the last 10 years or so, though recently

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.880
it's settled down to around 2.0 magnitude.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.559
Follow a line from that star to Antares, a
star that was likely born at a similar time

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.020
as Dschubba, but has evolved more quickly
into a red giant.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.770
Now extend that line out, the same distance,
going in the opposite direction.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.770
So what's here?

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.020
Well for starters, this is a wonderfully dense
region of the Milky way, as we're looking

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.610
in towards the central region of our galaxy.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.300
But right here, we should be able to use a
red dot finder or magnified finder scope to

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.229
locate a globular cluster at this spot, Messier
62.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.979
Charles Messier initially discovered this
object in 1771, but failed to note it's position

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.320
until finding it again in 1779.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.619
It has a moderately bright overall appearance,
with a bright core.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.630
At a respectable 14 arc minutes across, this
cluster likely spans about 100 light years

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.410
across in space.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.700
For amateurs, most telescopes will see about
one and a half arc minutes of the core, and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.610
approximately 6 to 8 arc minutes of stars
outside that area.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.209
Smaller scopes will show it as a hazy region,
while larger scopes should easily resolve

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.649
the brighter cluster members.

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.580
A journey onwards to an open cluster in a
moment!

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.310
Dark Sky Fact: Summer is the perfect time
to swap out old, poorly shielded lights for

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.420
new ones.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.040
Check out the selection of dark sky friendly
lighting at Lowes home improvement stores

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.560
in the U.S., or look on darksky.org for websites
where you can purchase these starlight and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.980
sleep enhancing fixtures.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.980
Let's back up a bit.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.420
This time draw a line from Dschubba, through
Antares, and on to the 1.8 magnitude Kaus

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.620
Australis in the lower right side of the Teapot
asterism in Sagittarius.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.340
The span of distance from Antares over to
Kaus Australis is just about 25 degrees, so

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.010
you can measure that distance by holding your
hand up like this at arm's length, like this.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.280
Now imagine splitting that line into thirds.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.850
This is not quite as easy as splitting it
in half, but you can also estimate the approximately

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.140
8 degrees distance by holding up four fingers
together like this.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.670
Our first hop is the 8 degrees from Antares,
so Messier 62 right here.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.640
But if we come back from the other direction,
from Kaus Australis towards Antares and stop

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.940
just a little further out - more like a fist
width of around 10 degrees - we find another

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.270
object: The open cluster of Messier 6, sometimes
known as the Butterfly Cluster.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.910
This cluster does indeed have a butterfly
shape to it - check out the 7-th through 9-th

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.420
magnitude stars that have two somewhat symmetrical
sides, with a fairly well defined body and

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.450
with a bit of imagination, two antennae that
rise up off the "head" of the butterfly.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.750
With larger scopes, stars down to 12-th and
13-th magnitude make this cluster a real treat.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.000
At 25 arc minutes across, low to medium low
magnification is best for this 1,600 light

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.140
years distant cluster of stars.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.480
At that distance and angular diameter, the
cluster covers about 12 light years of space.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.690
And one last thing to look for: Up from M6,
just underneath this 4.5 magnitude star by

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:08.950
about one degree, is the the center of our
Milky Way galaxy, right at the core.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.110
