00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.920
should we speak Swedish?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.200
Yes that sounds like a good idea.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.300
very good.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.900
Okay, the first question -

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.360
- Why do you play with the Puma evoSpeed?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.940
I have always liked light boots -

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.000
- also Puma are my sponsor and I have always liked Puma, 
especially now they have brought out the new evoSpeed, -

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.180
- which I have looked forward to for a long time,
 it is a great shoe, and I already like it a lot.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.820
Which qualities do you value in a boot?

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.360
Many of the ones found in the Puma evoSpeed actually. 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.680
It should be light and I do like the feel of this microfiber boot.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.720
You can also get it in leather, but I like the microfiber better.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.880
but a light boot, easy to move in, which is pretty close to this evospeed they just released.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.940
Is the look of the boots important?

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.740
yes I think so, I like shoes that are black or white.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.600
I've had green and pink boots before, but it's not really my thing -

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.880
- I'm more black or white
 that is why I'm very happy with this new shoe they released.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.960
Is there a club you dream of playing for?  

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.600
I have, ever since I was little, dreamed of playing for MalmÃ¶ FF, and I do that now -

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.320
- it has always been my biggest dream,
 but of course you dream even more -

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.900
- I've always liked Dortmund in Germany.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.200
This is just a dream, 
I'm very happy in Malmo, then we'll see how far it will take me.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.860
Which is the best player you've ever playing with, or against?

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.620
I would have to say Milan and Zlatan,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.840
it's probably the best player I have met, 
I have also played with him, and then I realized how good he was.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.420
I have to say Zlatan.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.260
Zlatan okay.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.370
That was it, but we are not quite done.
