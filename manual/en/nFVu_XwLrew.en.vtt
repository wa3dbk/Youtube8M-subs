00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:15.435
 The question I get asked the most

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.160
  is "How do you cook beef ribs?"

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.240
Well...

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.620
 Turns out, it's just about the easiest thing there is to cook. 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.680
So today, we're going to cook beef ribs.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.480
This ones pretty small.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.340
It's plate rib, from the grocery store.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.880
I think it's going to take about six hours to cook.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.254
If you have a bigger one, you may be looking at closer to eight hours.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.860
First Step: I'm going to slather the beef ribs in Louisiana Hot Sauce

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.520
You can do anything you want really.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.020
You can use oil.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.260
You could not use anything

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.140
I like the hot sauce.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.000
It gives it kind of an added tang and it helps the rub stick a little bit

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.840
I'm just gonna...

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.160
Slather a little bit. Kind of get it a little wet.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.940
Then I'm going to sprinkle on some salt.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.680
I only use kosher salt.

00:00:58.674 --> 00:01:00.194
Table salt is too fine.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.360
Try to get all sides.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.644
I like to do the salt first so you can see how much you're putting on.  And a ton of pepper.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.100
You could put any kind of rub you wanted to.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.380
And then the fire

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.540
I'm looking to cook these beef ribs about 285Â°

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.420
 I tend to go a bit hotter than I do with brisket.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.260
Its got bones in there.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.420
Bone side down

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140
Kind of helps shield it, kind of helps insulate it just a little bit

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.035
Also helps it cook a lot faster.

00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:32.813
One thing to be a little bit careful of with the beef ribs is if you cook really really hot

00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:36.973
You'll cook out a lot of bone marrow and stuff out of the bones and they tend to get a little bit gamey.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.580
So

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.960
 on it goes!

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.020
Alright, so it has been about 5 1/2 hours

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.580
I'm gonna spritz it.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.080
Keep it moist.  Keep the edges from getting too crunchy.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.794
And I'm going to actually probe it. 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.500
With my trusty thermometer.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.094
Just to kind of get a feel for whats going on in there.

00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:04.554
It's looking really really nice.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.920
Got a good bark.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.720
Not getting too crunchy

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.840
What I'm feeling for is to see if feeling pretty tight or if it feels like it's starting to get tender

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.880
It's starting to get tender back here but it still has a ways to go up there.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.540
Shut the lid.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.040
And come back in a little bit.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.980
These beef ribs are about 6 1/2 hours in

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.940
I'm thinking they're pretty close to done.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.280
I'm gonna probe.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.340
Oh yeah.  Those feel great.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.520
So I'm gonna take them off. 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.220
Always use a towel.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.860
Kind of pick them up, you want these ribs to be tender

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.460
They should almost fall apart but not quite.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.635
But what I'm really going for is I'm going to probe inside here.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.980
but I'm going right in between the bones.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.140
When you poke through the bark

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.040
it should feel like melted butter on the probe.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.700
You're not really looking at temperatures.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.700
If you were, it would be around 200 degrees

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.660
But each rib is a little bit different. So..

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.980
super-duper soft.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.397
And right here there is that second membrane between the bones and the meat.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.940
When you go through

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.140
you can feel

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.480
the probe poke right through the second membrane

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.975
and that's what you're really going for.

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:20.135
If that feels tender

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.960
this rib is done.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.480
Don't forget to let it rest just for a little bit

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.440
to let it reabsorb some of the juices too.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.380
A lot of people ask about beef ribs.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.760
It's really no big deal

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.560
Salt and pepper.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.294
Spritz it with water, some vinegar, apple juice, whatever you want.

00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:40.534
But the point is

00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:41.674
Cook it till it's done.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.440
Don't cook it too hot where you burn it.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.315
And don't cook it low enough where you don't render fat.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.560
Piece of cake.
