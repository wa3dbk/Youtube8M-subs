hello ,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.399
let me show you how to use ARC function

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.940
that's called audio return channel

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.670
it means the same cable which you connected
with home theater and with TV can be used

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.940
for distributor for all types of audio
from TV to hometheater as well

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.099
so in this case you don't have to connect
any additional extra cable to get the audio

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.169
from TV to hometheater

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.330
