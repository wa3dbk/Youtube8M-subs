00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:04.000
(gun shots echoing)

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:44.074
- [Voiceover] Woe woe woe woe!

00:00:44.074 --> 00:00:45.300
Woe woe!

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.684
I was scared then.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.524
Car camping in the snow.

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:08.140
Just hold the camera up so you
can see what the tarp set up

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.346
looks like.

00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:13.411
So this tarp setup kind
of goes against everything

00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:16.167
that winter snow camping has taught me.

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:19.929
We had to put this up in quite a hurry.

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.158
There's dinner cooking just there.

00:01:22.158 --> 00:01:24.573
Let's come back this way.

00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:27.266
The problem with this tarp setup is

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.356
it's just a little bit too
flat so if we do get hit

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:32.886
by a big thump of snow overnight

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:35.208
we may collapse.

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:38.180
The tarp setup may collapse.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.019
We do have a tent inside there though

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:42.434
a backup tent in case that happens.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:45.499
That guy-line is tied to that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.357
fallen tree.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.209
There's the rope.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.397
Swing around this way

00:01:51.397 --> 00:01:54.300
and that's the road so it's fair to say

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.038
no one is gonna be using this road

00:01:58.038 --> 00:02:00.487
until winter's over

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:03.970
so we've got this area all to ourselves.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.454
See what it looks like.

00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:09.121
It's the old green tarp.

00:02:10.078 --> 00:02:12.545
And now turned white.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.613
So what we've got cooking here

00:02:16.613 --> 00:02:18.900
a bit of pork just boiling,

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:21.000
turn that heat down a little bit actually.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.700
Bit of pasta in that pot there.

00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:27.829
And just here is a hydrated food pack

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.710
imported from New Zealand.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.000
Just hold it in the light so you can see.

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:35.143
There's half a liter of boiling
water inside that bag

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:36.234
right now.

00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:38.789
So the hydrated food is
turning into normal food

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.000
as we speak.

00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:43.432
Another

00:02:43.432 --> 00:02:45.081
new piece of gear

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:48.030
that we've got for this trip.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.000
Winter Fuel Formula.

00:02:50.747 --> 00:02:52.372
So the diesel fuel

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.950
from a four wheel drive
can actually freeze

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.366
in

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:58.144
low temperatures like
this, tonight it might

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.605
drop down to minus eight but if we put

00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:04.135
one milliliter of Winter
Fuel Formula per liter

00:03:04.135 --> 00:03:06.852
of diesel fuel inside the tank

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.057
when we fill the car up

00:03:09.057 --> 00:03:11.960
our regular diesel becomes Alpine Diesel

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.283
and that is...

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:17.092
it won't freeze, well not
unless the temperature drops

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:19.994
to minus 40 so according to the bottle

00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:22.734
we will be okay down to minus 40

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:26.792
but if diesel does freeze
it'll turn into like a jelly.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.002
Just pop that there for a
moment while we step back

00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:32.533
this way give you another
look at this angle.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:34.483
So

00:03:34.483 --> 00:03:37.897
a few variations in the
tarp setup this time.

00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:40.311
We've got a few new bars up there so

00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:44.329
the entire tarp is no longer
resting on the roof of the car

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.915
tomorrow we might be able to
actually drive out of here

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:50.004
for a bit of a day cruise
and then we'll come back

00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:53.528
later on leaving the tarp behind.

00:03:54.927 --> 00:03:56.738
Think the camera's fogging
up a little bit just have to

00:03:56.738 --> 00:03:58.805
give it a bit of a wipe.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:01.632
So we might come back
to you tomorrow morning.

00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:04.076
Christina is already in bed,

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:07.484
just keeping her toes toasty

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.502
while I cook dinner.

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:14.589
And here we are in the Alps of Australia.

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:18.769
Looks like that

00:04:20.005 --> 00:04:21.676
food

00:04:21.676 --> 00:04:23.529
is almost ready.

00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:26.036
Give it a stir.

00:04:26.924 --> 00:04:28.898
Actually just take that off.

00:04:28.898 --> 00:04:31.162
Another thing you can do with meat

00:04:31.162 --> 00:04:32.766
or when you're boiling
something to save energy

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:36.086
just take it off the heat, put the lid on,

00:04:36.086 --> 00:04:39.991
turn the heat off, and while I'm out here

00:04:41.612 --> 00:04:44.153
I'm using BIC lighters at the moment so

00:04:44.153 --> 00:04:47.752
I've never had any trouble
getting a flame with BIC lighter

00:04:47.752 --> 00:04:49.958
but when it gets really cold
like this there is a chance

00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.723
that it might stop
working for a few minutes

00:04:51.723 --> 00:04:53.836
it's just a matter of warming
the cigarette lighter back up

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:56.460
again and then you can

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.573
get fire once again.

00:04:58.573 --> 00:05:02.497
Here's the sleeping
arrangement for tonight.

00:05:02.497 --> 00:05:04.935
So one thing I do is,

00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:06.166
while we're camped out here,

00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:08.232
I'll show you inside
the sleeping bag here,

00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:10.717
is just keep all your electrical devices

00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:12.737
inside the sleeping bag while
you're sleeping at night

00:05:12.737 --> 00:05:14.757
this is a spare cigarette lighter there,

00:05:14.757 --> 00:05:17.451
just in case all the other
cigarette lighters fail

00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:19.912
we will have one that's warmed up.

00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:21.770
What else have we got in
here, there's another one of

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.208
my cameras.

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:26.530
GPS.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.759
So once the temperature drops down to zero

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.731
there's a chance that all
of those electrical devices

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:34.170
might stop working but
because they're inside

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.143
Christina's sleeping bag

00:05:36.143 --> 00:05:38.999
they should be all right,
I'll zip that up in a moment

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.617
after I switch the camera back off.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.081
One last walk back this way

00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:48.171
into the snow

00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:49.239
have a look

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:51.027
at the tent setup.

00:05:51.027 --> 00:05:53.297
The tarpy tarp.

00:05:54.928 --> 00:05:56.274
This is Bush Channel.

00:05:56.274 --> 00:06:01.274
(slow rap music)

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.996
- [Voiceover] Push man push.

00:06:25.996 --> 00:06:28.730
- How can I push if you not help me?

00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:38.158
(heavy rap music rhythms)
