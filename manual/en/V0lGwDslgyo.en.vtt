00:00:03.037 --> 00:00:04.237
Sultan Moulay Ismail...

00:00:04.598 --> 00:00:07.998
was responsible for transforming a small provincial town...

00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:10.673
into a monumental imperial city.

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:15.947
A ruthless leader he conscripted a massive slave army...

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.250
and fought off the Berber tribes to the South...

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.519
and Europeans forces rooted in the north.

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:23.586
With captured European slaves,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.900
he built an enormous Imperial complex...

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:28.785
with over 20 gates, 50 palaces, 

00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:32.648
and massive walls extending over 45 kms.

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.769
This is Meknes, the Imperial City.

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.072
We're riding on a Caleche...

00:00:40.263 --> 00:00:41.263
in Meknes...

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:42.643
and ahhh,

00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:44.511
new experience for the three of us.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.130
Yeah.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.080
Right now we're just getting ready to go past the...

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:49.249
Place el Hedim...

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.150
and, ahhh...

00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:51.318
Bab Mansour

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:52.918
The Place El Hedim... 

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:55.603
meaning “square of demolition and renewal”,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.030
is the social center of Meknes.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.429
Much of the medina was destroyed to make the square...

00:01:01.572 --> 00:01:05.372
so it could be used as a staging area to construct the Imperial Palace.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:10.368
Along to the square is the exquisite Bab Mansour, 

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:13.858
a well preserved gate with classic Almohad designs...

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.741
and columns removed from the nearby ancient city of Volubilis.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:21.413
The gate is usually closed...

00:01:21.702 --> 00:01:23.902
but occasionally hosts art exhibits.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:31.755
I'm standing at the Koubbat as Sufara, the Royal Parade Ground...

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:35.926
where Moulay Ismail inspect his 6,000 Black Guard.

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:37.763
 These were slave-soldiers...

00:01:37.988 --> 00:01:40.490
who were given wives to produce offspring...

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:43.250
that were pressed into military at age 16...

00:01:43.884 --> 00:01:46.180
thus exponentially increasing the army.  

00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:48.540
These were the granaries...

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:52.340
used to feed the main troops of...

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:54.110
Moulay Ismail

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.380
and ahhh...

00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:59.650
some say it was used as a christian prison...

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:02.960
Bleak place to be imprisoned.

00:02:03.492 --> 00:02:05.290
They're doing a lot of restoration here...

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:07.600
They even managed to get a...

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:09.260
bull dozer down here.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.800
I'm standing in mud.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:14.870
I'm going to let myself out of here.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:21.100
The best way to get around to the various sites inside the imperial city

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.250
is by Caleche, a horse drawn carriage.  

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:26.100
Yeah you like your horse ride, Abi.

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:30.220
In the summer,

00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:33.120
the temperature is well over 100 degrees...

00:02:33.354 --> 00:02:35.650
so walking is not the best idea.  

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.760
The most distant site from the Place el Hedim...

00:02:38.987 --> 00:02:40.990
is also perhaps the most interesting, 

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:45.120
the immense granaries and stables of Heri es-Souani 

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.770
These granaries were designed...

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.500
with incredibly thick walls...

00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:53.440
and underground water channels designed to keep the temperature cool.  

00:02:54.817 --> 00:02:58.620
The granaries also fed and stabled some 12,000 horses.

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:02.230
Next to the granaries is the Agdal Basin

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:05.830
which served as a reservoir for the sultan’s royal gardens

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.500
Here I am at the Royal Golf Grounds...

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.600
right in the middle of Meknes.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.260
It's kind of a strange site because...

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:16.560
it's a really hot city, duty...

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.900
and here we are in the middle of the old royal gardens...

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.900
and it's now a nine hole golf course.

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:25.240
It's really too bad I'm not any good at golf.

00:03:25.607 --> 00:03:27.610
Okay so I really don't feel like I belong here...

00:03:27.676 --> 00:03:30.080
so I'm waiting to be kicked out at any time.

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:32.740
but, there doesn't seem to be anybody here...

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.980
just walked in...

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:35.050
so..

00:03:35.295 --> 00:03:37.100
I think I'll just, ahhh, let myself out.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.320
Our last stop in the Imperial City 

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:44.160
is the final resting place of Moulay Ismail 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.560
his mausoleum completed during his lifetime.  

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.400
Moulay Ismail’s 55 year reign...

00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:00.860
lasted until 1727.  

00:04:02.295 --> 00:04:05.500
He was ruthless and bloody military leader...

00:04:05.906 --> 00:04:09.210
but he also created the foundations of modern Morocco ...

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:13.180
and for this he is highly venerated by his people.
