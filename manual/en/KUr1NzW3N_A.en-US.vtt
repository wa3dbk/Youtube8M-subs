00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.870
What's up people!? Have you ever wondered

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.139
if you can transfer your games data between iOS devices?

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.130
Today I will show you how this is possible

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.530
with a simple program/software --&gt; iExplorer

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.390
that you have to download, clicking the link

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.470
in the description.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.470
Once more, this process works with all iOS devices

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.300
in every iOS version. No need to be jailbroken!

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.230
It's important to refer that this process does not work with every game! For example:

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.350
It's more likely

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.670
to exist an app

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.860
with one universal version

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.340
that works on every single iOS device,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.660
than existing separate versions.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.880
As you can see this game

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.800
"iCopter" does have one version

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.010
for iPhone and iPod, and other for iPad

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.150
not being possible to transfer iPhone and iPod games

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.460
to an iPad, or the opposite.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.770
On the other hand, there are apps

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.790
like this one here "BouceOnUp"

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.210
that has one single version

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.080
for all iOS devices, meaning that it will be

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.660
possible to transfer (the games)

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.860
to an iPad and vice versa.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.070
Let me show you

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.430
with this example

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.600
of the app "BounceOnUp",

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.600
how you can transfer your data between devices.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.130
As you will see here

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.160
my highscore...

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.620
14,725

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.300
and I will copy this "number"

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.880
to the iPad, and for that, of course, the app must installed in it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.480
For this, connect your device

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.390
to the computer

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.400
with a USB cable.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.680
Having already downloaded the program "iExplorer",

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.670
open it...

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.610
and on the bottom of your device, click

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.780
where it says "Apps". Search for your

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.780
particular app to transfer the data..

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.769
In other tutorial that I've done *here's the link*

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.430
I teached you how to save your games, moving 2 important folders

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.649
to the desktop, and deleting others...

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.149
here, the process is going to be the same!

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:30.019
So, drag

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.419
the 2 folders "Documents and Library"

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.249
"Documents" and "Library"

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.159
to the desktop

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.949
and when it's over

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.389
I will disconnect the iPod and connect the iPad to the computer.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.069
The process ends only when nothing is written

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.419
down here.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.369
Being identified here the iPad

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:57.559
what you will gonna do is: In (your) app folder,

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.189
delete those with the same name

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.789
that the ones in the computer.

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.989
(Documents and Library).

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.019
And to do that

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.939
right click

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.009
on the folder

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:14.069
and delete it.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.679
One at a time.

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.889
After deleting those, grab the

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.239
2 folders

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.439
that you dragged

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.589
to your computer

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:33.489
and paste them on the same directory of the app, except this time

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.089
it is on your final device. In this case

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.799
an iPad.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:43.799
You can now open the game...

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.379
Let me lose here quickly to see the highscore...

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.189
And, as you can see.. 14,725

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.929
And, as you can see.. 14,725

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:02.689
as it was on the iPod.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.259
I hope it has helped you, once again,

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.899
