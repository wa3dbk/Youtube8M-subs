00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.779
This is a fun drill to have players

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.739
move and track the ball into the racket. In
tennis

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.879
most of the mistakes are due to the
player

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.199
not watching the ball from the bounce to the racquet.

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.309
This is a nice fun exercise that will help
players

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.840
get the feeling up really focusing on
the ball

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.329
100 percent. The players hit the ball to
each other

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.780
and try to stop it with the grip and
then hit back

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.780
high to their partners. 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.680
As you can see the
drill requires a little bit of coordination.

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.390
You have to turn the racquet around, place
the grip

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.979
right behind the ball, move your feet, set
up

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.840
and then tap it turn the racquet around
and hit it up

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.229
back to you partner. it is very
important that the players shuffle

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.619
in get right behind a ball. It makes it a
lot easier to make

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.619
contact with the grip.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.830
Once the players feel comfortable with
this drill, the next drill

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.830
makes it a little bit tougher.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.920
dealing with competitive pressure but
cap rally

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.360
players rally stop at the ball with the
butt cap

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.460
This drill is similar to the previous
drill

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.959
except the players are gonna shuffle and
try to stop the ball with the butt cap

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.439
before hitting it over to their partners.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.000
With a little bit of practice,the players will be able to stop the ball with the butt caps

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.430
every single time. 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.580
Once again the idea is to work on shuffling and tracking that ball,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.340
getting right behind it and having the
players

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.459
follow the ball from the bounce to the
racket.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.750
Getting this feeling of following the ball from the bounce to the racket

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.120
is key for players to minimize

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.640
errors while they're playing. 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.940
Practice
this drill next time you're on the court

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.480
and you will really understand what
watching the ball in tennis

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.540
really means
