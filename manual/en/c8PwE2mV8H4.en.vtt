00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.050
I have here cooked rice.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.050
Six cups.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.010
If you have rice cooker, just use it.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.690
It's very easy.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.530
Just follow the directions that comes with
it and then cook it.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.850
If you don't, you can cook it in a pot.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.630
It's very easy.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.910
Same proportion rice and water.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.460
You have to wash the rice before you cook
it.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.940
That water becomes very milky, color comes
out.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.570
So you keep washing, washing, washing until
water becomes almost clear.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.570
Once it gets clear, drain all the water.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.570
Then transfer to the pot.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.240
Then measure the water.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.910
If you have four cups, you need four cups
of water.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.750
Start cooking with high heat.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.100
Once it starts to boil, turn the heat to low.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.350
Then wait 20 minutes and turn the heat to
off.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.550
Then 10 minutes steaming.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.730
While you are cooking, keep the lid all the
way.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.369
Once you put the lid on it, don't take it
off.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.160
No peeking and no stirring what-so-ever.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.050
Just let it go.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.470
No I have here, already cooked, six cups of
rice.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.170
So I'm going to transfer 
to the hangiri.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.790
This is called hangiri.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.930
It's made with a natural wood.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.200
So any extra moisture is going to absorb to
the wood.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.430
If you get burned part of it, just take it
off.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.210
Now I have here sushi vinegar which is rice
vinegar, sugar, and salt.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.140
You cook it until salt and sugar is dissolved.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.460
You don't want to overcook it because once
it's boiled then you lose the vinegar flavor.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.369
So you don't want to boil it, but you have
to melt the sugar and the salt.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.319
Now I'm pouring the sushi vinegar into the
rice.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.870
Then break it.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.020
When you break the rice, try not to mush mash
the rice.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.090
You want to keep the rice individual.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.810
When you turn, cut it.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.189
Turn and cut it.

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.930
So that you don't mush or smash the rice.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.939
You can use plastic or metal, but the best
way is a wooden spoon.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.109
If you don't have this kind of bowl, you can
use a salad bowl.

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.450
A big salad bowl.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.560
An unfinished wooden salad bowl.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.730
That's the best one.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.169
And if you don't have it, of course you can
use a metal one.

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.549
But don't pick the bowl coming around it.

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.980
That keep the steam inside it.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.749
This time, as you can see, you want to get
all the steam out as quickly as possible to

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.019
get shiny sushi rice.

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.860
Youâ€™re going to go about three or four times
around it.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.059
The best way is a second person while you
fan it at the same time so all the steam is

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:31.939
out as quickly as possible.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.129
Once it gets room temperature or body temperature,
that's the best temperature, then cover with

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.230
a damp towel.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.209
Now it's ready to use for sushi and that's
how you make sushi rice.
