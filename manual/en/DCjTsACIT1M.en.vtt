00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.090
All right, you guys.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.520
So now we're going to get into the Moonwalk,
which was debuted by Michael Jackson in 1982

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.520
for the Motown 25th anniversary.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.220
If you haven't seen it yet, you've got to
check it out.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.520
Please do.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.270
So the Moonwalk: What creates the illusion
is the fact that he's shifting weight, as

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.490
he usually does in most of his moves, but
he's shifting weight using the terminology

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.099
from gliding.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.350
So with that in mind, let us start out by
pressing through the right foot.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.450
Now, as you press, this is what the right
foot would be doing.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.890
You're here, and you're pressing all the way
through to the heel.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.140
The other foot is just simply sliding back.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.220
Now, keep in mind that the leg that slides
back, you don't want the weight to be on this

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.220
leg.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.700
You want it to be sorely on the right, since
this is the one that's creating the push,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.460
so if I did it slowly, it would look like
this.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.930
Now, what's going to happen is I'm going to
change weight, shift it, the left heel is

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.429
going to come up, and the left heel is going
to push through like this, and as the left

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:27.399
leg pushes through, my right foot goes here
simultaneously.

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.729
It looks like this.

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.540
And then you switch and shift over to your
right side.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.729
Shift.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.150
Switch to your left.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.530
Shift right.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.110
Shift left.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.660
So with that in mind, let's try it a little
faster.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.640
I'm going to go here.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
Shift.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.040
Left comes up.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.209
Shift.

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.770
Right comes up.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.270
Left comes up.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.750
Right comes up.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.970
And so on and so forth.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.419
Now, that is your Moonwalk.
