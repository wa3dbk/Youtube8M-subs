Hi, this is Matt on behalf of Expert Village.
And today we're going to learn how to make

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.299
my Slow Cook Chicken with Garlic Ranch Potatoes.
Okay, so now we're ready to season our chicken

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.730
and I'm going to use a couple of different
seasonings here, or spices. This one's called

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.859
Sasson, it's a Spanish seasoning and it really
give a great flavor. It's red and it also

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:28.589
gives it a nice red color. I have two packets
here; I'm going to open the packet and kind

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:35.290
of spread it out and sprinkle it out, across
the chicken. I'm going to massage it in after

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.200
I get it on here. All the seasonings on here.
We'll throw one more on. I wish you could

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.530
smell this. This is a great seasoning and
you can find this if you have a supermarket

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.440
that has an international section; you can
find this in the Spanish section. I definitely

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.050
suggest you get a box of this. You can get
a small box or a big box. I guarantee you

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.320
can use it with eggs; you can use it with
steak, anything. I have another Spanish seasoning

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.790
here called Adobo. Same thing, you can find
this if you have an international section

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:17.890
in your supermarket. I'm just going to spread
that on here, like so. These two condiments,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.490
Sasson and Adobo compliment each other very
well. I definitely recommend getting that.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.600
I also have a garlic pepper grinder here and
you can get this in your store. I'm just going

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:42.140
to grind some of that on here, like so. Now,
I'm not going to put any salt on because the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.630
Adobo is kind of salty. So we won't need that.
I'll just push that to the side. I'm just

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:56.080
going to massage it in, rub it in. You see
how it has this nice red color. It's going

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:04.420
to seep in, definitely with the dressing that
we put on. It's going to taste really good.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.450
Massage it in and make sure everything has
that nice color. Okay, wonderful. I made a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.420
mess of my hands, as you can see. We're going
to put this off to the side and then we're

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.930
going to work on our potatoes.
