I'll continue with the side of the ear and
my focus is to connect this side of his beard

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:15.340
to the side-burn on the straight line. Same
thing. We'll connect this line of his side-burn

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:32.569
all the way down, into the jawline. Tilt your
head back. I want you to see how I created

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:41.620
a shadow, all around the shape of his jawbone
and cleaned everything on his neck. The next

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.339
thing that I'm going to do is I'll position
him forward and I'm going to create a nice,

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:54.239
soft line around here that connects from the
side-burn all the way to the upper lip. Here

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:32.049
we go.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.581
And that's what I'm hoping to create right
here. A nice, sharp edge that connects the

00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:43.520
side-burn to the upper lip. We'll go to the
next side. If you look at the side of the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.610
face, there's a contour line that focuses
from the side-burn, cuts right in the middle

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.020
of his face, and connects to the upper lip
if I was to take it all the way through. That

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.250
is going to be a shadow line that I will follow
to create a sharp line.
