00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:09.000
Welcome to our first tutorial for the USM-RC-2 
sound module by BEIER-Electronic.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.449
Today we will show you how to install the 
software and how to open an existing project.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.000
First insert the supplied DVD into your device. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:39.020
The autostart beginns automatically
but the loading process may take a while.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.000
Depending on your installed version of Windows 
an autostart window appears 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.000
or the installation process starts directly.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:00.560
For example with Windows 7 the autostart window pops 
up and you have to press "USM-Installer.exe". 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:14.390
In a next step the installation window appears. 
Press "USM-RC-2 Sound-Teacher installation".

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.870
Choose your prefered installation language.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.390
At the Sound-Teacher Setup Wizard press "Next".

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.000
At the window "Select Destination Location" you can 
choose the folder in which the Sound-Teacher should be installed.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Choose a specific folder or use the standard setting 
and press "Next".

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
For the selection of a start menu folder press "browse" 
and choose your desired folder 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
or use the standard setting.
Click on "Next" to continue.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
At the window "Select Additional Tasks" you can 
activate the button for a desktop icon in order 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.280
to start the program directly from your desktop.
To continue press "Next".

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.000
The window "Ready to Install" gives an overview of the 
choosen installation settings.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.430
Press "Install" to start the installation process, 
which is quite fast.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.000
The installation process is almost finished.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
If the checkbox "Lunch USM-RC-2 Sound-Teacher" is activated the 
Sound-Teacher will start automatically after installation.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.420
Press "Install" to complete the process.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.000
The user interface of the Sound-Teacher opens.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.549
No project is open and no SD card is inserted.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:37.000
In order to open an existing project from the DVD.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:57.379
Go to menu "File", "Open project" and open the DVD USM-RC-2 
in your CD/DVD device with a double click

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:05.000
All folders of the DVD appear.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The sound projects are stored in the folder "USM-RC-2 Sounds".

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.019
Open the folder with a double click.

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:25.000
All projects that are stored on the DVD are listed.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.419
There are various sound projects for example for tanks, 
snowcats, ships, tractors and many more.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:49.559
For demonstration purpose I choose the sound project 
"Truck-Scania V8 with turbo blow".

00:03:49.559 --> 00:04:05.000
"Scania V8.usm" is the filename. Depending on your Windows 
settings the filetype (.usm) is shown or not.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.129
Click on the file name and open the project by 
pressing "Open".

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:22.000
All sounds that belong to Scania V8 will be loaded.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You can see which sound slots are occupied and which 
one are free. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.419
How exactly these are working will be 
explained in another tutorial.

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:39.000
If the project is loaded completely it can be transmitted 
to a SD card. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.599
For that insert your SD card into your SD card reader.

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.000
In case the SD card it not displayed on the user interface 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
go to menu "SD card" and choose your SD card drive.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.569
Here for example the correct drive would be "F:".

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:22.469
If the card is correctly detected, you can see the 
SD card name, the drive-letter and the capacity of the SD card.

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:35.000
To save the project on the SD card press 
"Save project data onto SD card".

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.000
At "Status" you can see the single data that is transmitted.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.229
This takes a while because we are transmitting the data
for the first time.

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.779
Later it is much faster when just configurations are transmitted.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:07.509
When all data are transmitted in the field "Status" appears a notice.
Then the configuration is saved and the SD card can be removed.

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:17.279
When we remove the SD card, a notice on the user 
interface appears that no card is inserted.

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:28.000
And thats it. We have transmitted a standard project. 
But depending on the model and customer wishes,
the sound projects have to be modified first. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.719
How this adjustments exactly are working will be explained 
in another tutorial.

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.000
We are at the end of this video, thank you for watching. 
I hope the explanations were helpful and 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.860
I am looking forward to tell you more about the sound module 
from BEIER-Electronic in the next tutorial.
