00:00:00.127 --> 00:00:03.255
Welcome to week three of
our weekly Meal Prep Series.

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:06.385
I am so glad you guys have been
enjoying the series so far.

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:08.010
You have been absolutely amazing,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.123
liking, commenting,
and sharing the videos.

00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:11.281
So please keep it up.

00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:13.617
I really appreciate all of the support.

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:15.548
And I'm super excited to share with you

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.418
my third meal prep menu.

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:18.941
For this week we are featuring

00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:21.297
some beautiful chicken breast.

00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:23.553
Now I'm doing a balsamic
garlic chicken breast

00:00:23.553 --> 00:00:24.914
that I absolutely love.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:26.966
You can totally do a plain
chicken breast if you wanted to.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.343
But I like to kick things
up a notch, as you know.

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:31.252
Now, if you don't eat
meat, don't sweat it.

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:33.040
We have tons of great veggie dishes up

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.319
right after the chicken breast,

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:36.005
so you can just fast forward through it.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:37.306
So what I've got here are three

00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:38.810
boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.393
I'm just going to season
them really lightly

00:00:40.393 --> 00:00:42.182
with some pepper and a little bit of salt

00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:43.685
and really, that's it.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.961
We're keeping it super
simple with our seasoning.

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:47.607
I'm going to take these
guys over to my frying pan

00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:49.272
where I'm heating up some oil.

00:00:49.272 --> 00:00:51.223
And all I want to do is just
brown the chicken breast

00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:53.925
on both sides before I add my glaze.

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:55.571
So basically what I'm going to do

00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:57.522
is put the chicken breast top side down.

00:00:57.522 --> 00:00:59.938
And I'm going to cook them for
about four to five minutes.

00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:01.036
You'll know they're ready

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:02.845
when they release easily from the pan.

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:05.322
If they're sticking, then
it's too early to flip them.

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:06.603
Take my word for it.

00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:08.004
You do not want to flip them too early.

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:09.732
You'll shred your chicken breast.

00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:11.886
Now, this glaze could not
be easier to put together.

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:13.896
In a small bowl I am
mixing some chicken broth

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:15.319
with some balsamic vinegar

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.310
and a little bit of honey for sweetness.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.753
Then I'm going to add some minced garlic

00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:20.966
and some freshly chopped rosemary.

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.146
Now, if you don't have fresh rosemary,

00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:22.837
don't sweat it.

00:01:22.837 --> 00:01:24.095
Dried stuff will work as well.

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:25.498
But I do love the fresh stuff.

00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:27.591
It really adds a little
something to this dish.

00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:29.379
We're going to whisk this
together really, really well

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:31.045
and head back to the stove.

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:32.812
Now that our chicken
breasts are browned on top,

00:01:32.812 --> 00:01:34.518
we're going to flip them
over and let them brown

00:01:34.518 --> 00:01:36.896
for another minute or
two on the bottom side.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:40.370
Then we are going to add our
beautiful balsamic glaze.

00:01:40.693 --> 00:01:42.404
We're going to turn our heat down to low

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:44.376
and put the lid on and let these guys

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:45.981
simmer for about 10 minutes

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.747
or until they reach an
internal temperature

00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:50.491
of 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:53.076
Now, if you really want to
make these extra special,

00:01:53.076 --> 00:01:55.385
you should flip them a couple
of times while they're cooking

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:57.685
so that they're nicely
glazed on all sides.

00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:59.135
At least that's what I like to do.

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:00.130
Once they're cooked through,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.071
we're going to let them cool completely

00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:02.800
and then I'm just going to slice them up.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.626
These are great when added
to salads or over pasta

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.820
or you can eat them entirely on their own.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.303
It's totally up to you.

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:10.441
I've also left some links

00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:11.681
to other great chicken recipes

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:13.002
in the description box below.

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:14.850
So be sure to check those out as well.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.029
Now that our chicken is complete,

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.755
we are going to roast some potatoes.

00:02:17.755 --> 00:02:19.299
Now, I am using red skin potatoes

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.108
because I love how they
look when they're roasted.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.546
But you can really use any
kind of potato that you like.

00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:25.740
Roasting these potatoes
could not be simpler.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.670
I've just washed my potatoes
really, really well.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.067
And now I'm going to cut
them into cubes and toss them

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.266
with a little bit of olive oil,

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:32.465
some salt and pepper,

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:33.724
some garlic powder.

00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:34.984
You could use regular garlic,

00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:36.731
but I find it burns in the oven.

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:38.885
And some fresh rosemary.

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.470
Again, fresh is better here.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.217
But you totally could use dried as well

00:02:42.217 --> 00:02:43.436
if that's all you have on hand.

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:44.289
No problem.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.386
We're going to toss these guys

00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:46.666
until they're coated on all sides.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.764
And then we're going to pour them

00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:48.820
onto a baking sheet.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.867
Into the oven they go at
375 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:54.184
for between 25 and 35 minutes.

00:02:54.184 --> 00:02:55.483
You'll want to check on them

00:02:55.483 --> 00:02:56.480
every 10 minutes or so

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.135
and give them a quick shake so
they don't burn on any sides.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.703
Then we are going to tackle our asparagus.

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:06.398
All you need to do is start by cutting

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:08.430
the bottom quarter off of your asparagus.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.218
It's really woody and
not delicious to eat.

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:11.863
Then I'm going to put
them on a baking sheet,

00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:14.046
drizzle them with some
olive oil, salt, and pepper,

00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:15.601
and give them a really good rub.

00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:18.218
Into the oven they go
for 10 to 15 minutes.

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:19.376
Keep a good eye on them

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:21.140
because you don't want them to burn.

00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:23.432
While those beauties are roasting away,

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:25.646
we are going to get started on our salad.

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:27.313
This week we are making a beautiful

00:03:27.313 --> 00:03:29.242
kale and red cabbage slaw.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:31.112
Now, the important thing to keep in mind

00:03:31.112 --> 00:03:33.164
when you're doing salads
for weekly meal prep

00:03:33.164 --> 00:03:35.521
is that these salads have
to stand up to the dressing

00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:36.780
for three or four days.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.467
So you want to use
really hardy vegetables,

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:40.417
like red cabbage, for example.

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:41.514
All we're going to do is start

00:03:41.514 --> 00:03:42.835
by cutting our cabbage in half

00:03:42.835 --> 00:03:44.867
and slicing it really, really finely.

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:46.479
If you're not confident
with your knife skills,

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.414
don't worry about it.

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:48.633
Just put it in your food processor

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.563
and let it do the work for you.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.204
To our cabbage, I am going to
add some finely chopped kale.

00:03:53.204 --> 00:03:55.195
I just basically removed
the stems and chopped this

00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:57.349
as finely as I did my red cabbage.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.218
Now we're going to get
started on our dressing.

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:01.301
In a small bowl I've got
some canola oil standing by

00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:03.826
and to that I'm going to add
a little bit of orange juice,

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:06.666
some fresh lime juice, and some honey.

00:04:06.896 --> 00:04:08.559
We're going to season
it with salt and pepper

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:10.895
and pour it all over our beautiful salad.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.141
Next up we're going to get started

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:15.949
on our raw veggies for the week.

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.306
A lot of people think that
this is a step you can skip.

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:19.911
But for me it's really important

00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:21.150
to have raw veggies on hand

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.430
when I'm having a snack attack

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.502
because they'll be the
first thing I reach for.

00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:25.417
But if I have to do things

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:27.753
like peel a carrot or wash my tomatoes,

00:04:27.753 --> 00:04:29.521
I'm less likely to do it.

00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:31.512
So this week we've got
some beautiful carrots

00:04:31.512 --> 00:04:32.914
that I've just peeled and chopped

00:04:32.914 --> 00:04:34.540
and some celery that I've chopped as well.

00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:39.816
I'm also going to wash some
gorgeous cherry tomatoes.

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:41.701
These are perfect for snacking.

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:43.285
Next up we are going to get started

00:04:43.285 --> 00:04:44.992
on our snacks for the week.

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:47.003
These are perfect for that 2 p.m. slump

00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:48.303
when you just feel a little peckish

00:04:48.303 --> 00:04:50.559
and you need something to
tide you over until dinner.

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.408
First up I'm going to make these delicious

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:54.277
little cottage cheese fruit cups.

00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:56.211
All I'm doing is putting about half a cup

00:04:56.211 --> 00:04:58.178
of cottage cheese at the
bottom of the mason jar.

00:04:58.178 --> 00:04:59.761
And then I've got some beautiful melon

00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:01.388
that I just finely chopped up.

00:05:01.388 --> 00:05:03.236
And I'm topping it with some red grapes.

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:05.675
These are a great snack to
fill you up really quickly

00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:08.424
and again, get you through to dinner.

00:05:09.193 --> 00:05:11.546
Finally, I've got these
super simple deli roll-ups.

00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:12.826
All I do is take a piece of turkey

00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:15.097
and a piece of cheese and roll them up.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.973
I really hope you
enjoyed this week's menu.

00:05:20.973 --> 00:05:22.883
And if you did, be sure to like the video

00:05:22.883 --> 00:05:24.366
and share it with your friends.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.053
And of course, if you give it a try,

00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:28.084
be sure to tweet or Instagram me a photo

00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:29.994
because you know I love seeing
what you're coming up with

00:05:29.994 --> 00:05:31.762
in your very own kitchens.

00:05:31.762 --> 00:05:32.981
Speaking of Instagram,

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:34.423
if you haven't followed me already,

00:05:34.423 --> 00:05:35.988
jump over to Instagram and follow me

because every day through January

00:05:38.913 --> 00:05:41.433
I am sharing a brand new smoothie recipe.

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:43.525
And they are all absolutely delicious.

00:05:43.525 --> 00:05:45.272
