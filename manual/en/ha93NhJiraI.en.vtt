Hi, I'm Kelli on behalf of Expert Village,
I'm going to show you some tips and techniques

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.910
that I use when I'm trotting and jogging my
horse. So now we have our horse moving comfortably

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.850
at a walk. We are keeping our posture nice
and straight. Keeping our heels down, we are

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.830
having her moving nice and forward. We are
holding our reins right. We are going to move

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.689
into a trot so we are going to apply a little
bit more leg pressure. Give her a little cluck.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:37.629
We are going to her move up to a trot. Holding
her reins nice and loosely. You don't want

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.739
to hold her hands too ridged. You just want
them to kind of go with the motion of the

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:53.829
horse. We are sitting nice and balanced with
our shoulders back, our shoulder, hip and

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.429
heel are all in a line. Our heels are down.
We are looking where we want to go, keeping

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:10.159
our chin up and parallel to the ground. We
are staying balance on our horse we are sitting,

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.990
balanced on each seat bone. Now leaning off
to one side or leaning to the other, we are

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:28.520
keeping our shoulders really nice and square.
Keeping our elbows bent and one our side.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.680
Our hands are a few inches above the horse
wither, our fingers are closed but they are

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.729
nice and supple. They are not too ridged pulling
on her. We don't want to pull her back up

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.000
in her, we don't also want to let her too
loose and let her arms kind of bounce out

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.880
like this so we are keeping our reins nice
and loose. We are keeping our hands nice and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.320
soft. Soft hands make soft mouths and we are
using mostly our legs; we are not using a

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.189
lot of rein pressure. We are using our leg
to steer where we want to go, looking where

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.340
we want to go and keeping our posture. So
that is how you want to move from the walk

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.069
into the trot.
