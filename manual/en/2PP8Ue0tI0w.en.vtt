00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.490
Let me tell you something.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.449
There are few games I think as highly of as
Donkey Kong Country.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.890
That game is incredible.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.660
In fact, as much as people like it, I think
it might be under-rated.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.170
It’s so good, it’s even better than its
legacy.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.050
I mean, you can play that game now, and it’s
still better than just about every other 2D

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.090
platformer out there.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.250
Like, to this day.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.980
Donkey Kong Country isn’t great because
of nostalgia.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.129
It’s great because you can pick it up today,
and still be blown away.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.739
It’s still playable, still gorgeous, still
great.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.380
This game’s not as playable, or gorgeous,
or great.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.250
I know it says “Donkey Kong Country,”
I know it looks like Donkey Kong Country…kind

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.250
of…

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.299
But this isn’t Donkey Kong Country.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:09.189
More Donkey Kong Nice-try.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:24.819
So I went back and read some of the reviews
this thing got when it released, back in the

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:31.079
year 2000…and it seems like the consensus
was basically, “Wow, look how close they

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.289
got to Donkey Kong Country on a handheld.”

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.549
Like, that’s what blew people away, the
tech side of it.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.039
And even though they were well aware of the
game’s many, many problems…

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.450
They were still like, “OMG, the graphics.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.450
9.1.”

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.399
Actually, no one said “OMG” back then.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.639
And apparently, no one remembered what made
Donkey Kong Country so good.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.880
‘Cause it wasn’t the graphics.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.369
Or…not just the graphics.

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.619
This one’s just the graphics.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.979
So if you’ve never played Donkey Kong Country,
listen…I’m not one of those people who

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.539
says, “Oh, you have to play this game.”

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.260
But seriously, you have to play that game.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.580
If you have a Super Nintendo, get it.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.630
If you don’t, it’s on the eShop, get it.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.890
Seriously, it might be the best platformer
on the Super Nintendo, and that system had

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.950
some pretty serious platformers.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.780
But anyway, it was the game that resurrected
the dormant Donkey Kong franchise, it was

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.400
groundbreaking for its pseudo-3D graphics,
it played like a million bucks.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.710
Or bananas…

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.610
Speaking of which, that’s what it’s about.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.310
A bunch of jerk-off bad guys have stolen Donkey
Kong’s bananas, and he searches the island

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.310
to get ‘em back.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.020
It’s that same old run-and-jump template,
obviously…but Donkey Kong Country puts its

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.020
own spin on it.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.580
The gameplay has a bouncy, rhythmic quality
that really separates it from other platformers.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.350
I mean, Super Mario World, Yoshi’s Island…

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.900
They have the praise.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:12.480
Donkey Kong Country has the groove.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.840
Of course, that all applies to the original,
to the Super Nintendo game.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.400
The game this game claims to be a port of.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.450
It’s only kind of is.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:29.510
I mean, I have played Donkey Kong Country
so many times, I could play these levels blindfolded.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.800
These are not the same levels.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.410
A lot of them have been reworked, and even
though it’s subtle, it’s pretty jarring

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.570
if you know the game.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.270
I mean, Winky’s Walkway is one of my favorite
levels in any platformer, ever.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.260
This is not the Winky’s Walkway I remember.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.150
This is, like…it’s like imitation candy,
you know?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.150
The off-brand stuff.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.590
It looks like the good stuff…then you bite
it, and it tastes like what you paid for.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.680
A lesser version that just isn’t that good.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:12.840
But you know, the biggest problem here…is
the gameplay.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.570
I mean, Donkey Kong Country, to this day,
plays incredibly tight and smooth.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.780
This version is neither of those things.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.790
Like, as soon as you take control of Donkey
Kong, you know right away something’s not

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.790
right.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.009
It’s slow, it’s stiff…and actually,
what’s even worse is that you can’t see

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.009
a goddamn thing.

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.260
See, because they wanted this to look like
the original as much as possible, they used

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.540
this zoomed-in perspective, for more detailed
sprites.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.680
Unfortunately, that means your visibility
is horrendous, especially in the mine cart

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680
levels.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.220
You don’t see things until you hit things.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.530
Actually, I wish I hadn’t seen these minigames.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.000
Donkey Kong Country didn’t need minigames.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Let alone bad minigames.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.560
Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.570
I mean, the only reason people seemed to freak
out over this game, is that it’s this game,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.570
on a handheld.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.310
Wow, isn’t it amazing that such a thing
could exist, hooray for technology!

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.070
But after the novelty wears off, what does
it leave you with?

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.300
Like, today…this is just a frustrating,
outdated take…on a game that, even in its

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.360
much older form…still doesn’t feel frustrating
or outdated.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.830
Maybe 15 years ago, it was cool.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.130
But Donkey Kong Country for the Game Boy Color…

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.660
It was never that good.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.569
Breaks my heart to say that, you guys.
