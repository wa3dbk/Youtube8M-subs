&gt;&gt; Jim Farrington: I'm out here already. Oh
baby. Oh sweetheart. This procedure has changed

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.290
my life because I can do things that I couldn't
do before [music]. Good girl Molly. You're

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.620
a good girl. Yes you are. Before the surgery,
I couldn't walk very fast. I walked the dogs

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.620
I have to the end of the street to get the
mail. I'd have to stop every 15, 20 seconds

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.030
to catch my breath. And I said, this is not
right. I've got to have this corrected.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.530
&gt;&gt; David Butzel, MD: The diagnosis is called
aortic valve stenosis. So in a normal when

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.530
the heart squeezes, the valve starts closed
and it opens wide. Through time, those valves

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.680
scar down; they start to fail. And so when
the heart squeezes, instead of the valve starting

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.239
closed and opening wide, it starts closed
and opens just a little bit. That makes it

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.999
really hard for the heart to squeeze blood
through it to the body. And pressure backs

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:11.310
up into the lungs, and people typically present,
feeling very short of breath or with chest

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.600
pain.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.939
&gt;&gt; Jim Farrington: Oh Max, you big scaredy
cat. They couldn't do open heart because I

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.630
had open heart surgery back in 2004. If they
had to open my heart again, I would be in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.490
there for a month [background conversations].

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.969
&gt;&gt; David Butzel, MD: TAVR is a new procedure.
It's been designed for patients who are too

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.849
sick to go through a traditional open heart
valve replacement. So what's been developed

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.049
is another way to give them a new valve. And
what is actually performed is that a valve

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.630
is placed inside a stent, which is a coiled,
metal tube. And that stent is advanced from

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.749
the leg artery, all the way up backwards through
the aorta to the heart. And it's put inside

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:58.579
the old valve by deploying the stent. We're
very lucky because our heart surgeons and

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.969
our cardiologists all work together. Our incentives
are very much so aligned, where we want to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:11.670
bring new technologies to the hospital. And
we're able to do that in a cooperative way.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.170
&gt;&gt; Jim Farrington: Get a picture of that.
My wife wants it. See that sticker? I was

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.890
just at I think out I think on three days
later. And it was great. I mean I couldn't

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.560
wait to come home and see my little dogs.
Oh she's such a beautiful girl. I feel a lot

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.560
better now. I can breathe. I'm an independent
guy anyway. I always was. So yeah, it's great

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.170
to be back on track. Start and enjoy life
again.
