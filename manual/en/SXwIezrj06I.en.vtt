00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.580
Hey Dreamers!

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.820
Question:

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.060
What do you get when you mix Inside Out and classic Disney characters?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.860
Answer:

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.580
A very emotional Rundown.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.460
So, we're all obsessed with Inside Out, right?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.460
And of course, we love all of our throwback Disney characters, too.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.660
So, let's check out which classic Disney characters are most like Inside Out's five emotions.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.600
Get ready for all the feels!

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.440
First up: Sadness.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.320
Pretty much all Disney movies have at least one majorly-sad moment.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.620
Like Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Up, Bambi, and Dumbo.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.740
Just to name a few.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.260
But... Who's most in sync with Sadness from Inside Out?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.920
We're gonna say Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.300
Here's a side by side!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.780
Aw, so sad!

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.360
What do you guys think? Are Eeyore and Sadness a match?

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.500
Tell us in the comments!

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Next emotion: Disgust.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.700
Okay, so Disgust is actually totally lovable in Inside Out!

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.260
So this next match might be controversial.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.860
But we're gonna go with the Stepsisters from Cinderella.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.080
I mean, look at these faces...

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.840
Think Disgust would agree?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.440
[gagging noise]

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.980
....Maybe not.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.100
Moving on... Let's tackle fear!

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.360
There are a couple characters who fit the scaredy-cat profile.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.540
Sebastian from The Little Mermaid had his panicky moments.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.620
He even kind of looks like fear!

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.260
The best match HAS to be Panic from Hercules!

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.700
Oh! I-I'm sorry!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.420
I can handle this!!

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.620
[grunting]

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.260
[yelling]

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.460
They also look alike!

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.380
It's those big, googly eyes!

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400
Okay, next up, Anger.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.560
Everybody gets mad from time to time, and that includes Disney characters.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.120
Here are a few picks for Anger's doppelanger.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.120
[Chuckles] Dopple-ANGER

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.440
I got it...

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.500
First, there's this.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.780
WHAT?! The Fates are here and you didn't tell me?!

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.340
And finally, this face.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.180
Okay, maybe that's more insanity than anger...

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.480
And our last emotion... Joy!!

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.120
The feeling we get the most from Disney movies.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.120
Joy's classic Disney character match HAS to be Happy from Snow White!

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.340
I mean... his name IS Happy!

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.180
But really, every Disney movie has a happy ending!

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.280
So, let's do a tribute to our favorite moments of Disney joy!

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.300
[singing] Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.780
[yodeling]

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.020
Genie... You're free!

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.460
We can fly!

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.420
You can fly!

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.340
We can fly!!

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:20.900
[singing] That's when my life begins!

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.440
Now, doesn't that make you happy?

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.440
Okay, fan poll time!

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.860
Which classic Disney character moment do YOU think is most joyous?

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.800
Rapunzel when she gets out of the tower?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.720
Or, the moment Beast turns into a prince? Tell us!
