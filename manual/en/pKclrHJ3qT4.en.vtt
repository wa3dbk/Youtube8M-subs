00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.061
Famous linguist Eugene Nida,

00:00:02.061 --> 00:00:07.482
considered the “father” of over
200 translations in multiple languages,

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.429
including Spanish and English, said

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:15.849
"As long as all people had the
King James Version, they didn't think.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.573
It's terribly important
to have different translations

00:00:19.573 --> 00:00:23.159
to get a good argument started."

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:26.059
Is that what we need? An argument?

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.924
Hi, I’m David Daniels
from Chick Publications.

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:33.764
What did Nida mean by
“they didn’t think”?

00:00:33.764 --> 00:00:38.994
If he meant, “They didn’t doubt
the basic doctrines of the Bible,”

00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:44.025
that “they accepted them by faith,”
then I think that it’s a good thing

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:47.406
that they all had the King James Bible.

00:00:47.406 --> 00:00:52.919
Look where we are today.
We have an oversupply of Bible versions.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:57.310
Each one has its own pet
doctrines and its own pet phrases,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.275
and its own decisions as to
what words to take out or add in.

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:10.131
So along with an oversupply of Bibles, we now have an oversupply of doubt.

00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:12.706
If you want to have an argument,
and one side is telling the truth,

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:17.513
and the other side is not,
then the only way to “compromise”

00:01:17.513 --> 00:01:22.630
is for the side telling the
truth to STOP –and start telling lies.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.742
Then they can both compromise
by both sides telling half-truths,

00:01:27.742 --> 00:01:33.901
which are half-lies,
which are in reality... lies.

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:40.800
Do we really want an argument?
Or do we want an agreement?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.204
God said through the apostle Paul
in 2 Corinthians 6:16,

00:01:46.204 --> 00:01:51.049
16 “And what agreement hath
the temple of God with idols?...”

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.516
What is an idol? It’s a man-made thing
that is claimed to be a god

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.500
or to represent their god.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.139
And what are modern Bible versions?

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:09.381
They are a man-made thing that is
claimed to represent the word of God.

00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:12.148
Sounds a lot like an idol.

00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:19.860
No wonder we can’t find agreement between
the King James and the modern versions.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.465
I don’t know about you,
but I want to have an agreement,

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:29.833
first with God and His holy
words, and second with God's people,

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:32.091
who believe His holy words.

00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:35.438
I have said it before: I may not
understand every word of this Bible,

00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:37.624
but I believe every word of this Bible.

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:41.782
I hope you do, too.
If so, we’ll have an agreement.

00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:45.687
And I think that’s a good thing.

00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:48.768
God bless you, and have a wonderful day.
