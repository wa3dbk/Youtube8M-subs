00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.101
- Yo!

00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.402
Today we're making,

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.027
The New York Sour!

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:04.840
Yay!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.322
- I didn't tell you to say "Yo", okay?

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:08.795
(laughs)
Gangsta ass.

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:12.206
That's right go ahead, go
ahead Jess, go 'head, twerk it!

00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:14.461
Bourbon, pour!

00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:16.610
Stop!
(Cecilia laughs)

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.032
Don't go too hard, girl.

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:20.166
Jessica, simple syrup!

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.542
Ooh, ooh!
(Cecilia screams)

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:26.818
(laughs)
(Jessica screams)

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.408
- Skyy!

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:29.586
- [Skyy] Okay, stay there,
stay there, stay there,

00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:31.069
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.531
- Oh my God!

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.772
This just happened.

00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:35.397
- It's going in my belly right now!

00:00:35.397 --> 00:00:37.063
- [Skyy] I know, it's
simple sugar, it's sweet,

00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:38.566
and you're sweet like sugar, okay?

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.765
Goddamn.
- [Jessica] Hey!

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:41.329
(Cecilia laughs)
Gimme this, I got this.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.889
- Okay.
- [Jessica] It's all sticky!

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:45.210
- Hey, yeah, I know, I know.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.815
Look, when you all signed on for this job,

00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:49.253
I told you there were
certain work hazards, okay?

00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:51.219
(laughs)

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.723
I'm gonna just set this
here nice and easy, okay?

00:00:53.723 --> 00:00:55.592
And you can just go
ahead and do like that,

00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:57.091
squeeze it in.

00:00:57.136 --> 00:00:58.599
Let Jess do it, you know?

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:00.110
I just feel guilty because... (laughs)

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.482
- [Jessica] Oh, so you're gonna make me

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.294
look stupid, 'cause I can't do it?

00:01:03.294 --> 00:01:05.021
- Okay, you wanna let Cecilia do it then?

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:06.276
No you got it, you got it!
- [Cecilia] Oh!

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:07.403
- [Skyy] You got it, yeah!

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:09.710
Like a little baby
urinating, but it's there!

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.595
Girls, one day, we're
gonna look back at this,

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:16.239
and we're going to
laugh as a family, okay?

00:01:17.198 --> 00:01:19.169
Shake it and keep it sexy as two of you--

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:20.952
Y'all figure it out.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.822
Jess, take a turn, go ahead!

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.644
Act like you wanna be here! (laughs)

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:33.637
I know you're sticky, but (laughs)

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:41.240
Right there, that's good, perfect!

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.130
Jess, on that and open it.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.873
Man up!

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:44.564
(pop)

00:01:44.564 --> 00:01:45.530
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.112
Put this in there.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.318
Cecilia, rest this spoon on top!

00:01:53.456 --> 00:01:56.571
Pour that on the spoon, go ahead.

00:01:57.124 --> 00:01:59.131
Nice and slow.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:01.434
Okay, just like that, just like that.

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:03.872
Keep going.
- [Jessica] Ooh.

00:02:03.872 --> 00:02:04.980
- [Skyy] Keep going.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.657
Oh, look how sexy that look,
me love you long time, yes!

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:11.290
Only 50 dollar, okay good, perfect.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.337
Excellent!
- [Cecilia] Woah!

00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:13.760
- [Skyy] Tell me that ain't sexy,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.477
tell me that ain't badass, huh?

00:02:15.477 --> 00:02:17.733
Wasn't it worth gettin' all
soaked up in sugar, huh?

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.074
- Yeah.
(Cecilia laughs)

00:02:19.074 --> 00:02:20.211
- [Skyy] And there you have it!

00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:22.568
The New York Sour!

00:02:22.568 --> 00:02:25.900
Okay, girls, here's the
technique for this, okay?

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.769
Because if you drink from the
top, you just have red wine.

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.117
So once you suck from the
bottom, and go up, okay?

00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:33.539
Not sexually!

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.695
Just take a little sip, little pips, okay?

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:39.133
(laughs)

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.684
- I feel like,

00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:44.382
I would like this drink more
if it didn't have the red wine.

00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:46.657
- Suck it from the bottom
to the top Skyy, remember!

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:47.518
(Cecilia laughs)

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:49.262
(Jessica mumbles)

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.886
- I don't know dude, the
aftertaste of the red wine,

00:02:52.134 --> 00:02:54.085
that kinda works, though!
- [Cecilia] Yeah?

00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:56.575
- Yeah, 'cause if you're not
like a big Whiskey drinker,

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:59.669
and you suck from the bottom,
(all laugh)

00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:02.399
♫ Started from the bottom ♫

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.903
- and you go all the way up the shaft,

00:03:03.903 --> 00:03:06.388
you get like this nice (laughs)

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.745
- [Cecilia] Shaft?

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:09.878
The bottom bit is like, delicious, like,

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:11.219
I would drink that all day.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.718
- Jessica, I want you to know that I feel,

00:03:13.718 --> 00:03:15.486
super sorry about what happened to you.

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:16.745
- Sure, yeah.
- [Skyy] Okay?

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:19.346
- Let's just re-live that
moment for a quick second!

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:20.829
Simple syrup!

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.587
Ooh, ooh!
(Cecilia Screams)

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.382
(Skyy laughs)

00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:28.369
- The glass is hot, right?

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:29.791
So when you pick up the
glass, you go "Ooh!"

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:30.473
and it spills.

00:03:30.473 --> 00:03:32.423
- What if you actually got
the liquid in your mouth,

00:03:32.423 --> 00:03:34.272
Would it be because
all of this is alcohol,

00:03:34.272 --> 00:03:36.141
it would like, make a
fireball in your stomach?

00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:38.348
- No, no no no, because
the, the pieces on the back,

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:40.135
will put the pieces in the front out.

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:41.618
- How confident are you?

00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:42.614
- I'm pretty frickin confident.

00:03:42.614 --> 00:03:43.166
- Well let's try!
