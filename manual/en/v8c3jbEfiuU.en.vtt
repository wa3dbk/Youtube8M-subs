Career Counselor: This episode of Capella
University's Extreme Makeover: Interview edition

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.980
is focused on the importance of following
up after an interview. Our job candidate,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.250
Melody, recently had an interview, and hasn't
heard back from the employer yet. She's not

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.250
sure how to move forward:

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.990
Melody: Erin, thanks so much for meeting me
for coffee today. The job search has been

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.960
really stressful. I definitely needed a break.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.490
Erin: Yeah. How'd your interview go last week?

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.750
Melody: Well, I think it went really well.
Sharon, the person who interviewed me, seemed

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.460
to be really happy with the responses I gave
her. And the job seemed like it would be a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.460
perfect fit.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.460
Erin: Oh, that's great to hear that.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.190
Melody: Yeah, it is great, but the only bad
news is that I haven't heard anything yet.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.820
She said she'd call me by the end of the week
and it's Friday afternoon already. I'm getting

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.261
really stressed out that I haven't heard from
her.

00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:51.070
Erin: Yeah, that is super frustrating. Have
you called to check-in?

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.980
Melody: No, I mean, I got her card but she
said she was going to call me. And I really

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010
didn't want her to think I was stalking her
or anything.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.790
Erin: Yeah, you know I thought that too when
I went for my last interview, but I talked

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.360
to a Career Counselor at Capella and she really
encouraged me to follow up. She said, if I

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.370
called it would show that I was excited about
the position and I had taken initiative. It

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.350
would also give me a chance to check-in and
tell her again why I was such a great fit

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.350
for the position.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.190
Melody: So you did call, I assume, how did
it go?

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.940
Erin: Yep, I called and the hiring manager
was really happy I called. She said she had

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.540
a ton of high stress things going on that
week and hadn't had a chance to follow up

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.460
and she ended up scheduling a second interview
with me. And I ended up getting the job.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.400
Melody: Wow, that's great! Yeah, I don't think
I've heard that story before, but it makes

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.850
a lot of sense. HR [Human Resources] people
do have a lot going on.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.250
Erin: Yeah, they do.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.920
Melody: Well thanks so much for the tip, I
really appreciate it.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.920
Erin: Yeah, no problem.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920
Melody: Enough about me, how are things with
you?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920
Erin: Oh, they're going really great.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.650
Melody: [on the phone] Hello, may I speak
with Sharon Jackson please. Hello, Sharon?

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.500
This is Melody Cane. I interviewed for the
Project Manager position last week. I was

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.250
just calling to see where you were in the
hiring process for that position. Ah huh.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.120
Yes. Oh sure, that's great, I'd love to come
in for a second interview! I'm very interested

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.010
in this position and I'm looking forward to
meeting with the others on the team, and sharing

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.110
with them how my past project management experience
can benefit your organization. Let me see.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.580
Next Thursday at one? Yes, that would work
great. Thanks so much! I'll see you then.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.630
Erin? Hi, it's Melody. I followed up with
that employer that I talked with you about

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.310
last week, and I have a second interview with
them next Thursday! Thank you so much for

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.660
the information and the advice about how to
follow up. I'm so glad I called them.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.069
Career Counselor: This was a great example
of why following up with employers is so important.

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.810
Often the hiring process is just one priority
among many, and they can be slow to respond

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.200
to job candidates. Rather than stress out
while waiting for an employer to call, reach

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.620
out to them after an appropriate period of
time and see where they are in the process.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.160
Taking the initiative to contact the employer
often leaves a positive impression, and gives

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.510
you an additional point of contact with the
employer. Additionally, learning the outcome

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.230
of an interview process of which you are a
part – regardless of whether the outcome

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.319
is what you wanted or not – is better than
playing a stressful waiting game. The Capella

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.180
University Career Center hopes that this tip
makes a difference in your next interview.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.360
Stay tuned for more tips and good luck!
