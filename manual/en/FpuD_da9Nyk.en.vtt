00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.529
" My name is Irene Grossubatcher, I'm the
technician in the frank lab, and we're here

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.999
at the UCSF admission bay in the center of
interpretive neuroscience.

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:31.890
In this lab, we study learning and how information
that we have in our brain can be used to pick

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.850
and make decisions and to behave.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.089
Specifically we study hippocampus.

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:43.370
Hippocampus is a site that is important for
especially episodic memory, for remembering

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.710
facts and things about us.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.640
It's the first structure that is affected
by Alzheimer's disease, for example, and there

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.280
are some other neurodegenerative diseases
so we are trying to find out what does hippocampus

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.150
do to basically encode and store memories.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.970
Knowing that, we can probably have like, what
happens when the hippocampus doesn't function

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.649
that well anymore.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.829
I grew up in a small town in Italy, my parents
are pharmacists.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.829
I come out of a family of pharmacists.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.740
My grandpa is a pharmacist, all my siblings,
all my uncles.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.189
Everyone, and I am a pharmacist too.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.540
I really like that job.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.620
It's a very interesting job in Italy, but
in my last year, I came here to San Francisco

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.940
to do my Master thesis research in neuroscience,
and I found out that I just really love to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.830
think about the brain and how it works, so
I decided to stay here and take a job here

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.590
and continue in this field.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.830
Right now I'm working on a project, I'm trying
to record from a very tiny area in the brain,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.330
and hippocampus at the same time, to see how
the small area modulates hippocampus functioning.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.270
It's very difficult and we have just done
our first experiment.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.540
Looking at this, and we have come very close.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.810
We have not quite make it to target this way,
but we have come very close.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.729
I believe that next time, I'm preparing these
new drives to like, try it again, and I believe

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.369
we're going to make it, and it's going to
then be very good.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.480
I mostly like learning a lot, how we are able
to learn new things.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.840
I also like motivation.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.739
Either we are motivated for something, either
we are not.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.480
Often times it's out of our control.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.550
If we are motivated, we are able to do so
much more than we can if we're not.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.910
Like, our performance goes up so much, and
we're interested in finding out like, how

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.100
that happens, and why it happens, can we not
control this.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.840
If we would always be motivated, it would
be so much easier.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.690
We would be able to perform so much better.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.620
These are the two things that fascinate me
most about the brain.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.310
I'm every day very excited about coming into
the lab, because working in a lab is not only

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.950
working on your own experiments, but it's
also seeing what the people that are around

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.600
you do, so every day exciting things happen.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.630
Obviously it's most exciting if I'm running
an experiment and like, taking data and reading

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.510
and finding out stuff, but every day is exciting
because you can every day learn something

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.380
new, or use something exciting.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.989
Everyone in here is doing cutting-edge research,
is doing things that no one has ever done

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.870
before, and so it can always happen that you
learn something new.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.850
It's very exciting.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.239
I think the research that we do here, it is
basic research, it asks questions about how

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:35.569
the brain learns and how it encodes and stores
memories, so it is very basic, but again,

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.440
only finding out how that works, we have to
be able to cure diseases where we have impairments

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.250
in learning and storing memories.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.470
It really has an impact a little bit on the
learner's side, because we don't try to like,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.720
develop treatments right here, but without
a basic understanding of how the brain works,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.140
we are not going to be able to find treatment,
so it's very important, I think.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.421
I think everyone can go into science.

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:06.930
Obviously, science is so broad, there are
so many facets of it, and I bet there is something

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.930
for everyone.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.110
Everyone can do something as soon as there's
something that really grabs their interest.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.860
People are going to get into it.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.860
They're going to be able to do it.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.540
If there's a will, there's a way.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:44.719
You have to always believe that you can, and
you can if you want to.

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:45.719
