00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:02.363
- Hey everyone, how’s it going?

00:00:02.365 --> 00:00:05.158
So today’s DIY we are going to make some

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.660
drawstring backpacks.

00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:09.996
Today I will be using a non-sew method

00:00:09.998 --> 00:00:12.831
which is perfect for those
of you guys who don’t

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.085
have a sewing machine,
don’t know how to sew,

00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:17.128
or is a little sewing challenged.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.296
Or, you know, if you have a sewing machine

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:20.923
you can take your sewing machine out too

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:23.218
and make this project as well.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.386
So this is for everyone.

00:00:25.388 --> 00:00:28.306
I love these little backpacks
because I can take them

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:30.600
to the gym with me, I
can take them for a hike,

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:33.520
and it’s just lightweight and easy to use.

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:35.980
So these are perfect to take with me

00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:38.106
to yoga class and hiking.

00:00:38.108 --> 00:00:40.193
So let’s go ahead and get into it.

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:42.028
To make this you will need fabric.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.030
I’m using a heavy-duty canvas material

00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:46.700
that someone gave me
a long, long time ago,

00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:48.535
and now I can finally make use of it.

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:50.870
You will need some cord, drawstring locks,

00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:52.288
and fabric glue.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.415
First step is to lay out your fabric

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:56.793
with the wrong sides
out and fold it in half.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:59.211
Then draw an 18” x 18” square.

00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:01.255
Go ahead and cut it out.

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:04.340
Now open up your fabric with
the wrong sides facing upward

00:01:04.343 --> 00:01:08.011
at you and press in about half an inch

00:01:08.013 --> 00:01:10.681
of the raw edge, just like
what I’m doing right here.

00:01:10.683 --> 00:01:12.058
This is a step we have to do so that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.101
way we can glue down the raw edges

00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:17.855
and prevent the fabric from
fraying or coming apart.

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:20.066
Now fold the fabric back
in half with the wrong side

00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:22.568
facing outward at you, take some pins

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.570
to hold the folds in place.

00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:27.865
Now for the opening, which
is parallel from your fold,

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.201
you’re going to press down one inch.

00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:31.326
Just like so.

00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:33.998
And make sure to do the
same on the other side.

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:38.960
Now with your fabric glue,
glue what you pressed down

00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:40.711
earlier on the sides.

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:43.088
This will definitely prevent the material

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.091
from fraying and coming apart.

00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:47.426
And make sure not to
glue the opening part,

00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:49.303
which is parallel from your fold.

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:52.431
At the opening, it’s
time to place your cord

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:56.226
in between the one inch
fold that we made earlier.

00:01:56.228 --> 00:01:59.188
Place the glue along
the edge and make sure

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.066
the cord is close to that fold line,

00:02:02.068 --> 00:02:05.195
then press it down just like so.

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:08.008
Make sure to repeat the
same step on the other side.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.283
We are down to the last few steps.

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:13.786
All you have to do now is insert the locks

00:02:13.788 --> 00:02:16.496
to the strings on the sides.

00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:18.291
Just like how I have it right here.

00:02:18.293 --> 00:02:20.710
Because we are doing the non-sew method,

00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:24.296
with the loose ends tie
them together like so.

00:02:24.298 --> 00:02:26.173
This will also make it adjustable,

00:02:26.175 --> 00:02:28.718
just in case if you
find this to be too long

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.220
or too short, you can always adjust this

00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:32.971
by loosening the knots.

00:02:32.973 --> 00:02:35.600
It is now time to close our bag together,

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.728
so place some glue along the edges

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.815
on each side of the bag.

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:44.775
Carefully press the sides down

00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:49.738
and let this set for
a good couple of hours

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.198
before using it.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.283
Okay, I’m going to draw a mandala

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:55.370
and what a mandala stands for is

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:58.331
the universe, so I just love mandala art.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.583
They’re so beautiful to look at,

00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:03.126
and the patterns are just so intricate.

00:03:03.128 --> 00:03:05.130
So I’m making my own little version.

00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:07.256
I looked at some pictures online,

00:03:07.258 --> 00:03:09.341
and it kind of inspired me to make

00:03:09.343 --> 00:03:11.093
my own little version of this.

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:12.886
So this is what I’m doing today.

00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:15.515
I’m adding some glue and
some gold glitter to this.

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:18.726
Another fun and easy artwork to do is to

00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:22.271
do a color splash on your canvas bag.

00:03:22.273 --> 00:03:25.108
After the paint dries,
with a pencil I just

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.403
drew in some arrows, and
this is very simple to do.

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:30.571
They’re so cute to look at.

00:03:30.573 --> 00:03:33.031
Then I added in some text, which says,

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:34.700
“Follow your path.”

00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:36.243
I like to go hiking so I’m thinking about

00:03:36.245 --> 00:03:38.996
bringing this little drawstring
backpack with me, which

00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:42.541
goes with the theme “follow
your path,” but at the same time

00:03:42.543 --> 00:03:45.878
“follow your path” to me
is focusing on yourself,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.506
doing you only, and nobody else.

00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:51.926
Like, don’t focus on what
other people are doing,

00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:55.555
don’t compare yourself,
just believe in yourself

00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:57.515
and believe in your goals,

00:03:57.516 --> 00:04:00.726
and follow that path which belongs to you.

00:04:00.728 --> 00:04:05.150
(playful music)

00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:15.825
Alright everyone, that’s it for today.

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:17.576
Thank you so much for watching!

00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:19.452
If you enjoyed this
video then don’t forget

00:04:19.454 --> 00:04:21.120
to give a thumb’s up.

00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:22.998
I would really, really appreciate it,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.168
and let me know which artwork you guys

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.753
liked below, and if you will be sewing

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:29.546
or if you not be sewing.

00:04:29.548 --> 00:04:33.383
This will really help
me in making more DIYs.

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:35.010
Like if I know you guys want to sew more

00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:37.930
then I would do more sewing
DIYs, and if you guys,

00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:39.723
and if I know that most
of you guys don’t have

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:42.018
a sewing machine then I will stick to

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.936
no-sew methods and
things like that, because

00:04:44.938 --> 00:04:48.106
I want everybody to
enjoy, like, these DIYs.

00:04:48.108 --> 00:04:50.318
