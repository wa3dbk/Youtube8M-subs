00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.569
Alright, Michael Raines at Expert Village.
Now, we're moving on with our experiment.

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.330
We've basically put our containers together.
Now we have to talk about the solution. The

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.420
aqueous solution, which is water. Now, yes,
we use ordinary water, but it's going to be

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.109
distilled water. Regular tap water doesn't
cut it. Too many impurities in the water.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.099
Now, what is an electrolyte? Well, let me
show you. I'm going to scoot this over. And

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:37.660
I grab some chemicals. Here's one, Potassium
Carbonate. Here's another nasty one, Lye,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.820
bad stuff. And Baking Soda. Just the regular
Baking Soda stuff. Now, you say that's an

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.519
electrolyte? Yes, these are electrolytes.
It's a chemical in the water that promotes

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:58.499
current flow from negative to positive. Regular
water that's distilled or purified won't have

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:05.280
much of an electric current flow. It needs
to have an electrolyte in the solution. Now

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.360
Lye, horrible stuff. Great electrolyte. Poisonous,
a caustic, terrible stuff. I don't even know

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.820
why I tried it. It works. Bad stuff to use,
because if you had a spill it's going to eat

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.020
your hands off. It will. Do you know what
this stuff was used for? Drain opener. It's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:33.610
horrible stuff. Don't use it. You'll see it,
don't use it. Now, Potassium Carbonate. Not

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.490
such a deadly chemical. But it's hard to get.
It is a specialized chemical. Still a great

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.180
electrolyte. A lot safer. In fact, very safe.
But still, do you know where to get Potassium

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.049
Carbonate? I don't, I had to order it. Now,
baking soda. Everybody's got some. Why baking

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.469
soda? Because it works as an electrolyte.
Yes, all we have to do is add a little bit

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:08.090
of baking soda to the water and it's not ordinary
water. It's distilled drinking water. Yes,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.330
distilled water is what we're going to use.
We're going to use a little baking soda and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.670
it's going to work. Now, why distilled water
again? Well you know that the regular water,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.150
tap water has impurities. You can use rainwater
if you want to collect rainwater and go to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.260
all that trouble, but just go to the store
and get some distilled water will you? Now,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.670
we're going to put it together, but you'll
have to wait until the next clip.
