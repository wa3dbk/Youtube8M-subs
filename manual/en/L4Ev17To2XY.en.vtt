00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.100
There's an app for everything. Can someone just make an app

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.350
that sucks the fat right out of you?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.680
Hi everyone I'm Rob and this is on the cheap tip!

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.020
Now summer is right around the corner,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.100
and everyone is looking to lose weight fast.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.380
I mean, we're going to be wearing a lot less clothing

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.220
I wanna look like the hot guy in the pool loungin on the tube

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.220
not just look like the tube.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.900
So recently a friend of mine a fellow youtuber Ms. Yanny

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.960
told me about this military diet.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.660
Where you can lose 10 pounds in 3days!

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.600
Yeah you heard me right, 10 pounds.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.620
So basically you're supposed to follow a specific meal plan

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.880
for 3 days and

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.400
the combination of foods are supposed to work together

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.200
to help you burn fat and lose weight.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.420
Now I know what you're thinking,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.620
there is just just no way and I am just as sceptical as you are.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.940
So I went to a trainer to ask them specifically

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.200
if this would work and they confirmed

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.860
that, yes it can work cause because the foods

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.840
that you're eating filling but low in calorie.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.560
Now I've decided that I'm not only going to show you how to do this diet

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.680
but I'm crazy enough to act as your guinea pig and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.089
do this meal plan for the next three days to prove if it actually even works, but hey

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.640
I can stand to lose a couple of pounds. So let's get started. Follow me on my journey

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.060
Mm-hmm. The first thing that you need to do is weigh yourself in the morning of the first day that you are starting

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060
All right. I'm about to weigh myself. Oh-oops

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.390
I was just off the scale cuz I'm so fat and the grand total is

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.200
157.6 lbs (71.4 kg) you've done that you're just going to follow the meal plan and here it is

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.900
Good morning, I have boogers in my eyes

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.780
This is breakfast day 1 and what I'm eating is a half a grapefruit

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.760
One slice of toast (whole wheat is best) with two tablespoons of peanut butter and one cup of coffee, no sugar

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.460
No anything, it's black, and I don't even like coffee and I'm about do drink it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.760
It's not that bad. It's a little strong. I'm definitely going to be awake after this. You could also have a bottled water handy

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.220
I don't normally eat grapefruits. I don't know how to eat it. What do you do?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.100
Okay, this is not working for me. I'm not trying to be fancy anymore with this thing. Okay, this is good

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.120
mmm

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.160
Not bad breakfast so far

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.580
It's lunchtime

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.720
And I'm eating a half a cup of tuna,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.760
one slice of whole wheat toast,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.480
and one cup of coffee

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.980
Also, you can have water too. Now I do have to admit

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.719
I have never eaten tuna fish before

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.980
I don't like it this smells so bad to me

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.740
and I'm terrified of gagging. Oh my god

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.320
I don't know if I want to do this.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.740
My eyes are watering a little bit.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.440
You can see how scared I am of food

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.680
Like why am I scared of this?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.760
I'm just gonna put it in

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.940
It wasn't that bad. It's a little fishy.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.260
Sort of tastes like chicken with a fishy aftertaste.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.060
Maybe I should eat it with the toast.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.200
I was just gonna heat it up and put some cheese on it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.140
Don't like that. I feel like I'm gonna throw up

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.440
My gagged on that one.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.440
It's [like] chicken, that's it. Just chicken.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.640
Okay, I did it I'm done and that's only day one

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.649
It's dinner time and what I got today is three ounces of a meat of your choice

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.179
One cup of green beans a half a banana one small Apple. I have one cup of vanilla ice cream

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.489
I'm going to enjoy the hell out of this. So this is everything that I would eat already

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.239
So I'm not really having a problem

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.120
You don't really need to watch me eat

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.240
Day two and I'm eating one egg cooked anyway you like

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.300
the half of a banana and a slice of whole wheat toast and don't be making fun of my egg

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.929
I know it's jacked up with having boiled an egg know by now. This is something that I would eat normally

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.340
It's just delicious

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.030
All right

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.079
It's lunch time, day two, and I'm eating one hard-boiled egg

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.220
Five saltine crackers and the dreaded one cup of cottage cheese. I'm not excited about this one

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.679
I don't usually eat cottage cheese. That's the one thing I'm kind of worried about them smell too bad

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.160
I wonder if I spread it with a crack or maybe it'll be a little bit easier to eat. Why is it lumpy? I

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600
Don't like the texture

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.859
That grosses me out a little bit. The taste isn't bad though. With the crackers

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.850
I don't even really taste it just tastes like cream cheese. I mean will I eat this every day?

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.460
Know about that

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.840
it's dinnertime and I'm eating two hot dogs, no bun

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.780
a half cup of carrots one cup of broccoli

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.320
half banana

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.890
and

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.999
a half a cup of vanilla ice cream not a cup like we had last time I have to tell you the thing that I'm

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.589
the most excited to eat today is the hotdog when I first heard of this I was like

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.160
I'm not gonna want a hotdog, like, that's not something I've been craving

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.169
I've been craving it all day, especially after eating that cottage cheese. It took me an hour to eat

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.019
So this I'm gonna make love to it. I love all the stuff so I'm gonna go fucking eat. I just woke up

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.020
Good morning breath and all it's breakfast day three and I'm eating one small Apple

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.159
five saltine crackers and a slice of cheddar cheese

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.879
Yes, just a slice. This is a very small breakfast. At this one I'm a little bit over this diet

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.969
Today's the day that I eat the least but on top of that I have to eat tuna fish again for dinner

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.040
And I'm really not looking forward to that

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.769
I mean it'll be worth that in the end if I actually lose the weight, so I'm praying that that actually happens

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.130
It's lunchtime and I'm eating one slice of whole wheat toast and one egg cooked any way you like

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.040
So much food. What am I gonna do

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.099
Again, I like everything I'm eating but it's just I don't know if this is enough to get me through till dinnertime

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.799
I'm a big boy. I gotta get some food in me

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.940
I'm gonna eat it slow and to make it last

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.040
Hey it's dinner time the meal that I've been dreading all day

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.859
And I'm eating a cup of tuna fish a half a banana and cup of vanilla ice cream

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.479
I had to prepare the tuna a different way because I just wouldn't be able to down it and this is

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.459
My only meal and I really have to eat this so I just grilled it up. No oil or anything

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.999
Just plain and then I did season it with a little bit of salt and pepper

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:25.059
They said in this diet you can actually season it. So I had to do it. I'm praying that it made a difference

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.339
Let's hope. Here it goes. Oh my god so much better .Ten times better

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:34.539
Why didn't I do this before? It tastes like chicken now? It got rid of that fishy taste

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.598
But if I would have known this I would've beaten tuna a long time enough. What a triumph

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:43.088
So after I'm done with my tuna, I'm just gonna might get out of my ice cream and I'll be done with this diet

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:47.019
Thank God and we will see if I actually lost some weight

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:52.389
So once your three days is up you're going to then weigh yourself on the morning of the fourth day

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.980
To see if it even worked. I hope I hope I hope time for the moment of truth

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.340
151 lbs (68.4 kg)

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.020
I lost 6 pounds!!!

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.660
It's not ten but I'll take it

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.920
I haven't been that small since pre-school

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.980
Now this diet can be done once a week

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.480
But weight loss will vary depending on a persons previous diet.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.100
And if you would like to try out this military diet

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.220
I will leave a link in the description box

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.220
So you can find out more information about the meal plan

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.460
Now as far as me doing this every week

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.020
i don't think that's gonna happen

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.840
I think that is a great initial start to weight loss

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.759
But now I think I'm just going to take it from here and eat healthier and exercise. Now even though I didn't lose 10 pounds

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:42.900
I actually learned a lot about my eating habits during this process in which I often eat because I'm bored and not because I'm hungry and I think that was the best lesson I could have learned over all

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:49.220
So thats my whole tip, and I hope that you liked it! Make sure to comment down below, like this video, and subscribe to my channel

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.980
And i will see you all next Monday for another cheap tip, and this Friday for another cheap laugh!

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.320
Bye guys!
