00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.340
[typing]

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.680
As a result of my experience growing
up alongside the birth of the Internet,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.680
I'm in possession of some curiously
fond memories of America Online.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.420
Most important to this review, though,
is the AOL Games channel in versions 3.0 and 4.0.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.340
It held a treasure trove of secrets in
the form of downloadable .ZIP archives,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.020
one of which was Combat Tanks,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.260
developed by Michael Morrison and
Randy Weems under the name Red Herring.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.460
This was a game that defied all
expectations for 10-year-old me,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.760
which is either high praise or wildly inconsequential,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.020
depending on how you look at it.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.580
In 1994, when Combat Tanks released for Windows 3.1,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.300
I had a grand total of, like, two games for Windows.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.280
So any game that wasn't for DOS
was like a Holy Grail of sorts.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.160
And if it was fun AND free,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
well I may as well have just won the lottery.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.700
In my mind, Windows 3.1 games
were something to be cherished.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.400
And part of that sentiment remains with me to this day.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.420
Now Combat Tanks in particular was special to me

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.200
because it was an action game,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.760
far removed from the standard fare
of puzzle and card games

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.400
like you'd often find in the Microsoft
Windows Entertainment Packs that I had.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.080
Not only that, but it was an action game that didn't suck.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.980
Unlike Blitzer, which was just a
twisted clone of Fort Apocalypse.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.560
Instead, this was a twisted clone
of Combat for the Atari 2600,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.920
or more specifically, the tank mode from that game.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.840
You control a tank with the arrow keys
and have a button for shooting,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.240
and also a button for swapping weapons.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.440
"Kill or be killed" is the golden rule, as you would expect,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.080
so shoot the crap out of
everything until it stops moving.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.260
Primarily, you make use of your
unlimited small caliber rounds,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.680
which work just like they did in Atari's Combat,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.260
They shoot straight forward

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.140
and have a chance to bounce off walls,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.100
but fail to dole out much damage.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.720
You also have mines,
which will drop behind your tank,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.280
and deal a significant chunk of damage to any
ground-based enemies unlucky enough to cross it.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.420
And then you've got rockets,
which do the most damage

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.440
but are rather hard to come by and travel quite slowly.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.740
It's all about surviving as many
waves of these enemies as possible,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.920
from other tanks

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.880
to foot soldiers that can be delightfully squished,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.000
to helicopters and bombers
that pick you off from above.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.460
Other than some concrete barriers,
bodies of water and mud hazards,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.400
you won't see much that's more complicated than that.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.740
Your foes are brain dead and entirely predictable,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.640
but that's okay,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.380
because there's so many of them
that it becomes a nice challenge.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.000
Actually, one of the designers, Michael Morrison,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.840
also authored the book "Sams Teach
Yourself Game Programming in 24 Hours,"

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.560
in which he stated that Combat Tanks
was originally going to have

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.740
a single AI to play against.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.000
But since it proved so challenging
to create a competent AI,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.820
he just went with a lot of stupid AI to balance it out.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.860
And you know what? It works.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.860
Just fight off everything that it mindlessly throws at you.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.600
The levels will loop endlessly until you die.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.680
It's that simple.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.560
Combat Tanks was one of my favorite
Windows 3.1 games for me back then,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.160
and I loved trying to reach all three
terrain types throughout the game.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.880
Of course, in the shareware
version, that was quite the feat,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.500
since after a while it would spawn the Death Chopper,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.660
an invincible black helicopter that
haunted my nightmares for years.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.420
There's no escaping Death Chopper.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.420
And because your parents are broke,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.420
there's no hope of that ever changing.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.860
Eh, whatever. There was an
insanely fun two-player mode as well,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.120
that let you select various terrain types at any time,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.040
along with extra modes like Versus Combat,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.520
Cooperative Play and Capture the Flag.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.440
The only downside is you had
to play using the same keyboard,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.000
so you had to be prepared to rub elbows and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.780
accept some shoulder punches.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.420
Combat Tanks is a brush with violence
without becoming over-the-top.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.600
And in the days of being a kid using
Windows 3.1, that was good enough.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.840
And apparently it was good enough
for over 30,000 people to pay for it,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.220
since that's the number that it sold at retail.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.720
And yes, this was at one point sold in stores

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.460
by our friends at Personal Companion Software.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.520
It may not have made millions or anything, but

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.860
it was a success by low-distribution
shareware standards of its day,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.860
and it sure left its mark on me.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.100
Just speaking personally, I find that
happiness is a commodity that's

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.500
somewhat difficult to glean
from many games nowadays,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.000
and so I find myself gravitating
back towards things like this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.080
that just pleased me on a deep level, once upon a time.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.720
And it did so without even really trying. It just worked.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.680
There's something consistently refreshing about a title

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.340
as simple and straightforward as Combat Tanks,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.480
something that ages well enough
without becoming too dated.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.180
You play it for ten minutes.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.680
You grin as you're killed off and get a high score.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.140
Then maybe a couple years later, you'll come back
and play it for ten minutes and that'll be fine.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.160
That's Combat Tanks,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.720
and I would never ask for it to be anything more.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.480

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.240
And if you enjoyed this video and think
that the game looks interesting enough,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.400
well, the full version was released as
freeware years ago by the developers.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.200
So, just download it in the video
description below and enjoy.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.460
You can also check out some of my
other videos on Windows 3.1 classics,

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.560
or subscribe to LGR to be notified
when a new video is released.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.880
Which happens every Monday and Friday, but, yeah, it's

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.520
still useful in case you're terrible
with dates and don't have a calendar,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.620
or just don't like looking at numbers.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.960
I can understand that.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.360
You can also partake of social
networking junk on Twitter and Facebook,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.740
as well as support further LGR content on Patreon.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.840
And as always, thank you very much for watching.
