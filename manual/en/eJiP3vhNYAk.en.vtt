00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.680
Hi guys, today I'm gonna be doing
a tutorial using stacked braids.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.840
It's so cool.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.160
They all kind of always look
like it's a stacked 3D braid.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.000
So I'm gonna have a go
at showing you how to do this today

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.160
as a side braid.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.200
So all you're gonna need is two small
hair elastics to tie off the hair.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.280
So to start off with,
I'm gonna sweep all my hair to one side,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.880
and I'm gonna split it into three

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.600
as if I was doing a normal
3-strand braid.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.840
Now the way this is gonna happen

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.200
is we're gonna pass
it over to start off with,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.680
just as you would a normal braid.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.520
{\an5}So now each time we pass over
a new section,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.920
{\an5}we're gonna start off by taking
a small section of hair

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.640
{\an5}out of the braid,
out of that section

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.360
before we pass it over.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.040
So then the section from the back,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.200
I'm gonna take a small section off

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.840
and just put it behind...

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.840
and then pass that over.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.800
So you've just got to remember
each time

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.960
to take a small section of hair out...

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.240
and then pass it over.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.040
And then once you feel like
the hair's kind of got too small

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.920
so you can't be taking it
anymore bits out,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.040
you just want to continue it down
just as a normal 3-strand braid.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.240
And then once you get to the end
of the hair,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.920
you just want to take
the small hair elastic and tie it off.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.600
So if you see now when I hold this up,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.000
you can see all these kind of sections
of hair that come out

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.400
of each part of the braid.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.280
So now we're gonna take
these sections

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.280
and we're basically gonna braid them
over the top of that braid.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.880
So starting at the top,
you're gonna pick up two sections

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.840
from one side,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.640
and one section from the back

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.520
and I'm gonna do a Dutch braid
over the top

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.600
of that bottom braid.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.560
So for a Dutch braid,
you want to take the middle section

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.720
and pass it to the outside as opposed to
taking the outer two sides

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.960
and bringing them in.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.120
So that front section is gonna go out
and then the middle section out.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.600
And then each time you just want
to pick up another section

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.160
from the hair, so picking up
that section there

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.280
and then just continue
the Dutch braid down.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.320
And by picking up these sections that
we took out from the original braid,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.440
it kind of joins the two braids together

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.640
which just gives it a really
cool look.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.200
And then once you've incorporated
all the sections,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.520
you just want to continue it down

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.760
until it meets where you finished
that bottom braid.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.360
And then once you've braided down,
you want to take your other hair elastic

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.200
and you want to tie off that braid
so it's tied to the bottom braid,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.960
so just joining them together,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.040
and now all I'm gonna do

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.080
is I'm gonna go along the bottom braid,
just fanning it out

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.200
so just pulling gently on the hair,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.760
just so it kind of emphasizes
the fact that it's a braid on a braid.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.920
So as you can see,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.840
this braid kind of gives this
really cool 3D effect,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.520
so it kind of looks like
a braid from all different angles

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.280
which is really cool
and really different.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.480
I absolutely love this.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.200
it's such a cute hairstyle
for every day,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.280
just another addition
to the side braids.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.240
So I hope you've enjoyed this,
and I will see you all soon.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.680
Bye.
