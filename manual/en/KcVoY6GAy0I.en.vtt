00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.250
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.080
So a typical day for me.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.360
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.550
A typical day begins with.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.830
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.059
My day begins.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.090
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.190
Waking up in the morning.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.190
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.190
Waking up.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.190
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.190
Trying to wake up.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.190
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.500
Usually just grab a piece of toast with some
peanut butter and grab me a Red Bull and head

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.500
to class.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.500
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.579
I do live in Pacific Beach, so that does take
a commute to campus.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:30.579
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.100
I live right across the street from campus
so i can literally roll out of bed ten minutes

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.680
before class and get to class on time.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.680
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.780
And I always get Starbucks or some sort of
coffee or tea before class just to get the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.780
day going.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.780
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.780
Living on campus is very convenient.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.030
I don't have to worry about waking up late.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.270
I can get up fifteen minutes before class
starts and get to my class in time.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.260
I'll go to class and then afterwards in one
of my breaks I'll have breakfast with my best

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.860
friend and will go to Starbucks.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.860
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.450
My name is Nikki Gervais, I'm from Phoenix
Arizona and my major is Hospitality and Tourism

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.350
Management with emphasis in meetings and event
planning.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350
Overall the program, its truly amazing.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.010
We are offered just the most incredible opportunities.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.650
I took a weddings and social events class
last semester and thats actually how I ended

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.510
up in my internship right now.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.600
This internship is at a wedding coordination
and special events company.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.320
Its called Plan it San Diego.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.890
The teacher, the class that I was taking last
semester was weddings and social events.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.200
And about mid semester she had sent me an
email and just randomly asked me, "hey do

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.100
you want to be my intern next semester", and
I was like, "oh my gosh of course!".

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.140
And now that I have been doing it and helping
her doing on site visits, meeting with florist,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.320
and then of course helping on the day of the
weddings.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.350
It's been an awesome opportunity.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.350
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.290
My name is Ikaika Kekua-Luis.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.570
I'm from Mililani Hawaii.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.840
Im studying Electrical Engineering.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.070
The reason why i chose to attend San Diego
State was because of the Engineering program.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.850
As well as the fact that its probably the
closet University to Hawaii, and thats always

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.080
a good thing.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.421
And the weather's very similar, just a little
less humid and I like that.

00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:13.659
The relationship between professors and the
students are hands down awesome.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.920
As of right now I am just starting to get
into my upper division courses.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.019
I'm getting into the lab and the fact that
I can actually see whats going on as far as

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.610
like the circuits and using transistors.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.010
And I can just go on and on, but I really
love the hands on,

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.219
They have really good equipment, and thats
definitely a big plus for me.

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.219
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:36.099
My name is Joquel Vasquez, I'm from San Diego
California and I am studying Biochemistry

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.620
and I have a minor in Interdisciplinary Studies.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.000
I admire how much of a research university
this is.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.609
It seems very welcoming in comparison to other
schools in which students are competitive

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.069
yet their willing to reach out and help you.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.400
My favorite class happens to be Dr. Anderson's
Physics 195.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.129
He explains everything so that the class understands.

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.000
He even posts YouTube videos and its just
exciting to be in his class because he's an

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
enthusiastic teacher.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.299
Lunch, I usually eat on campus.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.299
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.299
Rubios, Daphne's.

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.299
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.579
Sub Connection, there's Panda Express.

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.069
We just have a lot of fun, there's a lot of
things to do here.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.069
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.620
So I took it upon myself to actually make
a Hawaii club for those incoming students.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.609
We want to create that little family bond
and then have the transition be a lot easier.

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.609
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.519
So I've been an SDSU ambassador sense my freshmen
year and its just been truly an invaluable

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.159
experience, something that I'll never forget.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.680
Also my Sorority Pi Beta Phi, I joined that
my freshmen year as well.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.560
I really just wanted to dive into things and
meet a good group of friends and I found that

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.900
there in my Sorority.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.900
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.760
I also got involved with Phi Delta Theta Fraternity,
I was fortunate enough to be one of the founders.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.829
Initially when i first met one of the alumni,
when I first joined, he was more than willing

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.430
to offer me an internship right on the spot.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.930
And that definitely opened my eyes because
it allowed me to start building those connections

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.029
for after i graduate.

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.029
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.249
So I'm an academic advisor for my major.

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:07.769
I take at least thirty minutes to sit down
with every student that comes in to see me.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.980
And I tell them, you know, just the whole
overview about the program.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.980
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.409
Currently I work at the Aztec Recreation Center.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.409
At the Rec.

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.590
Center I pretty much maintain a safe environment.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.410
I also work at the Associated Students Business
Office.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.700
At the office I also answer a bunch of questions
that students may have.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.700
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.290
The African Student Union offers a lot of
events in the evening and then we just have

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.290
fun.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.060
Other things that I do in the eveningsâ€¦

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.760
I study, I study.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.470
Normally in the evening, I go home and then
that is my time to study.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.470
And then make dinner!

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.780
I love making dinner with my roommates.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.780
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.840
Dinner, it will be with my friends.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.300
I'll eat a Cuic, but sometimes I go to East
Commons.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.650
When it comes to Cuic I like pasta night and
pizza night.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.650
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.010
Some of the places include some of the best
Mexican food.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.840
And then there's also like Buddies Burgers,
4.0 Deli if you want sandwiches.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.990
So there's a wide variety.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.070
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.410
There's so much school pride here and you
see that radiating at our basketball games.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.980
There's the show and the enthusiasm that comes
from that.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.980
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.700
You've got fifteen minutes drive to the beach,
fifteen minutes from there your in the heart

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.070
of the Gaslamp downtown district, fifteen
minutes from there your at school.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.660
I mean there's so much around you.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.660
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.050
You could get pretty much anywhere in San
Diego through public transportation.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.310
&gt;&gt;Ikaika Kekua-Luis

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.890
I would 100% recommend San Diego State University
to prospective students because this campus

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.030
is just so diverse that it makes you a lot
more well rounded and more aware of whats

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.880
going on in the world today.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.240
&gt;&gt;Joquel Vasquez

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.650
There's so much here for you.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.210
They have scholarships, they have resources,
they have professors wanting students in their

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.070
lab, they have a lot of things for you that
you won't find anywhere else.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.070
&gt;&gt;Nikki Gervais

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.900
I wouldn't hesitate recommending San Diego
State to anyone.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.310
I can't even explain how much I appreciate
this experience and I'll remember it for the

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.479
rest of my life.
