Cantaloupe-cantaloupe-canta-do-bop-a-loupe.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
I’ve got a case of the munchies

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.160
and I need something sweet.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.840
I won’t go grabbing candy,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.280
fruit is what I need.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.440
I could go bananas,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.840
pears make me berserk.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.760
And yogurt on my pineapple is perfect for
dessert.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.680
Nature’s candy,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.920
nature’s candy.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.400
I call it nature’s candy,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.080
I'm singing nature’s candy.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.720
I’ve got a sweet tooth for my favorite fruit.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.320
Nature’s candy.

Strawberry-strawberry-straw-ba-do-bop-a-ber-ry.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.520
I don’t need cotton candy,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.160
I don’t need jelly beans.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.350
You’ll find me with watermelon

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.890
spitting out the seeds.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.799
Toast with avocado,

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.350
a slice of harmony.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.070
Or blend a smoothie with a frozen berry symphony.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.270
Nature’s candy,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.560
nature’s candy.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160
I call it nature’s candy,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.040

I’ve got a sweet tooth for my favorite fruit.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.320
Nature’s candy.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.480
You know why I love fruit so much?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.710
Well, it’s sweeter than candy.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.200
Cantaloupe-cantaloupe-canta-do-bop-a-loupe.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.080
But it’s even better than tasting better
than candy.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.100
Fruit is full of healthy stuff like vitamins
and minerals and fiber that your body needs

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.380
to be big and strong.

Tangerine-tangerine-tange-do-bop-a-rine.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.300
Vitamins and fiber,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.360
complete my healthy checklist.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.600
And oh how sweet that such a treat

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.160
could also be my breakfast.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.720
Nature’s candy,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.480

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.700
Nature’s candy.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.020
