00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.788
Hello everyone. My name is Tasha and welcome to Heart of Tarts. 

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:08.215
Today we will be making a How the 
 Grinch Stole the Doggone Christmas Tart. 

00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:15.714
Can you believe it? He stole the entire Christmas, because 
 his heart was all small and crumbly and eghhh.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.598
Do you all know anybody with a heart too small?

00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:21.655
Like, I know these people in real life. They don't have 
 to be green. They look just like you and me.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:26.194
And, they walk around stealing everybody's Christmas cheer, 
 because their heart is too small. 

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:30.533
Well today we are going to help their hearts 
 grow with this sweet green Grinch tart.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.985
Here we go.

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:33.701
We are going to start by making our tart crust.

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:39.442
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and to a food processor we 
 are going to add in 1 1/2 cups old fashion oats,

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:43.342
along with 4 pitted dates, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:46.728
Pulverize that all together until it forms a flour.

00:00:46.728 --> 00:00:51.219
Next you are going to add in 1/4 cup 
 almond milk and 3 tablespoon coconut oil.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.062
Pulse that together until it is just combined. About 3 or 4 
 pulses and then press it around a 9 inch tart pan.

00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:03.422
Get is snug up against the sides and bottom 
 so it bake up nice and even.

00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:10.002
Bake it for 10 minutes and it will have a soft oatmeal 
 cookie texture and if you bake it for 15 minutes

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.878
you will get a harder crust. 

00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:16.074
If you prefer that. Did anyone notice I cut my 
 hair? Like I cut it some more. 

00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:22.720
I cut it. I cut my hair. No? 
 No one noticed. alright, keep it moving.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.456
Next we are going to make our filling. Usually I use about 
 2 avocados, but today I am going to use 3,

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.360
because the avocados were small at my local grocery store. 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.248
I don't know if it is because the seasons are changing. 
 Probably because they are not in season as close

00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:38.364
or whatever but we are going to use 2-3 avocados.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:45.410
1 whole banana, 1/4 cup almond milk, and 
 about 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. 

00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:52.160
Just depends on how much vanilla you like. Blend 
 that all together until it is very smooth

00:01:52.157 --> 00:01:53.790
and then dump it into your cooled tart crust.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.760
Spread it around in an even layer and we 
 are ready to tart this baby. 

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:04.210
And I really love my lip color for fall. I will put a link 
 to it in the description below so you can check that out. 

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:09.400
To make my toppings, I diagonally sliced my banana. I 
 took off two sliced to make his eyes.

00:02:09.402 --> 00:02:16.980
I topped it with a few raisins to make his pupils. They are 
 black and beady because  he is all evil and angry. 

00:02:09.402 --> 00:02:16.980
I topped it with a few raisins to make his pupils. They are 
 black and beady because  he is all evil and angry. 

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:23.780
To make his nose, I used a couple more raisins. I 
 tried to shape them out into an animal-istic nose, 

00:02:23.778 --> 00:02:26.570
but I don't know if I quite achieved that 
 but that is what I was going for.

00:02:26.573 --> 00:02:35.920
I thought it would stop ringing, but it didn't. 
 You don't bark. This is a disaster.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.420
For his lips, he has these pink-ish, red-dish poutty lips.

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:42.990
So I tried to cut a tomato into a 
 little pout and put it on there.

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:42.990
So I tried to cut a tomato into a 
 little pout and put it on there.

00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:48.390
That did not look quite right so I added a little banana 
 for some teeth like he was snarling at us. 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.000
For his facial expressions, I just carved it right into the tart. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.400
I made his eyebrows furl, like eugghhh I 
 hate Christmas and children and cheer. 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:03.510
I made him some wrinkle lines like he has 
 just been frowning for 1000 years 

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:08.740
and I put some dots where his little animal whiskers 
 would be. Like little pokes to his skin. 

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:15.150
For whisker spots. Hopefully you can see that. And 
 that is about all we did. 

00:03:15.152 --> 00:03:19.870
It looks grinch-y to me. Hopefully your family and friends 
 and kids will think it looks grinch-y too.

00:03:19.868 --> 00:03:24.540
Thank you so much for watching today and thank you 
 for letting me help your heart grown three sizes.

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:30.100
We are pumping it up for Christmas. It needs to be 
 extra large to contain all the Christmas cheer. 

00:03:30.097 --> 00:03:34.630
