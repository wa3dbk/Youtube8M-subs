Hey everybody, it's Jason Andrew Wrobel from
JasonWrobel.com.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.349
That's
JasonW-r-o-b as in burgers and burritos together-e-l.com.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.670
Today we're
combinining two, two, two of my favorite meals

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.019
of all time, burritos and
burgers, to create the burgerito here with

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.019
the Sunwarrior Tribe.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.789
So we're
doing a black rice tortilla with a ton of

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.980
fresh organic raw veggies, a
little bit of gluten-free vegan burger action

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.260
on the inside, hence the
creation of the burgerito.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.310
Let us begin, my liege.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.070
So the first thing that we want to do is create
the sauce for our

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.210
burgerito, and today we're going to be doing
a red pepper tahini sauce

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.940
that's going to slather and lather and drather
and father and all other

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.900
kinds of great adjectives all over our veggies
and our burger.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.640
Let's begin
by firing up the Blendtec and showing you

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.640
how it's done.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.720
I have a slew of fresh cut vegetables in here
which are going to be the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.040
base of our awesome sauce for our burgerito.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.360
What I've got in here is one
full red bell pepper.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.080
I've got a half of a diced zucchini, three
sprigs of

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.250
green onions or scallions, depending on what
you prefer to call them, and

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.390
for a little bit of spice I do have a half
of a habanero pepper with some

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.670
seeds in there.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.100
Now you can always adjust that action.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.880
You guys know I
like it spicy.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.220
It's the half of the Puerto Rican, which is
the bottom

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.590
half, if you know what I'm saying.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.802
We're going to add all this to our
Blendtec and get ready to blend the things.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:47.390
Next up, I'm going to do a quarter cup of
organic raw tahini, which is

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.770
ground up sesame seeds.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.370
If you guys don't have tahini on hand, you
could

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.770
always just use whole raw sesame seeds with
the same measurement.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.230
Next up,
we're rocking some organic coconut aminos.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.780
This is a great alternative for
those of you who are trying to avoid soy,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.120
yet still add a little bit of
flavor and salt balance to your recipes.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.970
To this, I think we're going to
add about a tablespoon.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.620
Now I'm throwing in a dash of smoked paprika.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.920
Again, you guys could
substitute a little bit of cayenne pepper,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.230
a little bit of chili powder,
whatever spicy spice you want to do.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.799
About a half a teaspoon or so should
do here.

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.859
Now I'm going to add a big pinch of fresh
ground black pepper and

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.390
a little throw-down of our Himalayan crystal
salt to add extra minerals and

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.430
bring the flavors together.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.219
Then finally what we're going to do is add
three whole juiced lemons.

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:45.769
We're just going to take a citrus reamer here
and put the three lemons in our recipe.

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.629
Now at this point we're going to go ahead
and blend our awesome red pepper

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:49.749
tahini sauce.

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.111
I think it's going to be a little bit on the
thick side, so

00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:54.970
if you'd like to thin it out you could have
a little it of

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.419
filtered water on hand, but let's give it
a blast and blend for 30 dirty

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.419
birdie.

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.790
Let's move on to assembling our burgerito
and putting all the fresh fixings

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.209
in our black rice wrap.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.129
Now when it comes to using a wrapper, you
could

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.669
use the wrapper of your choice.

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:17.999
In this case, I was just recently
introduced to these amazing black rice tortillas

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:21.829
from Food For Life, which
I usually get their regular brown rice wraps,

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.870
but this is awesome because
black rice has got a great flavor, tons of

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.120
antioxidants, tons of [inaudible
03:28] and it's super healthy for you.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.799
But if you guys just want to go
strictly raw, you could always do collard

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:32.799
greens.

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.700
You could always do swiss
chard, whatever you're liking.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.419
Let me show you really quickly how to soften
these guys up over an open

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.419
flame.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.579
It only takes about 20 seconds, and it makes
these a lot more

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.080
pliable and easier to wrap.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.390
Over a low flame, what I like to do is
basically just flip these guys, again, about

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.870
ten seconds each just to
loosen them up and make them easier to roll.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.409
Watch how it's done.

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.480
So now that our black rice tortilla wrap is
ready to be filled, I'm going

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.569
to start with my favorite veggie burger on
the market right now.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.689
This is
Hilary's Eat Well.

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.859
This is their Spicy Adzuki Black Bean Burger.

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.809
They
also have the World's Best Veggie Burger and

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:15.049
they have these great little
amazing Burger Bites, too, on the market.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.190
They're really, really great.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.049
They're totally gluten-free, yeast-free, low
in oil, low-fat, dairy-free,

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.300
egg-free, basically allergen-free and the
taste is amazing.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.919
You can grill
these guys, you can fry them up, you can even

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.680
put them in the toaster and
they come out amazing.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.740
So what I've done is grill up one burger with
a little bit of coconut oil,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.009
and I'm just going to half it and add it to
the base of my tortilla.

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.150
Now
it may look like I'm about to rock a sushi

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.310
roll, which with these
ingredients I certainly could, but we're going

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.860
to use these to stuff our
burgerito.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.810
I've got some fresh julienned cucumber.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.020
I've got some red bell
pepper, some julienned carrots, and also one

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.020
avocado.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.930
As far as ratios go,
it's a quarter cucumber, quarter bell pepper,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.860
half of a carrot and one full
Hass avocado.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.639
You can tell which one is my favorite, based
on the height

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.010
of the toppings.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.440
Let's stuff it.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.890
Then on top of my fresh cut veggies I'm going
to add some baby Boston

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.990
living lettuce, some fresh cilantro, and some
fresh Mizuna sprouts, and if

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.580
you notice the way that I'm wrapping everything,
I'm stacking everything

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.669
toward the center so that the edges are easier
to curl around.

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.439
So maybe I should change the name of this
to the monster burgerito because

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.720
I'm not even sure if there's room for this
red pepper tahini dressing, but

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.740
we're going to try.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.770
We're going to do our best here.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.439
That's all we can
do.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:43.650
So let's load her up and try and wrap it.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.650
So it's the moment of truth, you all.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.979
Mm.

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:57.830
The sauce is delicious, really
spicy, and light with the red pepper and the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.449
habanero, really creamy with
the tahini added to it, and the Adzuki Bean

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.780
Burger, really hearty, really
filling.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.400
You have a crunch of the fresh veggies in
there.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.750
This is a super
easy and really filling lunch option, and

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.330
as you guys can see, super quick,
super inexpensive with all the fresh veggies

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.430
you can get locally.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.050

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.250

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.461

00:07:11.461 --> 00:07:15.460
like a pay-per-view thing of
like the World's Biggest Mouths.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.039
It's J-Wro, Steve Tyler, Mick Jagger, and
I don't know, who else has a big mouth?

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.560
Maybe I should ask for comments
like who else is famous for having a big mouth.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.910
I don't know.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.770
It's going
to happen, World's Biggest Mouths 2014.
