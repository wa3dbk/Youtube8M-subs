00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Back home I worked for almost 10 years as a dentist.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And besides, I worked as a teacher in a dentistry school for almost 6 years.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I enjoy my job a lot because I am involved in my field.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.500
I love my dental field, I can see how the biomaterials change a lot.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.000
You know, it is a great opportunity for me to be involved in my field.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And besides, I can improve my English, all my skills in English: listening, reading, and writing.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.500
It was 2 different barriers. The first one was language.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.000
When I came to Canada, I didn't speak anything in English.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.500
The second one was to recognize what I am and what kind of thing am I going to do, in order to get past these barriers.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Before I got my job, I think I put applications everywhere. I used Internet, I used paper,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.500
I used networks, I used everything. Everything.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.000
Sometimes I went to a dental office and said, "I am Hector Castaneda, this is my certificate as a dental assistant,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
"do you need any help?" They would say, "No, thank you."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
"Okay, this is my application, just look at it, look at it. Okay?"

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.500
As an immediate goal, I would like to improve my English a lot. I have to do this as quickly as I can.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:02.000
My intermediate goals, I would like to become a certified dental hygienist in Canada.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
To become a dentist in Canada, I would like to do something different.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.500
I would like to take my practice in the future and bring it to the community

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.000
because our health system doesn't cover anything about dental treatment. It's so expensive in Canada. So expensive.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So I would like to do something for all those people who don't have the opportunity

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
to take good care of the health of their teeth.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.500
I would like to do something like this.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.000
Canada is a rich country, is a blessed country, but I would like to do something in this area.
