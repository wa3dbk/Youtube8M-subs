00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.200
Now in Revelations they put you into the animus
to keep you alive as the lives of three people

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.769
have overloaded his brain.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.349
In this game you finish their lives to get
his mind back.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.370
We are also told that Lucy has died.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.879
We will skip most of it.

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.140
This is the animus island being deleted.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:32.840
At the end you use the keys you collect to
open a vault.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:54.190
You find Altair and another memory key and
relive the memory.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:10.719
It sees Altair coming in and hiding 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:18.640
the apple and then sitting down.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.860
Ezio then goes to see the apple.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:45.180
Ezio and Jupiter talk to Desmond.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:57.479
I believe that is New York.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.639
Remember the statues.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:03:49.260
To essentially test what the pieces of Eden
could do.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:04:22.230
This is the disaster Minerva warned of.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:47.030
Click the link if you want to skip this bit.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:55.560
It is just a brilliant cinematic.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:07.500
The 
time lapse was of a statue and you then travel

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:21.000
there.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.130
Bill opens the boot to reveal the door to
another vault.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.810
That is where Assassin's Creed III will take
off.
