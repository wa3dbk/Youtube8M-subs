Welcome to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville's
College of Engineering!

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.710
The College of Engineering is one of the fastest
growing colleges at UT, with dramatic increases

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.710
in recent enrollment and research expenditure.
Our students and faculty members are stronger

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.009
than ever. We are one of the oldest engineering
colleges in the nation, founded way back in

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.590
1838, and we are continually developing and
improvingâ€”building new state-of-the-art

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.329
facilities all the time. The UT College of
Engineering is truly a college at the forefront

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.070
of engineering research and exploration.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.070
Chances are, if you get to visit the College
of Engineering you won't be able to go to

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.909
all the labs you want to. That's because
we are in more than 8 buildings on campus

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.439
with over 100 laboratory spaces, with each
one doing research on something fascinating

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.020
and different.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.020
The Knoxville campus is home to eight departments
of the College of Engineering offering a total

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.200
of 12 undergraduate programs: There's Biosystems
Engineering, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.430
Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science, Industrial

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.519
and Systems Engineering, Materials Science
and Engineering, Mechanical, Aerospace, and

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.819
Biomedical Engineering, and Nuclear Engineering.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.540
Our labs are run by distinguished and award-winning
faculty who are leaders in their respective

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.540
fields. For approximately every 17 undergraduate
students, the College of Engineering has one

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.450
faculty member. As a student at UT, you'll
benefit from working closely with the faculty

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.129
in the classroom and in the lab, and you'll
have the opportunity to learn from these researchers

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:49.430
whose work is defining and shaping the future
of engineering. And when you leave UT, you'll

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.819
be equipped to pursue a vast range of exciting
careers.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.819
UT is also uniquely situated next to the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, a huge research

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.849
facility that attracts scientists from all
over the world. UT's partnership with ORNL

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.879
has also brought many of those world-class
faculty members to Tennessee where they hold

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.260
joint positions. So in addition to all of
the advanced research you can do on campus,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.750
you may also get the opportunity to do research
in one of the United States premiere national

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.750
labs.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.280
In the UT College of Engineering, we nurture
and inspire the students and the Big Ideas

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.689
that will transform the world. If you get
the opportunity, make plans to tour the UTK

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.580
engineering campus. If you have questions
or need more information please visit the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.739
College of Engineering website for tour information.

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.889
The University of Tennessee. Big Orange. Big
Ideas.
