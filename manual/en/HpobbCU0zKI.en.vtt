Welcome to another eMediaCoach.com tutorial.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.130
In this tutorial, we're going to show you
how the background color of your website.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.610
Just before we start, in case you haven't
seen our other tutorial on how to make a website,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.710
we'll teach you how to make this particular
website in under two hours at absolutely no

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.869
cost at all.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.159
So, if you want an elegant looking website
like this, please watch our other tutorial,

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.519
and you'll have a bit more of an idea.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.550
That tutorial is a step-by-step instructional
tutorial, so you will get a final product

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.310
within an hour and a half.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:55.960
So, to change the background color, firstly
log in to your WordPress dashboard, your website.com/wp-admin.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.579
Go to Appearance &gt; Background, and here you
can choose an image for a background.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.890
So, if you've got a background image you'd
like to use, you can enter it here.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.829
You can upload that here.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.210
Otherwise, we're just going to change the
color for now.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.340
All you need to do is select the color from
here.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.360
So, it's basically just trial and error.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.700
So, for example, let's try a blue background.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.859
Hit save changes.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:43.459
Now, if we refresh our website, there you
go, the background color has changed.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.409
You can just play around with this; trial
and error.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.240
See what suits your website, your business,
your logo, colors.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.619
So, you can just play around with that.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.920
In our next video we'll actually show you
how to put a custom image as the background.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.850
So you can create some nice effects with that.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.509
But we'll leave that for another tutorial.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.149
