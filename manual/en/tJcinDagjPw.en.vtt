00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.790
Your skin is the outer layer of protection
to your body. Exposure to some chemicals and

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.619
other hazardous materials can lead to this
protection being broken down. It can cause

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.890
pain, discomfort and long term ill health.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.480
So where do the risks come from?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.539
Your skin can come into contact with hazardous
materials through everyday work activities

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:29.999
such as

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.820
1. Wet work and use of chemicals in many workplaces
2. Mixing or decanting chemicals and materials

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.820
3. Having skin contact with substances on
contaminated surfaces, containers or clothing

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.449
or
4. Exposure to, or working with animals or

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:52.449
food stuffs
and finally 5. Donâ€™t forget the sun

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.070
What are the causes of these risks?

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.679
Damage to your skin can arise in any situation
where direct or indirect exposure is possible,

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:02.260
for example

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.350
6. Immersing hands in hazardous materials
7. Splashes, aerosols and dusts landing on

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.540
the skin
8. Where there is no containment or reduction

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.720
in use
9. Where there is poor or no extraction at

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.210
the source
10. Where staff do not have suitable protective

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.570
clothing such as gloves or
11. Have the wrong or poorly maintained protective

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.170
clothing
12. Not knowing how to put on or take off

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.100
gloves safely
13. Poor house keeping and storage of chemicals

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.899
or hazardous substances

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:33.579
And where there is a

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:40.579
14. Lack of awareness of the risk among staff
and poor management

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.759
So how does all this affect your health?

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.560
Damage to your skin can lead to a number of
health effects:

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.009
15. Irritant dermatitis or burns
16. Skin sensitisation and allergic dermatitis

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.840
even to very small quantities
17. Pain and discomfort

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.840
18. Infection
19. Sunburn and possibly Cancer

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.020
How do you control the risks?

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.870
Taking steps to control the risks means you
must identify which hazardous materials staff

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.480
are exposed to. Then consider what steps are
needed to remove or reduce this exposure,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.090
for example:

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.319
20. Use chemicals and hazardous substances
that are less harmful to skin

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.180
21. Ensure good containment of the hazardous
material

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.159
22. Consider tools and working practices that
would minimise exposure to wet work and chemicals

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.209
23. Provide and maintain good work equipment
and extraction systems

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.090
24. Provide suitable protective equipment
such as overalls, gloves or aprons as appropriate

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.989
25. Practice good storage and house keeping
26. Consider skin health checks for exposed

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.060
staff
27. Always monitor your systems to ensure

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.980
they are working correctly

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.920
Following these examples will help you reduce
your health risks at work. For more information,
