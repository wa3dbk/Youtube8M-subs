Hey Chris this is David Burns from Handy Toyota.

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:09.309
Lately I've been emailing you back and fourth
a little bit on these new 2014 Venzas.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.710
What I did today is pulled this particular
one aside and it is one that I shot you an

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.350
email about if you're interested in looking
it up its stock number 25320 and again it's

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.020
a 2014 XLE edition and it is an all wheel
drive, a beautiful vehicle.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.430
I just wanted to give you a little quick video
here going over a couple of the features and

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.550
giving you a different look at it.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.860
Starting here in the front of the vehicle
you have some really aggressive looking high

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.060
intensity projector beam headlights and this
edition does come with the fog lights as standard.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.550
As you are coming around you have your 19"
alloy wheels on the vehicle moving up towards

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.920
the mirrors you do have turn signals on the
mirrors.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.010
They are color keyed to be the same color
as the vehicle and they are a heated mirror

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.739
also.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.390
One of my favorite features in the vehicle
the the smart key that I'm showing you here,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.990
this has the ability to put your key in your
pocket for example and if the vehicle (right

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.320
now its not running) I can lock it with two
fingers by touching it as I'm walking away

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.500
from the vehicle it also unlocks automatically
with the key in my pocket as I walk up to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.750
the vehicle.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.500
So it was locked now it's unlocked and it
is a push button start that you do not have

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.409
to put the key in the ignition in order to
start the vehicle.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.490
In the back of the vehicle you notice that
you have this windshield wiper that comes

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.310
standard with the vehicle now it does come
equipped with a back up camera and just to

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.490
kind of show you here this is where the vehicle
has the back up camera mounted there.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.080
I'll open it up giving you another perspective
of how much room there is here in the Venza

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.150
now the seats do fold down.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:02:00.979
But here you have a toneau cover for your
convenience you also have the spare tire underneath

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:16.550
this compartment hidden away nicely also in
this edition is a one touch rear tailgate.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:27.010
Chris just a perspective of how much space
there is in the vehicle when you put the seats

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.790
down and of course you can remove the toneau
cover bar to give you all of this utility

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.010
here in the back end of the vehicle.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.750
Chris on the inside the first thing I want
to show you is this does come equipped with

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.750
a sunroof.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.180
I also think it's important to show you that
it comes equipped with a moon roof in the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.780
back so that way you have that for your rear
passengers too.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.030
It's pretty cool even if you drive down the
road to have that much light in here too.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.180
Up here in the dash there are a lot of cool
things to talk about Chris.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.519
First and foremost you have your audio settings
with a 6.1" touch screen display now

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:08.360
here with this vehicle you actually get three
months of satellite radio that you can extend

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.420
at any time and you can also go back into
AM and FM obviously or pair up your Bluetooth

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.670
with your cell phone for example and that
will automatically feed things like a call

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.800
list or your music right over the Bluetooth
without plugging anything in.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.629
Coming down the middle console, I just want
to show you here that you do have heated seats

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:37.300
for both the driver and the passenger the
vehicle does have a sport dire mode which

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.620
you know gives a little bit more of a sporty
drive or if you are going down a hill you

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.480
can use the engine for braking rather than
riding the brakes.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.319
I king of like all of these cubby holes they
have.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.400
This is for your phone and it leads down into
underneath this compartment this is also perhaps

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.659
for a phone or anything else you want to put
in there it also has a hole that leads down

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.990
into the compartment so if you have your phone
in there you can click this back and you can

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:10.379
see you have your USB Auxiliary ports in there
to charge the phone or your 12 volt plug in.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.319
Now back here the middle console you do have
space for storage now this folds right up

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:23.520
and also that can come out to give you more
storage there now getting up on to the steering

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.219
wheel you have lots of hands free settings.

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:30.889
Now as I talked about before with pairing
your Bluetooth you have the ability here to

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.169
pick up or hang up cell phone calls but more
importantly you have the voice recognition

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.729
feature and that's where you can talk to the
system over the intercom asking to do the

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.809
things you'd like it to do and on this side
of the steering wheel you also have adjustments

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:49.300
for volume for example but you can also go
back and fourth with different settings like

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.509
your satellite radio AM and FM settings and
your Bluetooth.

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:03.849
I do want to mention to you you have navigation
on this vehicle that you can access that through

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:09.330
the apps button and by pushing map on the
touch screen and here you'll see that navigation

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.520
screen.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.710
Also the same screen that if I put the vehicle
in reverse you'll see your back up camera.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.869
Also when you put it in reverse you'll see
your mirrors adjust giving you a better view

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:27.779
point when you are backing up you'll notice
you also have those mirrors automatic folding

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:32.300
feature so just the push of a button and you
get the chance to be able to automatically

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.410
fold those mirrors in or back out for your
parking situations a couple other nice features

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.979
that I feel like are worth mentioning you
do have an auto dim rear-view mirror.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.009
You can always tilt and telescope the wheel
for your comfort.

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:55.050
You also have two different drivers settings
for seat comfort.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.080
One more feature one of my favorites is this
vehicle is loaded with a JBL speaker system

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.979
giving you great music entertainment.

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.711
