Hey everybody! This is Randy Santel, "Atlas"
with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions. Had a bad loss

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.530
last night in St. Andrews at Rascals Pub.
7-1 now. It's day #9 of my European Tour 2013.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.750
I am at Foxton's in Glenrothes, Scotland.
I'm taking on their Meat Feast Challenge.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.310
They also have a burger challenge, but I'm
doing quite a few burger challenges so I wanted

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.300
to do this one because it's unique. A lot
of meat obviously because it's call the Meat

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.160
Feast. We've got these three pieces of meat
here. We also have the sides, which are onion

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.160
rings, chips, mushrooms, eggs, black pudding,
and this will be my first time having haggis.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.380
I've got 90 minutes to finish the challenge.
I'm also doing it with my friend, who won

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.540
a Facebook competition, Tony. So this will
be his first challenge. We're both hoping

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.440
to get the win. I think two people have already
won. If we win we will get the meal free and

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.440
a t-shirt. Lets get it started! Alright, lets
get back to the victory! One, two, three!

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.270
Alright, last night I started with the chips
first, so we're doing meat today.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.270
Haven't even bit into it yet and I can already
tell it's cooked perfectly. [crowd laughs]

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.680
Very, very glad I went with the Meat Feast.
This meat has been very, very tasty.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.590
10:15 - the 40 oz of meat is gone. I got my
rings, chips, good-looking mushrooms, eggs,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.150
black pudding, and I'll probably do haggis
last. I know everybody's been wanting to watch

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.150
me eat haggis, and this will be

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.060
the first.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.400
Mushrooms are down.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.409
20:35 - lets do these eggs first, then we'll
do the black pudding, then the haggis. Why

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.909
use a fork when you got your hands.

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:41.909
26:30 - we're down to our four slices of haggis.
My first time having it. Hopefully its good.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.990
If not I have my Coke to wash it down.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.400
It's not bad.  It's definitely different.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.500
29:30 - haggis is actually really good.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.669
Alright, final time is 29:40. Back on getting
the win steak going. 8-1. That was a delicious

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.740
challenge. Thank you to Foxton's. They've
got a burger challenge and this Meat Feast

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.310
Challenge that I just did. Onion rings were
great. Mushrooms were good. Black pudding,

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:54.310
haggis, all three meats were awesome. Very
happy to get win #149 and first win in Glenrothes.

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:02.120
It was a delicious challenge! Thanks for watching!

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.080
Hey everybody! Just want to thank you for
watching me beat The Meat Feast Challenge.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.169
I'm here with Lee, the owner of Foxton's.
He's presenting me with my new shirt. My eighth

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:19.169
of the trip. Definitely going to keep this
one. I also got the meal free, and got the

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:26.509
record for the challenge! Thank you to Lee,
thank you to Foxton's. I appreciate it!
