VERNON M. WHALEY: The School of Music at Liberty
University is tasked with the mission of training

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.269
and equipping musicians as Champions for Christ.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.300
We do this for two distinct divisions.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.320
First, is the Center for Music and the Performing
Arts.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.910
The second division is specifically designed
to meet the needs of the evangelical community,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.430
and this group is called the Center for Music
and Worship.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.720
Liberty University's Center for Music and
Worship is the largest in the nation.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.730
We have over 400 graduate students that are
actively on the field, serving as worship

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.440
pastors and music directors, while completing
studies here at the Liberty University School

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.440
of Music.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.440
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.200
JOHN D. KINCHEN, III: We provide opportunity
for students to not just learn principles

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.180
of music theory, and music itself, but also
provide opportunity for them to implement

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.600
it immediately.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.789
One way in which we do this is we have students
bring their instruments to class each week,

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.670
and we have them perform the ideas that we
teach in class.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.840
&gt;&gt; PATRICK SHORTS: Being here at Liberty,
it's taken my perspective of worship and just

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.610
God alone to a totally different level.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
&gt;&gt; PETER JOSHUA GIL: The professors in the
music department are very, very well educated;

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.259
they're very well prepared for teaching and
passing on their knowledge to the students.

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.119
&gt;&gt;LARYY MICHAEL SEIPP: The faculty are some
of the best in their field in the country.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.490
They not only prepared me musically, but also
it prepares you to be successful as a Christian

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.599
in a secular world.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:32.579
&gt;&gt; JAMIE CASE: My experience at the School
of Music was phenomenal.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.669
It's where the Lord led me, and I believe
that that's where He was calling me to just

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:42.259
serve where He gifted me, and the program
facilitated that ability to continue to grow,

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.539
and in my understanding and the philosophy
of worship.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.340
They trained us to have the right kind of
ear, the right kind of understanding, but

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.750
also they trained us how to work with other
people.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.259
They stressed that time and time again, and
that's what ministry is.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.259
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.159
L. LAVON GRAY: We work really, really hard
to try to make sure that we know our students

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.159
individually.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.239
We're able to have growing, and I think very
productive relationships with our students.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.929
One of the things that distinguishes Liberty
University from other Universities, is that

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.290
while many Christian schools have a Christian
identity, Liberty University has a Christian

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.290
culture.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.819
And that permeates and influences everything
that we do at this University, both in academics

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.189
as well as just your general student involvement.

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.439
It's one of the key parts of our program,
is internships, because not only are students

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.120
getting hands on experience, but they're also
getting mentorship from some of the leading

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.529
worship leaders in the country.
