00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.210
Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel!

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.040
Today I am going to do my Monthly favorites
video for March.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.770
I have a few products here that I want to
share with you; and if you are interested

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.560
in seeing what I have, keep watching!

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.330
Okay, so I'm going to do the beauty portion
first, so that way I can get it all out of

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.330
the way.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.500
If that is what you are watching my monthly
favorites for -

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.550
First product I want to talk to you guys about
is a foundation I've been using a lot lately.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.680
This is the cover girl trublend foundation.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.590
I am in the color M6; I love that this foundation
goes on my skin naturally.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.020
It doesn't make me look cakey.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.410
I have another foundation, the 3-in-1 foundation
and.. mmmm...

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.430
I'm not really used to having foundation in
the first place.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.590
So, um, I like it to look as natural and as
much as my skin as possible.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.370
I don't hate that foundation, but I definitely
love this one a little bit more!

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.379
Next product for beauty, is going to be my
color tattoo.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.540
This is a 24hour color tattoo in number 70
Barely Branded and this was like a huge hype

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.440
here on youtube from a lot of girls.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.920
And I just had to try it.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.900
I never found the color that everybody was
talking about - but I finally found it!So

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.740
I picked it up, I have to say that I did not
like it at first because when It applied to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.110
my eyes, it was kind of like... thick and...
not good at all!

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.540
It did not blend out properly at all!

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.620
Once I got through that first layer that was
on top of it, it was so creamy.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.950
I applied it as an eyeshadow base under my
eyeshadow for today;and I really, really love

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.950
it!

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.120
I understand what the hype is all about, I
love the packaging of this and it really does

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.710
last for 24 hours.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.060
Third favorite for beauty, I'm going to do
those at the same time because these are nail

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.060
polishes.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.820
The first one is this love and beauty nail
polish from forever 21 - this one is called

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.030
"Neon coral" I actually have it on my nails
right now, but don't mind my nails because

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.460
they are disgusting!

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.330
They are v dry bad!

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.390
I've been cleaning all day so they have chipped
and faded off.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.480
So, don't mind that.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.260
But, I do have the neon coral on my nails
and then I put little dots from china glaze.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.790
This one is in the color "Passion" so, its
like a nice gold color.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.200
And I really love them together.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.390
Gold and coral for summer?!

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.489
I'm really loving that.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.310
The last product that I have for beauty is
going to be a lipstick, this is going to be

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.129
by Milani cosmetics.

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.019
This is the color 01 sweet nectar I have it
on my lips right now.

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.709
And, I love it you guys!

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.750
I'm loving orange for spring and I know you
all requested an orange type of makeup look,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.549
so that will be coming very soon!

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:51.599
But yeah, this is my favorite lipstick for
the month and I've been wearing it so much.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.610
I highly recommend their color statement lipsticks
because they are just amazing, they don't

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.730
dry out my lips, they are very moisturizing
and they last a long time.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.829
That would be my last beautiful favorite for
the month of March!

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.099
Okay, so I have body care/skincare stuff.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.660
The first thing I want to talk to you guys
about is the clean and clear acne gel.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.629
This is called Persa gel 10.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:19.340
And it has 10% benzoyl peroxide in it so its
going to give you maximum results.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.702
I've been breaking out a lot around my face.

00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:25.239
I don't know if it's just the weather change,
or what's going on.

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.900
But i've been using this clean and clear gel
and usually, what i'll do is wash my face,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.669
scrub it.

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.769
Get it nice and clean, tone it and I will
apply this to the spot that I need too first,

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.999
then i'll go in maybe 2-3 minutes later with
my moisturizer for the night.

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.840
But, this has been helping me.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.329
If you have acne prone skin or you are dealing
with hormonal breakouts,or, anything like

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.400
that.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.980
It is an amazing product and it is over the
counter so you don't have to worry about getting

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.609
a prescription for it.

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.999
For body, I have my degree motion sense deodorant.

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:08.540
I know, it's a little crazy to talk about
a deodorant but, Hey, I sweat like a man ha;f

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.540
the time.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.029
I workout a lot so I have to find something
that works, and that keeps the pits nice and

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.029
dry.

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.180
And this has been doing it for me.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.150
For about, 6-8 months, I wanna say, I was
using the Dove, the dove... what is it called?

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.570
It's like the one that like, gets the darkness
away and smoothes the underarms.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.250
And that really worked for a while and during
summer time, I kind of have to switch it up.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.990
I really love the new degree.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.670
This one is a motion sense, it's called sexy
intrigued and, it goes on clear.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.640
I wear black all the time so I would know.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.790
And the smell is so fresh and so clean!

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.400
I forgot, but this Is my Nume megastar flat
iron, I did a full on review on this and a

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.770
few people told me that they actually bought
it and they love it!

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.570
My sisters as well, I do have a coupon code
down below and you can get this for $79 instead

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.250
of $199.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.960
It is the numb website best selling flat iron
and I absolutely love it!

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.650
I'm not going to talk anymore about it.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.510
I'll have that video link down below if you
want to check it out!

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.480
And Ido have a book that i've been reading
for the month of march.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.470
And it is the Divergent book and I absolutely
love it!

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.120
I know that the movie is already out and I
can't wait to see it!

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.790
I really want to see it!But I really Like
this book!

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.681
Its like hunger games, but it gives you a
little bit more then the hunger games book!

00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:30.560
I read that book in one day!

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.200
This one took me 1-2 days of course because
I had to do mommy stuff.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.960
If I could just sit there and just read, read,
read I really would!

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.380
Ej got me the other 2 um... part of the trilogy
if this one.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.280
So, I will be reading those!

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.420
And the next one is my planner.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.020
I'm going to go in-depth of the planner; and
show you everything that's inside of it - but

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.530
i will say that it has been a lifesaver for
the past 3 months for me.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.990
I've been scheduling my videos.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.920

and Thursday and i'm still trying to figure

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.610

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.270
