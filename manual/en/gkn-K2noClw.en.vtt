00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
Hey guys Chrisfix here today. I want to talk about the top 10 mistakes people make with their car mistake number one

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.779
I see people do this all the time they get in their car. They start  it up, and they drive right away

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.119
That's not good for the engine you need to give the engine at least [10-15] seconds to get the oil to the critical

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.969
components, and let the rPMS drop down older cars

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.680
You should give you even more time and in cold weather you might want to give your car 20 30 seconds to start up

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.499
Especially when it's below freezing, the oil is really thick what you should do is get in the car start it up

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.679
give it 10 15 seconds put your seat belt on and stuff and

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.259
then drive

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.439
The second mistake I see people make is [they] start their car

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.000
They drive away, and they rev it up or they push the car hard before it warms up

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.909
You should always wait [till] your engine gets to operating temperature before you push the car hard or rev it or accelerate quickly?

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.149
Obviously if it's an emergency situation you got to do what you got to do

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.639
But never [beat] on cold engine the third mistake is putting premium in a car. That only needs regular you're not helping your car

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.809
There's no performance benefit

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.569
There's no better fuel economy nothing

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.599
all octane is is the measure of how hard it is for the gasoline to explode you can see?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600
My truck it says right in the [owner's] manual

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.759
Regular gasoline putting premium won't help you could see on my corvette. It says premium recommended, so you could put premium

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760
But you could also put regular because it's not required

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.719
[mistake] number four changing your oil every 3,000 miles today's oils are way better than they were back then

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.089
So that old 3000 mile oil change is a thing of the past

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.900
Today's oils could last 5000 7500 and even synthetics they can last up to 15,000 miles from my truck I do

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.379
7500 mile intervals for changing the oil and that's using conventional oil for my corvette I do 5,000 mile intervals

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.829
That's using full synthetic oil and for my new fiesta in the owners manual

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.279
It says there's a 15,000 mile service interval for the oil mistake number five people don't inspect their car often enough

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.040
it's important that you inspect your car because you're driving every day can't just take it for granted that your tires aren't flat that your

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.040
Oil is correct that you have enough coolant that you have enough windshield wiper fluid

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.699
We should do is when you're in a parking lot instead of going right to your car go

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.920
Take a walk around it real quick check all four tires turn your lights on turn your flashers on make sure your blinkers are working

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.019
Make sure your headlights are working make sure your taillights are working

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.229
It's a quick thing might prevent you from getting a ticket and it could save your life

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.669
Number six people don't check their tire pressure you want to make sure you don't over inflate and you want to make sure you don't

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.939
Under inflated tire pressure for your car is located on the inside door jamb of the driver's side you can see here my truck

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.599
Recommends 30 PSI make sure you check your tire pressure when the temperature changes

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.289
10 degrees or more mistake number seven people don't look at their tires enough

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.260
It's important to look to see how much tread depth you have left. You can see here

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.539
I'm using a penny and a quarter the top of abe Lincoln's head is to 30 seconds of tread left and the top of George

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:42.138
Washington's head is for 30 seconds to 30 seconds is the legal limit [you] don't want to be anywhere below that and it's dangerous if

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.619
You are the other thing you want to look for is you want to look for any cracks any?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.769
slashes and

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.349
gouges into the tire and the final thing is you want to look at the wear on the tire you can see here on the

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.289
Inside of my tire, it's worn down a lot and on the outside. It actually looks good

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.870
So if you didn't take a close look you might think attire is good

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.870
But in reality these tires need to get replaced

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.049
Finally don't cheap out on new tires if you get them you know they're one of the most important items on your card

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.409
Mistake number eight people don't check their spare tire they forget about it

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.179
They just leave it there and then when they need it. It's flat and what good is a flat spare tire do nothing

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.220
So you can see here my spare is actually flat

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.388
So you need to make sure you fill it up with [air] and also locate where the air is coming out if it's flat

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.668
Mistake [number] nine people don't read the [owners] manual

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.789
Reading the owners manual is one of the most fundamental things when you get a car

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.268
It's simple takes two hours three hours [you] read through the whole book

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.489
You should know what every button does in your car and what every gauge means in your car also every car is different

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.599
so if you're driving one car

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.238
and you move to another you should know the difference between the two cars a

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.129
Mistake number 10 people don't know how to clean their car properly one of the things I see people do all the times they use

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.658
Paper towels on their paint or they don't use any liquid when they're using a towel on their paint you need to have some type

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:45.260
of lubricant

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.239
And you shouldn't use paper towels when you're cleaning off your paint what you should do is you should use a microfiber cloth and have

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.649
Some type of lubricant, so some type of liquid and because cleaning your car is such a big problem

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.260
