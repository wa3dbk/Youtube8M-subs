00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.333
- NORMALLY,
AROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR,

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.166
I SEND MY WRITER AMY ALONE
TO A HAUNTED HOUSE,

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.733
BUT THIS YEAR, I DISCOVERED
SOMETHING EVEN BETTER:

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.166
SENDING MY PRODUCER ANDY
WITH HER.

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.500
LAST WEEK, I SENT THEM BOTH

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.833
TO THE HALLOWEEN HORROR NIGHTS
AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.266
IT WAS EVEN BETTER
THAN I IMAGINED

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.000
IN MY WILDEST DREAMS.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.666
IT ALREADY HAS OVER
4.5 MILLION HITS ON YOUTUBE.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.333
AND THE OTHER DAY, I THOUGHT,
"WELL, LET'S KEEP DOING THIS."

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.500
SO I SENT THEM BOTH TO
THE QUEEN MARY'S DARK HARBOR...

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.333
[cheers and applause]

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.833
WHICH APPARENTLY
IS EVEN SCARIER,

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:34.166
WHICH MAKES ME EVEN HAPPIER.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.733
LET'S WATCH.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.800
[sinister carnival music]

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.066
- HI, ELLEN.

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.600
WE'RE AT THE QUEEN MARY'S
DARK HARBOR,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.633
AND ANDY AND I ARE ABOUT TO GO
THROUGH THE CIRCUS MAZE.

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:43.166
- IT'S CALLED THE CIRCUS MAZE?
- ARE YOU READY?

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.333

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.166
ANDY, YOU HAVE TO GO FIRST.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.166
OH, NO!

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.666
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.333
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
ANDY!

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.900
- IT'S FINE.
WE'RE GOOD.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.333
WE'RE GOOD.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.500
- I DON'T LIKE THIS ONE.
ANDY.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.500
