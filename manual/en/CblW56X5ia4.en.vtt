00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.999
Eldon: There we got a little something on

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.999
Got a fish on, Landry! Want to reel it in?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.999
Landry: Yeah!  
Eldon: Hold on to it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.999
Crank it in!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.999
Keep cranking, keep cranking

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.999
Oh! There he took off.  Looky there! Crank it in!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.999
He's a little feisty - keep cranking!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.999
Need to get it in here and see what it is.  Ahh.. there we go
0:00:45.000,0:00:43.999
Little bluegill - not too bad.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.999
He's big enough to take home and get a little fillet off of.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.999
Landry: he's a sunfish.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.999
Eldon: They seem to be liking the nightcrawlers tonight.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.999
Landry: oh yes.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.999
Eldon: You'd better sit down, Landry.  You don't want to go spoosh into the water.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.499
Or I'll have to fish you out!

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.999
Landry: Huh?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.499
Eldon: You don't want to fall in the water.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.999
Landry: Then what will we have to do?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.999
Eldon: I'll have to try to get you out of the water again.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.800
We're out here on the Blair's Valley Lake. I have my son Landry with me.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.066
It's a beautiful evening to be out - the water is real still.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.266
Hardly any wind, hardly any waves.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.866
We're trying to see what we can hook into. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.466
I'm not familiar with this lake so I'm not sure what I should even be fishing for.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.999
So we're just throwing out some European nightcrawlers.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.999
We already have a bluegill in the bucket, so apparently there are some bluegill in here.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.999
So we'll keep fishing and see what we can find.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.999
There we go!  We got something.  Do you want to reel it in?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.999
Landry: (excited noises)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.999
Eldon: Keep reeling - we got him.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.999
Probably another bluegill - we'll take him.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.999
Got two of them - may as well get a few more in the bucket.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.999
Landry: Ohh!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.999
Eldon: There we go!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.499
See? See the bobber? It disappeared! The bobber's gone!

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.999
There - Ohhh!  He got free.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.999
I think he got free, Landry.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.999
See the bobber? The bobber went under!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.999
We must have something!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.999
Go ahead and reel it in.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.999
There you go, keep cranking!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.999
Crank him in - he's on there!

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.999
Got him hooked!

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.999
Landry: Woah.. there he is. (excited babbling)

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.999
Landry: Come! Come up here!

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.999
Eldon: There we go - number four!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.999
Didn't even get the worm.  We can use the worm again.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.999
Landry:  (singing an unidentified hymn)

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.999
Landry:  (yelling and laughing)
