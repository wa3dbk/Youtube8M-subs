00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:01.909
Hello!

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.029
In this video, I'll start with a story for
you

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.350
Hey, Peops!

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm traveling in Argentina

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.509
And I want to share something really nice
with you

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.509
And it is...

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:17.509
LEGO! Lord of the Rings!

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.390
I bought it here for 95 pesos, and that's
about U$10

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.390
It looks like very nice!

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.390
And I'm playing with it nooww!

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.390
TAAA DAAA!

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.390
Give you my Heart Container if you missed
one

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.390
Well, that's it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.390
Here, this one

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.390
I really liked it

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.390
But five minutes after I made that video

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.390
I've started to think I'd definately NEVER
open it

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.390
It'd stay in the box

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.850
But I'm givin' up

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.600
That's why I made this video!

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.600
Look at that!

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
It feels like you MUST play with it

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.600
So this is what I'm gonna do

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.989
I'll play with it!

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.340
The price was very cheap, speacially for LEGO
here in Brasil

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.340
The country of taxes!

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.340
I got very excited, and bought it at first
sight!

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.340
I wasn't really a LEGO fan

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.940
But things have changed for me!

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.940
Very well,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.940
Let's open it!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.940
Seriously, I'm opening it

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.940
Let's do it!

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.940
Can I open it?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.980
Enough. Let's start.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.980
Here is the box

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.980
Don't trust the recommended age

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.980
Some pictures of it when it's ready

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.550
It's so nice I think I'll buy other LEGOs
too.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.440
I've started it!

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.190
They're all divided by those plastic packages

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.900
There are some pieces that I can't identify

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.900
And a carrot!

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.900
Another plastic package

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.900
I can see Gandalf's hat!

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.900
Here, a horse

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:34.510
And the instructions for you to build it,
I believe

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.440
So that's it!

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.350
In my next video

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.850
I'll show you all the building process

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.270
Seems good.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.390
I opened it

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.640
And I regret nothing

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.820
Thought I'd be a little sad..

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.170
A little depressed..

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.300
But I'm not! YEY!

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.819
So next week I'll show you the complete process

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.420
And some extra things I've prepared!

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.140
Just wait for it!

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.140
That's ok.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.860
Bye bye!
