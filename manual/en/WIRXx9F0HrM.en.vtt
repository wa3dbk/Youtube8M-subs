00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.529
stemware about it like

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.509
i think it would be prepared to take a
break from it all the questions were

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.369
like one-word pledge

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.169

this issue but i don't know what was it
jada ho founder his whole thing was like

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.160
this matter thing

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.390
where it was like

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.060

difference between you and uh...

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.470

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.029
ridiculous question you don't mind
reader

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.260
your job is to ask questions

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620
that will reveal the differences between
them

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.840
you don't ask

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.200
the candidates and their

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.030

your your your here actually like that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.829
you providing one more level of
mediation of what it is that they

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.130
believe

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.659
uh... you know you putting like america
it it's it's it's bizarre

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.010
in fact in the email jim lehrer sure
taken it one step further

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.800
and had someone ask

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.860
lear

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.520
to ask them

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.650
what they think the differences between
their art

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.110
images ridiculous are not going to take
any social media questions

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.840
because i wanna ask of arab jews
question

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.450

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.860
directed by some other form of i can
come up with my own way of being up to

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.930
these

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.640
it was ridiculous

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.590

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.369
