00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:06.899
INTERVIEWER: Just angle it a little, uh, down.
Towards the lens. There you go.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.490
GARY: Like that? OK. Frasier loves a rosette
so we always go to that when it’s in view.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.490
FRASER: I love science. I love communicating
and exploring about space and astronomy. I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.270
want other people to enjoy this stuff as much
as I do.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.349
FRASER: My first instinct is always to set
up the telescope and just go - you look first.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.430
So when Google Plus came out I thought wouldn’t
it be cool if we could get a telescope streaming

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160
an image right into the hangout.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.110
FRASER: And Mike’s got just this monstrous
telescope that he’s built himself.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.030
MIKE: And I hadn’t even done a hang out
yet and I’m like this actually sounds really

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.340
intriguing, right. It’s telescopes, it’s
computers. Let’s figure this out, let’s

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.600
try it.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.170
FRASER: He emailed me and he said “I think
I’ve got it working” and he invited me

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.850
into a hangout and there it was. You know,
there was the moon. I was hanging out with

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.989
the moon.
That was when I knew we could do anything.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.730
You know, let’s get more telescopes. Let’s
get different points of view.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.360
FRASER: Everyone this is Umair. He’s based
in Pakistan and we’ve got Peter who’s

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.080
in Australia.
We’re getting people from Mexico and South

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.229
America and South Africa. Malaysia.
Hey, there’s Pamela.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.380
PAMELA: Hey Fraser.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.390
FRASER: And now suddenly there’s a way,
with almost no effort, we’re able to bring

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.650
all of these people together and put on a
show.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.140
GARY: (Laughter) Too close.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.360
FRASER: Everyone good to go? I’m going to
click on start broadcast. We’re public in

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.360
3 2 1. Hi everybody. Once again we’re going
to have our Virtual Star Party.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.880
Working the telescopes tonight we’ve got
Stuart Foreman, he’s the one showing the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.659
moon right now. We’ve got Gary Gonnella,
what’s your view Gary?

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.869
GARY: The Monkeyhead, it’s in the upper
part of Orion.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:48.820
FRASER: That’s really cool.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.750
PAMELA: If we were looking at this image in
color what we’d see is this is a beautiful

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.110
red nebula.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.659
PETER: It’s beautiful.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.130
FRASER: Well, I think everyone’s ready but
Mike. And no pressure Mike. Oh, I think I

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.130
see something. Can you move it a little down
Mike. There it is. Oh man, look at that.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.890
Don’t ever change cameras please (laughter)

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.810
MIKE: Just being in contact with these people.
Just talking to people. Some that you don’t

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.310
know, that you’re getting to know. Even
though they’re, you know, three time zones

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.060
and thousands of miles away.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.590
GARY: Somebody to share with. You know, it’s
nice when I look at my pictures and know I

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.010
did it. It’s wonderful, but to share it
with somebody.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.010
FRASER: Being able to look out into space
gives us context for how we live in our day

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.670
to day experience. It shows us that we’re
part of this bigger universe.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.110
Alright so Gary, you’ve got the rosette
for me?

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.489
GARY: I do.

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.230
FRASER: I mean for us. I mean for us, for
everyone to see (laughter). Not just me.
