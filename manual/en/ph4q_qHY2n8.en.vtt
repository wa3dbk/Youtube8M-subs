Now, something that I'm going to show you
also is how to apply bronzer. Bronzer is not

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.690
something you have to do, it's something that's
an option and I know a lot of us really like

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.070
to use it especially in the summer when you
want to have that bronze to glow and look

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.810
like you've been at the beach all day. But
it's not something you have to do, it's something

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.429
you can definitely use year around. You can
use it on the face as well as on the body,

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.599
if you want to give the body a little bit
more color, maybe on the shoulders or in the

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:40.540
cleavage area. Bronzer is something that I
would recommend using either instead of blush

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.820
or if you do use blush use it after blush
and that way you won't end up looking like

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.330
you have too much color on the skin. The ideal
way to apply the bronzer is to take a big

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.060
nice fluffy brush like this one, that way
it avoids the streaky look. If you use a brush

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.760
that is too small, you're going to end up
looking like you have stripes on your face.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.750
So just get a little bit and just kind of
tap off the excess and we're just going to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.710
sweep it across the skin. I like to concentrate
it on the areas of the skin where the sun

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.740
naturally hits if you're outside. So that
would be the forehead, maybe just a little

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.530
bit down on the chin and then you can just
use a little bit on the cheekbones, but be

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.100
very careful here that you're not apply too
much. Another quick tip is that you can apply

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:41.100
the bronzer just slightly under the blush
area and it helps to create a nice hollow

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:50.950
to the cheek and it really helps to define
your cheekbones. Again, I like to use bronzer

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.280
sometimes as my last step before I'm stepping
out. So do all of your makeup and just add

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.360
a little bit at the last moment and then you'll
be fine and won't have over keel. Don't forget

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:11.989
the neck area either, just maybe a little
bit on either side.

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.120
There's a lot of liquid bronzers out there,
those are fantastic as well, but for my money

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.859
I think a powder is much easier to use and
much easier to control as well. Fantastic,

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.180
now she has a bronze healthy glow!
