00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.950
Inside the Tanks...

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.800
...in association with...

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.460
...The Tank Museum...

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.950
...Richard "The Challenger" Cutland...

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.850
...The TOG II*.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.950
This monster behind me, is the TOG...

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.080
...or to be more accurate, the TOG II...

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.850
...and once again Wargaming...

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.610
...is at the world-famous Tank Museum...

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.810
...in Bovington, England...

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.250
...with another unique insight...

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.500
...into the world of tanks.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.440
Let me try to position...

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.300
...this beast for you.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.000
The clue is in the name, TOG, ....

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.920
...which was actually a nickname...

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.500
...that stood for 'The Old Gang'.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.840
This Old Gang included...

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.650
...some of the first tank pioneers...

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.970
...Stern, Tritton, Ricardo...

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.820
...Wilson, Swinton and D'Eyncourt...

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.170
...who, in Britain, in 1939, ...

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.180
...had been organised...

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.480
...into something called the...

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.520
...Special Vehicle Development Committee
...into something called the...

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.270
...Special Vehicle Development Committee

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.030
TOG I

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.680
Their fear was that the coming war...

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.800
...would be fought just as...

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.090
...the previous one had been...

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.880
...with lines of strong defences...

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.200
...that were enormously difficult...

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.980
...to penetrate.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.240
So they approached the British Army...

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.350

So they approached the British Army...

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.850
...with a proposal for a new...

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.120
...super-heavy tank...

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.120
...which could cross broken ground...

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.480
...and trenches, in support...

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.690
...of attacking infantry.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.800
A monster 'land ship'...

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.910
...that would cut a swathe...

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.200
..through enemy defences...

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.320
...and it was a monster.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.800
The first prototype...

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.860
...rolled out in 1940 and weighed...

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.680
...in at 81 tons...

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.360
...that's 25 tons more...

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.760
...than the Tiger I  and even 11 tons...

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.270
more than the Tiger II.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.850
As originally conceived...

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.380
...it had a 75mm howitzer in the hull...

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.760
...like the Char B1 Bis...

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.860
...and the first Churchill.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.550
With a tiny 2-pounder...

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.880
...in a small turret taken from...

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.740
...the Matilda II.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.500
Two more 2-pounders...

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.860
...in sponsons at the side...

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.860
...and no fewer than 4 machine guns...

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.460
...to provide all-round fire.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.110
Its armour, close to 75mm thick...

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.050
...could stand up to hits...

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.390
...from 47mm anti-tank guns...

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.920
...at 100 metres and also against...

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920
...105mm shell-fire.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.240
The tracks...

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.460
...just like early WWI designs...

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.170
...ran around the entire hull...

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.520
...and there was no suspension...

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.590
...for wheels at all.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.980
The whole lot was driven...

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.630
...by a petrol/electric arrangement...

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.140
...with a 600bhp diesel engine...

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.880
...driving an electric generator...

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.820
...which, in turn, powered motors...

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.450
...which drove the drive sprockets.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.850
The prototype did not impress...

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.370
...since the electric generator...

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.370
...overheated and burnt out...

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.920
...this was almost exactly the same...

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.600
...set up that Ferdinand Porsche...

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.370
...would later use...

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.810
...to drive his unsuccessful...

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.650
...prototype for the Tiger I...

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.720
...which also had a nasty tendency...

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720
...to catch fire.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.670
TOG II

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.050
Tank technology and the new style...

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.090
...of tank warfare...

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.740
...epitomised by the blitzkrieg...

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.080
...were already moving on...

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.310
...and the TOG I was abandoned...

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.690
...in favour of a redesigned TOG II...

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.960
...and this one here...

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.760
...is the only surviving example.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.580
It was just as heavy...

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.800
...as the first prototype...

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.780
...but incorporates some improvements.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.240
The tracks were no longer WWI style...

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.100
...that run from the front idler...

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.000
...through a tunnel...

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.640
...to the rear drive sprocket.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.200
The sponsons were also gone...

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.500
...and a side door for the 6 man crew...

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.240
...was installed above the track tunnel.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.240
It also now had suspension...

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.960
...as well as 2 electric generators...

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.260
...which actually seemed to have...

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.440
...functioned quite well...

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.760
...although it was still...

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.280
...hopelessly under-powered...

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.960
...with a top speed of just under...

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.880
...14 kilometres per hour.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.640
On top, the puny 2-pounder...

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
...ridiculous on a tank of this size...

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.040
...had finally been dropped...

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.100
...and a varitety of turrets were tried...

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.820
...culminating in this one...

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.920
...mounting a 17-pounder gun.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.180
This had been lifted wholesale...

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.020
...from the challenger...

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.800
...good name...

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.640
...a 17-pounder version...

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.940
...of the Cromwell cruiser tank.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.160
The whole mounted 75mm Howitzer...

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.080
...had also gone...

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.700
...replaced by 7.92mm BESA machine gun.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.160
In short, it had begun to look...

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.620
...like a WWII tank...

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.960
...rather than a WWI throwback.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.460
Inside

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.760
Let's now take a look...

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.080
...inside this monster.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.820
The first position...

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.940
...is clearly identified...

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.600
...in the centre of the vehicle and towards the front...

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.860
...is the driver's position.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.860
Just to the right of the driver...

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.960
...we would have found one of our...

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.520
....7.92mm BESA machine guns...

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.720
...and you can see the port there...

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.080
...where it would have been mounted.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.120
Directly behind that...

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.560
...you can see...

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.720
...this very large turret basket.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.200
Now this would have actually moved...

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.860
...obviously, in turn with the turret...

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.480
...and located up, inside the turret...

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.740
...we would have found the commander...

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.480
...the gunner...

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.280
...and the first of our 2 loaders.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.280
As for the second loader...

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.820
...well nobody's really too sure...

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.040
...where his actual position was...

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.720
...so we're assuming...

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.720
...that he would somewhere...

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.400
...be wandering around inside...

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.060
...the rest of this vast compartment...

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.300
Engine

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.200
Look at the amount of room...

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.180
...you've got on the back decks...

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.860
...of this vehicle.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.360
It's absolutely incredible.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.320
I mean, there's enough room...

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.480
...to hold a party here.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.920
Directly in front of me...

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.800
...you can see we've got this...

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.680
...great big 600 horsepower...

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.480
...diesel engine.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.580
Behind the engine...

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.000
..we have the 2 generators...

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.700
...and behind those generators...

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.300
...we had 2 electric motors...

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.900
...that drove the rear sprockets.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.920
End of the Line

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.780
Even had it gone into production...

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.440
...it's very doubtful whether the TOG...

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.180
...would have ever had any useful role...

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.000
...on the battlefield...

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.100
...other than making...

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.540
...a nice, big target.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.580
The problem was that...

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.540
...other, better tanks...

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.620
...had already arrived...

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.620
...which, between them, could match...

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.880
...or out-perform the TOG...

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.860
...in every way.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.940
The Churchill for armour protection...

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.440
...and the infantry support.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.380
The Sherman...

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.260
...for speed, manoeuverability...

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.180
...and eventually, firepower.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.720
So the TOG remains an oddity.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.600
A tank that looked backwards...

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.540
...in warfare...

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.980
...that was moving forwards...

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.120
...and a warning...

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.320
...that the demands of war...

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.040
...often require revolution...

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.680
...not just evolution.
