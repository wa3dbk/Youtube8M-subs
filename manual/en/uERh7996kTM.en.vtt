00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.909
Taking a bit of a look at a boring subject

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:05.130
but one that's quite important for Android
phones.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.419
Anti-virus software.

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.149
So here is Norton's anti-virus.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.199
And this is the lite version.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.929
I have my misgivings about most Norton
software but it tends to be one of the most

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.769
popular ones on the market,
heavily promoted etcetera.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.720
So on here you have anti-theft and 
anti-malware, 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.050
as well as call blocking and web protection
if you stump up for the full version.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.300
Instead of anti-theft, it allows you to send

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.460
SMS messages.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.290
I'm not going to give them my details.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.140
The anti-malware tries to scan all of the stuff
on your phone and  have a look if you've got

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.300
anything dodgy on there that needs to be
removed.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.680
Presumably, it also 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.310
gives an update on any APK's you download
as well, and checks those

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.310
before it actually lets you install.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.390
Certainly seems to be taking a while, 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.800
As with anything, 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.020
when you're downloading for Android, just be
aware of 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.600
the source as it were. There's an awful lot of 
great apps out there but there's

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.990
also plenty of apps out there that are 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.980
looking to steal data etcetera.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.970
Just be aware of the permissions the app
is using etcetera.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.070
Don't go downloading APK's off the web, you
know, especially not if it's a leading game 
app that happens to be

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.070
hacked or cracked. Most likely someone's
stuck a bit of malware in there as well.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.630
There you go, no malware found. Hooray!

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.300
It's a very basic app from Norton, 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.270
They seem to really want you to 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.700
go in and spend some extra money.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.130
Not a right lot of settings.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.000
Looks quite useful, ongoing notifications,
presumably, 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.290
ongoing notifications even.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.910
Why do I want to know that Norton is sitting there
using up my memory?

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.500
But anyway, that's Norton anti-virus for Android.
