00:00:00.045 --> 00:00:01.201
- Well hello everyone.

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.202
My name is Tyler Oakley,

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:04.304
and I feel like it has been forever

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.742
since I answered any of your questions.

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:07.174
So I thought, you know what,

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.943
let's just get down to business.

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:12.412
Not to defeat the Huns but
instead to answer your questions,

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.716
because it is time for another Q and Slay.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.184
My good friend, Julie, would like to know

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.786
what fast food could
you never live without?

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:22.556
And, I mean, it's hard for me to decide.

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.032
It's like you know the
movie, Sophie's Choice,

00:00:24.032 --> 00:00:27.188
where she has to choose which
of her children must die?

00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:29.863
My version of Sophie's
Choice would have to be

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.733
Taco Bell and Panda Express.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.036
I can't not love both of my children.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.504
I can't kill one or the other.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.608
I need them both in my life.

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:39.932
To survive, I need them both.

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:40.941
Good question, Julie.

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:42.205
Brownie_Hugger would like to know

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:44.768
what color is North West antichrist red?

00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:46.313
So if you listen to the podcast,

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:49.998
you would know all about
North West antichrist red.

00:00:49.998 --> 00:00:51.030
I'm not going to get into it.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.622
Listen to the podcast
if you'd like to know

00:00:52.622 --> 00:00:55.047
what we are talking about, but let me see.

00:00:55.047 --> 00:00:56.613
The outfit that Grace Helbig is wearing

00:00:56.613 --> 00:00:59.126
on the cover of her new
book, Grace's Guide,

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.461
which you can get in bookstores or online.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.195
The link is below.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.038
Bailey would like to know,
are you hella Christmas?

00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:05.532
And I would have to say,

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:09.536
as soon as like the minute
is past, Halloween is over,

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:13.140
November 1st, it's Christmas music time.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.061
Do not disturb.

00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:15.339
In fact, I have been like listening

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:16.533
to Christmas music since July.

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.410
I am ready.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.013
The new Pentatonix
Christmas album, incredible.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:20.514
Love it.

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:21.248
Enjoy it.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:21.915
Get it.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.773
You're gonna die.

00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:23.522
Lydia would like to know,

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:25.432
what are you recommending
this month on Audible?

00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:27.988
And as you guys know, I
recommend a new book every month.

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.412
We have a little book
club going on right here.

00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:31.565

but you can pick any book.

They have over 150,000 titles.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.231
I recommend a book every single month.

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.566
This month I am recommending Gone Girl.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.135
I was obsessed with the movie.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.587
I saw it before I read the book.

00:01:43.587 --> 00:01:44.609
Now I'm reading the book,

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.940
and it's like so true to like the movie.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.161
So, I'm like very happy about it.

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:50.043
And everyone that's read
the book that saw the movie

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.406
said that they like match up perfectly.

00:01:51.406 --> 00:01:52.779
So, I'm like loving it.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.748
It is a roller coaster.

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:55.449

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.183

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.294
BoomitsHannah says, I wanna know

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.962
how cute are you feeling today?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:09.830
I'm feeling pretty cute.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.669
Honestly, I feel pretty cute today.

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.638
I got this shirt I think in my P.O. Box,

00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:14.668
and I really like it.

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.636
It shows off my beautiful muscles,

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.838
because I'm such a jock.

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:19.692
(laughs)

00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:20.974
But yes, I am feeling cute today.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.481
I was like, can I wear a sleeveless shirt?

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:23.617
I don't really know

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:26.479
But then I saw, this morning,
Troye Sivan's new video,

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.149
and it's all about life is
not about finding yourself.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.117
It's about creating
yourself and doing things

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:33.387
that you want to do because
you want to do them,

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:35.879
and life is all about taking those risks.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.111
To take that risk that
nobody else will make

00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:39.492
is what's going to set you apart.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.560
And so I was like, you know what?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.981
Sleeveless shirt today.

00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:42.700
Thanks Troye.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.798
Haley says, how do you
feel about this picture?

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:46.333
(laughs)

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.674
When I saw it, I was like
okay, well, thank you for that.

00:02:49.674 --> 00:02:53.073
Honestly, it kind of freaks me
out in the best way possible.

00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:54.541
If there's somebody out
there with a foot fetish,

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.245
they are living their life by
watching this video right now.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.620
So thank you for giving that to them.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.049
But honestly, every time I make a video

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.058
I like log into Tumblr
like a minute after,

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:05.528
and there's already things like this,

00:03:05.528 --> 00:03:08.521
and I'm like, if there's one
thing that I am impressed by

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.624
it's my people, because they are quick

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:11.640
and they are talented.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.689
Rachrach would like to know,

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.161
are you sad to be leaving Top That?

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.646
As you guys know, I was a part of

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:17.903
a weekly pop culture countdown
show called Top That.

00:03:17.903 --> 00:03:19.356
If you want to check it
out, the link is below.

00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:20.600
It's still going to go on,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.651
but I am actually moving on from the show.

00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:25.004
I am focusing on some other projects

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.630
that I have wanted to work on for a while,

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.011
but I don't like to divvy up
my time and slice up who I am

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:34.481
and kind of give half-assed
efforts into different projects.

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.415
If I'm working on something,

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.150
I want to give 100% of
myself to something.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.919
So with that in mind, I was like

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.155
Becca, I want you to go full
speed ahead with Top That.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.223
I am going to go down this path

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.733
and work on these things that
I've always dreamed to do.

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:48.528
Em would like to know, left
butt cheek or right butt cheek?

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.498
And honestly, my left
butt cheek is ecstasy.

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:53.066
My right butt cheek is bliss.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.281
Try pickin between em.

00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:55.945
Girl, it's impossible.

00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:57.090
Honestly, I'm not gonna lie.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.405
I've got a nice ass butt.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.573
Nice ass-butt.

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:01.582
Nice (laughs) ass-butt.

00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:03.209
Yep, I've got a nice ass-butt.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.298
I am a cutie patootie with a rad ass booty

00:04:05.298 --> 00:04:07.447
that all the boys are
going to line up for,

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.683
whether it's your brother or
your dad or your boyfriend.

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.484
So, sorry about it.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.986
Zoe says, what is your favorite

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:15.041
Psycho Babble episode so far?

00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:15.952
(grunts)

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:16.517
Oh my gosh.

00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:17.024
I can't.

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:18.117
Honestly, I can't pick.

00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:19.726
They literally get better every week.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.214
The latest one was so funny.

00:04:21.214 --> 00:04:22.395
It was like a Halloween episode.

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.546
But the future one is even better.

00:04:24.546 --> 00:04:25.966
It's like all about boys.

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:28.301
So, it's just listen.

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.436
Go subscribe on iTunes.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.205
Homiephan wants to know, what
is the best website ever?

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:36.637
I would probably have to go
with tyleroakleytour.com.

00:04:36.637 --> 00:04:38.611
But yes, that is all I
have for you guys today.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.188
If you also are a cutie
patootie with a rad ass booty,

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:42.782
give this video a thumbs up.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.417
I will love you forever if you do.

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.386
I think we can get 100,000
thumbs up in the first day.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.287
I think we can do it.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.790
Go push the thumbs up button.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.555
I'm waiting.

00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:51.090
There we go.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.973

We are celebrating 1989.

00:05:01.727 --> 00:05:05.772
