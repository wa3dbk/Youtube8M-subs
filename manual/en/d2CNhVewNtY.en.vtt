00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:32.290
Alright, both of you! That’s enough!

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.556
No! I'm not done with him yet!!

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:35.998
Let go of me!

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:41.913
Maybe we should just let them settle this. Probably 
 the only real fight we’ll see tonight anyway.

00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:43.316
Bhima!!

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:46.515
Okay, okay. Get off of me. I’m done.

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:48.317
Enough, okay?

00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:54.285
Do you guys hear that?

00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:10.319
It’s the Rakshasa! Move!!

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:16.317
RAAAAWRRRR!!!!!!

00:01:16.317 --> 00:01:18.559
My leg! I’m pinned!

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:21.038
Duryodhana – grab the sword!

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:30.675
Aaaaahhhhh!

00:01:38.318 --> 00:01:40.670
I…I…

00:01:41.478 --> 00:01:44.850
(Offscreen) You have to do it, Duryodhana. Quickly, kill the beast!

00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:49.960
No…no – I...I can’t.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.040
RUN!!

00:01:54.668 --> 00:01:57.000
No!! Help me…please…!

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.320
No! No! No no no!!

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.640
You want him? You'll have to go through me first, demon!

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:08.550
Come on!!!

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.920
EEEEEeeeeeee

00:02:27.827 --> 00:02:32.010
May you have a better life in the next one.

00:02:34.438 --> 00:02:37.760
Master Drona – I’m sorry…

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.680
It’s Duryodhana who should be sorry.

00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:47.210
You can steal a man’s sword, boy, but you 
 can’t steal the courage to wield it.

00:02:47.213 --> 00:02:49.880
That has to be earned.

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:54.000
You may keep my sword Vinashak, Arjuna.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:01.720
A warrior who protects the weak even when facing certain 
 death brings honor to our code of super warriors.

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:06.720
Tomorrow, I shall start to teach you how to actually fight with the sword.

00:03:10.063 --> 00:03:13.760
Time passes. But I know his hatred for me has not.

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:19.240
It fuels him. And I fear it will undo us all.
