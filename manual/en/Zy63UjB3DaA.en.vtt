00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.000
Ginseng is a common name for about six
species of plants

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.250
that have been a highly prized for their
roots in general.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.070
There's really two varieties of ginseng
that are commercially grown

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.320
and those are American ginseng which is
panax quinquefolius

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.009
and Asian ginseng which is panax ginseng
and the word ginseng actually stands for

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.490
two

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.900
Chinese characters that together say
man root because sometimes ginseng roots do

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.439
tend to resemble human figure.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.489
Ginseng is just...refers to these the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.200
these plants in general. There's
generally two ways a growing ginseng in

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.270
a forest situation.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.210
The first would be called woods
cultivated. Woods cultivated

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.320
ginseng is defined by the fact that
some sort of mechanical tillage

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.920
is utilized to prepare the planting site,
but essentially woods cultivated ginseng

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.660
is grown in beds and those beds are
prepared by some sort of mechanical

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.950
cultivation.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.580
Typically it's going to require some
sort of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.940
spraying for diseases because the plants
are going to be crowded

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.750
and you will end up with roots that
will grow fairly large

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.840
fairly quickly but they will not really
resemble

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.950
wild ginseng which of course is going to
be the most highly prized ginseng.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.330
Wild simulated ginseng is ginseng
that is grown

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.860
without using any sort of mechanical
implements to till the soil.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.450
The only tools that are used are hand
tools such as rakes and grub axes and

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.409
things like that...scratchies for the soil
but basically no mechanical tillage

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.159
and typically that will be planted at a
much much lower rate.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.790
Twenty pounds per acre would be about
appropriate planting rate for wild

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.960
simulated ginseng

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.450
and that's going to result in ideally
about one plant per square foot, so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.490
that's the population that you'd be
shooting at

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.190
and quite often with wild simulated ginseng you do not need

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.909
to spray...you generally don't need to use
any pesticides

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.670
and of course you certainly wouldn't want to use any fertilizers in wild simulated

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.030
ginseng because you want to develop a
wild-looking root.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.540
In woods cultivated ginseng, you
might very well be adding a little bit

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.920
fertilizer, again, to try to get a big
group is quick as possible.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.799
The yields from woods cultivated ginseng
are going to be much much higher than

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.280
wild simulated ginseng.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.620
You might get 6...800 pounds or maybe even a thousand pounds or more

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.300
of dried route from an acre of woods cultivated ginseng,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.720
whereas a really good yield of wild
simulated ginseng for an acre would be

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.590
two or three hundred pounds of root. The
difference lies in the price that you

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.970
receive for those roots.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.130
Right now, while simulated ginseng is
selling for

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.610
six to eight hundred dollars I should
say per dry pounded New York

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.280
depending on how old it is... that would be
for typically 8- to 12-year-old root.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.900
Umm.. woods cultivated ginseng might bring
about half that price.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.190
Wild ginseng would probably sell, again,
from New York

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.510
wild ginseng would sell for somewhere in the
neighborhood of a hundred to a thousand

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.080
dollars a pound so

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.569
wild-simulated will bring prices that
are close to the price that are being

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.620
paid for wild

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.650
especially if it's grown on a good site
and the roots are big and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.510
healthy and vigorous and don't have any
evidence of disease.
