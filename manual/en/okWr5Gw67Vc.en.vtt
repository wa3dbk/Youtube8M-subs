Car Dealers in Red Deer: Get More Ups, Turns
and Profits with Smart Auto Dealerships

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:14.000
Is reputation management part of your car
dealership's marketing strategy?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.160
Marketing for car dealerships has changed
drastically in recent years, and many of the

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:26.710
traditional forms of advertising such as print,
radio, and TV have become less effective.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.820
Customers are now able to review dealerships
online and look at their options before deciding

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.910
on which dealership to go to.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.120
Your business depends on the reviews you have
and if you have any at all.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.530
Google+ Local has become the most important
place for reviewing dealerships online, and

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.220
review sites such as Insider Pages and Yelp
have become a common place for reviews as

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.830
well.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.090
Since Google+ Local and other review sites
show up in Google searches, Google has become

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.079
the main source of leads for many businesses.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.540
If you're not focusing your dealerships marketing
around local search, you're missing out on

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.560
many sales leads.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.510
From mobile websites to Google searches and
reviews, online reputation management is key

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.990
to getting more buyers into your dealership.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.690
Your dealership can interact directly with
your customers on social media sites like

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.571
Facebook and Twitter, and you can improve
your image by staying in touch with your customer

00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:29.780
base directly.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.440
YouTube is also a great way to improve your
social reach online.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.840
Many dealerships neglect their reputation
and website rankings online, and they don't

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.370
know where to start.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.200
The truth is that most of the leads go to
the top five Google+ Local listings with the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.330
highest reviews.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.960
Our company works with car dealerships throughout
the country to help them get targeted leads

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.170
through reputation management and marketing,
from designing high-converting websites to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.159
optimizing them for search engines and then
ranking those websites higher as well as managing

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.600
your reputation everywhere your customers
can find you.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.150
We can also help your dealership get a dramatic
increase in sales leads.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.780
You may ask yourself, "Why don't I just do
this myself?"

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.510
You could if you have a knowledgeable marketing
team who knows what works.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.200

your time doing what you do best.
