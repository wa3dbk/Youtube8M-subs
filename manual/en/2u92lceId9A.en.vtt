00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.933
- YOU ALSO ARE ON
"MASTERS OF SEX," RIGHT?

00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:02.933
- YES.

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.166
- NOW WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT--

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.666
HOW WAS YOUR FAMILY
WATCHING YOU DO

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.666
AN EPISODE OF "MASTERS OF SEX"?

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:12.033
- NOW, LUCKILY, I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY CRAZY ACTUAL SEX EXCURSIONS

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.666
WITHIN THE SHOW,
BUT I DID HAVE A SCENE

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.233
WHERE I HAD TO EXPLAIN
A SEXUAL EXCURSION.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.300
AND IT WAS VERY NERVE-RACKING,
BECAUSE MY MOTHER IS,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.700
LIKE,
PRETTY MUCH MY ACTING COACH.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.366
AND SHE'S LIKE,
"I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME MORE.

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.366
"I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME MORE.

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.633
"WHEN YOU GO INTO THAT MOMENT,

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.100
THINK ABOUT HIS HANDS
TOUCHING YOU."

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.533
I'M LIKE...

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.266
"DON'T DO IT, MOM.
DON'T DO IT."

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.000
SO THAT WAS VERY AWKWARD,
HER BEING THERE,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.933
BUT SHE'S COOL WITH IT ALL
ALWAYS.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.266
- WOW.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.100
THAT'S VERY WEIRD
FOR YOUR MOTHER TO TELL YOU

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.600
TO GIVE YOU MORE SEX TALK.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.100
- EXACTLY.
IT WAS VERY WEIRD FOR ME.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.266
BUT IT'S COMFORTABLE FOR HER.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.700
SHE'S LIKE,
"COME ON, GIVE ME MORE."

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.033
I'M LIKE, "SHARON."

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.000
I HAD TO CALL HER
BY HER REAL NAME.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.333
[laughter]

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.900
- YOU GET TO THAT POINT
WHERE YOU HAD TO.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.500
SO YOU TURNED 21,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.100
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT DRUNK

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.933
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
IN YOUR LIFE?

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.033
- YES, IN NEW ORLEANS.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.100
I HAD A REAL, LIVE HANGOVER,
YOU GUYS.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.866
AND I JUST NEED EVERYBODY
TO KNOW, ON THE TVs

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.900
THAT ARE PLAYING--
LIKE, THEY HAVE "THE HANGOVER."

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.933
THEY'RE NOT DOING IT.
THEY NEED TO TURN IT UP A NOTCH.

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.233
BECAUSE YOU LITERALLY FEEL LIKE
YOU HAVE THE FLU.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.300
THEY TRY TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
JUST YOUR HEAD HURTS.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.833
I FELT LIKE MY HEAD
WAS FALLING OFF!

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.666
I'M LIKE,
"THIS IS RIDICULOUS."

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.866
- IT'S HORRIBLE.

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.533
- AND, YOU KNOW,
I'M SO CLOSE TO MY PARENTS.

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.700
I TEXT MY MOM, AND I'M LIKE,
"YO, MOM," YOU KNOW,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.700
"I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT BE
COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.333
"LIKE, MY NOSE IS STOPPED UP,
MY HEAD IS HURTING ME.

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.666
"MY STOMACH MAY HAVE
A LITTLE SOMETHING AS WELL.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.100
"BY THE WAY, I DID DRINK
LAST NIGHT AS WELL,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.466
BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF IT"--

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.400
SHE'S LIKE,
"KEKE, YOU HAVE A HANGOVER."

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.266
I'M LIKE, "THIS IS THIS?

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.266
"THIS IS WHAT IT IS?

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.566
NEVER AGAIN.
NEVER AGAIN."

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.333
SO NOW I'M A LITTLE BIT
MORE COOLER WITH IT.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.333
- YEAH.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.366
SO HOW MUCH HAD YOU HAD--

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.000
DID YOU DRINK
ONE OF THOSE HURRICANES?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.433
- I DID!
THE GREEN THINGS!

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:48.133
[laughter]

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.433
THAT WAS--
LOOK, Y'ALL.

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:51.000
DON'T--
WHEN YOU GO TO MARDI GRAS,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.466
STAY AWAY FROM
THE BIG GREEN THING,

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.333
BECAUSE IT WILL HAVE YOU
LAID OUT.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.900
- YEAH.
- LAID OUT!

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.966
- IT'S CALLED A HURRICANE.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.466
THEY WARN YOU BY THE NAME,

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:02.433
AND IT'S ALSO
IN A GIGANTIC GLASS.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.766
- IT'S SO BIG.
IT'S SO BIG.

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:06.366
- NEW ORLEANS IS LIKE--
YOU KNOW,

00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:08.766
THAT'S WHAT IT'S KNOWN FOR
IS HANGOVERS.

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:09.766
[laughter]

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.033
AND GREAT FOOD
AND GREAT MUSIC

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:12.433
AND GREAT PEOPLE,
BUT BOY, OH, BOY.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.200
WELL, COME BACK AND SEE US
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.533
