00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.880
Here at the Georgia Tech Research Institute,
we are developing a lot of new technologies

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.520
to put in unmanned air vehicles. We recently
did several flight tests down in Fort Benning,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.740
Georgia, where we had multiple unmanned air
vehicles flying together, collaborating, negotiating,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.750
sharing tasks, flying in formation in an orbit.
We kept them separated by about 15 degrees,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.919
following one another, doing figure eights,
having a trailer follow a leader, doing different

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.610
maneuvers and showing that they should sense
each other. And these were all done autonomously

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.030
on the aircraft. The computer on the aircraft
did all that processing for them, by themselves.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.880
There's this tradeoff in unmanned air vehicles
systems called "SWAP," stands for, "size,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.000
weight, and power." So, whenever you're out
operating these vehicles, you have to do a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.140
tradeoff of, how big does the aircraft have
to be to carry all of these sensors? Instead,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.590
if you have multiple vehicles, they can each
carry different sensors or different payloads

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.049
and then they collaborate to use their payloads,
but there's a much smaller form factor. There

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.970
is multiple ways to use this technology and
use this capability. There's military applications,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.870
certainly, with the Department of Defense,
but there's a lot of homeland activities that

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.250
we can work on. So, for example, if you have
a forest fire and you wanted multiple unmanned

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.010
air vehicles to start searching where theyâ€”One
aircraft may see a small fire. It may call

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.020
another aircraft over to confirm that it's
a small fire, it's an escalating fire. Then

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.070
it can call a third vehicle over and it could
maybe drop some water on it or put out a chemical

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.240
suppressant. There's applications such as
pipeline monitoring or power line monitoring

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.960
or bridge inspection. We're looking at research
for advancing agricultural robotics. For example,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.350
hyperspectral sensors to start sensing plant
stress or drought conditions where we may

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.430
then choose to go and treat the crops locally
instead of having to treat the whole farm.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.780
I think the future is really exciting because
there's a lot that be done with these kinds

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.580
of unmanned air vehicles. Being able to get
the operator out of the loop or the operator

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.979
farther away from the danger is really a big
pay off for everyone in society.
