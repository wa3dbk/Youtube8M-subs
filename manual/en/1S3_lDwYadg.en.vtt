00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.500
I think I’ve found it: the best Star Wars
game.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.661
Sure, sure, you’ve got your Battlefront,
and your Republic Commando (both great games),

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:30.961
and I am not, by any means, an expert on Star
Wars video games, but Star Wars: Knights of

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.790
the Old Republic is what fans dream of in
regards to an immersive, interesting, and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.410
fun Star Wars RPG.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.820
Or what they dreamt of up until the game’s
release in 2003 for the Xbox and PC.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.050
Developed by the seemingly more PC-focused
BioWare and published by LucasArts, Star Wars:

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.550
Knights of the Old Republic is a must-play
for fans of the expansive space opera franchise,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:02.470
and for anyone looking for a great RPG.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.790
The most intriguing aspect of Knights of the
Old Republic’s design is its appeal hopefully

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.979
regardless of feelings towards Star Wars media
beyond the original trilogy.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.230
Knights is technically a prequel, but not
in the same time frame as the controversial

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.890
films, instead taking place 4,000 years before
the Empire came about.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.370
The story then follows a player-created character
that does in fact have a canonical identity,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.350
much like Commander Shepard in BioWare’s
other space epic, Mass Effect.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.420
And much like that game, and BioWare’s even
more similar Dragon Age: Origins, Knights

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.570
features the ability to interact with the
varied cast of characters that eventually

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.530
fill the ranks of your party, increasing the
emotional impact of some of the game’s key

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.120
plot twists.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.370
Ultimately, the ending of the game and your
role in said plot twists depend on a karma

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.460
system.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.270
The choices influencing said karma system
and the subsequent turn to the light or dark

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.800
side aren’t labeled as good or bad.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.380
This is a welcome design choice considering
some of the less immersive, obvious choices

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.850
present in more recent games.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.310
That being said, it’s still pretty obvious
what will happen after responding a certain

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.530
way in the somewhat dynamic dialogue system,
if the player does in fact have a solid moral

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.030
compass.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:21.739
But let’s be honest, we don’t, because
we play video games, so we’re all murderers.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.550
Speaking of murdering, gameplay!

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.920
Knights of the Old Republic features a round-based
combat system, in which gameplay can be paused

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.220
and commands can be issued, but actions are
ultimately carried out without real-time player

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.980
input, similar to, well, Dragon Age: Origins.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.650
Up to two other party members can be brought
into the environment and combat upon leaving

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.870
the home starship, the Ebon Hawk, and certain
quests and objectives may be unreachable without

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.740
the aid of your thief, droid, or Wookie friends,
among the six other possible allies.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.830
RPG mechanics surrounding the moment-to-moment
combat feature genre staples like specific

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.569
skill leveling, new feat and power allotments,
class-specific equippables, weapon and armor

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.460
upgrades, NPC interaction, and numerous side
quests.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.630
But similar to other BioWare RPGs and unlike
other popular Western RPGs like Skyrim, Knights

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.650
features more linear environments.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.569
Upon landing on one of the several planets,
such as Tatooine, the physical route necessary

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.980
to reach the main quest objective is very
clear, with a few exceptions.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.069
This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though,
because

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.290
it only emphasizes the non-linear choices,
character interactions, and lore obtained

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.130
from said characters, and the game still manages
to reach a pretty hefty total playtime upon

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.130
completion.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.741
Despite all it does right, the story, the
choices, the incredible worlds and lore, and

00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:39.080
the tactical gameplay, Star Wars: Knights
of the Old Republic isn’t perfect, especially

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.970
when viewing it through a modern lens.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.340
The game still looks great, voice acting is
incredible, especially for the aliens and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.580
character of Carth, and music is characteristically
Star Wars, but the flaws are more prevalent

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.250
in game design rather than in technical terms.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.780
Sure, cutscenes are a little stiff, and backgrounds
look more like less-impressive backdrops,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.400
but you may have noticed my couple of comparisons
between Dragon Age: Origins, and that’s

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.460
because it’s pretty similar and was also
developed by BioWare.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.060
I also absolutely love that game.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.790
But fandom aside, it’s clear to see that
BioWare had perfected the formula they did

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.790
so well in Knights.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.500
I don’t mean to suggest that it’s any
less of a game, and Dragon Age certainly isn’t

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.580
Star Wars, but modern gamers might find a
few archaic devices in its design.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.590
Regardless, BioWare created a true gem and
the best Star Wars video game experience with

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.630
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, one
that nevertheless stands the test of time

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:38.629
and is a must-play, and must-own, for Star
Wars and RPG fans alike.
