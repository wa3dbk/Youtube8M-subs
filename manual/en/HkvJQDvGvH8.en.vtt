Sorry guys, just asleep under my desk. Since
the pep talk went so viral, everybody been

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.420
wanting me to do something. Look what I have
been doing!

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.000

"I think we all need a three ring binder"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.739
"I think we all need a potato chip"
"I think we all need absorbent paper towels"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
