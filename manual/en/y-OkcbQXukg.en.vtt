00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.460
Hi guys, and welcome to the prelude of my Let's Play video series.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.840
Now, this video I'm basically using as a chance to tell you

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.900
what I'm going to be doing. I am going to be doing an Orc mage playthrough,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.560
a kind of warlock-shaman type, very warlike character, power-mad.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.880
Well, not power-mad, but definitely after power, that type of character.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.260
I'm going to be focusing very much on the character's needs,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.680
so he's going to be focusing on developing his magic,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.040
power, etc., he's not going to be doing lots of sidequests,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.380
he's not going to be doing all the different factions, etc.,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.120
It's going to be a very focused playthrough

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.100
Now, I'm also going listing all my mods that I'm using in the description below,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.140
and I will often mention specific mods

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.580
that I am focusing on.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.780
Now, I'll try and answer some questions before,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.700
because certain questions I know I'm going to get asked.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.940
I am not using anything like ENB

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.780
or RCRN, and I'm using Realistic Lighting instead.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.740
The reason I'm doing that is purely for performance, because

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.440
I'm recording this entire playthrough

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.940
it's going to a bit demanding on my system.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940
Recording does put a lot of

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.080
extra work on the system.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.580
So I'm going to be using

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.880
mods like Realistic Lighting because, of
course, they give superb performance

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.040
while still great looking great.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.420
A lot of people have also asked
me to do different types of playthroughs

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.729
and you know they've asked me to be serious
or some have asked me to be

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.140
something else and I've decided I'm
actually just going to play this

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.950
as I would normally play, I'm gonna play it myself. It's going to be a little different

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.700
because I'm talking to you guys, which
will obviously

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.380
break the immersion a little bit, and it probably won't be that serious.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.179
I don't take these games that
seriously

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.239
and of course I've played many times so

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.050
I have to try hard to pretend
that I don't know what's coming.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.270
Oh, I love that general, great voice,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.420
big Battlestar Galactica star
here

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.430
and obviously he was Doc Mitchell in
Fallout New Vegas

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.290
so love that voice.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.560
Yeah, yeah, he's trying to have my head chopped off

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.860
but I can't hate him.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.500
Basically, I'm also going to cut the video I was
thinking about

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.650
just shipping it raw but I think I'll
cut it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.360
because that will be times when I'm just, I don't know, selling tons of

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.430
rubbish, wondering through the forest
not finding anything

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.069
and I'll just cut those out, I don't think
that's interesting at all.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.510
And of course sometimes I'll just stop
and talk about the mods

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.750
because really that's what I'm actually
aiming for

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.450
so I'm probably going to cut out the
character creation

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.489
while I pick my orc character. The hardest part

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.569
about picking a character is the name

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.920
you always want something cool, but

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.099
I kind of have difficulty with that.  I might actually,

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.920
I think I'm going to pick pick a very normal

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.129
boring name, just to be different,
just to make life difficult for myself.

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.819
you know it's hard to be an evil dark lord if your name's

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.750
Nigel or something isn't it.
So that's what I think I'm going to do.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.580
I don't like her. I don't know about you.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.840
Yeah, but that woman annoys me.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.529
I like this guy but he's very depressing.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.160
And this thief here seems to be the
most sensible

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.400
Lieutenant Rikke: Anyone else feel like running?

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.390
Yeah, me, actually.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.600
Honestly, I think I'd rather die that
way. Oh well.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.620
So, here is my Orc warlock.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.620
Pretty cool.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.040
Now, name the character
