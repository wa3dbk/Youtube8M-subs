00:00:00.143 --> 00:00:04.592
 Hello, in the video of this week I will explain how the oil is made for love 

00:00:04.593 --> 00:00:07.753
 It is an oil that you can use to consecrate candles 

00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:11.923
 both requests and rituals of love in rituals and requests 

00:00:11.923 --> 00:00:15.253
 any type provided they are related to love 

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.664
 you can use it with your perfume 

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:20.133
 because when you go to an appointment for example 

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.513
 you you can spread through the body 

00:00:22.513 --> 00:00:25.723
 when you have need to resolve a situation of love 

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:28.754
 because you worry and even to attract love 

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:30.964
 It can be used for many things 

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:35.454
 materials are needed to realize that it is 

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:38.574
 a bottle has to go where the oil 

00:00:38.574 --> 00:00:42.693
 almond oil can also use seed oil I prefer 

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:47.083
 almonds especially if you'll use to wear it on the body 

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:50.574
 attar of roses 

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:54.924
 incense must be pure frankincense to prepare oils 

00:00:54.924 --> 00:01:01.204
 It has to be not worth frankincense incense stick or cone incense 

00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:08.204
 brown cane sugar, cinnamon 

00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:12.273
 and a tiny sprig of rosemary 

00:01:12.273 --> 00:01:14.853
 thyme 

00:01:14.853 --> 00:01:18.453
 and a basil leaf 

00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:21.144
 you also have to get inside 

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:28.144
 a pink quartz, pink quartz teeny 

00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:34.154
 three of these tiny red candles and 

00:01:34.154 --> 00:01:36.714
 the first step is to light 

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:39.173
 white velon to make the request 

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:44.223
 whom you will have faith, the universe, God the angels to a planet to a 

00:01:44.223 --> 00:01:44.954
 goddess 

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:46.354
 whom you will have faith 

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:53.353
 because to give you strength in love in this oil you're going to make 

00:01:54.594 --> 00:01:55.994
 the next step 

00:01:55.993 --> 00:01:57.953
 It is put into 

00:01:57.954 --> 00:01:59.863
 bottle of thyme 

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:05.192
 thyme has the ability to avoid infidelities so you have to put it 

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:06.143
 basil 

00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:07.902
 a sprig of basil 

00:02:07.903 --> 00:02:09.994
 But that is no discussion 

00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:11.213
 the couple 

00:02:11.213 --> 00:02:14.293
 and there is good communication 

00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:15.762
 rosemary 

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:18.742
 so that you luck 

00:02:18.743 --> 00:02:21.282
 the cinnamon 

00:02:21.282 --> 00:02:24.463
 as is aphrodisiac because you have passion for 

00:02:24.463 --> 00:02:25.502
 in relaccion 

00:02:25.502 --> 00:02:31.482
 I put a big wand and if they are teeny can put three 

00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:32.893
 you have to put 

00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:34.122
 a pinch 

00:02:34.122 --> 00:02:38.282
 of sugar 

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:41.023
 no need to throw much 

00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:43.273
 also some granites 

00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:47.972
 incense, sugar sweetness 

00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:51.252
 incense is to activate 

00:02:51.252 --> 00:02:53.692
 the spiritual part 

00:02:53.692 --> 00:02:58.303
 rose quartz rose quartz has to be clean and charged 

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:02.273
 put a down how to clean and load amulets link 

00:03:02.273 --> 00:03:05.903
 and quartz we put it to avoid the negative energies 

00:03:05.903 --> 00:03:07.293
 which may affect 

00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:10.023
 the relaccion 

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:13.023
 you have to also put a whole bottle 

00:03:13.023 --> 00:03:20.023
 essence of roses 

00:03:30.512 --> 00:03:32.262
 filled vial 

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:35.302
 almond oil almond prefer because 

00:03:35.303 --> 00:03:38.192
 if you're going to use to put it in the body 

00:03:38.192 --> 00:03:40.122
 it is much better 

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:43.703
 with almond oil with seed oil 

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:50.703
 but we already leave to your choice 

00:03:55.252 --> 00:03:59.952
 once you already have all the ingredients inside 

00:03:59.953 --> 00:04:06.953
 you move well 

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:13.263
 uncover the 

00:04:13.263 --> 00:04:20.263
 and three red candles 

00:04:22.643 --> 00:04:24.023
 place them 

00:04:24.023 --> 00:04:26.363
 triangle shaped 

00:04:26.364 --> 00:04:29.453
 leaving oil in the center 

00:04:29.453 --> 00:04:34.054
 with a little of the same oil 

00:04:34.054 --> 00:04:35.564
 UNTAS candles 

00:04:35.564 --> 00:04:40.333
 Here up in the direction of clockwise 

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:47.333
 each of them 

00:04:54.662 --> 00:05:01.662
 the prendes always wooden matches 

00:05:07.994 --> 00:05:09.714
 and you leave the oil 

00:05:09.713 --> 00:05:11.132
 amid the 

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:12.673
 of the three velitas 

00:05:12.672 --> 00:05:14.912
 until completely consumed 

00:05:14.912 --> 00:05:17.282
 this candle is with you made the request 

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:21.484
 also you have to leave, it is not necessary to completely burn off 

00:05:21.484 --> 00:05:25.532
 and once they have completed it with the turn off 

00:05:25.532 --> 00:05:26.874
 one snuffer 

00:05:26.874 --> 00:05:30.994
 and and from there you can already use this oil as for as I told the 

00:05:30.994 --> 00:05:36.073
 principle for any ritual, request the body to wear it 

00:05:36.073 --> 00:05:38.184
 to untartelo with your perfume 

00:05:38.184 --> 00:05:40.943
 for anyone who is related to love 

00:05:40.943 --> 00:05:43.753
