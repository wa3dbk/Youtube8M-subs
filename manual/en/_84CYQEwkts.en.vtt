00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:07.546
I come from Ecuador, from Brazil
and I'm from Saudi Arabia.

00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:11.926
From Japan, from South Korea,
from Taiwan, I'm from Iraq,

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:14.726
from China, I'm from Lyon
in the south of France.

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:15.136
I'm from Yemen.

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:20.446
At the University of Minnesota
we integrate our LL.M. students

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:23.016
into every aspect
of the Law School.

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:25.116
The variety of academic
programming is something we're

00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:26.046
very proud of.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:29.846
Our students can choose from two
LL.M. degrees our general LL.M.

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:31.926
degree and our business
law LL.M. degree.

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:33.516
And within the general
LL.M degree,

00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:35.836
students have the
wide range of choosing

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:38.756
from eight different specialty
areas, or they can carve

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:40.186
out their own academic
curriculum.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:46.366
The program here really helps
me deepen my knowledge in areas

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:48.666
that I want to practice
once I go back home.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:52.966
With an LL.M. degree
from a good law school,

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.846
with a business concentration,
I'm going to be able

00:00:55.906 --> 00:00:56.916
to do a lot with that.

00:00:57.196 --> 00:01:00.556
By being an LL.M. student here I
learn how to behave with people

00:01:00.556 --> 00:01:04.876
from different cultures, and
I now have a huge network

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:06.316
of lawyers from all
around the world,

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:10.346
so I'm quite sure I wouldn't
get the job without my LL.M.,

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:13.386
so it's definitely a
springboard for my career.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.666
We have a tremendous faculty
here at the University

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:19.026
of Minnesota Law School, people
who are not only great scholars,

00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:21.486
but who have had
experience in the real world.

00:01:21.486 --> 00:01:23.646
We have faculty members
who have served

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:28.236
on international human rights
bodies, deputy legal advisors

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:31.356
to the state department,
who have served

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:33.816
in the White House
as legal counsel.

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:37.616
There are a lot of interactions
between the professor

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:40.646
and the students and
help us concentrate

00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:42.116
and engage in the class.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:46.856
The mixture of J.D. and
LL.M. students creates a very

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.966
stimulating atmosphere in class.

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:52.806
I've made a lot of friends,
J.D. friends and LL.M. friends.

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:58.446
I have a mentor, a J.D.
student, he give a lot of help.

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:01.666
When I get a request
from the United Nations

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.866
or an international
group is asking,

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:06.526
"Do you know a lawyer who's
familiar with U.S. law

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:08.346
but who lives in this country,?"

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:11.166
and I can say, "Yes, I
have an LL.M. student

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:12.696
from the University
of Minnesota,

00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:14.186
let me recommend them!"

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:16.816
If you look at everything put
together, all the factors,

00:02:16.816 --> 00:02:18.986
you know, quality of life,
combined with the quality

00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:23.166
of the education, and, combined
with the specific expertise

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:24.976
in certain areas
such as international

00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:28.556
and comparative law, then
you'll see we're pretty much

00:02:28.556 --> 00:02:31.176
at the top tiers of schools in
the U.S. The Law School is one

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:33.216
of the country's top
public law schools.

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:35.496
It's located in the Twin
Cities here in Minnesota,

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:37.366
one of this country's
more exciting

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:39.136
and vibrant areas
to live and work.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:43.036
We have 21 major
Fortune 500 companies

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:45.076
within a 30 minute
drive of the Law School.

00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:47.516
What I like the most
about the Twin Cities is

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:52.246
that it's a big city but at the
same time it has a small town

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:54.046
feel to it where
everyone is nice.

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:56.126
You can consider that
some people think

00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:58.986
that Minnesota is cold,
but the people is warm.

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:02.146
One of the great parts of the
program is the opportunity

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:03.746
to experience the
students themselves.

00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:06.006
They are a wonderful
resource to the school

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:07.126
and we love having them here.

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:10.386
One of my friends, he did
the LL.M. program last year

00:03:10.646 --> 00:03:14.386
and he told me he had
a very good experience,

00:03:14.546 --> 00:03:19.186
so he told me you
like have to do it.

00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:23.846
If you get the chance to
do it, you have to do it.

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:28.926
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:30.926
goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, goodbye.
