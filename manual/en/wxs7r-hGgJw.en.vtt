00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.460
This is just simply a demonstration to
show this little mixer

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.269
before it's disposed of.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.380
It's a Sony MX-510

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.939
A portable semi-suitcase mixer

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.059
It was originally made for completely unbalanced operation

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.760
with jack sockets on the input

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.860
and phono sockets
so you could switch between line input,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.420
attenuated microphone, and full (gain) microphone

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.199
Each one of these five channels having its
own little fader

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.080
and a master fader here at the right
hand side

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.180
no particular level markings other than 
just 0-10

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.540
An indication here bracketing

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.320
that you should get in this area for
optimum performance

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.210
A little slider, which is rather sweet

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.680
in order to mark

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.979
the position that you wanted to come up
to, once you'd decided on your levels

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.390
again that's really

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.009
to do with the fact that you don't
have any

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.060
fine control over the input sensitivity

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.560
and only one of these channels has a
pan pot.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.840
(Sony) makes a big deal of it being a pan pot

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.969
But I did quite a few little recordings with this

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.949
and I was very pleased with it.

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:41.509
It runs off 12 volts-worth of batteries

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.640
so that's an awful lot of batteries in the back of the thing - all C-size cells

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.280
Battery Check (button).

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.729
The only thing about it is they did last a long, long time. There are no batteries in here at the moment.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.729
Again, headphone output - completely hopeless

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.280
just slung off the outputs

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.740
so virtually no power whatsoever.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
But it's a sweet little unit.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.800
I put this little plate on here

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.340
for  just scribbling on what's going on

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.060
although I seem to have used 
indelible ink, and it's stuck on!

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.700
I modified the the back of this unit - you can probably see there

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.940
to put XLRs in here

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.240
four - sorry five - phonos

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.500
for phono inputs (line level inputs)

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.660
and phonos for left and right main outputs

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.580
It's just a wooden panel replacing the original

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.140
thin metal arrangement.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.110
The thing does provide a degree of phantom power

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.540
in the sense that it will feed 12 volts

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.760
which is the battery voltage available in here

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.540
out as phantom power onto these (XLR connectors)

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.060
so some of the electret-style microphones

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.320
would actually have be able to handle
that and work.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:16.920
So there we are - that's the Sony MX-510 mixer.
