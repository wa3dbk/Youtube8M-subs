[Music]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[Crowd counting] THREE, TWO, ONE [cheers]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.810
[Music &amp; Clapping]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.100
[Michael Lee] Oh my God, oh my God

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.700
[Woman’s voice to Whitney Booker] 
You’re a New Yorker!

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.000
[Narrator] Every year, medical students across
the country find out their residency placements

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
at the same time: 11 a.m. on Match Day.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.100
Nearly 150 medical students from UIC’s Chicago campus 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.000
gathered downtown March 16 at the Aon Building

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to open the envelopes that tell them where
they will continue their medical training.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.000
The top five hospital placements were 
UIC, University of Chicago, Northwestern, 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Medical College of Wisconsin, and Loyola.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.200
Nearly half the class will stay in 
Illinois for their residency training.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.600
[Lauren Teverbaugh] The tears started even
when I was walking up to get the envelope, because

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.020
it’s a moment that I have been 
waiting for, for so many years.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.100
All the work that went into it, all the support
and love that I had that got me to this day.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.299
The emotions just overtook me.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.050
[Peter Ureste] I’m actually really terrified
by the idea that I’m going to be someone’s doctor

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.100
and having to manage their care.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.000
But I’m also more excited about 
that as well. More than terrified.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.300
[Patti Chico] The social mission of the university
and of the hospital is incredibly important to me.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.500
And I think the curriculum at UIC is outstanding.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.000
I think the faculty are amazing and the 
program just keeps getting better every year.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.619
But next year is going to be one of the hardest
years of my life and I know that going into it,

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.000
so, so I’m a little nervous.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.760
People will start calling me doctor 
and that’s kind of frightening.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.400
But in the end, you know, it’s the next step
and I think I’m as ready as I can be for that.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.000
[Damaris Ortiz] UIC! I’m staying here!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
[David Kim] Mass General!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.300
[Dimitri Azar] You know what? 
It’s the bow tie. [laughs]

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.500
