00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.179
Hi Gents! Today I want to talk a little bit about 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.000
working up your lather for a nice shave with a safety razor or a straight razor.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.660
The important thing is, that you have a nice brush. Preferably, a badger brush,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.640
but some Gents will prefer a boar hair brush. They come in 3 varieties...

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.670
Badger, boar, or, synthetic.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.939
The badger brushes are

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.240
generally considered a little better because, they retain moisture better, and that's the key to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.800
a great lather, is keeping the moisture in your brush. Ideally, what you'd like to do

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.530
is, get yourself a bowl. It could be

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.969
anything you find in the cabinet. I have
this bowl, which was made for me. So it's kind of 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.300
near and dear to my heart. You can go with that, an old coffee mug, or some kind of a bowl you may have in

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.800
your pantry your cabinet.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.410
Or, one of these throwback mugs. This has
to be an Old Spice Mug 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.909
from probably the early 1950's. Something like that or,

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.549
anything really, if it retains heat.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.100
If it'll get warm and retain the heat for a little while,  that's even better for you.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.189
The key is, I soak my bowl in hot water.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.430
Fill it with hot water, soak the brush inside it, at the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.570
same time for 2-3 minutes. Then take
the brush out.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.040
Give it a couple shakes, it will be drippy like this,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.490
but give it a couple shakes, get most of that moisture out of it.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.320
You don't have to be limited to your choices

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.460
as far as, just using a cream, or
just using a soap.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.110
I like to mix it up because, I experiment a little bit, it's kind of fun.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.600
See what works best for you. So here I'll
just give an example.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.610
This is my badger brush, and this is a
glycerin based shaving soap.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.750
I'll run this around a bit.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.189
Just coat the tips.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:11.189
Like so. And this, like I said, this

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.709
is a glycerin based soap. So, I'll get started with this.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.270
Then, I'll go ahead and mix it in with a shaving
cream,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.830
at the same time. Just to

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.819
get an additional coating of shaving cream on top of the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.340
glycerin based soap, like this.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.849
So I get a good coating on there. And then I will

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.110
grab my bowl, dump the water out of it, and just

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.890
start lathering it up in my bowl, to run it around like so.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.599
And even upside down is good because it gets inside the brush.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.910
And you can put a dab of water in there.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.750
And you'll see quickly after

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.450
just a few seconds, it starts building a nice lather.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.629
So the key is just back and forth, and keep
mixing it up.

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.250
It'll take a minute to 2 minutes. Generally after

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.159
20-30 seconds you'll see that you get a
nice, a nice lathering going, and it just

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.030
gets thicker as you

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.390
progress. As you can see.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.430
The key is, you'll notice that
number one,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.730
if your bowl starts to thicken up with a nice lather

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.790
inside of it, and you're able to get your brush to stand up

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.840
in that lather... like so.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.519
Without falling over, you know that
you've done a pretty good job! And also

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.970
when you bring it away from the bowl, you'll see that you get these nice peaks coming off of it.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.970
Like so...

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.600
And that's a nice, thick lathering.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.020
Just to get ready for your shave.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.590
And so, you can see that this bowl is filled up pretty good now with a 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.590
that's a nice lathering! You'll have no
problem getting

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.720
2, 3, or 4

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.570
passes out of a lathering like this.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.020
That's a nice thick lathering right there!

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.840
So again, I just wanted to talk about that, and let you know that you don't have to be limited

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.310
you don't have to say: I just can only use
a shaving cream

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.230
or a shaving soap. You can

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.290
feel free to mix various combinations,
and experiment a little bit.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.360
And just see what works best for you.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.630
There you are!

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.130
That's a nice thick lathering right there!

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.860
I'm going to "get my shave on" pretty soon!

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.860
That's it for now.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.530
Check out some of my other videos about
shaving with a safety razor or a straight

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.260
razor.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.680
I do some pretty good instruction on

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.080
how to do it.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.930
There you are, it's a nice, luscious lathering.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.980
That's it for today... We'll see you next
time!

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.169
Have a Great Day! Remember, you start
each day with a great shave,

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.680
you'll make each day a great day! Take care!
