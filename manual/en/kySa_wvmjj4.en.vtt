00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:28.420
Look, I feel like I know what you’re going
for, LEGO…the vibe and everything.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.220
I’m just not sure “friends” is the right
word for it.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.300
I mean, I have friends, but…we don’t really
do these things.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.199
Is this something we should be doing?

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.760
Are we not really friends?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.480
And that’s just two of the questions I have
for this game.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:59.479
Another is, in what perverse world do fashion
boutiques hire teenage girls?

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.440
And how old are these girls, with tops like
that?

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.720
Actually, you know what, don’t even tell
me.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.130
This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.030
It’s LEGO Friends for the Nintendo DS.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.000
I gotta take a break from this.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.930
So, uh, LEGO games.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.250
Usually pretty reliable, right?

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.200
In fact, LEGO games are kind of boring to
review, ‘cause they’re almost always the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
same.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.740
The same gameplay, the same humor, but more
importantly…the same quality.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.250
The LEGO games always have quality.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.540
And even on handhelds, where that quality
sometimes dips a little…it’s not like

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.850
they’re ever bad or anything.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.520
Imagine my surprise when I played LEGO Friends.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.450
It wasn’t the creepy situations, and uncomfortably
revealing tops…although they are creepy,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.660
and uncomfortably revealing.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.931
No, what surprised me about LEGO Friends,
was the quality.

00:01:55.931 --> 00:02:14.459
Or the lack thereof.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.849
This is, bar none, the worst LEGO game I’ve
ever seen.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.480
And you might think, “Well, even the worst
LEGO game is probably better than a lot of

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
games.”

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480
No.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480
No, don’t think that.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.480
Because it’s flatly untrue.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.799
This game is worse than I ever imagined a
LEGO game could be.

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.590
In fact, it’s so bad, it’s like…I’m
not just surprised this game sells with the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.659
LEGO name.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.650
I’m surprised this game sells…at all.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.810
Now, to be fair, this game was also released
for the 3DS.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.980
And I don’t have any information on this,
but I’m guessing that was the primary version,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.980
you know?

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.269
When a game releases for both the 3DS and
the original DS, at the end of 2013…the

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.969
3DS version is obviously the priority.

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.189
To have a DS version is a bonus.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.090
Only in this case, it’s not a bonus at all.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.150
It’s a deduction.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.200
Because I can’t remember ever seeing a DS
game as poorly made as this game.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.060
This is, seriously, appallingly low quality.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.629
And especially for a game with the LEGO brand
name.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:10.900
That’s the shocking part.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.370
I mean, you expect this from budget titles.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.099
I never would’ve expected this from a LEGO
game.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:29.579
So you play as a little girl who may or may
not be a LEGO girl, it’s hard to tell.

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.319
Which is another issue, there’s hardly any
LEGO in this LEGO game, but that’d be okay

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.819
if this were a good game.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.569
Holy crap, this is not that.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.989
Anyway, so it’s basically a simulation game.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.249
You go to school, you make friends, you do
little tasks…it’s like, it wants to be

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:44.939
LEGO Animal Crossing.

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.700
Only there’s very little LEGO and hardly
any Animal Crossing.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.450
Which…I mean, that kind of makes it hard
to be LEGO Animal Crossing.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.879
There are so many problems, I don’t even
know where to start.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.260
But I guess the best place is probably the
production value.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.750
Which is f*cking offensively bad.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.129
The graphics are terrible, the audio and music
sounds like it was recorded over the phone…but

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.680
the framerate’s worse.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.329
I mean, this wouldn’t be good for the Nintendo
64.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.329
Looks like it’s claymation.

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.519
Then again, claymation looks awesome.

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.519
This looks hideous.

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.180
In fact, if you want an idea of how little
effort went into this thing, and how ugly

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.680
it is…look no further than this.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.220
So compressed, it’s unwatchable.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:34.810
That’s your effort, right there.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.340
Now, like I said, this game’s also available
on the 3DS.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.530
And I have to imagine the production values
are way better for that one.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.460
This seems like a five-day rush job.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.259
But even if were prettier and it ran better…the
game itself still sucks.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.750
It’s, like, 90 percent fetch quests.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.449
And look at this minigame.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.599
Look how long you have to press the right
buttons.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.301
I could make Ovaltine faster than this.

00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:04.909
This is ridiculous.

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.789
I mean, I am not a ten-year-old girl.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:13.129
That’s probably one of the reasons I don’t
understand this, and why it makes me so uncomfortable.

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:19.220
Although that’s not the only reason.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.919
Point is, there’s not a person in this universe—ten-year-old
girl or otherwise—who should ever play this

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.770
game.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.930
Go make real friends.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.289
‘Cause if you go with this option, there’s
probably a chance you never will.

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.560
This is…LEGO Friend repellent, more like
it.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.410
All your friends will stop talking to you,
is the point I’m trying to convey.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.490
Because of LEGO Friends, for the Nintendo
DS.
