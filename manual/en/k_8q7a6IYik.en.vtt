00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Good morning John! It is not morning obviously, it is night time

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.580
It is London and I have been having a fantastic time.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.040
And as such I am phased with a brutal conundrum of what I should be discussing in this video.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.360
Should it be the powerfully packed humanity of the London Tube? Or the silly tranquility of Brighton Beach?

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.400
Or Sherwood Forest meets rich suburbs of Hamsteadheath?

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.060
Actually those things are pretty easy to cross off the list what it comes down are the two things I knew I needed  to do while I was here in the United Kingdom.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.580
And the two things that in fact have blown my mind more than I even thought they would

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.640
1: The Natural History Museum, which Katherine and I got up early so we could be first in line to go into

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.000
and yes, the Harry Potter Studio Tour in Watford.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.520
Science versus Harry Potter. That's my brain.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.500
This is an easy choice for most people - probably. Even seems like a juxtaposition

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.200
maybe choosing between opposites. But, not for me.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
So let's sort it out, let's sort it out with some superlatives.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400
Let's start with  the saddest thing.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.240
At the Studio Tour there was Albus Dumbeldor's office

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.680
and a mannequin wearing his robes and that made me sad...

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860
But, that's not going to make me nearly as sad

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.180
as like the last skeleton of a dodo, which that's a whole species gone man.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.380
Creepiest thing!

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.060
Hands down, no question. The living breathing Voldemort doll.. thing. It's maybe the worst thing I've seen in my entire life.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.720
Most inspirational!

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.600
Yes, the massive amounts of time and money and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.460
energy that went into creating every bit of the Harry Potter Universe

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.240
in perfect detail, that is inspiring.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.540
But, not nearly as inspriational as being in the presence of

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.000
Darwin's pidgeons, Wallace's collection

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.480
Pressings that were used by Lenaius himself.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.900
Contextualizing myself within the broader history of life on this planet

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.200
and feeling a direct connection to the people who

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200
teased out those truths.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.480
Best architecture.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.840
The Natural History Museum is amazing example of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.380
German Romanesque architecture.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.620
It evokes the sacredness of the natural world in a very human way

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.580
and it does that very successfully.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.280
In every nook and cranny

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.960
there is some other little hidden thing evoking

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.820
science and nature and it is absolutely beautiful. But,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.380
Hogwarts wins because Hogwarts!

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.940
J.K Rowling versus Charles Darwin.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.960
Both slaved away for decades over masterful works, yes.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.260
But, Darwin's care and indepedence and fortitude

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.700
definitely puts him on top.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.500
Also, he had severe digestive problems, which I can sympathize with.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.800
Best community.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.660
All science is collaborative.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.380
It is always part of a community.  Darwin is certainly no exception.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.420
But, Harry Potter too, is a collaborative work.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.900
Jo Rowling's world has benefited from the contributions

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.580
of a great number of people

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.540
Whether you are talking about screen writers and actors.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.280
Or, you're talking about the community of people who have sprung up around it to love it together.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.640
Uninteded collaborators like myself, and Harry and the Potters, and Melissa and Ellie, and Starkid

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.320
I think the fact that most art projects are not this collaborative,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.780
and this so clearly and in so many ways - to me at least - is... makes this another win for Harry Potter!

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.440
Which brings us to a tie. So yes, I have failed to decide which thing

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.880
I'm going to make my video about today, but it turns out

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.980
that it was able to make a pretty good video out of it anyway.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.260
It's like choosing between your children

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.920
Or more correctly, in my case, it's like choosing between

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.560
my parents. These are two things that didn't just contribute

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.720
to how I understand the world they built me as a person

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.220
oddly enough. What I love about science

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.440
is that enthusiastic perpetual drive toward objective truth and understanding.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.140
And what I love about Harry Potter is that unironic drive toward

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.180
objective goodness: loyalty and love and building together something greater than ourselves

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.640
and something better than ourselves.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.840
Not just for ourselves, but for everyone

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.100
Those are two things that are really guiding principles

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.540
of my life and so no,  I'm not going to pick between them

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.140
And yes, I am excited to be able to talk about them here

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.600
on a bench in Tower Hill in London

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.760
John,  I'll see you on Tuesday.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.780
