00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.130
My name is Jared Todd. I'm going to show you
a little bit about how to profile and then

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:15.290
we're going to go in and we're going to profile
this blade and get it to its final shape.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.230
Now first of all what you can do, the corners
of the wheel here are one of your biggest

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.410
assets for removing the most material. You
can really push into the corner and remove

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.689
a lot because when you push into the whole
belt itself it creates quite a resistance

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.769
and doesn't remove material as fast. You'll
notice that as I remove these larger sections

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.190
I'll really rely a lot on the corner of my
wheel. When you do rely on the corner of a

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.680
wheel you want to track the belt over that
corner of the wheel so you don't run into

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.619
the rubber which will destroy the wheel. So
I'll start this up then we'll adjust the tracking

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:42.659
and we'll get started. As you can see it's
taken off quite a bit and you just continue

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.569
doing that around until you bring the metal
into these lines that you have drawn. So I'll

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.950
grind a little bit more out here in this finger
cut out and then bring this down to this edge.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.979
Make sure you wear your safety goggles.
