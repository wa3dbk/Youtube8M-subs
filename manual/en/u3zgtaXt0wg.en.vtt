00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.360
So, first thing's first - what is a PicturePlan?

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.680
This powerful marketing tool can make
THE difference at your next listing

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.929
presentation!

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.719
After you order a PicturePlan, and
schedule an appointment at your earliest

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.309
convenience, our photographer will visit
your listing to measure the floorplan,

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.519
take an unlimited number of photographs -
inside and out  - and then within two

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.300
business days, your PicturePlan is ready!

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.000
On a PicturePlan, potential buyers click
on arrows within a floor plan representing

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.539
each photo - and stay engaged because
they're active participants in the

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.800
experience. They won't get bored, as with
traditional virtual tours or photo

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.300
slideshows.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.620
You can customize the text description
for every one of your photographs giving

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.510
concrete details to heighten the
emotional impact of the professional

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.960
quality photography.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.870
Real world reviews of neighborhood
businesses and a true aerial photo of

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.030
your listing in its surrounding area,
make it easy for buyers to picture their

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.710
day-to-day life living in your listing.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.000
After a showing, buyers can visualize their
lifestyle in your listing by positioning

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.700
their furniture on your PicturePlan.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.490
Using the furniture planner, you can
create a 3-D rendering in order to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.340
virtually stage empty, or not-yet-built
properties.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.689
Each PicturePlan is automatically
distributed to realtor.com and

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.070
dozens of other sites and MLS systems.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.180

marketing tools to help you get more

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.220
