00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.129
Hi I'm Tricia an organic gardener. I'm here with Reed Hamilton from Grass Valley Grains,

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.720
an organic farm and mill dedicated to
providing wholesome and diverse grains to our

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.170
local community.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.529
Thank you for having us out here today.
What's on your agenda for today?

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.490
Today I plan to harvest as much

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.389
hard red wheat as I can manage with my combine, as much as I can haul and get that on home.

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:33.130
And where are you gonna deliver it?

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.560
It's gonna go to my

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.129
home where I have my mill and storage for all the grain.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.090
O.k., great,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.920
well we really appreciate you letting us
come out here to use your field to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.500
demonstrate how to thresh rye on a
smaller scale.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.850
Small grains go through three stages
of ripeness.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.119
The milk stage, where the grains fill with a
milky liquid

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.610
that spills out when the grain is pinched,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.100
the stocks will start turning from green to
yellow.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.869
Then there's the dough stage,

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:06.430
the grain is harder but still easy to dent
with your fingernail. Then there is the mature

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.800
stage.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.910
The grain cannot be dented with your 
fingernail, the whole plant will be golden

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.110
brown.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.630
Don't wait too long though or else birds and
other critters could get your grain.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.420
Many farmers recommend harvesting in
the late dough stage,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.860
then they allow the grain to dry, which
makes for the best quality.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.620
For plots of about one hundred and fifty square
feet or less

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.430
simply use a grass shear.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.870
Just cut the stocks about a foot below the heads.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.390
The grass sickle is another great option
for small plots

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.329
to harvest with a hand sickle,

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:45.329
grip the grain with one hand and pull the sickle
through with the other hand.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.020
Another great option for a large
grain field is an Austrian scythe.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.940
Just put your feet apart knees bent,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.960
rotate your body,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.500
and scythe it.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.130
Keep the blade low and level with the ground,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.840
the wheat is cut a long narrow strip with
a sweeping motion.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.539
Starting with the blade slightly behind
you on your dominant side,

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.680
push with your dominant hand and
pull with the other. Rotate your arms and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.849
upper body as you sweep through the grain.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.219
Only use the first one third of the
blade. Harvesting grain with a scythe

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.419
is a great task to do with a partner,

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.019
one can scythe,

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.329
and one can wrap up the stalks.

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.339
Now it's time to gather up the stalks,
and tie them into sheaves.

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.480
Gather the stalks into a sheath that

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.680
is comfortable to hold your hands.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.930
Make sure all of the grain heads are
pointing in the same direction and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.209
bind them with twine.

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.239
now were going to make a teepee out of sheaths and this is called a shock.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.390
Swish together or intermingle

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.739
your heads

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.069
so that your teepee stands upright.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.879
and then just drape a little cheese cloth hat

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:01.049
over your shocks.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.259
to keep the birds out of your seeds while
they're drying.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:09.299
And then just let your shock dry for about seven
to ten days.

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.590
Once your grain is dry there's several ways
to thresh.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.999
Threshing is separating the wheat berries 
from the chaff.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:20.100
Banging the seed heads against the side of a trash can or a bucket

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.659
works really well.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.749
Another method is to step on the grain.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.529
All of these methods require

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.029
a little bit of muscle power,

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:37.329
but that's because there's not that many
automated options for small scale threshing.

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:43.049
Beating the heads with the traditional
flail or a plastic baseball bat works too.

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.689
Once you've finished threshing its time to winnow.

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.459
Winnowing is separating the chaff from the wheat berry and all you'll need

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.899
is an electric fan and two buckets.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.449
pour small amounts in front of the fan to blow away the chaff

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.609
almost pure wheat will drop into the lower
bucket.

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.739
Look through the wheat for rocks and other heavy debris

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.109
that can damage your mill when you go to grind the grain.

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.489
Plant your grains.

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.979
Harvest, thresh, winnow and grow organic for life!
