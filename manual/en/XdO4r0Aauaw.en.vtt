00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.810
In my time on this earth I have learned two
universal truths.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.450
The first is that film dialogue always sounds
better when delivered in Latin, thus:

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.650
[VADER] Luke sum ipse patrem te.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:20.080
[CPCGamer] And the second is that breaking
stuff is fun.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.340
Todays game doesn't have much of the first
thing, but it does have quite a lot of the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.340
second.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.480
And that's a good thing because Latin is a
very confusing language.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.399
So let's take a look at Jack the nipper, released
by Gremlin Graphics in 1986.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.739
In somewhat of a strangely recurring trend
among CPC games, this game sees you take control

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.089
of a baby.

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.109
Specifically, a little boy named Jack the
nipper.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.870
Because likening a toddler to an anti-semitic
mass murderer is definitely the way to go.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.649
If you think of the things that toddlers are
good at only a few things spring to mind:

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.930
Babbling, almost walking, biting their older
brothers finger and getting more hits than

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.460
they could possibly deserve. Twice.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.230
But you're forgetting one very important thing,
dear viewer; Babies can also cause millions

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.320
of pounds worth of irreparable property damage.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.710
This game focuses on the last thing in that
little list, which is a good thing because

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.190
if I hear one more rutting thing about Charlie
I'm gonna choke the little frelnik.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.910
Starting in Jack's bedroom the point of the
game is to roam the town and cause as much

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.100
trouble as you possibly can.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.890
From spitballing rozzers, throwing crockery
around or discovering the hidden passageway

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.380
that turns the game into a maddeningly difficult
platformer, the likes of which Gremlin liked

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.950
producing in the 1980's.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.710
Now, while mindless vandalism IS fun, this
game only gives you minimum points for just

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.440
throwing stuff around.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.490
No, if you want to go for the big bucks, you've
got to think outside the box.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.030
Example!

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.320
You throwing a magnet around will get you
a few points, but nothing special.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.200
But if you throw that self same magnet around
inside a computer shop and POW!

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.980
As if millions of geeks suddenly cried out
in terror and were silent.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.769
Don't worry guys, it wasn't all that bad,
that was a Spectrum factory.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:17.850
Oh yeah. Twenty years on and there's STILL
bad blood between me and your lousy console.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.910
It's not just destroying computers, though,
oh no.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.640
You can put weights in the sock factory,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.510
Glue the dentures shut in the false teeth
factory,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.140
And, one of my favourite puzzles, you can
wilt your fathers garden with plant poison,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.050
then use fertiliser to restimulate the dead
plants to make a zombie garden.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.410
As an aside, you know what's a bad idea? Referring
to graveyards as zombie farms.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.980
But on the plus side, I'll never have to attend
a wake again!

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.890
So uh...yeah.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.030
There's one thing I've gotta mention when
talking about this game.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.550
Now, I can appreciate that kids will get into
mischief.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.110
I mean, I myself once grew to be 112 feet
tall then destroyed Las Vegas.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.099
No, wait, that was Rick Moranis' kid.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.210
I was the one who hijacked my nan's car and
reversed it through four lanes of traffic.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.220
[CHEESY SOUND EFFECT]

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.780
But some of Jack's antics go beyond childish
shinoligans and turn into out and out supervillainy.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.400
Consider this: One of the items you can get
your hands on is an IED.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.550
Bad enough on its own, yes, but this only
gets worse when you consider the point of

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.610
said bomb is to blow a hole in the wall of
a prison block,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.530
thus letting all the inmates roam free without
any fear of being recaptured.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.340
That's about the kinda thing I expect from
the Joker, not a little baby.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.540
But with that said, it's not like it's out
of character for Jack.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.739
See, the magazine I used to read included
short comic strips about Jack.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.569
They let you know who he was, what he did
and kept you interested in the months after

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.569
the games release to make you think you wanted
a sequel.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.760
Which they made, by the way. It wasn't very
good.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.129
But in the comics, they showed Jack to be
a highly manipulative and destuctive child.

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:14.879
He drank, smoked, gambled...basically he was
a chav that existed before his time.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.949
And that's a shame, because Jack the nipper
is, in all honesty, a pretty good game.

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.630
It lets itself down sound-wise, though.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.910
There are only a few sound effects and the
one you'll hear the most, the jumping sound

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.250
effect, is really annoying. Also, the music
is really short.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.150
Literally, it's only eight bars long. How
long is that, you may be wondering?

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.740
Really, really short.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.410
More specifically, it's shorter than this
sentence.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.960
So you can imagine how annoying THAT gets
while playing the game.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.600
But on the plus side you're able to turn the
music on and off. Mid-game, even!

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.850
I'll grant you this doesn't fix the problem
of the sound effects, but, really, that's

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.380
only a minor set-back to what is actually
a pretty solid title.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.440
So if you can find it, check it out, 'cause
it's actually pretty good.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.680
And I'm done. Fac pergas, o nequam; perfice
diem meum
