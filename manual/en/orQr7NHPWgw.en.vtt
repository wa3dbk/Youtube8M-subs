00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:05.217
(lively music)

00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:11.273
- Hi friends!

00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:13.583
Thank you so much for
tuning in to COOKwithAPRIL.

00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:15.276
Today's Thirsty Thursday!

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:18.757
And I wanted to share my
very favorite juicing recipe

00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:20.972
that I actually discovered on my own.

00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:24.816
It's a mixture of veggies and
fruits and I hope you enjoy.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.393
So let's get started.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.513
I have spinach, as well as spring mix

00:00:29.513 --> 00:00:32.884
and these are like four handfuls;
I don't really measure it.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:36.694
And then I would typically add
like three handfuls of kale,

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:39.541
but I ran out, but this is
how much I have right now.

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:41.811
And I also like to include

00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.705
one large apple, one Asian pear,

00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:49.167
and then d'Anjou pear? Is
that how you say it, honey?

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:51.167
(chuckles) Just a green pear.

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:54.190
And then some carrots
and some blueberries.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.907
What you're going to do is just

00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:57.643
put everything in your juicer.

00:00:57.643 --> 00:01:00.645
And so this is a weird technique

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:03.048
that I learned from juicing many times,

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:05.934
but what I do is because the spring mix

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.724
and the spinach don't
have a lot of juice in it,

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:11.391
what I do is first I'll
put that in, right?

00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:15.644
And I'll fill it in until
it's completely full.

00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:19.037
Or I feel that it's full.
So it's almost full, right?

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.578
And then I'm going to add something

00:01:20.578 --> 00:01:23.296
that has a lot of juice,
like an Asian pear.

00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:26.508
And this will get more juice out of

00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:28.170
the spinach and the spring mix.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.214
So let's see how that goes.

00:01:31.663 --> 00:01:36.663
(juicer grinding)

00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:45.890
(juicer winding down)

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.448
That's cool, huh?

00:01:51.162 --> 00:01:55.261
And then again you're
gonna grab the spinach.

00:01:55.701 --> 00:02:00.208
And then I'm gonna add the
carrots this time around,

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:02.915
as well as some of the blueberries,

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:04.874
and then I'm gonna finish
off with something that has

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.882
a lot of juice, like an apple, and start.

00:02:07.882 --> 00:02:12.771
(juicer grinding)

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:24.890
(juicer winding down)

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.782
And then you're gonna just
continue adding everything,

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:29.335
and I'll show you how it turns out.

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:31.335
Alright, so the juice is ready

00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:33.905
and I made just enough
to fill this up, right?

00:02:33.905 --> 00:02:35.741
So I'm just grabbing a spoon

00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:37.619
and I'm gonna mix it all together

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.613
and of course taste tester Justin is here.

00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:43.664
Just gonna mix it and then

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.864
I think it tastes a million times better

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:50.115
when it's really cold, so
I'm just gonna add some ice.

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:53.302
There we go.

00:02:53.302 --> 00:02:56.428
And then I'm gonna pour this guy.

00:02:56.428 --> 00:02:58.210
Sorry about the mess, you guys.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.666
(laughs)

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:01.083
There I go.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.020
And then we give it a good little twirl.

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.673
And so I have to say,

00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:11.955
my husband has never tried this, ever.

00:03:11.955 --> 00:03:14.909
I tried to get him to enjoy
juicing as much as me,

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.086
but he just does not like the
idea of spinach and spring mix

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:21.855
into a beverage, so I'm nervous, you guys.

00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:23.814
This is the first time
I've ever been nervous.

00:03:23.814 --> 00:03:25.757
Okay, you ready to try it?

00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:27.482
- I am. I'm a little
nervous as well, though.

00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:29.534
- I'm nervous because I love it,

00:03:29.534 --> 00:03:30.796
but I don't know what you will say.

00:03:30.796 --> 00:03:33.905
- I know. You love it so much,
so I'm gonna be brave, okay?

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:35.354
Here we go.
- Okay, yeah.

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:41.997
- It tastes like apple juice.

00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:43.576
(both laughing)

00:03:43.576 --> 00:03:46.651
- Yeah, because it's one
large apple and pears

00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:48.856
and isn't it so good for you?

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:50.579
- You know what? It's
actually kinda refreshing.

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.908
- Yeah!
- You can kinda...

00:03:51.908 --> 00:03:54.066
Yeah, I can taste the spinach
a little bit, but it's, um...

00:03:55.196 --> 00:03:56.555
It's actually good.

00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:57.908
It's not bad.

00:03:57.908 --> 00:04:00.059
- Yay! Yay!

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:01.909
I can tell you're still

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.361
kinda iffy about it, but
that's okay because --

00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:04.702
- I wouldn't have taken three sips

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:06.196
if I wouldn't have liked it, right?

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:08.272
- Thank you. I'm so glad he likes it.

00:04:08.272 --> 00:04:11.202
I hope you friends have a wonderful day

00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:12.845
and I hope you juice with me.

00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:16.742
