00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.820
Using the SlideCam from Fotodiox

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.410
you can easily create hollywood-style
dolly and tracking shots

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.120
without the cost or elaborate setup. The
SlideCam can set up on any surface

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.500
or add a tripod or light stand for
higher shots.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.730
Simply attach your tripod head and your
camera and you're ready to add some

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.540
hands-on motion to your next video project.
You'll see the production value of your

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.170
videos increase dramatically

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.520
the first time you use SlideCam. 
SlideCam shots add smoothness

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.970
and new visual interest. With SlideCam you'll
create shots that are much more

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.970
interesting and dynamic than simply

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.090
panning or zooming with the tripod. With the
Fotodiox SlideCam your shots literally

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.840
move your audience through the scene,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.210
creating a vivid sense of dimensionality.
The SlideCam is an entirely

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.239
self-contained

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.059
rail system available in three lengths: 24
inches,

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.110
32 inches, and 39 inches.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.900
SlideCam features all aluminum and
steel construction for stability

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.049
and portability. The internal rails are
protected from accidental dings and dents

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.040
that could affect the smoothness of your
shot. Setup is easy:

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.159
for table-top and low angle shots simply
attach the included

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.490
all-metal stabilizer legs. All four feet
are

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.869
individually adjustable to level off the
shot perfectly.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.119
3 tripod threads on the bottom

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.840
are designed for using your SlideCam
mounted on a single tripod or light

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.259
stand.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.679
Or, add a second support for even more
stability.

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.130
Multiple mounting points let you create
dramatic

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.280
crane style moves by mounting the SlideCam
in an upright orientation.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.219
Or flip it around and have your camera
smoothly slide into powerful

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.149
low angle shots. Thanks to the enclosed
rail system

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.270
you can even hang your caps for those
high angle moves.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.460
The SlideCam's carriage moves on four 
all-metal bearings for

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.340
added stability. The slider's tension is
fully adjustable

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.030
and an integrated brake keeps the camera
in place for non-moving

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.650
shots. A 3/8ths inch screw interfaces with
your favorite ball head

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.940
or mini fluid head, and an integrated bubble
level

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.780
helps you keep SlideCam on the beam. The
SlideCam from Fotodiox

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.380
includes the all-in-one rail system,
stabilizer legs with adjustable feet,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.379
hex keys for adjusting slider tension, and
a custom fitted gear bag with a shoulder

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.819
strap.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.230
Punch up your next project with high-end
camera moves

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.420
