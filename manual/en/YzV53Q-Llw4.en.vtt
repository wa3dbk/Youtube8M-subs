00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.050
September 6th (Sun.)

00:00:07.317 --> 00:00:10.283
Yukie is hard at work by herself.

00:00:10.283 --> 00:00:13.050
Yukie: P—Please fill this out!

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.683
She worked together with Kazuko on Saturday, but to help with her training, today I had her partner be a little late.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.217
Yukie: Please fill out this survey!

00:00:19.217 --> 00:00:23.183
She could just wait for Kazuko, but instead she earnestly tries to hand out surveys so we can get a few more results.

00:00:23.183 --> 00:00:29.150
Yukie: Oh, of course. You're busy. I'm sorry to bother you; maybe next time!

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.283
Naturally, few people honestly want to fill out such a survey.

00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:34.317
Yukie sometimes adopts this sort of disposition,

00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:37.150
where, even if she's smiling, it still looks like she's glaring at you.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.117
Yukie: (No, this isn't working...)

00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:43.817
She wants to rely on Matsukaze, but if she does her normal routine here, people will only distance themselves further.

00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:49.317
Yukie: (What was the difference between me and Kazuko when we were handing out fliers?)

00:00:49.317 --> 00:00:52.017
Each of them must have had the same smile, so what was different?

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:54.417
She's trying so hard to smile, and yet...

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:57.217
Yukie: (Kazuko-san's smile was so natural.)

00:00:57.217 --> 00:01:01.317
Yukie: (She's always honest, and never lies about her feelings.)

00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:04.250
People aren't giving her the cold shoulder because she isn't smiling.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.017
So Yukie stops trying to force a smile.

00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:09.183
Yukie: Would you please fill out this survey?

00:01:09.183 --> 00:01:12.217
Though no smile adorns her face, she looks earnest.

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:15.717
She wants to be useful, and for everyone to learn about the book she and her friends are making.

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:18.417
She throws away her insincere smile and shows people the true face of Mayuzumi Yukie.

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:21.317
Passerby #1: Oh, isn't she kinda cute?

00:01:21.317 --> 00:01:24.483
Passerby #2: We've got some spare time; why not do it?

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:27.250
Yukie: Th—Thank you very much!

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.617
Her cuteness starts to draw men to her.

00:01:29.617 --> 00:01:33.750
Grandfather: Grandma, isn't that such a sprightly young lass?

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.817
Grandmother: A bird's-eye view map? Now doesn't that sound interesting?

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:41.117
And her sincerity gathers senior citizens to her.

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:44.383
Chika: A bird's-eye view map? What's that?

00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:48.083
Mayo: It's a map of the town's landscape drawn as it looks from above.

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.417
And the subject matter brings in students.

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:52.783
Yukie: Th—Thank you very much!

00:01:52.783 --> 00:01:54.450
Passerby #1: Whoa!

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.383
Passerby #2: What a shock.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:02:01.017
Though she still can't smile honestly, Yukie's managing to move forwards.

00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:07.283
Yamato: This place is expensive, but they have good online reviews.

00:02:07.283 --> 00:02:09.883
I'm looking at graphical designers and publishers online.

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:13.550
As good an artist as Capt is, I don't expect much from his design sense or taste.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.083
Yamato: Maybe I should select an independent place with experience.

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:18.383
I have a lot of important responsibilities, too.

00:02:18.383 --> 00:02:21.317
Momoyo: Oh, you've been working hard, little brother.

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:23.683
Yamato: Well, we can't put any of this off.

00:02:23.683 --> 00:02:26.517
I want the books to be printed by the middle of next month, and for things to be settled, one way or the other, by the end of it.

00:02:26.517 --> 00:02:28.817
Yamato: And if things drag on, people'll get bored.

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:33.217
Momoyo: Yeah. I've gotten bored of odd jobs myself.

00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:35.383
Nee-san and Gakuto have worked a lot.

00:02:35.383 --> 00:02:37.883
The sweat of their brows is what's paying for both the flyers and the final books.

00:02:37.883 --> 00:02:40.383
Yamato: ...Shoot. This part of the work is falling behind.

00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:43.883
I'll consult my acquaintances and try whatever I can, but I don't think things will go as I want.

00:02:43.883 --> 00:02:45.617
Momoyo: Sounds like you've got it rough.

00:02:45.617 --> 00:02:48.317
Yamato: I do, but I'll get it done.

00:02:48.317 --> 00:02:50.917
Miyako: Work complete.

00:02:50.917 --> 00:02:53.350
Momoyo: Where's Mororo?

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.183
Miyako: Inputting data. He's not even taking breaks to watch anime.

00:02:57.183 --> 00:02:59.250
Yamato: That stuff is his specialty.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.183
Moro easily outstrips the rest of us when it comes to computers.

00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:05.050
Yamato: Oh yeah, Nee-san, there's something else I'd like to ask.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.950
Momoyo: There's more?

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.150
Yamato: On Tuesday...

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.283
Momoyo: I can do that, easy. And I'll make Baldy chip in.

00:03:15.783 --> 00:03:20.483
September 8th (Tue.)

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:34.117
Jun: Hi everybody! Has anyone changed things up for the Fall semester? Or maybe debuted during Summer break? Either way, it's time for LOVE Kawakami!

00:03:34.117 --> 00:03:38.317
Jun: With you today with his close-cropped hair is Inoue Jun.

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:43.983
Momoyo: Close cropped my ass, Baldy. And I'm Kawakami Momoyo.

00:03:43.983 --> 00:03:47.383
Jun: And that's the first shot you've taken on me since summer vacation.

00:03:47.383 --> 00:03:49.317
Momoyo: So then, let's get to the mail.

00:03:49.317 --> 00:03:51.550
Jun: Whoa, already?!

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.817
Momoyo: "Momoyo-san, do you read any books?"

00:03:54.817 --> 00:04:00.017
Jun: Why would a listener ask that? That person doesn't know you one bit, Momo-sempai.

00:04:00.017 --> 00:04:04.050
Momoyo: You fool. Even I've been interested in a book or two.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.717
Jun: Well done, Sempai. Thanks for the laugh so early in the semester

00:04:08.717 --> 00:04:10.917
Momoyo: I'll teach you to laugh. (Crack!)

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:16.117
Momoyo: My cohost has decided to take a nap mid-broadcast, so I'll go on alone.

00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:23.717
Momoyo: It's not really a book, but next month, Kawakami Bookstore in the shopping district is going to have a panoramic bird's-eye map of Kawakami on sale.

00:04:23.717 --> 00:04:26.850
Momoyo: But be careful, because you can't buy it anywhere else.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.950
Momoyo: I'm bringing this up for one reason: I'm involved in the creation of the book.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.317
Momoyo: You could even say I made it myself.

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:41.417
Momoyo: Any girl who brings me a copy, I'll carry off in my arms. And if a guy does the same, I'll break his spine.

00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:44.717
Momoyo: Oh, and no matter how many copies you buy, it's once per person.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:50.283
Jun: M—Momo-sempai, I don't know how I feel about such a personal advertisement...

00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:52.483
Momoyo: Why don't you get a little more sleep? (Crack!)

00:04:52.483 --> 00:04:55.750
I feel bad for Inoue, but this should help our book's degree of familiarity.

00:04:59.417 --> 00:05:02.883
Shouichi: Being in a helicopter was totally awesome!

00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:05.250
Yamato: Did you get a grasp of the landscape?

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.083
Shouichi: I made sure to take some photos, yeah. Though I mean, it's not like I'm ever gonna forget what I saw.

00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:15.783
Takuya: You can perfectly picture in your mind what you saw after just seeing it once? That's amazing.

00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:20.283
Shouichi: I've said it before and I'll say it again: Kawakami's got a lot of variation to it.

00:05:20.283 --> 00:05:24.683
Yamato: There's the Kawakami Grounds, of course. There's also still some scenic streets, and fashionable spots like La Cittadella.

00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:29.483
Miyako: I've got the geography of that area down pat. And I've looked up all the history, too.

00:05:29.483 --> 00:05:35.050
Takuya: I've put together all the text in a way that's easy to edit. And we're leaving graphical design to a pro, right?

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.183
Yamato: Yeah. Well done, guys.

00:05:37.183 --> 00:05:39.683
Both of them are methodical workers, so they did a thorough job.

00:05:39.683 --> 00:05:41.783
Chris: Isn't this such a nice city?

00:05:41.783 --> 00:05:44.117
Kazuko: I've known that forever!

00:05:44.117 --> 00:05:46.083
Gakuto: Well, yeah.

00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:49.783
Yamato: As for me and Chris, the library and everywhere else we went were happy to assist.

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:55.483
Chris: The libraries say they'll include it as a resource, and the schools are considering using it as part of their curriculum.

00:05:55.483 --> 00:05:59.017
Shouichi: Then we'd better increase our order!

00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:02.250
Yamato: The train station said they'd join in once the book's finished.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.083
Takuya: It is hard to advertise something that's not out yet.

00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:07.950
Yamato: Seriously, good thing they were so forward-thinking about it.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.517
Kazuko: We're up next!

00:06:10.517 --> 00:06:12.317
Yukie: Here you go.

00:06:12.317 --> 00:06:15.683
I start looking over all the surveys Wanko and Mayucchi gathered.

00:06:15.683 --> 00:06:18.450
Gakuto: What sort of stuff did you ask on the survey?

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.783
Yamato: We asked what they want to see in the book.

00:06:20.783 --> 00:06:23.483
Momoyo: I thought we decided that on our own.

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.450
Yamato: Everyone else's voices are important, too.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.783
And you have to listen to them.

00:06:27.783 --> 00:06:31.383
Yamato: But you can't listen to all of them. Let's find what the most requested item was.

00:06:31.383 --> 00:06:35.117
Kazuko: There's a lot of people asking about restaurants and stuff.

00:06:35.117 --> 00:06:42.150
Yukie: That's right. They're always going to the same places, so they want more information on various ones.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.817
Shouichi: .....Restaurants?

00:06:44.817 --> 00:06:47.050
Miyako: I guess this, too, is Capt's time to shine.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.617
Yamato: Nope.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:51.350
Shouichi: I'll have a man I recognize write it for us.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.117
Miyako: Do you mean someone from outside our Family?

00:06:54.117 --> 00:06:56.217
Miyako doesn't look too happy about that.

00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:59.483
Shouichi: I've got the perfect man in mind. Let him do it.

00:06:59.483 --> 00:07:05.317
Miyako: I guess it doesn't really matter who writes it...

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.617
....And then the days started to fly by.
