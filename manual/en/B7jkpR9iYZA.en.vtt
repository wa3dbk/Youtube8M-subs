00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.650
Robert: Hi, I'm Robert.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.510
Sometimes you can't, or don't want, to remove
the factory stereo.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.099
But that doesn't mean you have to settle for
mediocre sound, or settle for the few options

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:11.969
built into that stereo.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.780
In this video, we're going to talk about options
you have for upgrading the sound quality in

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.340
the stereo without changing it.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.699
The first step to getting better sound from
your factory stereo is to replace the cheap

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.359
factory speakers.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.449
My buddy Ken will tell us a little bit about
that.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.329
Ken: This car has a very basic audio upgrade,
and one of the most effective.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.430
The factory speakers have been replaced with
aftermarket speakers.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.430
Robert: That's right.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.830
In fact, this is my wife's car, and she really
wasn't interested in getting a new stereo

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.140
but she wasn't happy with how the original
speakers sounded.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.890
They were muddy, and the sound only got worse
when the volume increased.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.360
So I replaced the speakers to give her music
the clarity it was lacking.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.530
Ken: Many vehicles require that you remove
the door panel in order to replace the speakers

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.960
— that sounds kind of daunting but it's
usually not that bad, especially if you have

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.450
a Crutchfield MasterSheet for your vehicle
— it's all laid out for you.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.460
With few simple tools you're ready to go.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.060
Now for this door panel, we've taken off a
few of the trim pieces and we've gone ahead

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.870
and taken out a few screws and you'll see
the door panel lifts right off.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.700
Once you've taken your old speaker out of
the door, simply plug in the Crutchfield-supplied

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:34.560
wiring harness to the new speaker, plug it
into the factory connector, and the mount

00:01:34.560 --> 00:02:09.280
it onto the door with the screws that are
supplied.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:27.620
And you're done.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.190
Once you've tested the speaker to make sure
it's working OK, then it's time to put the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.200
panel back on.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.790
Just reverse the steps you did with the MasterSheet.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.099
Robert: You get much better sound from aftermarket
speakers, especially in terms of the level

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.599
of detail and blends from lows to highs.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.810
Ken: Yeah, and most aftermarket speakers work
fine with the low-powered factory stereo.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.200
Some do require more power than a factory
deck can provide.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.029
You'll want to decide how much of an upgrade
you want before replacing the speakers so

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:58.510
you know which speakers you're going to buy.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.510
Robert: Exactly.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.760
Ken: Now if you want to take your system to
the next level, beyond what aftermarket speakers

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.230
and maybe a new receiver can offer you, you're
going to need to add an amplifier and a subwoofer.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.239
Robert: And for the next part of our discussion,
it just happens that I have another vehicle

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.230
for us to take a look at — one that has
a more serious audio upgrade.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.230
Let's go check it out.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.379
Ken: All right.
