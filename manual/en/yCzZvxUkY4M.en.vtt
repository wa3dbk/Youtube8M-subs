00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:38.370
Alright, I'm sold.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.260
It's taken a few years, and I may never get
over the character design.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.030
But nonetheless...this game is awesome.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.250
Fully, totally awesome.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.090
I'm on board, Ratchet and Clank.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.340
Better late than never.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.960
So this is the final installment of Ratchet
and Clank's Future series.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.250
And honestly, I've never really paid much
attention, so I can't say much about the previous

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.250
games.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.250
And this one makes me regret that.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.170
It's like the entire philosophy was, just...hey,
let's make a 3D action platformer with action

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.850
that's actually as good as the platforming.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.950
Oh, and let's have really good platforming,
too.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.420
This is the perfect kind of game to just kick
back and play.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.580
Not too much to think about or be overwhelmed
by...just to play.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.040
To break crates, collect stuff, upgrade guns,
jump across gaps and blow things up.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.500
And it's all done so well, it's hard to find
anything to complain about.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.400
I guess that one thing that defines Into The
Nexus more than anything else...is that the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.850
gameplay is constantly evolving.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.740
The more you play, the more of the game unravels.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.620
You're unlocking new weapons and gizmos and
gadgets, and each one elevates the game to

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.680
an entirely new level of awesomeness.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.660
It never just stays the same for very long.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:10.810
Even though there are constants, enough changes
to keep you interested.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.480
One thing I've noticed people complaining
about...is that it's short.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480
And I can see that.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.130
It's anywhere between 6 or 7 hours, the first
time through.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.320
But that's the thing.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.760
The pace is so satisfying and the game is
so fun, you'll definitely want that second

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760
run.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.030
And frankly, who decided what was too short
for a video game?

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.830
I think this is the perfect length.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.980
Think about it.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.450
Studies show that, like, 90 percent of people
never actually finish the games they're playing.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.890
So maybe 6 hours isn't too short.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.590
Maybe 26 hours is too freaking long.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:49.310
Anyway, what matters is...however long you
play it, it's fun the entire time.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.990
As much as I hate the character design the
levels really surprised me.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.260
There are some pretty cool environments in
this game.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.280
And unexpected, too.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.800
You go from beautiful hillsides to...oh, now
we're underground, and there are strange carvings

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.570
on the walls with ritualistic stick figures
eerily hanging from the ceiling.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.880
The game always takes you somewhere cool.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.440
Even if it's a place you might not want to
be.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.870
And you know, there's a real addictiveness,
to a game like this.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.480
It's the perfect storm of these habit-forming
game elements, you know?

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.090
I mean, there are just things everywhere that
you can smash, and collect these shiny little

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.090
nuts and bolts.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.990
Which, of course, you can use to buy more
gadgets.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.990
And upgrading!

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.300
It's so easy and relatively fast, you're just
compelled to keep going.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.480
It really is just a joy to play.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.630
So what's not to like?

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.050
There's definitely some cool platforming,
but I always want more from these games.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.120
Less flat levels and more perilous jumps and
stuff like that.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.220
I mean, you've got a hover pack, a la Super
Mario Sunshine.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.560
Give me some of that tricky, towering, Noki
Bay platforming.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.541
Then again, I'm probably nitpicking...criticizing
things that aren't there, and all that.

00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:09.760
And really, it's all you can do with a game
this good, and this well made.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.270
And as someone who isn't familiar with the
series, I really liked the mechanical emphasis.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.630
It's all about the gadgets, the weapons, the
crazy robot enemies...really cool stuff.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.440
And with surprisingly diverse level design,
given that...very specific concept.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.800
There's heart beneath the steel, and color
on top of all the metal.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.560
And above all else, there's a really good
time in Ratchet and Clank: Into The Nexus...a

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:47.470
fine action platformer, and one of those rare
games in which both halves are equally awesome.
