00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.670
Hello hiii you do the 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.729
same hi every time no last time I said hola yea hola

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.000
so we are officially in Europe and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.890
we are on our own we are off the ship this
is actually day 2 in Barcelona yesterday

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.010
it was just a litle crazy trying to find
a hostel

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.289
in a new city in a new country on a new
continent

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.289
that we've never been before

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.710
but everything went really well yea we got
off the ship obviously

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.250
no problems then we took a little shuttle into downtown

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.440
that got us on La Rambla which is
kinda the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.500
touristy strip of Barcelona on the Times Square of Barcelona

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.360
The Times Square of Barcelona found wifi at
Starbucks was actually pretty funny our

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.989
tour guide today said

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.270
there's one area that really skews all
the crime rates

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.610
the most dangerous place and that is
Starbucks

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.180
only foreigners only American foreigners
are going to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.750
the Starbucks and paying that much for bad coffeeand they leave all their stuff right on the table to take

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.409
we found are hostel we met ore
hosts here at the hostel for

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.750
 the place when we originally arrived we had the room to ourselves

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.040
by the end of the night we had two other
guys with us

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.310
so hostel living it was pretty difficult

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.760
the fourth member of our dorm came home around 2
a.m.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.950
and there were just showers running
there were

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.330
doors opening doors are unlocked locked
in a

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.700
there's all kinds of stuff snoring

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.100
that's something I'm sure we're going to get used to but

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.399
for last night it was a bit out of our comfort zone both of us

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.930
I think Barcelona is absolutely fantastic but it does remind me a lot of New York

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.810
we were over on La Avenue Parallel and it

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.110
just reminded us a lot of our old apartment

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.229
area in New York we figured out the
subway

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.899
the Metro today which I think is
better than New York

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.850
much cleaner it's wider it's
faster

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.270
and its two euros each per trip so not bad

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.000
after getting settled in to the hostel
yesterday first thing

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.420
actually as promised was got underwear

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.280
and socks and new sleeping shorts we ended up at
an artillery store that had

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.069
AK-47 on the wall

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.000
that was not sporting good
clothing

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.010
ended up at a cool just kinda like a
running store yeah

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.030
called Decathlon then
we went to lunch

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.360
ordered way too much way too much

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.830
and wee ordered sangria and they came out with this huge pitcher

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.980
of sangria that restaurant was pretty expensive it was
about forty euros for everything for

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.290
dinner that night we actually went on
the hunt

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.480
there's something here called travel bar
which is basically just kind of a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.370
traveling themed bar but they are actually really smart
the way they do it basically they go to all

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.780
the hostels about put out coupons

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.150
for free drinks and free food free
walking tours and stuff to attract

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.780
all the travelers to the Travel Bar they're the ones
that host the free walking tours for

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.170
 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.780
which is what we did today 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.810
 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.849
 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.250
 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.440
which was really cool learned a lot of cool stuff all types of

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.510
architecture

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.989
 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.739
 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.010
 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.109
 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.260
 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.690
that is one thing I've learned is that Barcelona is such an 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.489
old city it's actually older than Rome by a few hundred years

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.690
and so it was really interesting to see all this history and even the Roman

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.110
parts of the city from when Rome came in

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.610
so we got to see that it was really cool it seemed like every corner you turn

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.040
there's something there like taking a
tour there was really

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.269
something in like everywhere you go

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.390
it was crazy okay so it got a little cold outside

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.560
we thought we'd come back in and do our conclusiÃ³n

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.760
that's it we're gonna have a new a fake
Spanish word of the day

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.870
today's is conclusiÃ³n

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.010
that was about it for the day tomorrow we head

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.310
to Paris tomorrow night tomorrow is going to be a big day we're gonna figure out

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.199
the train passes so we don't know where
the train station is or how to 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.050
activate our tickets or what train we're
going to be taking

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.919
in a perfect world we would be able to take a sleeper

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.990
train tomorrow this is it for us today
we miss everyone

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.169
