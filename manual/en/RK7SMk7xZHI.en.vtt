00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.590
You know, some of the challenges that I have
when I'm frog fishing is fishing under a bright

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.730
sunlight like we have here.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.910
A lot of that has to do with the weather that
we have had if we have had a front or if it's

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.570
post frontal or it's just we have had a high
pressure for the last 2 or 3 days.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.420
A lot of sun is a good thing, for me especially.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.350
As you can see we have a lot of overhanging
trees and brush in the water and for me; what

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.890
I always like to do and is something I've
been noted for is taking the bait and skipping

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.550
it way back in the bushes and when the sun's
out, like it is right now, you really have

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.750
to get back into those back pockets.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.500
I mean that's where all the shade's at.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.769
For this particular bait, you know you need
to get to where you need to take the bait

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.670
to the fish because they're going to be up
in the shallow trees so the condition/water

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.820
temperatures all that plays a factor, wind
direction, you want to look at all that stuff

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.110
because that's going to dictate whether they
are going to be all the way in the back, or

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.890
they're going to be in the secondary's, or
they are going to be out on the points.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.980
So a lot of that has to do with just making
multiple presentations and trying to figure

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.860
out where they're going to be positioned in
and around the cover.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.700
But with the sun out they are more than likely,
you know we're kind of in the morning still,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.870
they're going to be more attached to the cover.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.110
Later in the day, you know the suns been beating
on them for 4-5-6 hours, the water temperature

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.250
will be coming up, a lot of times you'll see
them suspend up, in, around the trees.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.040
They're just out from them and they're more
willing to travel say 2-3-5 feet to go get

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.520
bait whereas, right now, I probably have to
put it right on top of them for them to come

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.870
up and grab it.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.150
So, keep that in mind whenever you're fishing;
let them tell you how they want the bait and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.060
how you need to present it to them because
that's going to be the key for you to go out

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.940
and duplicate that and the place and other
parts of the lake.
