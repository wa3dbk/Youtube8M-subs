00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.430
Here in the Canadian Rockies, Kyle Hale and
the Kicking Horse Mountains Safety Team

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.360
are preparing a graphic demonstration of what
happens to the human body when it's hit by

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.369
a big one.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:27.500
To do this, they use two lifelike dummies,
which are accurate replicas of the human body.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.539
Each dummy weighs the same as an average man.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.350
To add realism, they're geared up with snowboards.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.660
Good to go.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:49.280
Using high explosives, the team triggers an
avalanche.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:05.000
The dummies are right in the way of hundreds
of tons of snow traveling at over a hundred

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.390
miles per hour.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.380
As soon as it stops, the snow sets up like
concrete around anyone who's been buried.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.140
That's why it's often impossible for victims
to dig themselves out.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.810
So, survivors of an avalanche have to move
fast to reach their friends.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.780
It takes only minutes for them to suffocate.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.180
If you cannot conduct a self rescue within
your group the changes of survival are, are

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.490
really slim.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.590
At this point we've located two subjects.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.100
One is breathing and conscious.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.100
The second, no resp.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.100
Ten-Four file.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.880
EMS has been activated and the helicopter
is on its way.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.340
It's taken our team about five minutes to
excavate the, the bodies.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.450
And, as you can see behind us, they're quite
contorted and banged up.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.720
If this had been a real situation, we would
be lucky to find either of these two individuals

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.910
alive.
