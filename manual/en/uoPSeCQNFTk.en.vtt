00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.850
Hi today from Skilled Wound Care we will be discussing wound care in the nursing facility.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.589
 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:09.990
focusing on a wet to dry dressing we
will be demonstrating a wet to dry

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.760
dressings

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.710
and one of the most controversial uses of
a wet to dry dressings

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.029
is in the nursing facility because it is
not recommended for prolonged use in the F-Tag 314.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.920
 Okay so now we're
gonna go ahead and demonstrate a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.960
wet to dry dressing. So we always use
normal saline

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.169
this is .9 percent normal saline and

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.520
on one of the things you always want to do
before you apply your dressings

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.579
is to irrigate

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.520
the wound itself and usually you can do that with a saline bullet or

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.480
with a syringe

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.160
and with a little bit of
pressure

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.489
irrigate that wound, but for now and then
after that we're gonna go ahead and you

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.590
can do the wet to dry in a number of ways,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.969
you can actually pour the saline 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.570
into a cup which I'm gonna do here for
this demonstration or you can actually

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.710
go over a sink and just pour the normal
saline

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.189
unto the gauze itself, and then I'm just
gonna go ahead and take a piece of the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:08.830
gauze

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.760
and just wet it here, and you can take

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.610
and then what after you do that you want
to go ahead and and

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.409
squeeze it and let a lot of the 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.619
let a lot of the lose water out of there and you
gotta make sure you use the loose gauze

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.310
The woven gauze that is loosely woven

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.890
and you go go ahead and open it up so
you get those fibers of the tissue

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.220
and then you just lay it on their and
you'll continue to do that with your

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.500
wet gauze packing the
wound as such and that's your wet layer

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.759
so you'll have all this wet gauze there inside of the wound

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.009
you may even want to put some on this
necrotic area here

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.649
that is your wet layer and then you move on
your dry layer and you will you the same four by

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.960
four dressings except they're dry and
then you may wanna lay them out

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.070
to be in contact with the wet

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.670
you'll keep going until you have enough

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.620
and then once you're done with that
you'll put either an island dressing

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.549
or I have an ABD Pad. You will put that over there.

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.739
And then you will use some skin tape to go
ahead and tape that down.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.750
Island dressings are preferable and that
will basically be your wet to dry

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.310
dressing

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.700
now what will happen is that these
dressings need to be changed within

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.810
eight to 12 hours in the nursing home
setting we usually only do dressings

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.750
once a day so make sure if you do these
dressings or at least doing them twice a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.150
day

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.980
morning and evening and when you're
removing them the reason why these are

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.840
not indicated in the nursing facility
specifically

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.019
from the F-tag 314, is that they're
painful to remove they, when you do

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.590
remove them, the whole purpose is to
remove the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.610
dead tissue from the wound so they're
performing mechanical debridement but

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.650
they also remove healthy tissue so it's
a non-selective debridement and so you're

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.450
removing granulating tissue

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.040
which can cause bleeding and break down
to the granulation tissue

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.040
so these cause pain, they cause breakdown

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.660
in the tissue and there's other
dressings that are better than these

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.790
dressings for

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.450
wound healing. Although studies have
really not shown that other dressings

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.069
will heal

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.889
wounds faster than wet to dry dressings
commonly we don't use them for this

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:21.489
purpose

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.200
so if you're gonna go how to remove them
the top layer won't be hard to remove

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.370
but probably after eight to 12 hours
this dressing here that is wet right now

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.440
if this had transpired for 8 to 12 hours
on a real wound would probably be dry

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.349
and then once you start removing it

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.540
it will probably be pretty hardly stuck
to the surface

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.389
to the basin of the wound and as you're
removing it, you're probably gonna rip

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.160
off some this tissue here

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.459
and it's going to be painful to the
patient so you may want to

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.829
wet it a little bit to remove it, but
that does remove the purpose of the

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:54.470
actual

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.419
pulling it off to mechanically a
non-selectively

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:04.370
deride some of the tissue on their and
so that will be painful so you may want

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.950
to medicate your patient when you're changing
the dressing

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.379
A lot of patients have pain with these
kind of dressings especially if the wounds

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.180
are this large

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.709
and so you may want to medicate them and
you want to use this in in limited

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.060
use and I am now today we have other
dressings are a little bit more advanced

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.639
than wet to dry dressing that mean we
want to use such as

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.240
hydrogels or collagenases or
calcium alginates

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.620
foam dressings there's just a lot of
different dressing that you can use that

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.490
have auto lytic activity such as

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.240
even honey dressings have autolytic
activity that may be superior to using

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.120
wet to dry dressings because wet to dry
dressings are non-selective so you'll

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.710
have the granulation tissue being

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.780
eaten up by them as well when you pull
them off

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.039
they cause pain so they're not our
number one treatment option in the

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.050
nursing facility wound care setting

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.400
more of this training is available

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.270
at our Wound certification course. I
hope you join us there and we can talk a

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.270
little bit more

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.620
about why we don't use this dressing
too often and why we like to use other

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.300
dressings

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.569
but that ends this demonstration
on wett to dry

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.720
