00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.490
We as students are provided with scholarships
in some cases by EPSRC and the Alumni of the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.230
university.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.520
We are also allowed to work in the department
for the teaching terms and provide assistance

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.840
during the exam period, invigilating exams.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.079
There’s great financial support for international
students.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.420
It’s actually called the Birmingham International
Scholarship.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.220
It’s for Maths students who have qualified
to do a PhD in Mathematics or even to do an

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.210
MPhil, specifically for international students.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.359
The conferences I went to this year started
in Galway in Ireland with the International

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.359
Conference.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.760
That was great, it was an entire week and
I was invited, I was a speaker so it was really

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.149
fun to do and afterwards there was a conference
at Oxford, again another talk and that was

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.149
fun.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.300
And lately the big one has been two weeks
in Venice for a summer school.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.479
So there are some speakers that I knew that
focused on a particular topic in Group Theory

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.900
for the whole two weeks and it was a really
class time.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.320
One of the great things about being an EPSRC
funded student is that these conferences are

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.370
all paid for, including one international
conference.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.600
So it really makes the experience affordable.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.820
We have quite an active post-graduate society.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.229
I think there are two key events that we have
every year, irrespective of financial situations,

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.619
and those are the Christmas Party and Dinner
and the Summer barbecue.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.750
We also play football once a week and go bowling
regularly.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.149
We also play pool on Tuesdays every now and
then.

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.789
We have a weekly cake club, like we’re just
having now, where someone brings some cake

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.030
in and we take turns on a rota, so you can
either make or buy a cake, so it’s good

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.030
for socialising.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.340
It’s quite relaxed and people are easily
approachable and make you feel welcome, especially

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.360
if you’re an international student or for
anybody at all.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.219
It’s always difficult leaving home.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.109
I think it’s important, especially if you’re
doing a PhD because you’re independent so

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.110
you need to talk to other people sometimes,
so yeah, it’s really good.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:18.340
From the point of view of a Maths PhD specifically,
it opens up a massive number of graduate careers

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.180
to you that may not necessarily come directly
out of an undergraduate Maths degree.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.780
I’m in the Applied side so I can go and
work for an engineering company, as one of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.290
my previous colleagues has done.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.100
Several have gone into actuary and accountancy
so it’s quite varied what we can do.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.790
The fact of the matter is that almost everyone
applying to these high-end jobs now has an

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.840
undergraduate degree and a PhD is a way of
further differentiating yourself from everyone

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.339
else who will be applying for that job.
