00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.460
Released in November of 1989, this $40 million
dollar animated musical fantasy film marked

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.209
the start of the so-called "Disney Renaissance",
a ten year period that saw the resurgence

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.270
of widely successful animated films from the
Walt Disney Company.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.471
Thanks to a strong heroine, well-written songs,
and an inspiring, kid-friendly plot, this

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:24.759
G-rated adventure grossed over $200 million
from multiple theatrical runs.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.759
Like most of us though, I first saw the film
on home video, where it did remarkable well,

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.560
selling over thirty-million copies.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.840
Its success also spurred two direct-to-video
follow-up films, a 31-episode Saturday morning

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.750
TV series, and a stage adaptation still in
production.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.080
Loosely adapted from a 19th century fairy
tale by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.000
the short 82-minute story follows a teenage
mermaid who dreams of life beyond her underwater

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.210
home, foolishly making an unfavorable deal
with an evil gypsy octopus to win the heart

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.950
of a man she's crushing over.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.870
Voicing the title character, Jodi Benson is
playful, sweet, and indelibly charismatic...

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.270
quickly convincing the audience why she's
worth cheering for.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.730
Her singing voice is equally incredible, expertly
anchoring a number of the film's extremely

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:42.180
memorable musical numbers.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.289
Her anthropomorphized sidekicks include a
tropical fish, a crab, and a seagull, voiced

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.029
by Jason Marin, Samuel E. Wright, and Buddy
Hackett, respectively.

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:53.749
In a sort of unlikely mentorship role, Wright
is quick to subdue Benson's over-eager excitement,

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.350
remarking, "Somebody's got to nail that girl's
fins to the floor."

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.060
Indeed, it's a bit far-fetched to believe
that a sixteen year old would not only fall-in-love

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.799
during a single afternoon, but end up marrying
that person the very next evening.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.479
Although the humor and gags are clearly aimed
a younger audience, Hackett's goofy persona

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.630
as an ignorant know-it-all still makes me
laugh, and is probably my favorite character

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.630
in the picture.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.360
Christopher Daniel Barnes, Kenneth Mars, and
Star Trek's Rene Auberjonois round out the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.170
supporting cast of exaggerated characters
with serviceable performances... but it's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.080
Pat Carroll as the nefarious Ursula that truly
steals the show... voicing a scary, but quick-witted

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.350
villain, albeit with poorly explained motives.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.470
It's also curious that she imposes arbitrary
limitations into a curse she designed, only

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.180
to cheat her way to victory later on.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.950
The landmark sequence is Wright's up-beat
calypso number, "Under The Sea', which besides

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.570
being endlessly catchy, also won the picture
one of its two Academy Awards.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.340
Impressively animated with all hand-painted
cells and analog camera work, the direction

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.900
by Ron Clements literally paints a beautiful
and imaginative portrait of an underwater

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.120
kingdom; brimming with life, colors, and personality.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.720
Similarly, Alan Menken's score that weaves
everything together is particularly outstanding

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.070
and a pleasure to listen to.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.320
Although the quickly-paced story is a bit
trite, and many developments feel rushed and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.320
unrealistic, it's a simple and important allegory
- that teaches children to strive for their

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.250
goals, without compromising who they are.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.900
This film is hard to separate from nostalgia,
but even twenty five later, it still holds

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.090
up incredibly well.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.570
A marvelous experience that has stayed with
me all my life, it's also worth rewatching

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.570
every few years.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.260
"The Little Mermaid", "Magical journey with
amazing music."

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:30.290
Now let's see what you had to say in the YouTube
comments.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.020
Our scores for "The Little Mermaid"... an
EIGHT and an EIGHT.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.010
You applauded the music and animation styles,
calling this a GREAT movie.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.010
I have to agree... for kids, and especially
little girls - this movie is a wonderful time,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.100
and for adults there's still a fair bit of
fun and excitement to keep you entertained,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.180
I thought it was GREAT as well.
