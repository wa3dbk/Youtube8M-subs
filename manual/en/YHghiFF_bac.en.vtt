All right, now we're going to talk about the
kick for the west coast track. Like some similar

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.770
to the snare, a lot of east coast tracks,
they use the kick from the break beat, but

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.920
what you want to do when you're making a west
coast track, probably use the kick from a

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.200
keyboard. A lot of kicks from the keyboard
can even give a little bit more bass in it

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.270
because it's a newer kind of sounds. You want
to have some bottom in the west coast tracks.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.180
You don't want to have it too deep, just like,
wow, that's just too much, but, you can, really

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.370
just have it as deep as you want. The kick
you just have to be original, have it at a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.050
rhythm you want, just fool around with it
until you get the kick that you like, but

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.829
like I said I will suggest that you use it
from the keyboard, don't use a break beat

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.050
drum kick, but if you'd like to, you can,
but use a kick from like probably keyboard

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.930
you can use some real 808s, you can keep it
down low, or, however you want to do it, similar

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.860
to the east coast track just have a rhythm
that you like. And what we're going to do

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.479
is I'm going to show you this west coast track
we've been working on, I'm going to show you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.189
the kick, where I place the kick, the kick
is a little bit lower than what the east coast

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.509
kick was, so you can feel that little bottom.
When people are riding in their cars they

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.700
hear that little bass a little bit more, so
come check me out. Now I'm going to show you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.840
the kick, like I said before, the kick can
be anything you want it to be, just kind of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:33.929
be creative, and let me show you the kick.
You hear the high hats and the snares going

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:57.479
their way, now here's the kick. See the kick
is just a basic pattern. Yeah. So that's just

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.729
something you want to do, the kick is real
bass heavy, so what you want to do is you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.679
know probably put some bass, a lot of bass
in your west coast tracks.
