00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.960
Hi everyone, I'm Claire, and I'm back for
Brilliant Botany episode two with some summer

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.290
reading recommendations from some of my favorite
botany-related books.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.800
Now for my first recommendation, I couldn't
pick one of Amy Stewart's books, so I have

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.800
three of them.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.870
Amy Stewart is a science writer who typically
writes about plants--she also has a book Wicked

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.730
Bugs which I don't own because I'm more of
a plant person--but the first of these is

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.150
Wicked Plants by Amy Stewart, which is a really
great, it's almost like a reference, you could

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.620
definitely read it through, but it's basically
a history of plant poisons, and their different

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.980
uses.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.289
Ranging from food, to weapons, to famous people
who have died, all sorts of things.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.329
And it's actually a really gorgeous book.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.600
It's a really nice hardback.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.499
I'm a book geek so I really like it for that.

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:49.569
And it has really great illustrations.

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:54.190
The second of these is, the first one I read
by her, is Flower Confidential and this is

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.120
the good, the bad and the beautiful of the
cut flower industry around the world.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.019
It talks about breeding blue roses, breeding
the Stargazer Lily, which I mentioned in my

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.760
last video, how roses are cultivated and shipped
from Ecuador, Guatamala, all around the world.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.079
It's super interesting, super well-written,
it's more of a narrative than a science book

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.070
which is something that I really love about
it.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.780
The third of these is The Drunken Botanist
by Amy Stewart, her newest book, and similar

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.920
to Wicked Plants it's a really gorgeous hardback
with great illustrations.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.680
And it is little anecdotes, and each chapter
or section is a different plant and how alcohol

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.680
is derived from it.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.899
So it's basically any alcohol you can think
of is in here with back stories.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.049
Fruitless Fall by Rowan Jacobsen, the collapse
of the honey bee and the coming agricultural

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.049
crisis.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.310
It was published in 2008, so it's a little
bit outdated in terms of talking about colony

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.290
collapse disorder, the disease or condition
that was striking all of the world's--or at

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.619
least the United States'--bees a couple of
years ago.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.320
It is a very great book if you want to learn
about how bees work and communication and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.820
hives; it's very great.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.429
As you can see, I have lots of post-it notes
in it, because plants and bees, both very

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:02.429
important.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.729
This is one of my absolute favorite books,
The Wild Trees by Richard Preston.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.310
It's about Coastal Redwood research in Northern
California and how that started within the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.230
last couple of decades.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.960
And the men and women who started that area
of research.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.810
One of the first researchers, Steve Sillett,
free-climbed into a redwood canopy without

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.910
any gear just to stand in the crown of a redwood,
and it's believed that he was one of, or the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.340
first man to stand in the crown of a redwood
tree.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.470
This is more of a practical recommendation,
this is Newcomb's Wildflower Guide, mostly

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.360
based in Northeastern America, I'm sure it
reaches up a little bit into Canada.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.650
It's what I've used in my plant systematics
courses to identify plants.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.610
It's a really great, easy-to-use guide, so
even if you aren't a botanist and don't know

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.450
that much about plants, you can use it to
identify stuff in your area.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.230
You basically need to be able to tell how
many petals a plant has, how its leaves are

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.000
arranged, which will be explained to you in
the book, and what shape those leaves are,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.370
also explained to you in the book in terms
of options.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.040
And then it leads you through questions, so
you figure out using pictures and descriptions

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.670
what plant it is you're looking at.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.590
And there you have it, some summer reading
recommendations if, like me, you have some

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.870
down time right now.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.570
And if there's a particular topic you're looking
for a book on, drop a note in the comments

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.650
and I'll see if I can come up with a recommendation
for you.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.591
Similarly, if you have any botany-related
questions leave those in the comments and

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:30.840
I'll answer them in a future video.
