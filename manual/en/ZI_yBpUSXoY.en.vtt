00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.520
Structural Studies of Phycobiliproteins from
Spirulina

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.180
Spirulina is considered to be an excellent
source of proteins.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.610
The structural composition of spirulina includes
phycobiliproteins that contain a covalently

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.300
attached chromophore called phycocyanobilin,
which is in a planar conformation when the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.619
protein is in native form.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.910
When the protein is denatured, this chromophore
undergoes a conformational change, leading

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.820
to a change in the absorption spectrum which
is recorded at 625nm using a UV spectrophotometer.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.530
This experiment examines the structural changes
occurring in phycobiliproteins upon denaturation

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.920
with potential denaturants like urea and potassium
thiocyanate, employing UV-Vis spectroscopy

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.129
Materials Required

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.440

Spatula.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.000
100 ml beaker
Sonication chamber

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.140
Procedure

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.470
Arrange the required materials on the Lab
bench.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.500
Preparation of Phycobiliproteins from spirullina.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.939
Place the weighing dish over the weighing
balance and tare the balance to zero.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.910
Take four spirullina tablets open them and
empty the contents into a watch glass.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.619
Using a spatula transfer the spirullina powder
from the watch glass to the watch glass kept

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.499
over the weighing balance and note the weight,
which should be approximately 2g.

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.399
Transfer the powder into a 100 ml beaker with
a spatula.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.140
Using a 100ml measuring jar measure 50 ml
of 0.1 Molar potassium phosphate buffer at

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.479
pH 7.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.159
Pour this into the beaker containing the spirullina
powder.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.840
Mix the solution using a glass rod.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.439
The colour of the solution changes to deep
blue colour.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.680
The spirulina solution is then sonicated to
break the cells and release the proteins.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.010
Sonication is done 5-6 times for 1 minute
at intervals of 5 minutes.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.060
The solution is then centrifuged to remove
the cell debris.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.870
For this, the solution is transferred into
the centrifuge tubes.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.450
Centrifugation is done for 20 minutes at 24,000
RPM at 4 degree Celsius.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.430
After 20 minutes take out the tubes from the
centrifuge and you will notice blue pellets

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.540
in each tube.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.120
The supernatant is transferred into a 250
ml beaker.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.260
Take 50 ml of 0.1 Molar Potassium Phosphate
Buffer at pH 7 in a measuring jar.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.040
Make the volume of the spirullina solution
to 100 ml by adding 0.1 Molar Potassium Phosphate

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.890
Buffer at pH 7 from the measuring jar.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.190
Weigh 29.00g of ammonium sulphate powder and
add it to the spirullina solution.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.830
Mix the solution using a magnetic stirrer
for 5 minutes.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.519
After stirring, the solution is again centrifuged
to isolate the proteins.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.870
Centrifugation is done for 10 minutes at 16000
rpm at 40C.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.770
The supernatant is transferred into a 250ml
beaker and discarded, whereas the pellets

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.100
remain in each tube.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.069
Measure 25 ml buffer in a measuring jar and
add it to the pellet in each tube.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.739
Dissolve the pellet in the added buffer by
shaking the contents in the tubes with the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:37.739
hand.

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.240
Transfer the solution into a conical flask.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.969
Protein Denaturation Studies.

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:48.239
Transfer 3mL of Potassium Phosphate buffer
into a cuvette using a pipette to be used

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.860
as the blank.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.300
To a second cuvette, add 3 ml of Potassium
Phosphate buffer using a pipette.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.060
Add 100 痞 protein solutions into this cuvette
and mix it well using the pipette.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.990
Then place the cuvettes in the UV spectrometer
slots and record the spectrum at 625nm.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.549
This solution is discarded and the cuvette
is washed and dried.

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.799
Now 1.5 ml potassium phosphate buffer is taken
in the cuvette.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.530
Then add the denaturant 1.50 ml of the denaturant
8M potassium thiocyanate to the cuvette.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.830
And finally add 100 痞 protein solution and
mix well using a pipette.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.750
Then place the cuvette in the spectrophotometer
slot and record the spectrum at 625nm.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.010
This solution is discarded and the cuvette
is washed well and dried.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.910
Taken 2.25ml of potassium phosphate buffer
in a cuvette .

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.350
Then add 750ul of the second denaturant 8M
urea to the cuvette.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.530
Finally transfer 100 ul of protein solution
to this cuvette.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.750
Mix well using a pipette.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.600
Place the cuvette in the spectrophotometer
slot and record the spectrum at 625nm.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.130
After the measurements are completed, both
the cuvettes are removed from the UV spectrometer
