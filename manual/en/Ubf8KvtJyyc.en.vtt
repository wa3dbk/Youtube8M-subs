Hello there, welcome to the Manchester Sky Ride 2012.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:34.933
[music]

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.233
Well this is my first Sky Ride,

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.233
so I’m quite overwhelmed by the

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.266
number of people here already. We’ve not done it before

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.366
so we’re just really excited to have a look

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.366
around the City without the cars.

00:00:45.366 --> 00:01:03.766
[music]

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.766
You don’t realise just how many cyclists there are

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.766
until you come to something like this.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:11.866
[music]

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.933
We’ve had a fantastic day,

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.000
it’s been great to see everybody giving up a bit

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and getting off the sofa

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and getting out and enjoying themselves.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000
[music]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.033
We did the circuit three times,

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.033
we enjoyed it so much. [laughing]

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:36.033
Really good, yeah!

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:41.566
[music]

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:44.066
Hello, I’m Kelly Brook. I’d like to thank everyone

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.200
for coming down to the Sky Ride in Manchester today.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.533
It’s been fantastic to see everyone out on their bikes.

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.766
I’ve really enjoyed being part of Sky Ride 

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:53.766
for the last four years, so please keep cycling.
