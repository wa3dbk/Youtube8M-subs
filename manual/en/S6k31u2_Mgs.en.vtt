Tofurky Vegan Vegetarian Turkey

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.223
Hey my Sweet Vs, It's The Sweetest Vegan here, and today on the 
 show I will be showing you how to bake a Tofurky.

00:00:06.223 --> 00:00:12.479
Now I have never had a Tofu Turkey, Turkey Tofu, Vegetarian Turkey before, but

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.139
we will experience it together.

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.322
But I think it will be simple to make. What you will need is

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:26.355
a Tofurky Vegetarian Roast, but they have one that comes with 
 gravy and a feast that comes with other sides.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:34.992
You will also need two large carrots (I just got baby carrots), 
 2 potatoes, 1 onion, soy sauce, olive, and sage is optional

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:37.137
I hope you enjoy this recipe, here we go!

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:41.866
We are going to start by preheating our oven to 350 degrees F.

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.698
After you have set your oven, we need to prep our vegetables.

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:48.249
Peel and quarter one onion.

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:54.219
Peel and chop two large potatoes.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:02.531
And if you are using large carrots, chop them up as well.

00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:07.338
But if you bought baby carrots, just grab a handful or two.

00:01:10.473 --> 00:01:16.476
An now we need to prepare our baste. It is a 
 simple mixture of olive oil, soy sauce, and ground sage.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:22.686
So after you have prepared your vegetables and your 
 baste, it is time to unwrap the Tofurky.

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:28.956
Take off the out layer of plastic and place it in the casserole dish.

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:28.956
Take off the out layer of plastic and place it in the casserole dish.

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:34.134
Surround it with the vegetables and pour half of the baste on top

00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:38.615
Bake the Tofurky for 1 hour and 15 minutes covered.

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:46.040
Then return and pour the rest of the baste over the Tofurky

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.550
Bake the Tofurky for another 10 minutes uncovered.

00:01:49.552 --> 00:01:51.550
Then the Tofurky should be complete and delicious
