00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.910
Hi, I'm Bruce with Armada Technologies
and today I want to talk to you about

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.139
the question that we really get asked
the most about, which is how do I find

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.950
lost valves? Really, there are two ways
to do it. I'll show you the traditional

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.430
method first and then I'm going to show
you a kind of a tricky one that most

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.210
people don't know about. It's a
little bit of an advanced technique but

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.689
I think you'll appreciate it.
First of all, these are our locators. I'm

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.380
using the 800D today but these
techniques will work either with our

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.630
300 or our 700. First, I want to
set up the transmitter with one

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.180
alligator clip going to the station wire
that the valve is the connected to, that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.420
I want to find. The other one, the black
one, is going to go out here to the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.800
ground stake. We've got that in the dirt.
Once I've got that on, I'm going to have

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.579
the receiver turned on as well. When I
turn on the transmitter, I want to make

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.070
sure the needle on here, the analog
needle, goes at least above 4. I've got

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.129
that so I know I've got a good ground and
I'm going to start tracking wire. Now, the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.930
receiver is in the null mode. The
null mode is lack of signal over the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.479
cable. You can see when I go over the
cable, I'm not getting any signal. What

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.500
I'm looking for when I hit that valve
box is an increase in the signal or

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.860
volume and I'll lose that null, so this
is not it. I'm cheating a little bit

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.970
because I know where this wire goes. As I hit this valve box,

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.640
you're going to hear the signal get louder and I've also lost my null. This is the valve

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.810
that I've been looking for. If that had been under about 6 inches of dirt, we would still get the same

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.049
signal but you'd know
where that valve box is. I'm going to go

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.119
back just to verify. I'm going to turn it down a little bit. I just get a light signal and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.659
when I go to that box, you can hear the
difference in volume. That's the valve I'm looking for.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.030
The second method that we're going to
use is a little advanced but basically

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.600
what we're going to do is I'm going to take
the black lead off the ground stake and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.040
I'm going to connect it to the common
wire that goes to the solenoid that

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.020
we're already connected to. What happens then is the wire path that we found

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.620
before is going to remain silent.
Basically, those two wires run together and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.190
they cancel each other out.
But when I get to the valve box, we're

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.610
still going to have that signal. In
essence, we're going to have no signal to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.180
the target. When we get to the
target it'll be loud and there won't be any

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.350
ambiguity as far as where our valve box
is. So we take our receiver just like

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.820
before. You'll notice, I've got this on
pretty high volume. I'm not getting any

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.560
signal over the wire that we had signal
over before, right? I'm just showing

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.709
you, you don't have that signal anymore
to guide you there. If you're going

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.760
to use this technique, you do have to
kind of know what area this valve box is

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.959
by either having tracked the wire before or
just from experience knowing where it is.

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.720
I'm cheating a little bit because I
already know where this valve box is but

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.170
watch what happens when we go in this
valve box. Again, no wire signal, valve box.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.010
I got a little signal back here. I can
get rid of that pretty easy just by turning it down.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.250
So again, with under 6 inches

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.689
of dirt on top of that
valve box, I'm going to know exactly where

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.590
it is. I'm not going to be confused by
wire before it or after it. Just that

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.349
valve box is going to light up. Great
technique

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.069
if you're looking for valves.
