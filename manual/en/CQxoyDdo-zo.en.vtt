scott

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.780
smoking while stoned actually add
doubles your risk of a fatal car crash

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.280
drive-through

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.399
but it's moving off though

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:13.589
no

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.229
how do i remembered for smoking i guess
bouquet

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:21.960
kroger also needs to a lot more smoking
actually in the senate hearing more

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.509
stone

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.359
dot

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.079
again inside i think as okay so uh...
driving milestone to actually doubles

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.530
the risk for fatal car crash now this
guy story before we even get into the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.780
nitty-gritty of this is the kind of
story that like anti-drug uh... people

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.870
who like to take it safely we can to
legalize marijuana because it doubles

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.489
the risk of the fatal car accident might
sort of alcohol if we legalized

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.690
marijuana we would regulate at the same
way that we regulate alcohol people over

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.430
the age of twenty one would only be able
to access it you wouldn't be able to add

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.370
dr bodily fluid influence underweight
those laws already exist don't drive

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.030
layer under the influence no tobacco
inconceivable to someone who's anti-drug

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.600
in the second it's legalized it's
legalized

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.590
everywhere i go everybody gets along the
job of flying a plane driving you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.600
starting in the tory pot i heard that if
you realize their wine at your gonna

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.500
start feeding infants

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.880
captain you know baby food that's
infused with marijuana stacy in

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.670
kindergarten as the the public school
teachers are teaching our children kids

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.230
how to be homosexual they grow up there
gonna be among pot to totally nobody the

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.400
one part of what occurred to know what
you said is that

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.430
you said that alcohol also it's the same
it's not actually alcohol even in this

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
study they say is significantly more
dangerous than public part of more

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.170
dangerous than you thought it was

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.840
but now the halls even well give me the
exact numbers i didn't know this but

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.310
let's say you're driving in your blood
alcohol level is the legal limit of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.240
point opiate that still triples your
chances of getting into a fatal car

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.270
accident act

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.110
that i thought that if your blood
alcohol levels up quite a way in good

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.939
right like sounds like you're you're
good enough to drive you know i mean i

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.320
thought that's why the decided on that
number here in our daily lives of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.489
students at this but i'll call them

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.499
it was by politicians some contract
right now ninety four we get back to

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.000
that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.189
i'd i'd just

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.869
if the numbers are there any still
triples your chance of getting into a

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.529
fatal car accident well maybe you
shouldn't have a blood alcohol level

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.760
plano eight i don't know this is my
sweetie

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.880
however if your blood alcohol level is
at point ten that quadruple rolls your

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.210
chances of getting to a fatal car
accident so yes it's finally write about

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.000
the fact that alcohol is much more
dangerous than marijuana when it comes

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.949
to

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:42.399
having effects on you wire dr yeah and
we should we should understand that

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:43.469
uh... d

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.999
they're not the same when you were
drinking you can start up a little bit

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:47.689
drunk

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.989
and you can get so obliterated that you
can't even stand how does not feel that

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.160
same way

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.770
right and they also say one important
difference between the two

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.380
is that while when you drink a lot you
tend to overestimate your ability to to

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.560
to continue driving anime it's at the
same with pop people who would become

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.730
stone actually drive more cautiously as
a result because they're in their

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.530
conscious enough to recognize the fact
that they might be impaired

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.239
rest with that something that they
pointed out

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.129
and this really fast this is a a
meta-analysis it was done and they

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.070
looked into numerous studies

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.510
and i i looked at the methodology it
seems completely legit uh... i could

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.179
suddenly changed anybody's mind his
anti-drug but

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:30.540
one thing that i like about this study

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.900
is that i think that the reaction to
this is going to point out a very

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.890
interesting difference between
conservatives and liberals who comes to

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.670
scientifically evidence definitely
before the study

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.819
by honestly thought that pot did not
significantly affect your ability to

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:43.579
drive

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.029
but i know integrating this do
information i still think party

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.730
legalized although i don't smoke

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.019
but i'm gonna do bear in mind that that
it does affect your ability to drive

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.370
this isn't affecting

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.960
your it is a similar side if you have is
that affect some of the anti-drug wilson

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.810
the conservative person won't even
intentions people are settler ways are

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.360
not

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.300
quick to take scientific evidence and
use that to change their own opinions

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.140
their day in fact they will use that
evidence to strengthen their own

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.430
opinions because they'll proceed in a
completely different regardless of what

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.499
the numbers are

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.869
on but when it comes to us driving while
stoned

00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:20.989
i think it's like unknown rainer when it
comes to how it could really affect

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.449
someone with h_i_v_ it makes you know
completely out of it leg you're out of

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.569
it you can't think right now it's little
reflexes so it's not a good idea to

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.459
drive why you're stoned everyone knows
that the question is how will that

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:38.129
knowledge be used when it comes to drug
policy legacies republicans anti diet

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.019
drug people are still guinea use it as a
way to keep it criminalize
