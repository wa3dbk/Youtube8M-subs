00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.830
How do we take care of a corn snake?

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.010
Now to start off with, this little fellow
that I have in my hand is actually a king

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.170
snake, but they are very similar.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.390
They are of the same class.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.820
They're constrictors.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.810
Corn snakes and rat snakes are almost one
and the same, and as you can see from the

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.410
pictures, they have more of a marbled appearance,
instead of the colors as the king snake, the

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.580
California king snake.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.390
They come in quite a few different morphs
nowadays and you'll get very, very interesting

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.049
patterns and colors with your corn snakes.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:46.290
Be careful, the colors come from breeding
and inbreeding, genetics, and unfortunately

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.860
what we're finding is, is the more unique
coloring's and morphs have more health problems,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.479
so it's very important to talk to the breeder
about the quality of the snakes.

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:06.780
You want to make sure that your corn snake
is active, shiny, round.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.720
They should not be concave, nice and clear
scales.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.140
The eyes, the mouth, the tongue should be
moving.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.190
The snake should be as inquisitive as this
little guy here.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.020
Corn snakes, when they hatch are about 10
to 14 inches long.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.380
As adults they could be up to anywhere from
3 to 5 feet, so when you buy your corn snake,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.770
be aware number one, they're wonderful snakes,
they're docile snakes, but they are going

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.520
to grow.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.300
You want to make sure that the terrarium that
you have for your corn snake, most of the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.620
time 20 or 30 gallons does it, but an easy
way of doing it is measure the length of your

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:56.160
snake, and the length and width of your terrarium
should be a little bit longer than the length

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.600
of your snake.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.090
So there's a good basic rule on the size of
the terrarium.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.479
Snakes are ectothermic, they're cold-blooded.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.850
So they need to heat themselves in the warmer
area of the terrarium for their immune system

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.350
to work, for their digestive system to work,
and you'll notice that they'll move from the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.060
warm area to the cooler area.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.920
It's important that for your corn snake, you
have either, they have heating ribbons now

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.830
that you can put underneath of your terrarium,
that gives kind of an even heat, and then

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.890
a heat light that is screened and away from
your snake, because they will get close to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.040
them and burn themselves.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.420
It's very important to control humidity.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.959
Corn snakes require about 50 to 60% humidity.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.400
It's very easily controlled.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.890
They need to have a basking area, so putting
a tub of water in the terrarium, so they can

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.160
get into the water, they can drink from it.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.790
It keeps them moist, helps with the humidity,
helps with them going to the bathroom.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.220
The other thing for our corn snakes is they
are shy, so they always need a hiding spot

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.500
or a hiding box.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.690
An easy thing to do is use a plant pot, turn
it upside down, cardboard box, but it needs

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.709
to be about the size of the snake so it can
ball up and be very comfortable in there.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.770
You can have a hole in the top or the side,
so that they go in to hide away.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.300
They are nervous snakes and if they do not
have a hiding spot it can be stressful and

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.380
cause illness.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.950
There's a few tips for taking care of your
corn snakes.
