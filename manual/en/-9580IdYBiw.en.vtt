00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.580
Hello.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.260
Tomatoes are fun to grow, and of course
exceptionally delicious to eat.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.880
With young plants at the ready you're
just a few weeks away now

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.460
from enjoying the tastiest fruits you've
ever experienced.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.180
In this video we share some ideas for
supporting and pruning your tomatoes

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.140
to ensure a bigger, better harvest.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.800
Whether you're growing your tomatoes
indoors or out,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.040
you'll need to give plants the right type of
support.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.040
Some tomatoes need more support than others.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.180
Cordon types, also known
as vining or indeterminate tomatoes,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.360
grow to head height and
beyond, requiring tall, sturdy supports.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.380
On the other hand, bush (or determinate) tomatoes

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.500
grow up to about 3 feet (1m)
high, and therefore require less support.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.360
In between are semi-determinate or intermediate types of tall bush tomatoes.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.780
Cordon tomatoes can be grown
against tall canes or stakes

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.829
or, in a greenhouse, twisted around
string.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.880
Firmly secure canes or stakes into the ground so they will hold up against

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.580
the considerable weight of fruit-laden plants and withstand sudden gusts of wind.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.420
Push the supports into the ground before planting to avoid damaging the roots.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.360
Tie stems at regular intervals to their canes, leaving enough slack

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.000
for the stem to
continue growing in girth.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.480
Securing a tie just above a truss will
better support the weight of fruits

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.830
than a tie secured below a truss.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.490
Use string or strips or soft material
for the ties.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.530
Fully loop the tie around the cane before tying in the stem.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.110
Cordon tomatoes can also be trained up wigwam structures, one plant to each cane.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.020
String supports are
easy to set up.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.019
Dangle string direct from the
greenhouse's framework,

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.720
or from a horizontal length of string
secured and stretch taut between the gable ends.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.680
Bear in mind that the greenhouse be carrying
the entire weight of the plants

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.340
so it must be strong enough for the job.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.799
The string you use should also be stronger than normal
garden twine, which can easily snap.

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.319
Loop string around the rootballs of the tomatoes at planting time to secure the string in place.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.300
The string will be further anchored into the soil as the roots grow.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.900
As the plants reach up twist the string around the stem,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.520
completing a full loop around the stem every two leaves.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.600
When you reach a truss, tuck the
string above or behind it - never below it.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.740
In theory, bush tomatoes
do not need support,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.400
but left to their own devices plants can
be weighed down onto the ground by heavy fruits

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.900
increasing the chances of slug damage,
disease, and fruit spoil.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.520
Tying plans to study canes
will keep them from flopping over.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.400
Tomato cages offer fuss-free support
for bush and semi-determinate tomatoes.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.459
Buy purpose-made cages, or make your own from concrete reinforcing mesh

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.099
or welded wire mesh such as this.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.839
Larger 6-inch (15cm) squares will allow you to easily flex the mesh into a tube to make your cage

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.809
and offer easy access to your tomatoes.

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:16.120
They don't cost much to make, and can be reused for many years.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.480
Start by cutting a length of mesh 5-6 feet long (150-180cm).

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.680
When rolled into a tube, this will give a cage diameter of 18-22 inches (45-55cm)

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.500
That's tight enough to support a plant, while giving it enough room to expand.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.660
Use sturdy wire- or bolt cutters to make the cuts,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.880
and wear gloves to protect your hands from snagging cuts.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.420
Once cut, carefully roll the length of mesh into a tube.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.280
Tie the ends together with
heavy gauge wire or string to give a close hold.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.700
Now cut off the bottom wire from the cage to leave just the vertical wires sticking out.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.220
These wires can be used to push the
cage into the ground.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.320
For added stability, tie the cage to a vertical length of rebar, or similar sturdy upright.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.440
You can also pin the bottom wire to the ground with tent pegs.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.480
Position your tomato cage by
lowering it over the top of a plant.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.069
Pull through any stray branches.

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:24.829
As the plant grows, encourage growth upwards through the center of the cage.

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:29.960
Fruiting trusses can be left to grow outside the cage to make picking even easier.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.320
At the end to the season, simply unfurl the mesh and store flat to save space.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.900
Tomatoes require regular pruning for
the best results.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.180
This includes pruning trusses to remove
excess fruits

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.040
and removing unproductive lower leaves
and side shoots (suckers) from cordon tomatoes.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.940
Removing developing
fruits from trusses may seem counterintuitive,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.180
but in warmer climates where growth is
especially vigorous

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.680
there are a few reasons why you might
want to do this.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.480
First, thinning the fruits within the trusses of
prolific fruiters such as cherry tomatoes

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.400
will insure those that remain grow
larger.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.500
For varieties bearing particularly heavy fruits, such as beefsteak tomatoes,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.560
thinning fruits just 3 per truss will reduce the weight of the truss,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.520
and make it less likely to snap
away from the stem.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.520
Prune trusses by snipping off the fruits
with sharp scissors while they're still small.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.160
Remove all leaves below the lowest ripening trusses
of cordon tomatoes.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.580
These older leaves will divert the plant's energy away from producing more flowers and fruits,

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.380
while reducing air circulation and light
penetration.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.760
Remove the leaves but pulling the leaf sharply up, then down, so it comes cleanly away from the main stem.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.080
Support the stem as you do this.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.680
Also known as suckers, sideshoots on cordon tomatoes
distract the tomato from

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.320
producing flowers and fruits, and must therefore be
removed.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.160
Sideshoots appear at the point where a
leaf joins the main stem.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.060
Remove them by wiggling them from side
to side, then using your thumb to snap them out.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.200
Remove sideshoots while they are still young, working from the bottom of the plant up.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.080
It needn't take long to complete these
simple pruning and training tasks.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.040
It's a once-a-week job, and at the same
time you can check on your plants

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.500
and the progress of your ripening tomatoes.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.560
Of course there are lots of other ways of supporting tomatoes - what system do you use?
