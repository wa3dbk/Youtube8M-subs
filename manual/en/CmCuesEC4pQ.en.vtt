Our next guest speaks 9 languages... but as for Kazakh language. He just began studying it little by little. Let's watch a quick report...

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:35.299

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:47.733
E facil conversar - POR, konusmak kolay - TR

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:57.666
Amir Ordabayev is a polyglot. He just translated the phrase "it's easy to speak" in 9 languages. There is no doubt about his abilities.

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:07.299
The 25 year-old speaks languages like English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Turksh

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:15.233
He works as an interpreter

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:31.266
For English the main motivation was to find a good job. But languages like French and Spanish I learned for football.

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:48.499
My favorite team is Real Madrid and I wanted to understan all the press-conferences with the players.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:07.933
Amir is a Kazakh. But he studied everything in Russian in high-school and did his Bachelor Degree in English in Canada.

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:18.966
Let's meet! Amir Ordabayev!

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:27.366
- Will or will not Real Madrid win this Champions League?
- Maybe this year they will make it.

00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:37.032
- Is Ronaldo in a good shape?
- If he stays fit he will score a couple of goals for Real Madrid!

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:43.066
- Does he speak Spanish well?
- Well, yeah he does! But he speaks with a thick Portuguese accent.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:51.799
You speak all your languages without an accent?
- Well, maybe 6 of them. + 3 are conversational
- When did you start?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:09.500
- Can I speak in Russian?    - Sure!
- I started learning English when I was 6 at school. I had to take an IELTS exam

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:21.800
so that was the main reason... When I was studying in Canada there were many people who speak Latin languages... 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:35.633
and that was a big motivation. 60% of English vocabulary is Latin but structurally English is a Germanic language... 

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:42.166
Football was the main motivation to learn languages like French and Spanish.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:53.799
If Kairat team does well in European competitions and if Kazakh team makes it to the World Cup... What are you going to do?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:11.700
Of course not only Kairat but if other Kazakhstani teams do well in Europe I think that would be a good reason to improve Kazakh.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.233
But of course the playes should give their conference talk in Kazakh as well :-)     - You started recently learning Kazakh, right? Are you motivated?

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:36.866
- Well... if I watch the news I can understan about 70-75%.
- We will invite you in 6 months. Hopefully you will improve!
- I will do my best!
