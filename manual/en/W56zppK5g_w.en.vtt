00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.820
but even at work logo is taking sex
therapy in a new direction this time

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.469
with puppets let's take a look jotted
here

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.789
all you guys you identities relationship
ideas to manicure veterans mcgheeteam

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.099
everything history no jeewa brawl

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:25.099
unwanted attention begin refused to hear
me campaign speak for with

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.330
that's and constant animated mine

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.150
adventuring

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.440
but that's not really what they look
like and what is that as a backpack

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.879
selling that this is this the resell
thanhnien at work and while they are

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.619
uh... it's a real life sex therapy
session the real audio but instant in

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:51.600
order to justify not disclose people's
identities they're using pot that's

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.559
inside of the actual video i'll love you
describe yourself as appealing to gauge

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.420
trendsetters and straight people who
want to be ahead of the curved and that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.949
this is a bailout twenty-four real
couples to open up without compromising

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.479
their anonymity anonymity and we
actually have a quote from the executive

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.450
producer of felt he said if we can bring
that up we want to create a show about

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.670
their api but we want to take the pain
out of watching people talk about their

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.890
sex lives so far staked on what do you
think i think that it's also a bit and i

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.610
totally watch that show no i was
actually a fan of at one point of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.259
cranking curzon just visually looked
very much like that the puppet section

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.240
pretty similar

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.439
uh... but it but love the the
juxtaposition of the puppet faces an

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.560
incredibly real the discussions that
there is the response

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.710
yet so at the ads you see this being
popular now bear in mind never heard of

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.030
local t_v_ before uh... but maybe a
typically double-barrel you never know

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.460
never know i think that a lot of people
will like that and i think that you know

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.830
even if you don't get

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.550
uh... liberty being air carriers
certainly obviously hearing about a lot

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.930
of news outlets maybe that one critical
to your watch that's online

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.979
or subscribe but i think it's very
interesting so what happened is that

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.860
couples

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.960
and that they in order for b

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.740
for being on the show in exchange for
that they got their therapy sessions

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.880
paid-for and they had again' lesbian
couple christians couples and couples in

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.069
their sixties sodas ranging across all
sorts of different

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.420
backgrounds you know

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.689
gender orientation all sorts of stuff
and i think it is great at it allows

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.500
people talk about saxon their sex lives
and open non-judgmental way because so

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.959
many people have all sorts of hangups
about sacks or ideals that they think

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.170
they should be performing too but
they're not holding up to those and it's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.900
hard sometimes to have a real
conversation about that because it isn't

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.099
does force to be vulnerable though at
least we knew your

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.790
you know you can't your face in out
there

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.630
you can have all the way you can really
open up to people here and i think that

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.160
people can can really listening media
dot some of the their advice in these

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.290
therapists and their own sex life there

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.310
the one real regret that i have is that
the people didn't know what for him but

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.209
it would end up on a t_v_ show

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.459
now i see in this community pre-trial
but i kinda wish that like the only

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.949
found afterward would you like this to
be

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.209
young saleable but because the business
transaction of and getting the therapy

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.140
paid for that can happen unfortunately

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.769
maybe a future seasons

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.029
on but i really like this idea i think

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:14.400
it's interesting commentary on reality
tv that reality tv purports to show

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.309
reality where people are basically
playing cartoons of themselves but when

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:22.849
you actually have real people we need to
cover them up with this in fact it it's

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:23.449
like this we

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.149
his reading circle in japan

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.319
reality is there not but when concern

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.810
tapped the public's inside of the people
yeah that's true like you said it looked

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.700
like actually a little more interesting
that the public that have not to

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.670
people's faces do you think in session
interesting dot supervision and you're

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.470
thinking of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.500
cleanup cost probably remind yourself in
the street and all these trial the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.730
battery and

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.090
kind of a more lighthearted less serious
topic so i think maybe people be able to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.780
relate a little bit better when they're
talking these awkward uncomfortable

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.250
aspects of jackson and they were talking
some serious things like when you say

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.150
hey you right now this relationship is
how about you know what you know

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.410
stephanie stereoscopic state to address
the output when you said opera

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.390
situations here is a pauper situation
it's going to come up

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.089
some child is gonna be like going
through the channels

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:10.379
but that's the activities of daily
universe that i'm not for playing
