Now we're going to begin to ink the block
and do what's called proofing the block where

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:15.309
we apply ink to the surface of the block and
pull a proof. A proof really is just that;

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.950
it is proof that the image is on the wood.
First let's discuss paper. There are several

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.500
papers that you can choose as an artist and
a print maker as well. Most importantly we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.079
want to us an acid free paper for the longevity
of the artwork itself. Something like newspaper

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.040
is fine to pull a proof on or even your 8
1/2 by 11 paper that you would buy in a pack

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.560
to computer print. That would be sufficient
for proofing but not for a final piece of

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.640
art that you would want to frame and put in
a gallery situation. There are several types

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.039
of paper. Generally what a print maker would
choose would be one that would not have a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:12.850
lot of texture that might be competitive or
one that has essentially different values,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.670
stripes for instance. Something like this
could be interesting. I would probably not

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.720
choose a paper that has a lay or a tooth to
it which actually occurs in the process of

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.650
the paper being created. The screen for which
the pulp falls on will have a texture or a

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.810
surface to it. These are a lot of hand made
papers are like this. The best choice for

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.090
right now is something called Hosho which
has two sides to it. Traditionally you print

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.040
on the smooth side of the paper not the rough
side of the paper, your image will appear

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.530
much more concise and precise. The marks that
you've carved will show up much better on

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.420
the smooth side versus the rough side of the
paper.
