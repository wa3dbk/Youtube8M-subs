Welcome to Pins and Things. Today, we're going to be making easter egg popsicles

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.529
So what you're going to need is 12 easter eggs and egg cartons

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.829
to hold them up. A small syringe or a round cake decorating tip, tape, a large nail, 12

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.799
Lollipop sticks and your favorite kind of juice

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960
So make sure they're perfectly dry and tape over the holes that are on the top of the egg

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.150
Next take your nail and poke holes in the bottom. The bigger side of the egg

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.429
Now that they're all prepped and ready. I'm going to take this little syringe. You can also use a cake funnel

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.009
Just a round one. I'm going to use this syringe and

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.739
Take some of my juice put it right over the hole and squirt all of my juice in

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.549
Once I've done that. I just put my popsicle stick in

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.980
and move on to my next one. Here's the method for using the little icing funnel

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.040
We just need something to pour that house kind of a lip on it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.540
And that works really well too. Now i'm straightening a little bit

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.450
And leave them in here overnight

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.850
Here they are. It was a little bit hard to open

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.800
but I just made sure to put it in a little bit of warm water. If you still can't get it from that point put

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.399
A butter knife in between and jiggle it a little and it will come open and look how pretty

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.880
It's perfect

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.690
And it tastes good. Yeah!

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.200
