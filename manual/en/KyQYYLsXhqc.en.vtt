00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:12.090
Alfred Hitchcock once said of films that “creation
is based on an exact science of audience reactions”

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.130
Many years after that shower scene, audience
reactions are becoming an exact science – Neuroscientists

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.130
are looking at how we watch movies to figure
out which styles of filmmaking have maximum

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.820
control over viewers’ brains.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.280
It’s popularly being called “neurocinema”.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.269
In one study, participants watched 30 minutes
of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly in an fMRI

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.020
machine, so their brain activity was being
recorded.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.710
The researchers compared the pattern of activity
in participants' brains and found it was remarkably

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.710
similar.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.450
During particular scenes of the movie, activity
in certain brain areas increased and decreased

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.790
at the same time across the participants and
their eyes tracked the same areas of the screen.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.850
The researchers suggested it was an indication
those scenes were more engaging.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.510
A follow up study compared the participant’s
brain activity watching The Good, The Bad

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.890
and The Ugly to watching other things–like
an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, an

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.600
episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and a real-life
10 minute unedited shot of a New York City

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.800
park.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.840
The researchers again used the similarity
of the participant’s brain activity as a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.390
measure of how engaging the scenes were.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.781
They found the Hitchcock episode evoked similar
brain activity across all viewers in over

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:40.990
65% of the cortex, the outer layer of the
brain.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.090
Similar activity was seen in 45% of the cortex
for the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but only

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.890
18% for Curb Your Enthusiasm and 5% for the
real-life New York City park.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.010
The study shows that Hitchcock could orchestrate
the responses of different brain regions in

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.790
a timely fashion across all viewers.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.550
Of course, fMRI can’t evaluate the artistic
and aesthetic value of a movie.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.810
And some movies and TV shows aim to control
the audience’s reaction more than others.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.690
It depends on the director's style and intentions.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.440
But soon we could see the audience sitting
in the directors seat.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.709
It’s been suggested films of the future
will be so interactive that they will respond

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.870
to your brain activity while you’re watching
them – so they can be the most engaging.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.290
It’s like the ultimate choose your own adventure…
that could end up being the true definition

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.200
of a horror film.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.580
Neurocinema can objectively measure some of
the entertainment value and audience reaction

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.440
to movies, TV shows and advertisements; and
we can use the results to refine how engaging

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.590
and emotionally effective they are.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.459
But it can't tell us who will walk away with
this year’s Oscars -- although big data

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.459
can.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.520
Check out Forward Thinking to find out how
something as seemingly unpredictable as an

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.790
Oscar can be forecast using the right methodology.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:21.300
There’s a whole new meaning to lights, camera,
action.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.400
Let me know what you think - and your Oscar
picks - in the comments.
