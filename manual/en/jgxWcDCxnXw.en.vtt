00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I have nothing else to do,
And I enter the opposite door

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
With no invitations, no announcements.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm roaming though the worlds,
Though courtyards with gates,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Where teenagers' "dramas"
Are hidden from their mothers.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Forgotten fingers on your face -
I will lend you them...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Forgotten touches on your face...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Forgotten fingers on your face -
I will lend you them...

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Forgotten touches on your face...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Then - what will be, will be.
Maybe he could forget me,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Would become as cold as a stone Buddha,
Would wait for a new miracle...

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But I keep flying, having nothing else to do,
And I enter the opposite door,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The opposite door...

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Forgotten fingers on your face -
I will lend you them...

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Forgotten touches on your face...

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Forgotten fingers on your face -
I will lend you them...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Forgotten touches on your face...

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Forgotten fingers on your face -
I will lend you them...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Forgotten touches on your face...

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Forgotten fingers on your face -
I will lend you them...

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Forgotten touches on your face...
