Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen from Vanveen bulbs
dot com. And in this segment we are going

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.059
to talk about how to grow indoor plants with
artificial lights. Now we all love our plants

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.340
outside in our garden, but we can also enjoy
plants inside. And you don't need to have

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.940
a really sunny window and you don't need to
have a lot of artificial light for them to

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.260
grow well. You only need a little light and
I found plants really survive well indoors

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.829
with a little help with just a little artificial
light. I have found this window is the best

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.859
window in my whole house for plants to grow.
It is east facing so it gets the sun that

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:44.620
comes up in the morning and then there is
no sun in the afternoon. I've got this artificial

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.319
light up here that is on every night. It's
about the only light that I leave on in this

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:55.480
part of the house. And it's just enough light
for all the plants to have light at night

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.170
as well. And it seems to be just enough for
them to do even better then if they didn't

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.230
get any light at night. And I found just a
little bit of artificial light goes a long

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.590
way. And all it takes whether it's a little
light in your laundry room or a light in your

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.020
bathroom or even a light in your office. If
you put a plant underneath that light when

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.240
the light's on at night it might be just enough
for that plant to do really well. So of course

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.560
the sun light is the best for plants. But
not all of us live in areas where even when

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.930
the sun is out and there's so many clouds
to cloud it up, you are just not getting enough

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.070
light in the house. So by just even having
a few lamps or a few lights or using the lights

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.409
that you already have, sometimes you can use
clip on lights and sometimes even a night

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.409
light over a plant will make all the difference.
And try it that's what my case is, try it

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.020
you never know what plants will do. A lot
of plants don't need much light to survive.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.560
And they will do very well indoors even if
it's a tiny night light above them. So try

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.299
to plant your plants inside under a light
and see how they do. If they are not doing

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.019
so well move them into a sunnier window, and
if they are doing really well, then leave

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:16.080
them where they are at. But gardening can
be really enjoyable inside or outside and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.830
you don't even need to have sunlight. You
can have artificial light.
