00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.030
Alright so we already know how to play Mary Had a Little Lamb on Black Keys

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.510
we learned that in our last lesson

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.369
and we really only need
to know  your number so that we know

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:13.510
which fingers to play

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.590
in order to play it on white keys we need
to know what letters to play

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.960
so we're going to use the right hand to
play this piece and we're going to begin

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.289
just as we did on the Black Keys with
finger three

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.199
so we had a little lamb in the key of C is
going to and

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.340
on the note C, so I'm going to place my thumb

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.210
my lowest finger on C, and I'm going to put one finger on each white key

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.330
so in this piece I want to use all

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.110
the fingers except the 4th finger, there's no F in this

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.370
piece of music so here I go beginning with
righthand finger 3

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.970
on E and when to play down from E

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.170
to D to C  to D

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.270
here are the first 4 notes

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.989
you can see it happens again down here
but next on

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.310
the first-line I'm going to play E three
times that's my third finger just as it

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.320
has been I have not moved my hand

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.330
now D

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.770
now EGG

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.869
G is right in here, it's the 5th finger

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.590
let's try that line again starting
with right hand three on the E from

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.520
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.310
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.630
now we're ready for line 2

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.630
here we go, finger 3 on E

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.680
and that's the end.   so if you need a
little practice

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.680
on playing your pinking on G  you can continue to practice playing that all by itself

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.340
just to get a little bit of strength in your 5th figer

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.370
And what you want to do after playing the note

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.020
is keep all of your fingers relaxed

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.860
she 5 wanna bring your hand back into
our

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.830
And after you play g with your 5 you want to bring your hand back into a relaxed position

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.140
Now I'll play it all again...right hand 3 on E

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.860
 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.819
 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.310
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.250
 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.739
 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.430
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.709
