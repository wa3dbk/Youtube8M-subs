Hi my name is Karl James owner of Creolesoul
Catering located in Round Rock, Tx and on

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.059
behalf of Expert Village I'm here to show
you how to make Boudin. So here we have it

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:23.619
our finished boudin once again we did a pork
boudin we used I used country style pork ribs

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:31.980
boneless for this. You can use a pork butt,
pork shoulder, we cooked that pork with a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.400
little pork liver as well as our holy trinity
some garlic, and lot's of green onions, we

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.760
separate it the green onions we had the the
bottoms we used the bottoms in the cooking

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.850
process and the saved tops for later. We added
2 types of peppers we added some crushed red

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:02.250
pepper and then we also added some green Serrano
peppers to this and to our seasonings we use

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.110
a little of salt and pepper with some creole
seasonings which added another layer of spice.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.870
As well as just a little of cayenne pepper
to add even another layer of spice then at

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:27.030
the end of that we added some parsley as well
as some thyme just for little extra flavoring

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:37.140
and once we got ready to stuff our boudin
we then added those tops from the green onions

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:47.360
into the that. Because this recipe is heavy
on green onions we then took our pork casting

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.430
and we soaked those in water for about 45
minutes, then we kind of threaded them on

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.100
a nozzle of one of the faucets and run water
through it to remove that salt that may have

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:11.410
been inside. We checked for holes and tears
we thread that onto our sausage stuffer and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.830
once my again my friend Denise Robinson gave
me a hand and I appreciate that, thank you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:28.440
very much, and we stuffed our boudin. And
here we go we steamed it got those castings

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.000
cooked, now we'll let them cool and we'll
either package it for freezing, or you know

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.430
if somebody's ready to eat some now we can
either do it in the oven, on top of the stove,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:57.070
on the grill, in the microwave, on a campfire,
under hot sunlight, here it is boudin give

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.480
it a try.
