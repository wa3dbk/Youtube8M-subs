00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.730
You may notice sometime that water is dripping
out of a tube in a place that it’s never

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.559
dripped before, and it’s a pretty annoying
thing and it may be getting your porch or

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.200
door wet. Well, there’s a reason for that.
It’s called the backup condensation line

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.100
 - backup condensation drip line. And when
water is dripping from this tube in a very

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:29.541
conspicuous place, it’s your alert to unclog
the primary drip line. &lt;P&gt; If your system

00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:33.140
is functioning properly, the condensation
that’s building up on the condenser, which

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.359
is 99% of the time in your attic, is coming
out of the tube where it’s supposed to,

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:44.690
which is a fairly inconspicuous place, normally
it’s by the compressor outdoors. This is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.450
necessary because the water, the condensation
building up in the unit, needs to go somewhere

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.079
 - otherwise it will damage your house. So
when this backs up, it clogs up with algae,

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.579
which is very common. Then the water starts
to get diverted into a drip pan in the attic,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.100
and that’s what the other condensation line
is letting you know - is that the water is

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.120
then building up in that. So what you need
to do is clean out this line, and I’ll show

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.940
you where to do that. &lt;P&gt; So what you’ll
need to do is brave your attic. Come up here

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.040
and see what’s going on. If your system’s
designed properly, this is the primary condensation

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.640
line- the one that you need to clear out.
And if it’s designed properly, there will

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.700
be a clean out hole where you can open this
up, expose this, and run some warm water with

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.600
bleach into the hole, which will eat up the
algae and free up the line. If it’s so far

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.420
gone that it’s really stubborn, you’re
going to need a snake and run it down as far

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.170
as you can, and that will probably alleviate
your problem. But otherwise, if this is clogged

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.710
then the water is coming out into this pan,
in which your condenser sits. And then it’s

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.700
draining out of the back up line. And if this
ever were to overflow, you’re going to have

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.480
water seeping through your ceiling, and you’re
going to have thousands and thousands of dollars

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.560
of damage on your hands. So it’s very important
to take care of this as soon as possible.
