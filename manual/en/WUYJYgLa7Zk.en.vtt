00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.049
magnitude if you're getting away my
involvement lists

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.469
the boarder lands to really sit still
over a month away but new details are

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.709
coming out almost everyday like new head

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.570
special addition and pre-order weapons
enhanced enemy a tiny and other boat

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.879
level goodies

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:24.229
i happen to know since point reason for
that can't tell you but

00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:28.359
mcknight to attach to certain characters

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.930
he brings us to a new feature for the
sequel it's not scales it's not maps

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:32.800
it's not

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.200
any of the gazillion guns story after
they are original boarder lands which

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.899
while in family entertaining had almost
no story or

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.190
character development to speak out

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.860
you know there was a vault you look for
the policy found the baltimore allies

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.620
and the story gearbox has promised more
main character and npc dept

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.860
and we should be learning more about the
original bulk hunters to that said they

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.679
had plans to make one of the main

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.149
playable characters the commando
accident bisexual but have since dish

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.100
those plans because they were to
controversial

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.290
that was recently revealed an trivia
bank an official xbox magazines

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.150
which said that the dev team abandoned
the idea did to potential backlash in

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.920
the community

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.619
but honestly does that bother you edit
cell bad for fictional deflated man to

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.360
be attracted to other fictional pics
laymen

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.970
barley and mass effect for you

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.890
were both games i got keeper featuring
mail in mail content options

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.820
but honestly i don't think ever should
have been such a big deal

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.230
i mean it'd anymore have considered that
we are going to nine a monster in the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.429
first quarter lands

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.040
or the testicles spider boxing half-life

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.420
i say no

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.250
then again i'm not exactly the demo that
goes on xbox live in chatsworth around

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.710
with magic order that squatty shaming
moving halo

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.970
someone alive

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.720
we have a little freedom flake on so
that kind of course gaining concept of

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.600
the summer

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.560
that thing i just can't shut up about
and its kick-start campaign with about

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.780
nine times the funding may ask for it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.890
over eight and a half million dollars of
plants and more than sixty three

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.000
thousand backers who say yes to have to
book crowd consul gaining

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.450
once we have one backers will start
seeing their consoles in late twenty

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.349
twelve but if he were not part of the
kick start a campaign and still want one

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.379
you can pre-order it online for ninety
nine dollars for shipping

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.719
for april twenty thirteen ship date

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.569
no one even sure how well those
incredible concept were actually work

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.819
and has received criticism mainly
regarding electronics manufacturing

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.029
logistics and piracy still it's hard to
deny it's a novel idea and he lives

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:35.569
pretty sexy the project has always had
top tier texting and many high-profile

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.110
backers now julia has even more aboard
including online twitch dot tv

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.469
namco bandai square enix is final
fantasy three

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.299
flats bebo x n_b_c_ and probably more

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.509
despite the criticism and the fact that
over four hundred fifty thousand units

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.849
need to be sold for to be profitable

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.819
and really help this console succeeds
with its mission

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.370
or do not only four revolutionary
console but our vision of

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.089
how'd we consume games and entertainment

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:06.919
and how developers get to create and the
lease it

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.239
plots at the very least i'd like the
idea that a little starter projects

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.579
could make sony nintendo and microsoft
sweat

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.739
our darling mars curiosity rubber stamp
its first week in the bride

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.869
getting a system that date or as nasa
calls it the brain transplant which does

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.689
nothing to help my habitat
anthropomorphic thing the robbers

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.169
personally i think you have to be is a
hipster because she is blamed the grainy

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.490
i think the tire fee

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.209
and she's not great at it

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.789
anyway the goal is to transition
curiosities main computers from landing

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:41.319
applications to software designed for
service exploration statistics will drag

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.289
ought to avoid ins and using the robotic
arm maybe a few free revive its big

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.849
brother spirit when day

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.099
curiosities computers and sounds
actually have about ten times less

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.310
horsepower

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.130
in what you might find your sparkle
according to density a senior software

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.950
engineer at j_p_l_

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.450
unlikely smart found the robbers read
seven fifty power p_c_ microprocessor is

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.359
built for extreme durability

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.309
and can withstand times thailand and
protons in interplanetary space and in

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:12.599
mars atmosphere which would ruin almost
any technology any of us down

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.799
since he says they simply need computers
to work because

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.929
well we can do that we called repairman
j_p_l_ also received for the first

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:24.860
high-resolution video friends of the
descent taken from the marty camera as

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.889
well as well resolution panoramas when
that happens

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.880
of course by the time this area's j_p_l_
in the world's most handsome systems

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.979
engineer may have had many simple video

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.680
hopefully this time it will be impact
limit some of us mistake for ilene

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.249
select

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.519
so who are you gonna play at the border
lines to personally i'm torn between

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:46.150
zero and maya

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.750
i declared my ap i'm not gonna be a
healer den and that is your job
