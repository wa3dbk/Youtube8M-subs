00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.210
Hello, this is Mike Hayes and on this video
we're going to talk

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.740
about how to teach yourself guitar chords;
in particular on this

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.250
video we're going to look at how to play the
G chord in a variety

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.100
of easy fingerings.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.100
Now if you've just started out playing guitar
you may be confused as to the best way of

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.980
playing a G chord; in
fact your friends might play the G chord in

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.210
a variety of
different shapes and you might have looked

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.940
up a chord book and
seen even different shapes for the G chord.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.559
Now in reality when
you're teaching yourself how to play chords

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.680
the thing to keep in
mind is that each chord has a specific spelling

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.620
and once you know
the spelling for that chord, when you have

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.010
that combination of
notes you can play it anywhere on the guitar

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.800
at all; so let's
begin with some easy G chord shapes and I'll

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.250
just explain how
this works.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.890
The notes that go to make up a G chord are
G, B and D

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.860
this is how you spell G chord in music, wherever
you have these

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.610
three notes G, B and D on the guitar fingerboard
you'll be

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.820
playing a G chord; in fact, you don't even
have to have these

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.550
three notes you can have just two of them
you could have a G and

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.000
a D and you'll have a G chord.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.770
I'm going to start off by showing
you two easy G chord shapes, now both of these

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.900
shapes only use
one finger, so if you're just starting out

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.710
on guitar this first
shape is a really good one to try, how I'm

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.340
playing this shape is
by placing my third finger, at the third fret

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.909
on the first
string, that's all I'm doing with my left

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.170
hand, with my right
hand I'm strumming the first four strings

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.720
... and there's your G
chord.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.640
Now, if you'd like a G chord with a nice rich
sound that's

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.000
good for backing up vocals what I'm going
to do is place my third

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.260
finger, at the third fret on string six: now,
this is a little

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.300
bit tricky because what I want to do is block
out string five, I

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.670
just want to make a click there; ah you'll
probably find it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.700
quite easy to do because if we just let our
third finger be a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.340
little bit lazy and lean across that fifth
string it'll block it

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.340
out.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.650
What I'm going to do with my right hand is
strum right down

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.280
to the second string; so in reality I'll be
strumming five

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.760
strings, but I only want four to sound because
I'm blocking out

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.370
that fifth string, here's my G chord.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.930
Now, these next two ways of
playing G chord are aimed at guitar players

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.970
who have been playing
for a little while; for example you probably

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.320
know the D chord
shape, but what you might not know is that

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.180
if you move this D
chord shape up the fingerboard until your

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.640
first finger reaches
the seventh fret, I'm just keeping the exact

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.209
same shape, the d
chord shape but now if I play the first three

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.849
strings ... I have
another way of playing G chord.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.010
So, here's another chord shape
that you'll already know if you have playing

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.160
a while, I'm just
going to take the C chord shape, now I'm going

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.629
to move this C
chord shape up the fingerboard until my first

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.819
finger is at the
eight fret. this time I have to be careful

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.260
not to strum the first
string or the sixth string but if I move my

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.480
C chord shape up to
the eight fret and strum the inside four strings

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.239
that the second,
third, fourth and fifth string I'll have a

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:09.690
G chord.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.300
And now I'd
like to show you two more G chord shapes that

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.120
I find very useful
in specific musical situations; ah, for example

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.410
if we're playing
songs by The Eagles for example this next

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.499
G chord shape would be
a very useful one to know and I'm playing

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:29.900
this G chord shape by
placing my fourth finger at the third fret,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.370
on the first string,
my third finger at the third fret on the second

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.610
string and my
second finger at the third fret on the sixth

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.740
string, I'm blocking
out the fifth string and I'm strumming all

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.689
the six strings, and
here's how this G chord sounds ... and in

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.839
many instances I would
use that G chord shape if I was changing from

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:00.990
G to C and I wanted
to create that "Eagles" type guitar sound

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.089
ah,I'd have to do if I
wanted to change to the C chord I would simply

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:10.300
move my second
finger down to the fifth string and we'd be

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.690
creating a C2 chord
and it sounds like this; here's my G chord

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.380
and if I wanted to
change to the C2 chord I'd simply move my

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.690
second finger down and
strum five strings, incidentally with this

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.529
C chord I'd be
blocking out the fourth string, here's those

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:49.319
two chords again the
G to C; and this last G chord I'm playing

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:56.189
by placing my first
finger at the third fret on the second string,

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.639
my third finger at
the fifth fret on the fifth string and my

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:07.330
fourth finger at the
fifth fret on the fourth string&gt; And, I find

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:15.520
this is very useful
if I'm moving from C to an F2 which incidentally

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.979
is going to be
the same shape, the exact same shape as this

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:25.529
G chord, so when I
move that F2 chord up two frets if becomes

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.819
a G chord.

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:35.340
Let's have
a listen to how these three chords sound:

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:49.979
C, F(2), G.
