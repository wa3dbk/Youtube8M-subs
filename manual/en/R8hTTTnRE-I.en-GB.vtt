00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.850
Howdy, folks! It's Barry here from my virgin
kitchen, back again in the videojug kitchen

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.350
for my series Good Food Good Times: A World
Cup Special, and today is the United States

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.380
of America. We're making sloppy joes but I
need to get a little bit more Americanized

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.470
[changes clothes] Whoa. Too American? Yeah,
I think so. [music]

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.022
Right, folks, I've just put the oil in the
pan. I am out of my American ways there, it

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:29.810
was very good for a brief moment. So, the
theory of sloppy joes, guys, I'm not really

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.450
sure. There's about three different ones.
A lot of it seems to be around the whole money-

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.829
saving thing. You let me know down below what
you think it is. I'll be interested to find

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:36.829
out.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.850
Anyhow, with this oil nice and hot we'll get
our mincemeat straight in there and start

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.530
cooking. This is just such a simple recipe.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.100
Okay, that mincemeat has browned nicely already.
It didn't take very long because the pan was

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.679
so hot. It was like so hot it was like Diana
Ross, one of the most American icons sunbathing

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.190
on a beach, eating a sloppy joe and that is
what we're aiming for, my friends.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.989
We'll add in this pepper and onion. It's only
a quarter of an onion and a quarter of a green

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.920
pepper, just to soften it up. Get it all nice
and moved around there. And remember, guys,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.080
if you want to have a go at making this recipe
it's one of the easiest one in the series,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.350
if you're looking for something un-intimidating,
check out the description box down below for

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.920
the full method and ingredients.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.160
The final steps really, guys, before we let
it simmer away is chucking the extra flavors

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.560
in there. We've got some mustard powder here
so a good heaped teaspoon amount, do you see

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.360
like that? Maybe even two teaspoons in there,
just sprinkle it all around. I'd say that's

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.430
more like two teaspoons, but of course you
can tweak the flavor. A little sprinkling

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.430
of garlic powder, a teaspoon of that. I've
got some barbeque sauce here. Whoa, in that

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.530
goes, a nice little bit of tang. And the ketchup,
and in goes our water so straight in there.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.810
We want to mix this around as soon as we can
because we want the mix to be fairly sloppy,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.909
hence the name. We don't want it to dry up
and go too lumpy and thick. Just want that

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.570
flavor working all around, so it's souping
it down letting that barbeque sauce and ketchup

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.530
working away for you.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.780
So this is a great meal to make for the big
match. Now I know you guys are more into football,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.320
which we call American Football, but you can
make it for anything. Enjoy the World Cup

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.440
and get into it. And you never know, you guys
might do quite well. If you're enjoying this

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.640
video, while this simmers away, don't forget
to give it a thumbs up, share, comment, and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.700
subscribe to both myvirginkitchen and, of
course, videojugfood.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.950
We're nearly there, we've just got to put
it in some buns once it simmers down. Believe

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.799
it or not, guys, that is it! It's had twenty
minutes of simmering down and you just want

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.700
to keep a little bit of moisture. Now I've
got some toasted burger buns here. So, what

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.599
you do is get all sloppy with it. You load
it up but it doesn't matter if you have a

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.099
little bit of spillage, so don't feel bad.
I'm just going to pile that on there. I've

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.291
probably got enough here for about three or
four buns, but I'm just putting two on there.

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.969
That's enough for this kind of diet. That's
how I keep my figure.

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.230
So, it's completely optional whatever you
put on these. This is just how I had mine

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.629
when I spent some time out in Boston, in America.
But let me know down below what you'd put

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.269
on yours. I've just got some steamed corn
and a little bit of shredded cheese, of course

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.659
you can put some cheese slices on the middle,
but let's just get that on there. Simplicity,

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.069
simplicity but sometimes that's the best thing
so you can enjoy the big game.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.019
That is it, my friends. So if you enjoyed
this video, like I said, don't forget to give

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.199
it a thumbs up. I'll see you again next time.
