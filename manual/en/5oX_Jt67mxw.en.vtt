Hello YouTube, It's Chrisy here from fellowes52.co.uk and today I have got these to review.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.400
They are these, the Sennheiser RS 160 Wireless Headphones. So we will jump right into this and we will see you on the other side!

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.710
Setting up the Sennheiser RS 160 Wireless Headphones is more or less straight forward. Simply unbox

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.399
the product, locate the two rechargeable AAA batteries, unlock the two ear pads and insert

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.969
the batteries into either side. To charge the headphones simply plug in the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.649
5V DC adapter into the slot on the side, and orange light will appear to indicate charging

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.629
has commenced. The middle raised button is your power button, simple press to turn on

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.139
the headphones. The buttons either side are for your volume, how ever using the TV's volume

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:55.399
works best I have found. To connect the transmitter simply plug in

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.399
the 5V DC power adapter, the 3.5mm jack, which goes into your headphone jack on your TV.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.100
Select the volume to the middle, I found this works best. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.270
The transmitter is portable too, simply overturn it, connect two AA batteries, insert your

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.140
3.5mm jack to the transmitter, then the other end to your media device, ie, your phone.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.820
Then listen to your music on the go. I recently purchased the Sennheiser RS 160

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.369
Wireless headphones over a month ago. Previously I had wired headphones with a max range of

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.829
10m wired, which worked fine but was a nightmare at times especially walking around with a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.670
lead trailing behind you so I decided to go
for Wireless, less leads, less hassle!

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.670
I picked the Sennheiser RS 160 up from Argos in the UK for Â£139.99 (about $220). I was

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.549
immediately surprised at the build quality
of the Sennheiser RS 160 wireless headphones.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.049
Even though they have that 'plastic' feel
about them, they are very durable and rugged.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.439
They are not lose or moving parts when you are putting them onto your head to listen

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.299
to your audio. You get the simple flex of
the headband and that's it!

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.880
The two ear pads are very comfortable to wear over your head, with or without glasses. You

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.220
can easily sit through a whole film with them on and not notice or realise they are actually

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.410
on your head. However, I do advise you take them off every hour or so and take a break

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.750
to let the ear pads buff back out again to
their nature state, thus giving the comfort

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.050
back again. Charging time for the Sennheiser RS 160 wireless

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.110
headphones is roughly 16 hours, a long time I know but considering you get 24 hours play

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.380
back it's not bad. I charged them fully when I first purchased these over a month again,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.810
and although I only use them at night when
everyone is in bed, I haven't had to charge

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.000
them again, yet! So hat of to Sennheiser for
that one!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.250
The Sennheiser RS 160 have a frequency range of 20m (inline of sight) I have of course

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.950
tested this out and this is true. It may not
seem a lot of distance compared to other wireless

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.930
headphones but be honest, who's going to be more than 20m away from their transmitter!

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.430
The frequency response of the Sennheiser RS 160 is between 18 - 2100 HZ, with a sound

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.430
pressure level coming in at 106 dB. Weighing in at only 226g (without batteries) the Sennheiser

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.040
RS 160 are weight light yet durable for any
activity, be it watching TV or at the gym!

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.640
The carrier frequencies come in between 2.4 - 2.48 Ghz, to cut out interference from other

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.510
products, thus these being digital audio,
it's crystal clear

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.590
You will however when there is no sound being produced through the headphones find a hissing

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.120
noise coming through, this is completely natural when their is no audio, once audio is played

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.460
through the headphones this hissing disappears making way for crystal clear HD sounds.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.910
So that is my review on these little bad boys the Sennheiser RS 160 Wireless Headphones

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.540
cracking wee wireless headphones. If you're going to buy any I would recommend buying these.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.040
They are very durable and not much is going to go wrong with them. I hope to have them for years to come. Overall I would rate them at 9.8/10

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:09.500
There is very little that would let them down. Probably the only thing that would let them down for me is the charge time. Sure, there is always one down side!

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.200
Until the next time, thanks for watching!
