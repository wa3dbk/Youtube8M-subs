00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:03.629
Week 1: Getting started with the iPad

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.629
2.

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:05.629
The multitasking bar

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:06.629
Let's take a look at another important function
of the Home button.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.250
Press it twice in quick succession to reveal
the iPad's multitasking bar.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.260
This multitasking bar is an important way
to get around more quickly on your iPad.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.679
Get into the habit of using it and you'll
find your iPad easier to control.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.269
Using this bar, you can switch to a different
app while the current one remains in memory

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.269
in the background, meaning that it doesn't
quit, but rather enters a kind of suspended

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.269
animation.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.870
We'll see how that works.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.780
So I select the Notes app.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.540
We move to that.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.880
Double-tap on the Home button.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.940
Let's move to the iPad app.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.470
It switches over.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.100
Go back to the Home screen, double-tap, and
there is our multitasking bar.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:02.730
One other nice thing that you can do from
here is as we tap and hold on an app, all

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.270
the apps start wiggling and you see that little
red button with the Minus sign in it.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.649
That means that you can quit apps from here
simply by tapping on the Minus sign.

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.259
So we'll quit the Calendar app by tapping
on that button.

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:28.259
To return the icons to their normal behavior,
just click on the Home button.

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:42.899
Multitasking controls
If you swipe this bar from left to right,

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.859
you'll eventually see a set of controls.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:58.389
The appearance of the first button depends
on how you've configured the side switch options

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.789
in the general setting screens.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:13.550
How do you configure the side switch?

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:32.300
Go 
to Settings, General, Use side switch to:

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:40.000
choose either Lock Rotation or mute.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:03:08.040
If you've configured the side switch so that
the iPad mutes when you push the side switch

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.560
down, you'll see a rotation lock icon.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.110
When this lock is engaged, the orientation
of the iPad's screen won't change, regardless

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.880
of how you rotate the iPad.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.050
So currently, rotation is enabled.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:35.060
I tap that button and now rotation is locked,
just like using the side switch when that

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.330
option is engaged.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:52.600
If you've configured the side switch to lock
rotation, the button which you use for muting

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.580
and unmuting your iPad will look like a speaker.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:12.660
And you can see that we have it unmuted.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:28.290
Tap the button and now the sound is muted.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.570
After this button you'll see a slider for
adjusting the screen's brightness.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:40.210
To increase the brightest, just slide the
button to the right, and to decrease brightness,

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.960
slide it to the left.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:55.220
Here you'll also find buttons for controlling
the iPad app's playback, and possibly a 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:16.650
button for choosing wireless devices to 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:28.130
play 
the iPad's audio using a technology called

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:38.919
AirPlay, which we'll discuss elsewhere in
the course.

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:45.840
And finally, there is a slider for adjusting
the iPad's volume.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.350
