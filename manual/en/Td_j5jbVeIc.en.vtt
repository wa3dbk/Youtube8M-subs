00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.370
0:00:14.319, 0:00:18.919
At the age of just seven Justin Cook knew

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.070
he wanted to run his own business

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.070
0:00:18.919, 0:00:21.750
He also knew he wanted to call it Fortune

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.070
Cookie

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.570
0:00:21.750, 0:00:26.269
What he couldn't have known was how successful

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.370
that business was going to become

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.390
0:00:26.269, 0:00:31.979
Today a Fortune Cookie is one of the most

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.910
successful digital media agencies in the UK

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.120
0:00:31.979, 0:00:34.780
Brand spanking new offices in central London

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.309
0:00:34.780, 0:00:38.000
turn over that’s more than doubled in the

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.320
last two years

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.059
0:00:38.000, 0:00:41.460
and up to twenty counts on the go at

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.059
any one time

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.260
0:00:41.460, 0:00:44.400
Among the major blue chip companies

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.170
0:00:44.400, 0:00:49.100
Justin also knew from an early age it was

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.100
the
Digital media world particularly web design

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.100
0:00:49.100, 0:00:50.340
and e marketing

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.470
0:00:50.340, 0:00:52.450
he wanted to be involved in

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.969
0:00:52.450, 0:00:53.690
Perhaps naively

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.190
0:00:53.690, 0:00:55.880
it felt like a whole new world basically

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.200
0:00:55.880, 0:00:59.509
and I felt like a bit of a pioneer and

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.109
wanted to get involved really on

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.229
0:00:59.509, 0:01:03.119
to try and realize the opportunity.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.130
I got some advice to my father and he

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.130
0:01:03.119, 0:01:03.939
said it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.960
0:01:03.939, 0:01:06.560
nothing in your lifetime is going to happen

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.850
0:01:06.560, 0:01:09.600
that will have a bigger impact on

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.180
0:01:09.600, 0:01:13.860
human beings in our lives and on the web.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.710
0:01:13.860, 0:01:15.219
And get involved basically

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.680
0:01:15.219, 0:01:18.140
The foundation, on which the company

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.680
has been able to grow

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.360
0:01:18.140, 0:01:22.390
is in the building all strategic relationships

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.360
with clients

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.320
0:01:22.390, 0:01:25.750
relationships fortune cookie views more as

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320
partnerships.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.660
0:01:25.750, 0:01:30.490
This allows fortune cookies to see itself

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.820
as parts of a client’s organization

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.930
0:01:30.490, 0:01:33.470
and it means they could all work together

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.930
for a long term

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.800
0:01:33.470, 0:01:36.860
Not simply for the duration of one web build

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.350
0:01:36.860, 0:01:41.979
The great benefit of working with a client

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.940
over
a longer time period is that we can challenge

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.940
them

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.940
0:01:41.979, 0:01:45.740
you can challenge them and push

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.000
them into areas where

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.150
0:01:45.740, 0:01:47.940
they didn’t necessarily see themselves.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.830
0:01:47.940, 0:01:54.020
You can prove to them through great

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.320
experience architecture development
through user testing processes

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.781
0:01:54.020, 0:01:58.030
Potentially through 3b testing on a live

00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:57.781
environment

00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.900
0:01:58.030, 0:02:00.680
That this is a new cutting edge solution

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.490
0:02:00.680, 0:02:03.229
but one that will also work

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.430
0:02:03.229, 0:02:08.409
but to make these partnerships work Fortune

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.650
Cookie
has to understand clients requirements

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.300
0:02:08.409, 0:02:12.629
Every day of the week you'll find clients

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.850
like national enquires

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.030
0:02:12.629, 0:02:14.709
visiting Fortune Cookies offices

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.420
0:02:14.709, 0:02:16.349
or vice versa.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.330
0:02:16.349, 0:02:19.360
They want to get under the skin of their clients

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.230
0:02:19.360, 0:02:20.859
understand what makes them tick

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.980
0:02:20.859, 0:02:23.999
Literally spend time on the shop floor

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.890
0:02:23.999, 0:02:27.769
We go to the client's offices themselves

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.520
and talk to all the different kindof Stake
holders

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.710
0:02:27.769, 0:02:31.840
that are involved in the organization.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.540
0:02:31.840, 0:02:33.019
Finance/Marketing/PR/HR

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.430
0:02:33.019, 0:02:36.619
and we basically ask them

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.140
all individually what they want.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.010
0:02:36.619, 0:02:40.819
We’ll do capacity benchmarking and analysis

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.810
and I will look at what their competitors
are doing

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.730
0:02:40.819, 0:02:43.989
go outside of their own traditional

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.730
competitive set

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.280
0:02:43.989, 0:02:48.109
and look at other organizations.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.280
People we can learn

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.280
0:02:48.109, 0:02:49.379
from basically

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.650
0:02:49.379, 0:02:53.219
Everyone’s doing things well

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.130
But not everyone’s doing everything well.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.070
0:02:53.219, 0:02:56.989
But at the end of the day it's not the clients

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.070
that use the sites

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.660
0:02:56.989, 0:03:01.700
Fortune Cookie realizes the importance of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.630
road testing sites with end users

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.740
0:03:01.700, 0:03:06.009
So it builds representations of the clients

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.770
target audiences

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.760
0:03:06.009, 0:03:08.250
then it hires agencies to recruit those people

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.680
0:03:08.250, 0:03:10.749
and invites them into its offices

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.700
0:03:10.749, 0:03:14.530
here is a potential end user of a site

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.070
has been invited into the office

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.870
0:03:14.530, 0:03:18.419
to use Fortune Cookies eye tracking system

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.240
0:03:18.419, 0:03:21.030
It allows the clients sitting in the next

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240
room

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.670
0:03:21.030, 0:03:23.390
in this case diabetes UK

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.401
0:03:23.390, 0:03:25.829
to see exactly where on their site

00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:28.080
0:03:25.829, 0:03:29.149
the end users eyes are drawn

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.580
0:03:29.149, 0:03:34.559
we don't talk to end users

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.740
then you can design a site very well

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.660
0:03:34.559, 0:03:37.229
based on your own opinions or the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.040
opinions of you clients

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.830
0:03:37.229, 0:03:41.560
But were not the end users always

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.010
And the customers our customers are not the
end users

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.180
0:03:41.560, 0:03:46.820
By talking to a range of the end users, the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.430
end sight users
Customers we can make sure with got the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.709
0:03:46.820, 0:03:50.429
process that’s right for them as appose

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.709
right for us

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.080
0:03:50.429, 0:03:56.049
It makes it scientific; it means were not

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.610
designing on a whim
To reach this level of success

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.380
0:03:56.049, 0:03:58.559
Fortune Cookie Has had to survive difficult

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.380
times

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.319
0:03:58.559, 0:04:03.089
Not least the .com crash of the late nineties

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.990
Many digital agencies went to

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.041
0:04:03.089, 0:04:03.920
the wall

00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:05.041
0:04:03.920, 0:04:05.189
but for Fortune Cookie

00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:06.880
0:04:05.189, 0:04:08.259
the crash turned out to be a blessing in

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880
Disguise

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.739
0:04:08.259, 0:04:12.049
it batten down the hatches and made cutbacks

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.920
0:04:12.049, 0:04:15.109
decisively it stopped being a jack of all

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.920
trades

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.090
0:04:15.109, 0:04:18.879
and instead specialized in just a few sectors

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.910
0:04:18.879, 0:04:20.899
travel Tourism and leisure

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.620
0:04:20.899, 0:04:22.030
financial services

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.620
0:04:22.030, 0:04:23.629
and the media

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.750
0:04:23.629, 0:04:27.910
The advantages of sticking with those three

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.380
or four
Key areas

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.800
0:04:23.629, 0:04:27.910
is that we know them really well there’s

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.310
A real depth of knowledge in the studio here

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.820
0:04:33.139, 0:04:37.560
Were being fed all the time from our clients

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.340
and were also feeding back to our clients

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.930
0:04:37.560, 0:04:38.990
were they can’t go to the sorts

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.699
0:04:38.990, 0:04:41.960
of conferences’

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.540
and read the types of papers we do

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.520
0:04:41.960, 0:04:44.590
It’s a constant knowledge exchange with

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520
those clients

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.199
0:04:44.590, 0:04:49.489
I don't think we can do that to the right

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.970
depth
If we had clients in all different sectors

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.930
0:04:49.489, 0:04:53.539
The digital media business is evolving Faster

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.930
than most

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.770
0:04:53.539, 0:04:57.649
the manner in which people access information

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.930
on the web is evolving

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.669
0:04:57.649, 0:05:01.939
and web sites themselves of becoming ever

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:00.860
more sophisticated

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.880
0:05:01.939, 0:05:05.809
Fortune Cookies has had to adapt to keep pace

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.880
with these changes

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.450
0:05:05.809, 0:05:10.330
we write accessible in everything we do and

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.480
when I say accessibility I don’t just

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.480
0:05:10.330, 0:05:10.950
mean

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.480
0:05:10.950, 0:05:14.710
I'm making web sites that could be used by

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.110
people with disabilities I mean a web

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.280
0:05:14.710, 0:05:17.139
that can be accessed by anyone

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.639
0:05:17.139, 0:05:18.629
on anything

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.740
0:05:18.629, 0:05:22.000
so a web without boundaries, a web without

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.740
borders

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.460
0:05:22.000, 0:05:25.860

by someone is brazil on a 5.6k modem

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.800
0:05:31.469, 0:05:37.030
Two or three years ago we were delivering

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.830
websites
to our clients.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.340
0:05:37.030, 0:05:38.280
We were designing web pages and web

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.690
page templates for people to make sites from

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.340
0:05:38.280, 0:05:40.280
Now we’re delivering experiences and a web

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.340
page might

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.460
0:05:40.280, 0:05:44.580
Be a tool in that but then so might a piece

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.840
of video
So might a rich interact interface,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.060
0:05:44.580, 0:05:48.389
so might an email

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.720
0:05:48.389, 0:05:53.479
Were less focused on the page now and a lot

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.040
more
Focused on getting the overall experience

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.260
0:05:53.479, 0:05:57.619
which means everyone’s expertise has to

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.280
come into play
a lot more

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.331
0:05:59.860, 0:06:04.349
What strikes you about Fortune Cookie

00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:02.419
0:05:59.860, 0:06:04.349
is here is business that survived the .com

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:03.740
crash
of the nineties

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.419
0:06:04.349, 0:06:07.179
and emerged a strong agency

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.960
0:06:07.179, 0:06:12.979
It forsakes quantity for quality looking

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.540
not for short-term profit

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.210
0:06:12.979, 0:06:13.860
but long term gain

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.180
0:06:13.860, 0:06:19.189
and that's the reason why Fortune Cookie appears

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.169
to be one of the digital agencies

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:19.310
0:06:19.189, 0:06:19.439
of the future
