00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.550
Now that we have our stocking all laid out
I am going to put a couple of heavy books

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.540
on it for a little while, while I move onto
something else. We need to make the little

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.250
loop that will hang up our stocking so what
you need to do is pick out one of the fabrics

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.109
that you have left over and we are going to
cut about a 2 inch strip, be 2 inches wide,

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.310
4 or 5 inches long, let’s make it 5 inches
long and we just going to cut that out real

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:40.219
quick. Then we are going to grab our iron
and what we are going to do is just fold it

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:48.460
inside as you can see what I am doing right
here. I’ll iron that down and once you’ve

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.559
done that, you are going to take it and fold
it again because what we are going to do when

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:03.320
you are done ironing it, is that we are going
to sew it close so that there are no little

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.900
seams or no little edges and we are just going
to sew all the way down. You want to sew as

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.479
close to the edge as you can there. Just tie
a little knot on the end before you start

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:28.020
and then weave your way down all the way down
to the length of your little loop. Make sure

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.149
the stitches are kind of close together. We
don’t want them to pull off easily or anything.

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.700
Once you make your way all the way down to
the end, you just want to tie it off. Give

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:53.990
it a couple of good little ties there
and this will become the loop that will later

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.579
hang, our little stocking.
