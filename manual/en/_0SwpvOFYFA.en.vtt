00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.799
You know you guys there's there's only two things in the world right now that make me feel really really good....

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.390
one....

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.390
oxycodone because

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.230
getting your wisdom teeth out sucks, and I'm on top of the world and....

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.209
two - a 3 to 1 win over the other the Atlanta Thrashers!! Look oh, that was so sick. It was so sick you guys.  I

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.379
could talk about the finer points of the game. I could talk about

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.909
Mats Sundin maybe get in his last goal as a Leaf - that would be pretty good.  Can maybe talk about Kari Lehtonen taking a little

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.279
dive-ski, or I could just

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.939
cut to the chase and talk about what you want to talk about which is the Sundin trade thing.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.660
Still kinda full..... Oh, well um...

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.369
Okay, let's cut to the chase no one cares about the finer points of the game at this point.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.680
Everyone's written the Leafs off, even, I mean, it's......they're not mathematically out,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.069
but who cares let's just get to it. Mats Sundin's no-trade clause.  We're not going to talk about Kaberle, Tucker, McCabe......

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070
Give me a..... I don't care. I don't care.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.570
Sundin and that is all.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.439
I do not envy mats Sundin right now at all - I do not

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.470
He's a millionaire. He holds all the cards in this trade situation

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.109
I know, but he's damned if he leaves Toronto because then he's the captain who left Toronto and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.930
God forbid he should win a cup. It's like. Oh, he couldn't win a Cup here. He didn't put his heart into it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.930
here, he tried better somewhere else....

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.909
If he doesn't go...... ah what a selfish bastard,

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.699
I can't believe he wouldn't leave for the better of the team - rah rah rah - and all that crap.  Listen.....

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.959
He signed a contract, he signed and negotiated a contract with his agent.....

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.530
to get a no-trade clause, that's what he wanted.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.449
He didn't want to leave Toronto or doesn't want to leave Toronto for whatever reason.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.009
Now let's just say - for a moment - Mats Sundin were to go "You know what guys, I'm gonna,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.140
I'm gonna bite the bullet right now and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.840
wave my no trade clause and go to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.019
Insert team here, Anaheim, Detroit. I don't care.....

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.349
he doesn't want to play for them.

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.738
Do you - okay - people are talking about how....

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.589
ohhh you're gonna get offered top dollar for Sundin..... who the hell??  What what GM other

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.090
than maybe Mike Milbury wants a guy to play for him,

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.439
that doesn't want to be there, or doesn't care about winning with that team?

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.899
Sundin's heart is in Toronto....

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.078
and although I would love to...hey....I would love to see those picks come to Toronto, but Sundin

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.018
is concentrating on this.....

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.899
and still in his heart, God bless the guy, he thinks there

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.470
He could he could win a cup in Toronto some day.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.850
And everyone's acting like he's going to retire after this year. I don't think he's going to retire, he hasn't ruled it out......

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.579
but come on.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.600
I don't know.  And that's all I really ask you guys to take into account, heading into this trade deadline.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.530
So ummmmmmm.......

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.949
until next time I guess guys..... HA HA!!

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.470
I got dared by a subscriber to do that. Anyway, be nice to Mats. okay?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.960
Okay..........okay.
