00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:09.000
In this video I’ll show how to display the six frame translations of an mRNA using Genome Workbench from NCBI.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I’ll start with Genome Workbench already open to the search view.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You can get Genome Workbench at the URL at the bottom of the screen.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.700
I’m going to search the NCBI public databases for the following accession: 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.966
N M _ 0 0 1 1 8 2 . 4 

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:36.566
Once the search has returned, I’m going to add this data to my project.

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:43.133
Then, I’m going to open a graphical view.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:49.133
Now, I’m going to turn on the six-frame translations from the content menu in the graphical view.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:53.133
Then, before searching for the open reading frames to show the six frame translations, 

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:56.866
I’m going to close the project tree view, the task view window

00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:05.666
 and reconfigure my windows so I can see search results side by side with my graphical view.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:10.466
Then in the search view, I’m going to select Open Reading Frame Search from the search tool menu.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.866
There are a number of settings we can tune here,

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:19.266
I’m going to click the filter icon and uncheck the “show only longest ORFs”

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:29.666
checkbox if it’s checked and click ok.

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:33.100
Now I have a list of all the reading frames in this mRNA.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.200
These views of the data are linked and to show that,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:45.400
if I click on one of the rows in the list, the graphical view changes to show the reading frame.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.400
If I look at the six-frame translations track I see green and red marks.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.600
The green marks are start codons and the red marks are stop codons.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.900
If I choose this reading frame

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:12.933
and zoom in we see that the start codon lines up right at the start of the protein product.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:15.933
If I scroll to the left, I see another start codon.

00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:20.266
The decision for this annotation is based on an established body of research about this gene

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:26.233
that asserts the use of this downstream ATG site.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:29.333
If I zoom out, scroll to the right and zoom back in,

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:47.333
we see the stop codon right at the end of the protein where we expect it to be.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:52.733
This is just one example looking at the six frame translations and the connections between the views in Genome Workbench.

00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:57.633
There’s a lot more you can do with these tools, please visit the NCBI website to learn and do more.

00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:58.333
Thanks!
