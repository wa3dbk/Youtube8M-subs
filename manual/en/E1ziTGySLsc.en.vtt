Dear Friends –
It’s hard to believe that it’s been over

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.200
six months since my family and I arrived here
in New Delhi, but it has, and what a six months

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.840
it’s been.
I wanted to give you this brief status report

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.810
on where things stand and what we’ve been
working on. I’ve had the good fortune of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.390
traveling throughout India – 18 trips, 22
cities, and one can feel the sense of excitement

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.890
surrounding the US-India relationship.
As most of you know, January was an epic month

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.440
for us in many ways – we welcomed Secretary
Kerry for Vibrant Gujrat, an incredible event

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.050
that brought together business, civil society
and political leaders from across the globe.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.280
And, then just two weeks later, we were thrilled
and honored to welcome President Obama, as

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.800
the Chief Guest for Republic Day. From the
arrival at the airport, to the cup of tea

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.740
with the Prime Minister, to the parade and
state dinner, and the speech at Siri Fort

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.560
– every moment was so very special. The
visit helped us make great progress in so

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.229
many areas such as in civil nuclear cooperation,
trade, and defense. We signed our first ever

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.920
Joint Vision Statement for the Asia Pacific,
issued a Declaration of Friendship, and announced

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.979
plans to co-develop and produce defense items
– further solidifying our countries as best

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.869
partners.
Coming out of the President’s January visit

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.929
we have some 30 dialogues and 80 separate
initiatives. We are working together – from

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:55.090
the heights of space to the depths of the
oceans and beyond. But the real promise of

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.830
our relationship, as the Prime Minister recently
said, is not simply what we can do for each

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.640
other – it’s what we can do for peace
and prosperity in the world.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.150
That’s also why we call the relationship
– “Strategic Plus” with the “plus”

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.180
meaning we now work together in more areas
of the world, and on more subjects than ever

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.159
before.
Beyond the government to government initiatives,

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:27.310
I’ve also had the good fortune to meet so
many people across India. In Hyderabad, I

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.060
was privileged to attend the school graduation
for at-risk kids who had been rescued from

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.650
the street and were learning English and other
enrichment skills. In Bangalore, at Aero India,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.060
it was inspiring to see our military and the
Indian military jump teams operate together,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.650
and I was thrilled to meet the dozens of US
defense companies collaborating with Indian

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.290
partners. In Gujarat and in Pune, I saw the
openings of impressive new US factories, which

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.870
will help gain a greater share of business
in Asian markets and create jobs in the US

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:09.120
and India. In Mysore, I met with migrant workers
and saw the impact of a US funded solar battery

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.209
pack, and how it could improve both livelihoods
and safety. And, off the coast of Kerala,

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.299
I got a glimpse into the future of US and
Indian Naval cooperation, when I spent an

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.140
afternoon with the brave men and women of
the USS Carl Vinson, with 10 Indian naval

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.030
aviators, learning and discussing carrier
cooperation. Our aircraft carrier working

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.359
group, and the new 10 year defense framework
signed by Secretary Carter, will help take

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:44.170
our cooperation even further in the years
ahead.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.120
One of the most memorable experiences was
traveling back to Punjab, where my parents

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.459
are from and see the house where my grandmother
and mother lived, and also go to the college

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.920
from where my father graduated. It was a proud
and special moment, and clear reminder of

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.459
our deep people to people ties that have existed
and flourished for decades. Back in New Delhi,

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.249
and as our governments recognize the 10 year
anniversary of the landmark civil-nuclear

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:18.799
deal, our bilateral relationship has soared.
While we won’t always agree on every issue,

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.230
we do have robust dialogues and very close
relationships across the political spectrum,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.009
and we are grateful for that close collaboration.
We are also committed to supporting India’s

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:36.919
global leadership role in strategic matters,
in international institutions and economically.

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.460
I also have to take a moment to recognize
the amazing team of public servants, both

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.639
American and Indian, who work at the US Mission
and four consulates in Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.949
and Hyderabad. They are the best of the best
and we could not make the gains in this relationship

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.819
without their tireless efforts.
There’s no question the next six months

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.310
will be just as action packed , especially
as we set out to expand our work in health,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.370
transportation and agriculture, and do even
more in our military, commercial and clean

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.330
energy partnerships. And in these first six
months, I’ve come to one simple conclusion

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.389
– we are stronger – the United States
and India -- when we work together. That much

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:29.150
has become crystal clear.
Come visit us, and follow us on social media.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.889
I’m excited about our path forward and achieving
the “best partnership” that the President

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.729
called for. Thank you very much.
