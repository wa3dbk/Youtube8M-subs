00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.250
okay so well this is our

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.459
hot salt

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.829
and uh... it's going to fit in

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:17.210
talese axle flan fasteners and put on a
new axle flange gasket here

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.400
used by those who

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.269
moved by your steals the they're nice
kids

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.019
lucille really well

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.810
they're easy to take off and put on you
put silicone on their doesn't stick

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.060
and also it makes a big

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.510
no mass for the next night it coming

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.390
and clean all this stuff operate

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.450
see how that somebody put silicone on
that

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.390
even if you need anything

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.040
might stay away from that go with the
purpose made

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.210
gasket you know when you put these axles
and

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.840
this axle here status flying down into
your side here

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.300
so when you put it in

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.890
it's going to be laying in all like this
in the hall the side years rate the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.820
medals so it is a little technique

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.540
that's gonna help you from

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.580
damaging your fingers

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.500
so you feel like a man

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.860
and what you wanted to is you wanna

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.730
you want to grab the axle when you gonna

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.300
leverage absolutely and goes into the
hole

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.780
in that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.830
in their site here

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.340
and see how our fingers are nimble hien
the flange here

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.400
great there when it went in

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.140
that would accomplish finger-pointing
start before hand here

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.220
wow what a benevolent point that's not a
good day

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.820
at the office

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.160
we want to avoid that again see my hands
are kim behind here but they're on the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.799
outside of this

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.630
and we're just now simply put

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.810
allowing that to line up at the holst

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.360
once it does it goes pretty quick so you
don't want to have your fingers in

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.570
behind there

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.410
new camelot on some nearness not in a
state and now what we're going to do

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.229
savannah put the axle flange nuts on

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.890
now we're going to tor come to the
specification

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.890
but the manufacture of lines

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.760
them and uh...

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.839
mandate just up the break

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.289
and uh...

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.189
were going to uh...

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.839
jected differential

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:16.009
and that's

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.250
and make sure all the orioles off

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.849
the insider up

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.680
an off the back of the realities

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.450
pat of vehicle that's come in for a
wheel cylinder

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.419
are premier we'll see you all

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:29.239
that the oil

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.019
traces on the back side of this

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.609
it looks like it's still leaking

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:36.569
so

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.379
you don't wanna have the guy while to
the scales in america

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.889
casey welders oil on the back side here
we all

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:45.680
on

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.819
it so we'll see all weekend

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.389
you know it's only because he hadn't
cleaned the oil out the back it's a

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.749
perfectly good we'll see you in there

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:59.029
so part of that job is to make sure the
rian the tire and the back side of the

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:04.649
tired or all three of oil so that it
indicates uh... to anybody inspecting it

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.219
but it's not a leaking we'll see y'all

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:14.219
because they'll definitely pull you over
for that

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.799
we may want to put the wheel back down
the final parties which i'm gonna do as

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.189
except in the air

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.669
so we'll come back to this don't forget
to talk goes on

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.119
if you've had the wheel off

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:34.139
here at the wheel studs

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.919
very critical that you torque those
wheel nuts with the torque wrench

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.339
munich criss cross pattern so get the
months not

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:46.829
bring 'em up to your first work usually
about half way of the final four

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.869
category your file targeted criss-cross
pattern

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.349
make sure that these handles for the
valve stems

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.549
are offset one another

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.569
because if you don't get them lined up
right these two dual wheels

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.639
the driver may not be able to access

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.869
the valve stem

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.719
if the ab paid attention to orientation

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.559
or you get the bolt on the same side
many

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:12.829
gathered victims of the time filling up
with their

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.759
whatever you do when you're felonies
vehicles on the service you make sure

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.519
you feel the insight tires walls the
outside okay because

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.930
uh... very critical that you have equal
tire pressure both israel's we're going

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.970
to go ahead and work in a just up the
break saloon

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.910
zoom over there and elsewhere

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.870
airmen doubt will drop the we are
