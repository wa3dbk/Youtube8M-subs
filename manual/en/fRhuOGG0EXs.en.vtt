00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.700
In my video where I built these rain roofs

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.740
I got a couple questions asking why put on this roof

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.880
And here's why

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.720
This is actually a pretty heavy rain storm, we don't usually get them this heavy

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.220
but it rains for most of our winter

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.180
And now I can see how this roof is performing

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.760
and I'm a little bit disappointed with it, it doesn't cover as well as I would like

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.280
I mentioned in the video that I wished it was a little bit wider so that it would extend out

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.020
past the front of the hives more

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.180
and the back of the hives

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.080
It just barely seems to cover them front to back

00:01:09.132 --> 00:01:13.452
I might try modifying some of them and make them a little bit wider

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.680
I just have to add more roof pieces to it

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.420
You usually don't get to see this on my videos because I generally don't shoot video on rainy days

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:03.495
My 10-frame hives have a lid that probably does okay in the rain

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.060
It extends out on the sides and has a metal top, so it's probably pretty rain-proof

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.480
But my little 5-frame nucs like these ones, they just have what's called a migratory top

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.077
where it's just a wood top and no metal flashing, no metal cover, and it doesn't extend out on the sides

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.480
So I don't think that these would do too well in the rain, at least not the type of rain that we get in our winters

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.500
So installing this rain roof over these nucs was my main objective

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.760
and I decided to just put it on all of the hives
