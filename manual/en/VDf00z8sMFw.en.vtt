00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.996
You may not realize it,

00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:10.081
but from the moment you got out of bed today

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:12.697
to the point where you sat down to watch this video,

00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:14.419
you've essentially been swimming.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.172
Why? Because air is a fluid just like water.

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:19.966
It has waves and eddies.

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.050
It flows.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.552
And when you push air out of the way,

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:24.803
it rushes around you into a wake.

00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:27.391
So why don't we notice it most of the time?

00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:30.642
We commonly think of air as empty space.

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:33.812
But while one cubic centimeter of interstellar space,

00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:36.065
the volume in the tip of your pinky finger,

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.032
contains roughly one atom,

00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:43.197
the same volume of air has about 10 quintillion molecules.

00:00:43.197 --> 00:00:44.946
If that sounds hard to wrap your head around,

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:46.697
it happens to be about the same

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:49.198
as the number of insects alive on the planet,

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:51.946
all crawling, climbing, and flying over each other

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:55.570
in an enormous, tightly packed swarm.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.838
When this swarm of molecules runs into things,

00:00:57.838 --> 00:01:01.381
it exerts a force, pressing against the boundaries of the fluid,

00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:04.676
like water pressing against the glass of a bottle.

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:06.512
This is known as air pressure.

00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:08.226
And while air is lighter than water,

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:10.557
all those molecules still get pretty heavy,

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:12.975
with the total air filling a typical school gym,

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:15.771
weighing about as much as an adult elephant.

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:17.727
So when you walk into a gym,

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:19.394
how come you're not immediately crushed

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:21.360
by the elephant of air in the room?

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.983
Well, first of all,

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.644
because most of it is pressing on the floor and the walls,

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:27.478
and the part that is pressing on you

00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:30.978
is pushed back by the pressure inside you!

00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:34.084
You see, the air, as well as the water and everything else,

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:36.999
that fills our bodies exerts an amount of pressure

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.835
equal to that of the air outside.

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:40.838
Of course, this is no accident.

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:43.173
It's precisely what allows us to survive

00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:44.882
in the normal atmosphere,

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.395
and what makes it more difficult

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:48.345
at high altitudes or deep water.

00:01:48.345 --> 00:01:50.846
And we normally don't feel the air pressing on us

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.648
because it's generally uniform.

00:01:52.648 --> 00:01:54.768
So even though different amounts of air molecules

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:56.560
are hitting you at different times,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.227
the swarm is so thick

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:01.107
that all those little differences average out.

00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:03.777
What happens when air pressure isn't uniform?

00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:06.279
This means that the molecules are pushing harder

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:08.060
in one region of air than another,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.476
driving the air flow from the higher pressure region

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:12.144
to the lower.

00:02:12.144 --> 00:02:14.161
We feel this flow directly as wind,

00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:15.790
and the pressure systems

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.499
that meteorologists are always going on about

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.960
are responsible for other weather changes,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.922
from the mundane to the catastrophic.

00:02:22.922 --> 00:02:24.590
But differences in air pressure

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.001
do more than just let us complain about the weather;

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.428
they're the very reason we're alive.

00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:32.061
We breathe by lowering the pressure in our lungs,

00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:33.933
allowing air to rush in.

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:35.767
So the next time you take a deep breath,

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:38.522
think of the unfathomable number of air molecules

00:02:38.522 --> 00:02:40.311
you're commanding to move.

00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:42.310
We look up at the night sky

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.478
to ponder the infinity of space,

00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:46.310
but unless you're watching this video

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.976
from that deep space,

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:49.533
there are more air molecules

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.144
in and around your body

00:02:51.144 --> 00:02:54.077
than there are grains of sand in all the world's beaches and deserts,

00:02:54.077 --> 00:02:56.454
stars in the visible universe,

00:02:56.454 --> 00:02:58.747
or both of those numbers combined.

00:02:58.747 --> 00:03:00.394
The vastness of the universe

00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:01.894
is right in front of you

00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:04.004
and inside you.
