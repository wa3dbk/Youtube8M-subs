00:00:00.711 --> 00:00:03.294
(upbeat music)

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:19.327
- We traveled over 5,000 miles from home

00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:22.718
to take you on a trip to Tuscany.

00:00:22.718 --> 00:00:25.071
Sun kissed vineyards, cypress trees,

00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:27.934
medieval towns, just
some of the intoxicating

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:30.140
sights you'll see in Tuscany.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.703
Where the middle ages are
alive in the modern day.

00:00:33.703 --> 00:00:36.787
Situated between the cities
of Sienna and Florence

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:40.258
sit nine municipalities
that make up the coveted

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:42.535
Chianti Classico Wine Region.

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:45.963
But, behind the rolling
hills are real people

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:50.060
who dedicate their lives to
bringing these wines to life.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.826
Tune in today as we give you a

00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:54.317
taste of the toast of Tuscany.

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:56.238
- [Local] Tuscany is one
of the most beautiful

00:00:56.238 --> 00:00:58.166
places and has the best reputation.

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.796
- [Monique] If anyone knows
the land's bountiful beauty,

00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:02.962
it's Conte Sebastiano Capponi.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.608
His family first bought this
Grave and Chianti Estate Winery

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:11.521
in 1524, even after 20
generations, the past is present

00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.688
and comes back to life on
the back of every bottle.

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:20.053
- It's known as the most soul and senator

00:01:20.053 --> 00:01:22.681
and for 20 years, they have
to find a sort of brand

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.428
for Tuscany cousin Will the third.

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:28.217
(Italian language)

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:29.920
- [Monique] But, their ancient history

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.565
doesn't keep them from forward thinking.

00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:34.818
- For the production
parts, I have two very good

00:01:34.818 --> 00:01:36.882
cell masters, one woman
and one man because

00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:39.141
it is very important to have both palettes

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:41.823
because women and men
have different palettes.

00:01:41.823 --> 00:01:43.217
- [Monique] How do you think men

00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:45.196
and women's palettes are different?

00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:47.656
- Women are usually
much better descriptors,

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.507
another thing they tend to know,

00:01:49.507 --> 00:01:51.606
at least in my case,
they tend to have more

00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:53.696
of an approach like mother
to babies with wine.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.370
So, they tend to know
the babies very well.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.574
So, when I'm doing a blind tasting and my,

00:01:58.574 --> 00:02:01.241
Sabrina was a woman cell master,

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.802
she will more or less
know what wine is it.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:09.465
Yes, she's very good at that.

00:02:09.465 --> 00:02:11.480
- [Monique] Women have
good attention to detail.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.726
- [Sebastiano] Men have vision,

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:14.231
women take care of nitty gritty details.

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:15.778
That's usually, that is usually the case.

00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:17.120
- [Monique] They're the dreamers.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.953
- I know.

00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:20.047
- [Monique] We make it happen.

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:24.275
Established in 1385, Antinori's
ancient roots run deep.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:28.132
Now, 26 generations later,
the family maintains

00:02:28.132 --> 00:02:32.254
a leader in Italian wines by
practicing three principles.

00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:35.171
Passion, tradition and institution.

00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:40.098
- Antinori is 2,000
acres vineyard in Italy.

00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:44.640
We have a lot of estates
all around the world

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.390
and but at the same
time, we are real family.

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:52.082
I feel the presence of the history

00:02:52.082 --> 00:02:55.334
and I think that we have
to work in the right way

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:59.098
to maintain the history
but at the same time,

00:02:59.098 --> 00:03:02.088
to go ahead with the renovation.

00:03:02.088 --> 00:03:05.910
- [Monique] For the first
time in the family's 625 year

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.001
history, you can now see
the wine making process for

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:13.459
yourself at the family's new
state of the art facility.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.319
Why did you guys decide
to open to the public?

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.475
- [Sara] To share with
other people the knowledge

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:22.745
of how a wine is done because
many people drink wine

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:26.764
but actually know nothing
about how wine is made.

00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:28.280
And here we want to try to teach

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.363
people what's behind a glass of wine.

00:03:32.292 --> 00:03:35.267
- [Monique] What's the reaction
been like when people come?

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:37.853
- They are all, they are like that.

00:03:37.853 --> 00:03:40.216
- [Monique] Elevating your
taste to a higher place

00:03:40.216 --> 00:03:42.930
is easy riding on these
black rooster roads.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.235
- In Tuscany, in Chianti, every

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:48.478
piece of land they have a name.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.762
- [Monique] What was the name
of the place we were just at?

00:03:50.762 --> 00:03:51.988
- [Driver] Solatio.

00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:53.218
- [Monique] And what does that mean?

00:03:53.218 --> 00:03:56.203
- Those can wait to
say exposed to the sun.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:58.485
- Our tour under the Tuscan sun continues

00:03:58.485 --> 00:04:02.576
at Costella D' Albola which
is here in Radda in Chianti

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:06.672
and owned by the largest
wine making family in Italy.

00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:09.361
- The story of this
estate is very, very long.

00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:12.108
Started in the middle ages and started by

00:04:12.108 --> 00:04:15.019
a known big family of Florence.

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.686
Family bought in 1979
from Gnolconte Family.

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:24.282
Quality is the first
thing that a wine maker

00:04:24.282 --> 00:04:27.032
or producer of wine have to make.

00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:32.714
John and Zunina started
this road more than 40

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.217
years ago when they start to
buy property around Italy.

00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:41.839
You can see the middle
ages in the building,

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:44.219
you can see the renaissance in the villa

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:48.565
beyond too has, you can see
that the story or the culture

00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:52.758
of the region of Tuscany
in the Chianti Classico.

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:57.599
The future of wine is not
quantity but quality wines.

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.766
Remember that this wine can
extreme when you drinking

00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:08.109
so I want underline the importance

00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:10.964
of this very, very elegant wine.

00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:13.010
- [Monique] Elegance
seems effortless in the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.282
territory where tranquility
and tradition fill the air

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.675
and where friendships were formed

00:05:18.675 --> 00:05:21.744
between one of America's founding fathers,

00:05:21.744 --> 00:05:23.831
Thomas Jefferson and the family

00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:25.899
that fathered Chianti Classico.

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:27.594
We are here in the beautiful

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:29.360
Chianti Classico region of Italy.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.346
We literally have Sienna
over our shoulder.

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:34.477
- We're at front to Italy which is one

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:36.987
of the oldest properties in old Chianti

00:05:36.987 --> 00:05:40.810
and it belongs to my family since 1435.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.143
I represent generation 24th.

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:46.279
- You don't look a day over 23rd.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.548
(laughter)

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:50.751
And, is it true your
family going back years

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:53.210
and years and years ago
actually fathered Chianti?

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.249
(laughter)

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:55.694
- Yes, we can say that.

00:05:55.694 --> 00:05:59.989
One of my ancestors Cila
Comace in 1398 wrote the

00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:04.934
first official known document
mentioning Chianti wine.

00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:08.447
So, he was the first to associate
the word Chianti to wine

00:06:08.447 --> 00:06:10.053
and this was a few centuries ago.

00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:12.239
- For someone at home
who's never tried a Chianti

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:14.662
Classico wine before,
what would you tell them?

00:06:14.662 --> 00:06:18.902
- I would say the Chianti
Classico is a great wine

00:06:18.902 --> 00:06:21.958
and it's one of the best
wines to pair with food.

00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958
It has this beautiful
freshness, this complexity

00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:30.555
and this nice elegance which can pair

00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:32.785
with a lot of different foods.

00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:34.702
Enjoy food, wine, life.

00:06:35.688 --> 00:06:38.938
I think this is an incredible privilege

00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:42.218
to be in this kind of industry.

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:44.356
This is so unbelievable.

00:06:44.356 --> 00:06:47.618
- A privileged lifestyle
is postcard perfect here

00:06:47.618 --> 00:06:50.047
where the prusuit of life,
liberty and happiness

00:06:50.047 --> 00:06:52.682
is attainable under the Tuscan sunset

00:06:52.682 --> 00:06:55.099
and around any Tuscano table.

00:06:56.861 --> 00:07:01.212
I'll drink to that, how do
we say "cheers" in Italian?

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:04.278
- We say "cheers", "salutia, arrivederci".

00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:05.461
- Arrivederci!

00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:07.222
What does that mean, arrivederci!

00:07:07.222 --> 00:07:08.232
- I'll see you again.

00:07:08.232 --> 00:07:09.484
- I hope so, I will see you again.

00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:11.067
Thank you so much.
