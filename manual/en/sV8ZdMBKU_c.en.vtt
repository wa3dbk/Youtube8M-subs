00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:14.123
A Roadside Mongrel

00:01:11.312 --> 00:01:14.214
Episode 14
The one with Italian hospitality

00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:16.289
God bless!

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:20.497
I welcome you warmly
in the first episode of the "Mongrel"

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:23.555
after the Advent and Christmas break.

00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:27.789
I am in Cervia in Italy, and
as you can see I have very special guest.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.608
That is Dea, literally "goddess",
who spent with me the last two nights.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.939
At the beginning of the year,
I would like to ask you for something.

00:01:39.628 --> 00:01:42.843
I would like that this episode
become some kind of an appeal

00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:49.161
it is the beginning of a year, so maybe
it is worthwhile to find a view for it.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.964
And it just so happens that for me
these first days of the new year

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:57.461
and the last days of the old one, too,
fall into one, very clear view.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.285
And this is what I want
to talk about today.

00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:04.542
The word which, I guess,
will be a perspective for me

00:02:04.787 --> 00:02:08.551
for the forthcoming twelve months,
for this 2013,

00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:12.203
is the word "guests" or "hospitality".

00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:14.720
It is so for at least three reasons.

00:02:15.063 --> 00:02:18.610
Firstly, because we have been celebrating,
for several days

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:22.240
and there are still a few days to come,
the Holidays of Hospitality.

00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:24.682
Because God stayed among us

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:28.107
and it was the most unbelievable visit
we can imagine.

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:31.889
No further could God go
in the intimacy with us.

00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:37.012
Secondly, more tangibly, this Christmas
guests really appeared in my life,

00:02:37.012 --> 00:02:41.630
as we decided that on our Christmas Eve,
in the monastery in Łódź,

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.876
this empty plate usually waiting
for someone, will not be empty this year.

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:49.970
We invited a guest
and that was a really lovely experience.

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:52.998
And thirdly, I'm a guest myself.

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:57.240
I have been invited to an Italian parish

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.804
where a Polish priest, Wojtek,
is the parson

00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:04.200
He's the owner of this wonderful Lady
that is lying next to me.

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:06.680
He is an unusual man,

00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:13.496
but also a man who really values the word
"hospitality" because he is alone.

00:03:14.512 --> 00:03:17.217
For eight years he has been
the parson here in Italy.

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:22.320
He lives alone in the parish, essentially
he lives continually in isolation.

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:27.386
I'm really glad that I can stay there.
We are not doing anything special,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.749
we are not doing any great works,

00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:34.038
we are just sitting, talking,
I'm stroking a dog,

00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:36.901
then we are eating,
than we're sitting again,

00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:39.706
than eating again, and again,
and so on.

00:03:40.537 --> 00:03:46.189
And I am thinking
that God is inviting me this year

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.812
to become a guest for someone.

00:03:49.302 --> 00:03:53.675
To be, as often as posiible, a guest
for people who need to

00:03:53.875 --> 00:04:00.130
be with somebody because they are alone,
who need someone to fill their loneliness.

00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:04.454
I think that is really 
an unusual and breathtaking perspective,

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.317
because, as St. John says,

00:04:06.317 --> 00:04:10.863
you cannot love God you cannot see,
if you do not love the man you can see.

00:04:11.478 --> 00:04:14.037
And for me, that will be the perspective.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.490
It is also something absolutely fantastic,
at least for me,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.065
to observe how Father Wojtek
functions here in Italy.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.720
Although he is alone, he does not close
in his longing for the presence of others,

00:04:29.407 --> 00:04:31.997
but he is going out
with that closeness himself.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.405
I'm observing how he evangelises

00:04:35.405 --> 00:04:39.770
and tries to reach to people
living here with the Gospel.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.276
Almost nobody goes to church here,
so Father Wojtek goes to people himself.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:49.936
Every morning we go to a petrol station
where there is a charming saleswoman.

00:04:50.037 --> 00:04:52.861
There, Wojtek drinks coffee,
talks to her for a while.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.711
She does not go to church, but Wojtek
always makes a cross on her forehead.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:02.309
His basic places of evangelisation
are beaneries and bars.

00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:04.833
There, he can meet local people

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:07.995
and talk to them
while drinking wine or eating

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.140
This is a man who needs guests,
but becomes a guest himself.

00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:17.506
I think it is the right perspective.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:23.192
We often stand in a position claiming
someone would fill our loneliness.

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:27.981
There is a beautifull sentence
of St. Mother Teresa, where she says:

00:05:28.532 --> 00:05:31.966
God, if I am lonely,
please give me someone

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:37.210
who is even more lonely than me,
and I will be able to fill his loneliness.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.834
I think that's exactly
what it's all about.

00:05:40.297 --> 00:05:43.870
I greatly encourage you
to try, in this forthcoming year,

00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:46.201
to fill the loneliness of others.

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:51.751
Even if you are forsaken yourselves,
even if it is you that really need company

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:56.864
of someone to fill your loneliness,
don't see it that way!

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:01.453
Go out to those who need company,

00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:05.700
to be with them,
to give them some warmth,

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.468
to eat something good with them,
to let them feel your closeness.

00:06:11.911 --> 00:06:15.289
Then, I am sure, miracles will happen.

00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:21.440
Because our faith is a faith
in God who is the Guest,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.302
who continually goes out
to be with us, to meet us,

00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:28.001
to sit with us at the table,
as the Revelation sats.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:30.110
And I believe it would be great

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.361
to answer to His way of living
in exactly the same way.

00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:40.400
I greet you warmly
from these faraway lands,

00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:43.622
and I hope we will soon
meet in Poland

00:06:43.752 --> 00:06:48.868
and I will be your guest
or you will be my guests.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.713
And together we will search
for God among us.

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:54.721
See you!
