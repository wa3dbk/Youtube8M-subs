00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:14.620
I was looking over the internet, researching
into the different MBA schools,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.600
and one of the schools that always kept coming up was Michigan State.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:27.160
All of the people seemed have a positive experience here—good feedback from recruiters, from current students, from alumni.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.790
Well, it started the minute I walked onto
campus as a student—and it started with

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.460
an orientation program, meeting my team for
the first time. And these were people that

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.240
came from diverse backgrounds—both geographical
and professional.

00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:48.475
I started off in engineering and I wanted
to move into the purchasing field, but I didn’t

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.140
have a real robust business background.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.600
Some are “career-switchers”—coming from
dramatically different fields. Others are here to...

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.619
 deepen their understanding of business
discipline. All of them have in common that

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.750
what they’re looking to do is create a career
where they’re going to make a difference

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.300
in the business that they’re working in.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.520
So as faculty we roll up our sleeves, get
to know the students well, and essentially

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.729
lead by example.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.949
And the smaller class size is very beneficial in terms of...

00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:21.380
fostering discussion among the students within the classroom setting.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.845
In the business world today, teamwork is pushed—it’s
necessary—it’s critical for success.

00:01:30.015 --> 00:01:34.680
I wanted to develop those skills so I could
be a leader—a team leader, and a business

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.039
leader in the future—and that’s what Broad
offers.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.210
Maybe some of the recommendations that we
put together. I think that’s a good idea.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.375
Our graduates understand the business as a whole. It’s not just about supply chain management,

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:49.619
 or just about marketing. It’s how those functions fit into the business

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.909
and contribute to the success of the business.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.489
First, of course, they have to learn the fundamental techniques…and they have to learn them very well.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.320
Then, they have to apply them. And then, they have to apply them in situations which

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.389
are as close to reality as you can possibly
bring into the classroom.

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:10.569
So this past year, Kelloggs came in. We wrote
up a custom case and gave it to the students.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.990
They have to approach the problem, figure
out the research they need, and then propose

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.500
and defend the strategy to management.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.360
There are people from all over the world—from
the U.S., from Europe, a lot of countries

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.450
in South America, from China, Asia…

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.060
The culture of the program very much lends
itself to that interaction that allows the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.140
students to learn from the experiences of
each other.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.000
I came from Idaho Falls, Idaho—a town of
about 50,000 people. I ended up in New York

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.420
City working with a Fortune 50 company.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.885
This summer I had the opportunity to do an
internship at Intel Corporation in Portland,

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:51.780
and there were plenty of MBAs from all across
the United States.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.510
I always ask them, you know, “How did you
feel? Did you feel you were as prepared as

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.250
your colleagues from other MBA programs?”
And unequivocally, every one of them has said

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.200
they felt as prepared or more prepared.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.860
Well, yeah, they’re bright and they’re
well-trained, but the first few weeks they

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.230
show up as the students that are happy to
bring in resources from other places and really

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.230
lead the change through hard work. And over
time, people take notice, and that’s somebody

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.425
they want to be around.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.360
Everyone wants to have a balance. They’re
going to work hard, but they’re also going

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.350
to make sure they have time to have fun and
really foster relationships.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.230
They have a charity auction. The Broad Women’s
Association organizes the “Race for the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.230
Cure.” You know, it’s kind of a nice way,
if you think about it, to teach ethics within

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.590
an MBA program—because the students leave
with a sense of social responsibility.

00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:48.025
Now I’m a “finance geek,” so it’s
the best return on your time, your money and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.480
your effort. And you come out all the better
for it, in terms of competing as well as in

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.120
terms of friends and alumni.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.040
Career services at the Broad program is one
of the other top reasons I chose to come here.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.310
When I looked at the percentage of folks getting
jobs and internships, it was in the 90’s.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.570
That was a huge selling factor for me—because
you want to have the confidence that they

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.685
school is working for you, as well as your
capabilities to get you a job.

00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:16.780
I think that the network beyond the Broad program, and beyond those alumni that I went to school

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.350
with, is extremely valuable. Michigan State
is a large university, yet when you meet somebody

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.380
from Michigan State, that’s an immediate
connection that gains you a hand-up.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.425
I grew so much in the Broad MBA program. I’d
definitely do it again in a heartbeat.

00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:34.400
Whether it be in a classroom setting or it
be with case competitions or organizations

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.710
or the friendships that I’ve made, each
aspect of that has pushed me to a limit where

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.845
I’ve never gone before.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.689
I think we prepared them for anything that
they want to achieve.
