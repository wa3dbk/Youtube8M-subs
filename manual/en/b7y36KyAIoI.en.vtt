00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.599
(upbeat pop music)

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.293
- Hi, YouTube friends!

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:08.991
- Hey, everyone.

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:10.163
- Thank you so much for tuning in

00:00:10.163 --> 00:00:12.364
to Cook with April on Tasty Tuesday.

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:13.521
Today, we're gonna show you

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:16.028
how to make a healthier
version of potato chips.

00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:19.325
These are baked potato chips
with a lot of yummy seasoning.

00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:21.665
So, I hope you stay tuned
'cause they're delicious.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.083
Let's start out with the seasoning.

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:26.803
Start out with two
tablespoons of olive oil.

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:29.962
Next, add one tablespoon of rosemary.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:33.229
Then, add some onion powder
as well as garlic powder,

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:34.571
they're both half a teaspoon,

00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:36.819
and mix that together and set aside.

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:39.257
And now we're gonna work on our potatoes.

00:00:39.257 --> 00:00:41.596
Peel your potatoes if you would like.

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:43.076
I'm using two potatoes.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:46.482
You don't have to peel it,
but I prefer to peel it.

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:49.419
After peeling your potatoes,
you're gonna use a mandolin

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:52.804
to create small slices
of potato chip shapes.

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:57.165
And, as you can see, it is the
exact shape of potato chips.

00:00:57.165 --> 00:01:00.968
Next, you're gonna grab a
pan and place foil on top

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:02.797
and grease it with some olive oil.

00:01:02.797 --> 00:01:06.344
And then, you're just going
to brush those seasonings

00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:07.636
on the potato chips.

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:10.347
And then, I'm adding some
cracked pepper and salt.

00:01:10.347 --> 00:01:14.046
Bake for 20 to 30 minutes at 300 degrees.

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:15.215
Enjoy!

00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:19.738
All righty, so they're ready.

00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:21.267
And are you ready to try it?

00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:21.981
- Yes, please.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:23.461
- I heard that it's good

00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:24.683
when you add a little bit more salt.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.508
So, I'm gonna crack some salt on top.

00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:27.832
- Okay, all right.

00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:29.646
Which one should I take? Just any?

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:31.327
- So, here's the thing.

00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:33.579
I learned that the darker it is,

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.194
the darker ones are more crunchier.

00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:36.894
- Right, right.

00:01:36.894 --> 00:01:37.585
- So, anything you wanna try.

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:38.332
I think this would be a good one--

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:39.089
- Okay, I'm gonna try this one.

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.826
- 'cause it looks crunchy.

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:40.549
- Yes it does, okay.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.688
- It looks crunchy.

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:51.153
- Ugh, that's disgustingly
good! (April laughs)

00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:53.824
- I see all your guys' comments on there.

00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:56.454
You say, "His reactions are so fake."

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:57.871
It's so not true!

00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:01.896
I love her cooking and I am
just in love with this too.

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:02.852
It is so good.

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:03.550
- Isn't it?

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.013
- Yeah, it's so good. I love it.

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:08.515
It tastes like the Panera chips.

00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:09.438
- Oh yeah! Like the--

00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:11.907
- Have you guys ever
had the chips at Panera

00:02:11.907 --> 00:02:12.929
or the Saint Louis Bread Company

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.071
or whatever on the East Coast?

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:15.886
That's what this tastes like.

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:16.711
Ooh, it tastes so good.

00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:18.395
- [April] I like it.
- [Justin] Mmm, it's so good.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:19.245
- It's really crunchy.

00:02:19.245 --> 00:02:21.087
- It's so good.

00:02:21.087 --> 00:02:22.558
It tastes just like potato chips!

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:23.615
- And it's healthier!

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:24.498
- Yeah.

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:26.537
- Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:27.785
These are really good things.

00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:29.400
I think I even wanna eat
it with some ketchup.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.208
- Yeah, that'd be good.

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:31.573
- [April] Is that weird?
- [Justin] No.

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:32.499
- Okay, let's have some ketchup.

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:33.200
- Yummy.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.147
- Have a beautiful day.

00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:35.906

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:39.572

00:02:40.344 --> 00:02:41.787
