Hi this is Alia, and I am in Morocco with Othmane! 

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:14.145
Last year we did a video on Ch'hiwatine, click the link to 
 watch it and we are here one year later! 

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:22.744
Hi Othmane! it's always a pleasure to see you! 

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.862
What is Ch'hiwatine?

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:28.817
Ch'hiwatine is a start-up that I launched 1 year ago

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.896
It's the first company that delivers traditional Moroccan food. 

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:36.165
So how does it work?

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:49.718
It's very simple! We prepare daily fresh Moroccan dishes. You can 
 call us and ask us "What is cooking today?"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We give you the menu and if you are interested, 
 you get the dishes within 30 minutes! 

00:00:55.169 --> 00:01:00.628
There is a new item menu that is coming up, it 
 joins the practical, the delicious, and the affordable! 

00:01:00.657 --> 00:01:05.033
It's the Tagine Sandwich!!!

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:08.166
What is a Tagine Sandwich?

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:18.865
We take one of our delicious tagines and fill a daily freshly 
 baked bread with it - we are still testing the recipes

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:25.316
it's delicious and practical! 

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:43.800
As I promised, as usual, we will share with you 
 our recipe of "Moroccan Spinach Bakkoula style" ! 

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:53.120
Slice the cured olives into small pieces. We are using 
 green and red olives in this recipe, 

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:57.130
but feel free to use either one, or no 
 olives at all if you dont like them.

00:01:57.132 --> 00:02:02.250
hese are cured olives, which means they are salty. Therefore we are 
 going to place the green olives in boiling water 

00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:11.690
for a few minutes to remove some of their saltiness and 
 acidity (the red ones dont require this step). 

00:02:11.693 --> 00:02:19.790
Usually, in Morocco we use Mallow or what we call Bakkoula for this kind 
 of recipe, but today we are making it with Spinach!  

00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:25.620
Place the spinach in water for 10 minutes to soften then wash it well.

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:34.470
Drain the spinach and roughly chop. If using mallow, youâ€™ll have to 
 steam it first before using it in this recipe. 

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:38.880
Now finely chop the parsley and cilantro. 

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:50.280
In you cooking pan, add crush garlic, salt, paprika, cumin, and cayenne 
 pepper. Of course adjust the spices to your taste. 

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:58.740
Add olive oil and the rest of the ingredients: 
 the chopped olives, cilantro, parsley, and spinach. 

00:02:58.735 --> 00:03:06.520
Cover the pan and cook all the ingredient on medium 
 heat. Mix the ingredients often to avoid burning. 

00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:12.450
Cook for around 10-15 minutes or until all the liquid has evaporated. 

00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:18.820
Serve warm or at room temperature along with crusty bread 
 and decorate with slices of preserved lemons.
