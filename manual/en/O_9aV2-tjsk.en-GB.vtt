00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.580
Opel Adam S, car showed at Ginevra but not yet on the Italian market

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.340
is a hot hatchback

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.160
and a good rival for the 500 Abarth

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.260
I'm very lucky because I'm one of the few that can test this car, thanks to Buzzetti's concessionaire.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.980
We can see that this Adam is the most sporty version

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.160
Noting some particulars like carbon fiber on mirrors and the front bumper

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.560
We can see the sporting soul of this car also on the bodywork

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.520
The dimensions are the same of the previous Opel Adam

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.840
that is 370cm length and 172cm wide

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.780
The length between front and rear wheels is very close to the 500 Abarth, that is 231cm

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.860
The spoiler draw immediately your sight, like the 18" rims

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.380
The tires respect the sporty look, infact the measures are 225/35

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.400
You can choose different colors between the roof and the rest of the car

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.480
We are talking about 5 colors for the roof and 10 colors for the rest of the car

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.320
The combinations are multiple

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.060
The boot is small, only 170L, but I don't think represent a problem because the target of this car is 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.100
directed to young people.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.900
It's possible to lower the rear seats to double the space

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.920
But if you don't want to, this boot can in any case transport three or four bags like this

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.920
The rear seats of this car are wider such as the 500 seats

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.800
If you set the front seat for a 170Cm person, the space on the rear is acceptable

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.580
But if the person is 180Cm or taller, the space disappears

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.880
The rear seats are high quality, comfortable and enveloping

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.020
The interior are well made, I appreciate the steering wheel, the gear knob and the handbrake red highlighted

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.220
I like the adhesive that reminds us we are inside an Adam S

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.360
I really appreciate the Recaro seats, obliged optional in my opinion

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.060
Those seats are really comfortable and enveloping.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.814
The used materials are really high quality

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.500
Let's see now the performance of this car, since is a sport car I think is the most important thing.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.300
This car mount a 1.4 turbo that develops 150cv and 220nm of torque

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.000
This car does 0-100 km/h in 8,5s and the max speed is 210 km/h

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.040
Brakes are perfect.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.320
The suspension are hard and the steering really precise

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.820
We can notice without problems what is going on behind our feet

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.860
This car invites you to push the accelerator, also in the corner, it feels real stable and reactive

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:20.000
When the turbo kicks in, you can feel the real power of this car, your back is smashed on the seat

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.300
The gear box is a 6 speed precise and set on the right hardness

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.980
When the engine is pushing the sound increases, but is not loud such as the 500 Abarth

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.820
Concluding, the Adam S is a real sport car that invite you to push hard

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.400
It has good suspension and nice interiors

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.680
The Adam S have best interior comparing it whit the 500 Abarth, but the sound is not loud like this one

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.140
Not everyone loves loud cars, so it can be a positive thing

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.320
