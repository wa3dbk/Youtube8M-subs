00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.970
Jeanne: The topic of the seminar today is
"Problems of the transition from school

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.660
to university."
The purpose of the seminar is to think of

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.520
ways to help students
to better cope with their academic work.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.820
Let's start by talking about two problems
faced by first-year students.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.330
They are, time management and working in groups. Well, I think that University students seem to have

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.260
a lot of 'free' time available
and there could be a whole day without any lectures

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.850
or seminars
So, in other words, university life is sort of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.620
'unstructured' compared to school, we often have to hold discussions and do assignments

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.570
in groups which can cause
lots of problems for first-year students

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.100
I know you have searched for useful materials
in the Library

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.300
and on websites, so let's see what we've
found out

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.300
I'd like to start off by asking Dennis to
tell us about time management

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.360
Dennis: As I see it, the most important thing
is to learn

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.690
and use organising and time management skills
Jenny: I think you're right. The books say

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.980
we should
make three kinds of timetables such as the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.840
semester planner, the weekly planner
and a diary for everyday work ...

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.930
Dianne: Go on.
Dennis: A semester planner is for things you

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.770
must do and don't change
such as tests and exams, and assignment due

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.580
dates. A weekly planner
is for you to put down classes and extra-curricular

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.580
activities;
while the diary is an action list which you can tck for everyday

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.790
work such as pre-lecture
readings, homework, and family functions

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.190
They help students organise
their time in a systematic way

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.880
Dianne: To a certain extent, yes, but they
are not always helpful

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.290
Research shows that it's maybe difficult
to stick to planners, like it maybe

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.870
difficult to control time in collecting information
for

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.300
papers and projects.
Jeanne: I couldn't agree more. It's hard

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.200
to fit in
part-time jobs, extra-curricular activities,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.150
and social life with academic (studies).
Some social activities just pop up at the last

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.129
minute
and you feel bad turning down invitations

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.689
Dennis: It seems to me that I spend too much
time on

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.819
'time wasters' such as chats, phone calls,
ICQing,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.930
watching TV, browsing the internet, etc. I
must learn to say "No".

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.450
Jenny: I've got some tips from university
websites

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.030
and they say we must also learn how to research
effectively,

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.769
such as, we can attend workshops organised by the library,
we could also ask teachers for help outside

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.180
class time and even make
use of consultation hours. This is important

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.390
because we need to do
a lot of reading and assignments in a short

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.969
time period.
Jeanne: Well, we're running out of

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:12.189
time, so, let's move on to the second problem.
What's your view on working in groups, Jenny?

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:17.480
Jenny: As I see it, it is a problem because
group work requires

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.409
communications in different ways, such as
face-to-face, phone calls,

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.590
and email, which take up a lot of time.
Dianne: As far as I'm concerned, the problem

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.290
is you need to
work with people that you don't know. Group

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.430
work is never easy
because sometimes, some people are dominating,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.939
others contribute little,
very often I find that the time is spent unproductively

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.239
and I often feel frustrated.
Dennis: I agree with Dianne about knowing

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.159
our team members, it's good to get to know our team members,

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.680
find out their backgrounds,
strengths and interests so we can know what

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.969
they like to do and what
they are good at, and so we can build a good working

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.249
relationship.
Jeanne: Well, my readings say that to get

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:06.779
better grades we should clarify
assignment requirements such as the purpose

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.239
of the project and the skills
we need to demonstrate in the project.

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.370
Dianne: I think you're right. And after
understanding the task,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.329
then we can break them down into subtasks, and see which parts can be

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.109
done on our own and what can be done in a
group.

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.560
Dennis: Then we need to agree on a plan and
the deadlines.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.160
Someone should be chosen to take on a leadership
role to guide the process.
