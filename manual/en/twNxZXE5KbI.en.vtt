00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:07.480
music intro 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.459
quick and tasty Mexican steak tortilla 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:12.870
my inspiration for this comes from 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.019
seeing this on the street in south America walking past and smelling 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.029
it going over whats happenign here having a little look and then 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.079
putting my own interpretation on it as well and that is what its all about 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.880
especially on this channel 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.010
all you need is a nice onion right to make this sauce im going to start off  

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.290
dice out nicely 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.730
a little bit of oil 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.310
you only want to sweat it enough frying and sweating are too different things when you fry it it goes really 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:45.310
brown and nutty and when your sweating it it will go translucent and sweat yeah so that's what we are going for

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.010
why not put a little bit of chorizo in there. the oils that come out of this are fantastic 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.929
there really really powerful 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.100
robust 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.800
and they really give a nice dynamic to teh sauce as well yeah 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.320
you can see all that lovely oil coming off that is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.130
scrumptious 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.180
now i'm going to put a bit of garlic in add a bit of background flavour just two 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.840
we need one these boys now a chilli 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.800
good 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.370
smelling nice now we have got a bit of coriander here look at this nice and fresh 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.510
pungent and it really lifts the dish with these leaves but if you use these little boys here 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.640
everyone leaves them out look at them 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.970
just think when its growing

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.180
all the nutrients are coming 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.180
there look at that all the water that's coming out of it it tastes fantastic lets get in into the pan 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.250
its raining coriander and that is the colour of mexico right there look at it

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.250
so a lovely tin of chopped tomatoes 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.950
throw them in 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.330
fifteen twenty minutes and you've got yourself a nice spicey sauce 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.070
this sauce is the Jacobs you could use it with almost anything a bit of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.130
pasta a nice bit of chicken you can even put it on a nice bit of cheese

this cut of meat is called the skirt steak its easy to find it cooks really quickly and its delicious 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:35.819
i need to tenderize it i want it to be really thin so that it cooks really quickly 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.709
