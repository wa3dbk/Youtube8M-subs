00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.080
Hey guys, I just wanted to go into the habit
of playing No Limit Hold 'Em, just the base

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.080
rules of the game.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.150
Here we got our players and we got our blinds
posted 5 and 10.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:24.500
I've got the 2 cards face down, now in another
video we talked about about limit hold 'em

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.350
and like the betting restrictions there.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.010
In no limit there are no restrictions, which
can be good or a bad thing depending on how

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.410
you play.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.080
So, here let's say he decides he wants to
call.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.110
Here, with his bet just decides that he wants
to call as well.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.850
Now, he's got the option he could either check
or he can raise.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.970
He decides to raise, now with limit hold em
he would have to raise $10, but here he can

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.280
raise as much as he wants.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.090
And say, in this case here he wants to raise
$25.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.440
Alright, so now players here would have to
bet 25 if they wanted to stay in the hand.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.520
So here, say he wants to call, and then he
wants to fold.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.240
Alright so this goes in the pot, this goes
in his well.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.909
Alright, now we have a flop.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.840
Okay.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.799
Now here in no limit, you don't have to bet
10 if you don't to.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.210
If you want bet more than that, your more
than welcome to.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.220
Another thing, a lot of players have heard
the terminology 'all in.'

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.030
What that means, is that he basically pushes
it all in, and now he's betting all of his

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.030
chips.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.950
All players here started with the same amount,
that's just for the sake of making things

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.000
simple here.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.299
So let's see, he decides to call alright?

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.430
So now everything matches up, alright.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.380
And in a hold em game, also in a cash game
you don't have to show your cards right away

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.290
but in poker tournaments, if you ever see
some tournaments that they'll show on TV,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.869
they'll actually have them turn the cards
up.

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.640
Alright, here.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.540
We actually have an interesting situation
where there's a king, jack, and a 10 but then

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.120
both both players have a queen.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.060
Nobody else has like a higher card, so in
this case here the best 5 card hand for both

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.090
of them is king, queen, jack, 10 and 7.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.550
So in this case here, this is called a split
pot.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:50.280
What happens here is that both players split
the pot.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.519
Cards get swept up and we go to the next hand.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.090
And that's No Limit Hold 'Em.
