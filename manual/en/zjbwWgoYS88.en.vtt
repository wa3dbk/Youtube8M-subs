Aloha, my name is Kaipo Kaleikaumaka
Leopoldino and I am from Kailua-Kona on

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.900
the Big Island of Hawaii.   I love
Chaminade because of the community

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.100
spirit and atmosphere here.  Everyone is
looking out for your well-being and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.600
everyone has your back, especially the
teachers.  Every teacher is an expert in

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.100
their field and every one of them will
bend over backwards just to see you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.900
succeed. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.500
During my first year at Chaminade
University I was very fortunate to have

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.400
the opportunity to get involved with the
Hawaiian club and I was eventually asked

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
during my first semester to become the
president of the Hawaiian club.  It was an

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.800
opportunity for students to come
together from all walks of life – from

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.900
Philadelphia to New York to Alaska – all
come together twice a week to sit down,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.800
learn a bit of the culture, and have fun
doing it.  We kind of consider ourselves

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.400
the self-appointed “ambassadors of
aloha” and everyone who joined Hawaiian

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.500
club had a good time. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.300
Through my involvement with the
Hawaiian club I was very blessed to have

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.200
the opportunity to meet a man named Dr.
Henry Halenani Gomes.  He was not only

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.100
the advisor for  the Hawaiian club, but he
the director of the Office of Native

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.400
Hawaiian Partnerships for Chaminade
University.  He was my mentor, he was

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.600
also my boss and it was through him that
I was able to learn what it means to be a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.100
Native Hawaiian man in this day and age.
He taught me lots of things like direction

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.300
and goal setting.  Unfortunately, Uncle
Henry passed away in September 2012

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.900
but his lessons that he taught me in all of
our conversations – they still stick with

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.600
me today. 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.900
This is my third year as a student here at
Chaminade University and I got to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.200
experience many different things while
being a student here.   This year I had the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.300
opportunity to run for the president of
C.S.G.A. or the Chaminade Student

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.300
Government Association.  My duties
include talking with the students, hearing

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.000
their concerns, and then acting as a sort
of liaison between the administrative

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.500
branch and the student body.  I find that
being in student government now is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.200
really preparing me for what I want to do
in the future.   In the future I want to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.300
advocate for Native Hawaiian needs and
rights and now I find that I’m able to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.700
practice it here at Chaminade, advocating
for what students want,  and what

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.800
students need, and what could make
students’ lives easier. 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.100
I think the coolest part is that when I
eventually graduate and I get my diploma

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.600
and I look at it and I hold it I’d be able to
know that not only did I get a great

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.800
education in my pre-law program with
Criminal Justice, but I learned so many

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:43.200
other things along the way.  Whether it be
my experiences at Hawaiian club or my

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.900
involvement with C.S.G.A. – I’ll know that
everything that Chaminade had to offer was

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
there for me and I was able to take
advantage of it. That’s the true value of a

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.000
college education and I’ll be able to move
forward confidently in life, ready to take

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.500
on the next stage.
