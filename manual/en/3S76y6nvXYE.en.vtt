00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:07.149
Some Star Trek factoids. When Star Trek first
aired the very first episode was entitled

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.530
The Man Trap involving a female metamorph
who was actually a creature who drained the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.210
salt from human beings? In her normal human
guise, she was an ex gal pal of Dr. McCoy

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.680
ie. DeForest Kelley, but this turns out that
it was the fourth episode actually filmed.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.399
The first one should have been Where No One
Has Gone Before, but executives said they

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.679
wanted something that wasn't as intellectual
and had more of a creature in it. The fourth

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.829
episode was the first one that fit the bill
so that was aired first. We didn't see the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.429
introduction of Spock and Shatner, as we would
have, until the third episode was aired which

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.120
was actually the first Where No Man Has Gone
Before where they actually traveled to the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.019
end of the galaxy. Now in that particular
episode we saw William Shatner at his grave

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:11.080
and it said James R. Kirk, but we know later
he was called James T. Kirk - T. for Tiberius.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.920
A few other factoids - Leonard Nimoy was in
the original pilot The Cage in which Jeffery

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.790
Hunter played the protagonist, but apparently
the executives didn't like him and Jeffery

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.979
Hunter wasn't that happy with it so they made
another pilot with Shatner. Of course, Nimoy

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.119
was in every single episode, perhaps best
known previously, for roles in them, a small

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.270
role, and also playing Narab, an alien, in
Zombies from the Stratosphere. James Doohan

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.530
i.e. Scotty Montgomery, the engineer, lost
the middle finger of his right hand during

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.090
World War II. They always were careful not
to show that on close up. Only in one episode

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.700
was that revealed. And, I should point out,
that in the sequel and in The Cage, which

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.970
was the original, Gene Roddenberry got the
brilliant idea to make it a two hour installment

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.390
entitled The Menagerie in which scenes from
that original pilot were incorporated, but

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.230
Christopher Pike, the role that Jeffery Hunter
had played, was now played by a lesser known

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.670
actor because Jeffery Hunter didn't want any
part of it. So he had heavy makeup and the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.730
man was supposed to be ill accounting for
the change in his physiography.
