How to Make a Wedding Cake.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.170
If you can follow a recipe, you can make a
wedding cake.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.540
These tips will help you create a classic,
three-tier confection.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:23.090
You will need Baking pans Cake recipe Filling
Cake assembly tools Plastic wrap Aluminum

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:31.880
foil Pastry brush Simple syrup Edible decorations
Boxed cake mixes (optional) and serrated knife

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.880
(optional).

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.880
Step 1.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.830
Figure out how much cake you'll need.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.450
A cake with three, round, two-layer tiers
(14 inches, 10 inches, and 6 inches) will

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
serve about 100 guests.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.170
Preparing a separate, 11- by 15-inch half-sheet
cake is an easy way to serve another 40 guests.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.210
Square cakes provide more slices, and look
just as pretty tiered.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.210
Step 2.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.120
Pick a cake flavor and filling.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.489
Keep in mind that the cake should be dense
because the bottom layers must support the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.610
upper ones.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.889
If you lack refrigeration space, choose a
non-perishable filling.

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:17.140
Some boxed cake mixes offer instructions on
adjusting the recipe for a denser cake.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.289
Step 3.

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.540
Choose a frosting.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.670
Consider the temperature at the reception;
the kind of cake surface you want, and whether

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.289
your priority is a beautiful cake or a tasty
one.

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.970
Buttercream frosting can melt in high temperatures,
whereas royal icing requires no refrigeration.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.969
Fondant provides the smoothest surface but
isn't as tasty as other icings.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.409
Store-bought canned frostings are not firm
enough for wedding cakes.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.450
If you want a ready-made frosting, get one
made specifically for party cakes at a cake-supply

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.450
store.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.450
Step 4.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.139
Get the proper tools: a plastic cake board
that's wider than the bottom layer; separator

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:58.990
plates -- foam board disks that each tier
rests on; and dowels -- rods inserted through

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.569
the cake to support the tiers.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.219
Find them in cake decorating and craft stores.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:05.329
Step 5.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.649
Bake the layers a few days before the wedding.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.370
Let each one cool completely before wrapping
it in plastic, and then foil, and then freezing.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.370
Step 6.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.510
Defrost the layers at room temperature 10
to 12 hours before the wedding and make the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.510
frosting.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.409
If possible, bring everything to the wedding
site and assemble the cake there.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.110
If the layers are not level, even them out
by cutting them with a serrated knife.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.349
Step 7.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.439
Assemble the tiers.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.700
Place the bottom layer of each two-layer tier
on its own separator plate.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.459
Brush the surface of the bottom layer with
simple syrup to moisten the cake.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.970
Then, cover the surface with filling, add
the top layer, brush it with simple syrup,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.370
and frost.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.700
Step 8.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.860
Insert dowels, trimmed to the height of each
tier, into the two bottom tiers: For the 14-inch

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.959
layer, put six evenly-spaced dowels 4 inches
from the edge, and four evenly-spaced dowels

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.849
6 inches from the edge.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.650
For the 10-inch cake, evenly space six dowels
3 inches from the edge.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.050
Now carefully stack the tiers, including the
foam boards.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.159
Step 9.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.769
Add the finishing touches, like decorative
piping and edible flowers.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.200
If you're more adventurous, you can fashion
flowers out of marzipan or gum paste.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.849
Have a great wedding!

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:27.439
Did you know The 2004 New England Bridal Showcase
featured a seven-tier, 17-foot high cake that

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:35.769
weighed 15,032 lbs. and was large enough to
serve 59,000 guests.
