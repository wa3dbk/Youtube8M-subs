Hi! We are Nick and Valerie Wisniewski on
behalf of expertvillage.com. We are here to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.920
talk about animal tracks and sign and if you
need more information, please visit our website

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.619
walnuthilltracking.com. Here in front of us
we have some different kinds of animal sign.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.300
Tracking isn’t just about tracks it is also
about the other clues that we have to animal’s

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.780
life and the forest. At one time being able
to read that information was a matter of survival.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.649
With some skill and some practice you can
learn how to do that again. Here we have some

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.399
food that was opened by different animals.
These are hickory shells and we can tell by

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.109
the way they were opened and the incisor marks,
the teeth marks on the shells, these hickory

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.390
nuts were opened by a chipmunk. Here we have
some spruce counts. These were cleaned. They

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.960
were fed on fed by a red squirrel that was
looking for the little pine nuts that grow

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:23.300
in there. These hickory nuts were opened by
birds; probably something like a white breasted

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.930
nut hatch. You can also tell that by the way
the nuts were opened. We have some feathers

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.240
here of a bird that was killed by a red fox.
You can tell by the damage to the feathers

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.350
and the crushing of the quills. You can tell
by the spacing of the teeth marks where the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.740
feather was damaged. But those are the canines
of a carnivore. In this case, a red fox that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.660
took the bird. Learning how to read animal
tracks and sign is something that you can

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.130
be helped with some good references. Valerie
is showing you a field guide to mammal track

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.920
by Alice J. This book was published in 1954
and it is still one of the best books for

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.280
overall exposure to different tracks and sign
of different mammals, bird’s even amphibians

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.840
and insects in the United States. Next we
have tracking in the art of seeing how to

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.840
read animal tracking sign by Paul Resendez.
A more recent book probably considered the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.140
finest tracking book available. In terms of
interpreting the way animals move and the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.379
patterns they leave on the ground, a very
indispensable book is Animals in Motion by

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:49.260
Eadweard Muybridge. Learning how to rt4ead
animal tracks and sign can be an incredible

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.959
experience and can teach you much about the
animals in the forest.
