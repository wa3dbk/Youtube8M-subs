00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:06.153
Hey my Sweet Vs, It's The Sweetest Vegan here and today 
 on the show we are gearing up for Valentine's Day.

00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:06.060
Hey my Sweet Vs, It's The Sweetest Vegan here and today 
 on the show we are gearing up for Valentine's Day.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.590
Today we are making vegan red velvet cupcakes.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.590
Today we are making vegan red velvet cupcakes.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.315
And do not get grossed out, we are using beets 
 instead of red food coloring, and trust me

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.315
And do not get grossed out, we are using beets 
 instead of red food coloring, and trust me

00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:19.453
you can't taste the beets. And I don't really 
 like beets, but you can't taste them.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:23.174
But I am getting ahead of myself, lets go ahead and make our cupcakes.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.135
We are going to start by preheating our oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:40.705
Then line your cupcake tin and get all the ingredients together. 
 Remember a list of ingredients can be found below.

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:40.705
Then line your cupcake tin and get all the ingredients together. 
 Remember a list of ingredients can be found below.

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:47.067
We are going to start by whisking together our 
 dry ingredients: all purpose flour, granulated sugar

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:47.067
We are going to start by whisking together our 
 dry ingredients: all purpose flour, granulated sugar

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:51.151
cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:55.489
Whisk until well combined. Then use a food processor or a chopper,

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.629
I am using a chopper because I am broke, to puree your beets

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.389
then add in the canola oil, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.389
then add in the canola oil, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:05.968
And pulse again until combined.

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:10.821
The add your beet mixture, or your wet ingredients to your dry ingredients

00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:14.931
Add if you need a little but more moisture, 
 like I did, add a little water.

00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:20.736
Next, your want to immediately put your cupcake mixture into your cupcake tins

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:26.309
And bake those for about 18 to 20 minutes.

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:32.230
It depends on your oven, remember every oven 
 is different. I just check for doneness.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.083
My vegan red velvet cupcakes baked for 18 minutes, and when 
 the tooth pick came out clean, I took them out.

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:47.690
Every vegan red velvet cupcake needs a vegan cream cheese 
 frosting, click the annotation or see the description

00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:53.040
for my vegan cream cheese frosting recipe. Sorry if you can hear 
 my dog chewing in the back ground, he's been rude.

00:01:53.035 --> 00:02:00.810
And these came out ubber delicious. The cake came out like 
 no other vegan cake I have ever had before.

00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:05.040
Maybe I'll start putting beets in all of my 
 cakes, but that is it for today. Bye.
