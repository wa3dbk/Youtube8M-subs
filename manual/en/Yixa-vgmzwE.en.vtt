00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.850
Okay, and so now I'm ready to show you how
to run this drawstring through this purse.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.450
What I want to do is start on one side and
bring it all the way through where it comes

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.500
out the other side. So, I'm just going to
hold it, slip it through and just push it

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.080
through with your fingers and you can kind
of gather it as much as you want then let

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.260
it go and pull it through. It's really, really
easy to do. If you've ever lost the drawstring

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.080
out of a hoodie or something like that, you're
probably familiar with doing this, but if

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.600
not, then now you know how to put your drawstring
back in your hoodie. Just use a safety pin.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.499
It's a seamstress trick. When you get right
here, you have to remember you have that piece

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.579
of fabric in there for the lining, and what
I like to do is, like see right now I can't

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.379
get through because I caught the lining for
the opening, so I'm going to put my finger

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.199
in there and when I can feel the safety pin,
then I'm going to push and I know that that's

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.170
where it is. See where it comes out. Try to
feel it with your pinky or if your big finger

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.929
can fit in there try it, but usually mine
can't. When you're doing this, don't let this

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:22.240
part go all the way out because you'll have
to start all over. Here I am at the other

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.960
side and you just keep running it through.
Just skip that hole and go back to where you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:39.990
first started. Okay, I'm almost there and
then I'm going to show you how to run the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.770
second one through on the next clip because
it's a little bit different than running this

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:52.350
one through. Remember, use your finger. You
can feel that piece. Oh, there it is. Okay,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.409
here's these 2 pieces. You can see it's starting
to take it's shape now, and what I'm going

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.109
to do is just take out the safety pin and
make just a little knot with both of these.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.479
That's not the way I'm going to finish them,
but I'm going to leave it like that for now

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.819
because I don't want to be working on this
one and this one come out, so I'm just going

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.250
to make sure it's going to stay in there for
now. So in the next clip I'm going to show

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.160
you how to work with this ruffle and put this
one on the other side, so we'll do that next.
