00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.310
Just in case we encounter
any more trolls who

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.880
want us to figure out
what types of money

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.270
they have in their pockets,
we have devised an exercise

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.190
for you to practice with.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.220
And this is to solve systems
of equations visually.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.080
So they say right over here,
graph this system of equations

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.790
and solve.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.850
And they give us two equations.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.500
This first one in blue, y
is equal to 7/5x minus 5,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.475
and then this one in green,
y is equal to 3/5x minus 1.

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:32.100
So let's graph each
of these, and we'll

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.560
do it in the
corresponding color.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.830
So first let's graph
this first equation.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.820
So the first thing I see is
its y-intercept is negative 5.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.790
Or another way to think about
it, when x is equal to 0,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.040
y is going to be negative 5.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.320
So let's try this out.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.470
So when x is equal
to 0, y is going

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.230
to be equal to negative 5.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.160
So that makes sense.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.850
And then we see
its slope is 7/5.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.340
This was conveniently placed
in slope-intercept form for us.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.310
So it's rise over run.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.540
So for every time it moves
5 to the right it's, going

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.080
to move seven up.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.420
So if it moves 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 to the right,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.610
it's going to move 7 up.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.920
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.342
So it'll get right over there.

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:20.050
Another way you could
have done it is you

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.760
could have just tested
out some values.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.676
You could have said, oh,
when x is equal to 0,

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:25.360
y is equal to negative 5.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.540
When x is equal to 5, 7/5
times 5 is 7 minus 5 is 2.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.380
So I think we've properly
graphed this top one.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.000
Let's try this bottom
one right over here.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.970
So we have when x is equal to
0, y is equal to negative 1.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.290
So when x is equal to 0,
y is equal to negative 1.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.930
And the slope is 3/5.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.100
So if we move over 5 to the
right, we will move up 3.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.580
So we will go right
over there, and it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.760
looks like they intersect
right at that point,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.400
right at the point x is
equal to 5, y is equal to 2.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.120
So we'll type in x is equal
to 5, y is equal to 2.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.810
And you could even verify
by substituting those values

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.310
into both equations,
to show that it

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.250
does satisfy both constraints.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.580
So let's check our answer.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.931
And it worked.
