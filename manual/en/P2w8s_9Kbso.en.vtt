Hey, man. Do you have a phone charger?

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:37.866
- [Man] No.

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.227
- Deja, do you have a phone charger?

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:40.385

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:43.149
Does anybody have a iPhone 6 charger?

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.911
I can't believe no one has a charger.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:50.747

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.393
- I don't have one.

00:00:55.393 --> 00:00:58.045
- I need to use your car
charger! It's an emergency!

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:00.161
Okay, give me your car then.

00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:02.036
I'm sorry, I need your car.

00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:03.344

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:29.965
Still up for lunch?

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:32.037
- [Chrissy] I am so
sorry, Ben, I wish I could

00:01:32.037 --> 00:01:33.845
but my brother's car just got stolen.

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:37.685
- Stolen? I'm sorry to hear that.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:38.681
What kind of car?

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:39.758
