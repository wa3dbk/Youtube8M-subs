Hi everybody I'm John Graden, I'm a professional
speaker, a trainer, and the author of the

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.880
Impostor Syndrome. How do you write a feature
story? I've been the publisher and editor

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.870
and I've written for many, many magazines.
So let me share with you some of my experiences.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.279
If you are to the point where you've been
assigned this story good for you. Let's do

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.349
it well. Make sure you understand exactly
what your editor wants. Make sure you guys

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.310
are both of your ladders are on the same wall.
So if he is expecting one thing and you do

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.249
something else, you are going to have to redo
it. And that is really a waste of time for

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.489
both of you. And it makes you look like an
amateur and you don't want that. Make sure

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.980
you know your word count, how many words and
your deadline. Beat that deadline. As you

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.570
start to expand the story discuss the story
with some of your friends and colleagues,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.821
get a sense of their reaction to it. Here's
a good example. With the impostor syndrome,

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.710
when I would explain to people that the impostor
syndrome is a feeling that you are not as

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.820
smart, skilled or talented as people think
you are, they go oh my God, really that's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.700
me. There's a name for that? It was virtually
the same response over and over again. So

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.030
I was able to weave that into my query letters,
my book proposals and then stories that I've

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.360
written to promote the impostor syndrome.
So when you get this emotional reaction from

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.640
people make note of that. It may become your
headline, it may become your lead sentence,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.390
the sentence that's used to hook your readers
into the story. It may be part of your intro,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.799
and it certainly can become even the title
of your book. So I want to gage where the

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.810
emotions at with this subject. When I have
lots of facts and figures like you know, unemployment

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.500
rates or whatever, inflation, I want to bring
that down from a big macro view into a micro

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.610
view of how it effects the person on the street.
If people are losing their jobs, how is that

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.659
effecting this family of four who is facing
Christmas. So I want to try and humanize the

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:03.210
article to make sure that I'm connecting with
the reader. The headline and the first sentence

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.890
in the intro all work as your sales person
for this article. They sell the potential

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.750
reader on investing the time to actually read
the story so it's got the promise of benefit,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.270
where it's got to teach them something of
interest or it's got to just entertain them

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.630
if nothing else. So make sure you spend a
lot of time on the headline or the title of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.410
the story, the intro to the story and then
that lead sentence or two which is also called

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.920
the hook, we are going to hook them into read
the story. So I want to promise a benefit

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.380
or I want to teach them some type of new strategy
or something that's going to help them improve

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.940
their lives. So when you write the headline
to the story, here's a good test that I've

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:47.160
learned to use, I use the so what test. So
what, I read the headline so what. And unemployment

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:56.290
is on the rise, so what. How does that effect
me? Families facing dire Christmas, it's hard

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.950
to say so what to that. Do to inflation, due
to unemployment. So I'm taking that big picture

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.690
and bringing it down to the reader's heart.
I'm John Graden and I hope that helps you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.230
to write a good feature story, thanks.
