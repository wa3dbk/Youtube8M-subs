I started break dancing when I was 16. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I met the B-Boy when I was walking down the street and met a dancer and their breaking acrobatics, his dynamic dance, impacted me and that's when I got in in the B-Boy world.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:08.000
At first I started break dancing mostly because it is fashionable. In my neighborhood everybody did then struck me there and then had a friend who was dancing and he said he had a band and started with them learned very quickly there and then I felt very free.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Here in Cuba we never had an international event before. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The Red Bull BC One has many qualifiers, many cyphers and a final. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I live in Guanabacoa, in the hot land, where the most prevalent are the folklore and Afro-Cuban roots. I work as a shoemaker. Is this type of work the one that alouds me to have more time to devote to the B-Boy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Today I am a professional B-Boy and I have 12 years dancing. Well it was not easy either. I have like eight or seven years giving it all, training hard for be able to do it. I didn't know if I was going to travel or to be on television, I only did it because I liked to share with my mates. He was upset and I was going to dance then it was like my vice, my way to calm down.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
My family didn't support me; they said this dance was not doing anything for me, that it was a waste of time. Its something I felt, I liked and I did, it was like that. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But well I set a goal many years ago and I said that If I was going to practice a marginal dance that nobody knows, I would try to be the best. Maybe then people can get to know me. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I knew that some day I would have that chance. I practiced and worked a lot because I knew that this moment would arrive some day. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Winning here the first place is not everything. Winning is also going to Colombia to represent Cuba, represent all B-Boys who for years have wanted to participate in a BC One, who for years have struggled.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:23.000
For me to win is to show the world that in Cuba that the B-Boy is sacrifice, is like, is pleasure. That the B-Boy is practiced because we were born like that.
