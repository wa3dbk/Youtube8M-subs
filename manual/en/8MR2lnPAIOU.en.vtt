00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.349
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Hi everyone, Robyn Youkilis here,
television show host and certified wellness expert

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.780
&gt;&gt; Summer: Hi, I'm Summer Bock,  fermentationist.
We're going to show you today how to make

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.200
a tempeh Reuben salad.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.509
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Ooh, say that again. That sounds
so good. [laughter]

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.300
&gt;&gt; Summer: We're taking this concept, for
those of you who are gluten free, we're going

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.960
to take a sandwich and teach you how to turn
it into a salad so you don't have to miss

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.439
out on your favorite lunch treats.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.509
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Sounds good to me. Who doesn't love
a good Reuben, and we actually even took this

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.320
a step further because we're making it vegetarian,
so we even took the meat out of this guy,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.980
and made it healthier, and we're adding in
super foods and awesome boosting stuff. We

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.870
really took this up a notch. Let's get started.
Summer created this incredible dressing for

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.080
us with all the lovely flavors of a tempeh
Reuben, so why don't you tell us about that.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
&gt;&gt; Summer: That's right. First of all we're
starting with the mixed greens here and then

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.800
we're going to build from there. We're going
to use a Russian dressing and that's going

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.890
to be our salad dressing for this. What we
do is we're going to take mayonnaise and ketchup

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.439
and we're going to ...

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.720
&gt;&gt; Robyn: So artfully displayed ...

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.439
&gt;&gt; Summer: Thank you.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.680
&gt;&gt; Robyn: ... In that dish there. I love what
you did there. She made mayonnaise and ketchup

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.500
sexy. I'm just saying.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.900
&gt;&gt; Summer: That's right. We're going to take
the mayonnaise and the ketchup and we're going

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.010
to mix those two together, and that's going
to create this Russian dressing. We pour a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.740
little bit of sauerkraut brine into this.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.500
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Okay, so let's talk about the tempeh
in this tempeh Reuben salad. We have some

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.960
tempeh here that's marinating in a super simple
marinade of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.520
some good Grade B real maple syrup and a little
bit of tamari, which is just a wheat-free

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.560
soy sauce. This marinade is a favorite of
Summer's and I's. It's pretty much how we

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.259
always do tempeh.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:42.969
&gt;&gt; Summer: That's right.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.320
&gt;&gt; Robyn: And tempeh, don't be afraid of it,
it's just a fermented soybean cake. It sounds

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.950
scary but it's really simple. Bring it home,
just sear it off in some coconut oil. You

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.090
don't even have to do the whole marinade thing,
it's absolutely delicious with a little salt

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.490
and pepper. We have our beautiful seared off
tempeh croutons we're adding to our tempeh

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.119
Reuben salad, and why don't you add your favorite
ingredient ...

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:05.799
&gt;&gt; Summer: Yeah, here we go.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.260
&gt;&gt; Robyn: ... And then get that in there ...

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.649
&gt;&gt; Summer: We'll lay the sauerkraut on there
and then we're going to sprinkle some caraway

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.150
seeds.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.019
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Caraway seeds are what's really
going to make it taste like a tempeh Reuben.

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:15.979
&gt;&gt; Summer: This is ...
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Rye bread.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.709
&gt;&gt; Summer: Right, this is the Reuben flavor,
the traditional caraway seed makes it that

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.230
rye bread flavor. This is going to be delicious.
Robyn: That's what you guys are really tasting

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.700
with rye bread. It's just the caraway seeds.
Let's give that a mix, and that's it, that's

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.879
all that's going in here. If you want to simplify
this even more you can take out the tempeh,

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.060
it probably would still work and be absolutely
delicious, or jazz it up and add mushrooms,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.510
whatever your favorite ingredients are. Sprouts
would be great in this.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.269
&gt;&gt; Summer: If you're a meat eater you can
use the regular corned beef.

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.930
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Oh yeah, meat eaters. Yes. Go ahead,
find a good organic, preferably from a local

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.909
farm, nitrate free good corned beef, or you
could even learn to make that yourself. That's

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.889
like a whole other advanced video that we're
not quite ready for.

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.199
&gt;&gt; Summer: Let's serve it up.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:03:01.680
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Let's serve this up, and Summer's
going to have it straight is, straight exactly

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.059
as is. I eat dairy from time to time, so if
you guys really love the Swiss cheese on your

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:13.450
tempeh Reuben you could go ahead and get a
little bit of organic cheese. I got a raw

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.819
cheddar for my. This is a cow's milk cheese.
I looked for a goat cheese that was Swiss

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.799
style but I didn't find one. If you guys can
find one where you live, let us know. We want

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.579
to hear from you, we want to hear how your
tempeh Reuben tastes because we're about to

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.650
taste ours. Ready, girl? Cheers.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.950
&gt;&gt; Summer: You put some cheese on yours?

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.859
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Oh yeah, I forgot ... Thank you.
It's ... I'm excited about the cheese part,

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:36.959
I'm not going to lie.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.250
&gt;&gt; Summer: I just can't wait to eat this tempeh,
it looks delicious.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.930
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Ready? I'm not taking a TV bite,
I'm just going for it. Oh my God. Bye.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.719
&gt;&gt; Summer: That's so good.
&gt;&gt; Robyn: Oh my God.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.669
&gt;&gt; Summer: Yeah.

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.060
&gt;&gt; Robyn: I'm going to leave you here because
this is too amazing.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.749
&gt;&gt; Summer: This was such a good idea.
&gt;&gt; Robyn: This was such a good idea. I love

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.159
it.
&gt;&gt; Summer: This is what happens when forces

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.519
combine.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.349

I'm going Bock to my salad because, I mean,
it's everything. This salad is everything,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.860
I've decided. It's the best thing we've ever
made, hands down.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.349
&gt;&gt; Summer: It might be.
&gt;&gt; Robyn: It might be.

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.539
&gt;&gt; Summer: It might be my favorite salad.
&gt;&gt; Robyn: I totally agree.

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.999
&gt;&gt; Summer: I miss me a Reuben.
