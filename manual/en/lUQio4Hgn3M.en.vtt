Hello, my name is Luis Estrada and I am a
Software Developer. In this video, I'll show

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:17.010
you how to scan photographs. For this demonstration,
I'm using Picasa 3. Picasa is a registered

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.890
trademark of Google, a company to which I
have no affiliation. Press file and import

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:32.940
from. Select the device. Your scanner should
appear under this option. Now select the preset,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.180
depending whether you are scanning a color
or a black and white picture. You can also

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.482
manually adjust the settings. Under the dpi
resolution, you choose the original quality

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:54.090
of the scanning. DPI means dots per inch and
this is a major of quality. The higher the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.219
dpi, the better the quality of the scan image.
As the dpi increases, so does the image file

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.549
size and the time it takes to scan it. Depending
on the characteristics of your scanner, you

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.530
can choose resolutions of 75 up to 2400 dpi
or even more on professional scanners. If

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.299
you want to get the best quality, choose a
high dpi even if the scan image is too big.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.710
You can always resize it and compress it while
maintaining the better quality than if you

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.729
scan it at a lower dpi. If you do not need
a professional quality, you can use a 75 or

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:50.729
200 dpi resolution. In this case I will use
75. Press okay and then preview.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:00.580
Now you can crop the image to get rid of the
white background. Now press scan, the image

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:09.679
will be imported into Picasa. You can scan
as many images as you want. If you scan more

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.660
than one image, the import all button will
include all pictures into Picasa. If you do

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.550
not want all pictures to be imported, select
the ones you need and press import selected.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:35.600
Enter a new folder name and choose a location
for the folder or leave the default one. You

00:02:35.600 --> 00:03:00.780
can add additional information like the place
taken, date and a description.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:10.910
Finally, click finish. Your image is now in
Picasa, ready to be viewed and shared. I'm

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.700
Luis Estrada and I've showed you how to edit
your digital images.
