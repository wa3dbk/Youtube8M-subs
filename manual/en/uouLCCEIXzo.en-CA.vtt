00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:32.055
Japacon TV

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.825
Guys called prototype creators who are creating figures acknowledged by the world.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.850
We were able to bring a camera into the divine workplace where it’s usually not allowed to do so.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:08.060
Right now, Kaiyodo has ten prototype creators, but not one of them went to art school or had experience in product modeling.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.940
And the guy working on the end of the room is the treasure of the figure world, a genius prototype creator named Bome.

00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:25.425
Bome is a pioneer of girl figures who continues to attain the ultimate in modeling beauty and has enthusiastic fans across the country.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:31.515
In 2001, his works were displayed at the Cartier Foundation of Contemporary Art.

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:40.060
Takashi Murakami’s girl figure which was valued at 66 million yen was also created by Bome.

00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:45.795
Excuse me. We are from a show called Japacon TV...

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:47.240
I always watch it.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.555
Really?

00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:56.525
I saw people talking about Japacon TV, and started recording it on DVD.

00:01:56.525 --> 00:02:00.595
How do you like it?

00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:06.570
Seeing how foreigners react, I found it interesting.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.670
You do watch our show! Thank you!

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.160
What are you making now?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.025
I’m making a girl figure.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:29.850
I’m carving wrinkles, and it’s still halfway done. I’m going to put clay and finish it up. 

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:33.555
As a prototype creator, what do you keep in mind?

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:39.690
I try to make it look cool at a glance.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:51.225
For posing, I think about a model standing and try to extract coolness and prettiness from that.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.535
Is there anything you refer to?

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:01.040
I like Michelangelo.

00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:12.725
The ways of drawing wrinkles and poses are derived from the past, and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.865
I hope I can draw differently by looking at things like this.

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:27.680
We have learned that these top creators were enhancing the originality of Kaiyodo.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.505
Kaiyodo’s new attempt is figures in capsules named... “Capsule Q Museum.”

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.000
What did you put a lot of effort in to spread “Capsule Q”?

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.205
We tried to make it easy to spread to users.

00:03:47.205 --> 00:03:54.055
This time around, we provided a selling point that we will release 3 series every month.

00:03:54.485 --> 00:04:04.735
The first releases of Capsule Q Museum are 3 series: “Japanese Animal Collection,” “Tyrannosaurus,” and “Taro Okamoto’s Art Piece Collection.”

00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:10.295
I used a cowardly hand.

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:27.665
Back then, “chocolate eggs” sold 120 million items in 3 years, so promoting its revival, I wanted to capture the old fans.

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:36.460
Using the Japanese monkey as a main visual, we renewed the Japanese animal series.

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:49.030
It’s just bringing back a hit from the past, and Kaiyodo had almost never used this kind of cliched strategy before.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.250
Why did you choose “capsule toys”?

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.275
Candy toys are gone.

00:04:59.275 --> 00:05:03.385
Capsule toys are not like buying figures.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.400
It’s a gamble.

00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:17.200
A capsule toy is the only platform that general customers would buy.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.210
Why do you change the Capsule Q series every month?

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:36.305
If capsule toys don’t sell 300,000, profits won’t be big.

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:41.440
Even if it sold well and you wanted to make the same amount, you can’t do it again.

00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:48.630
We make a large amount at once, so we can sell it at a reasonable price.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.010
Even if it sells well and we wanted to make more, we won’t be able to do the same.

00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:02.090
Kaiyodo’s business strategies for its new brand “Capsule Q” are

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.050
to capture old fans with the popular figures from the past, 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.630
to get general customers with capsule toys, and

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.305
to keep its popularity by changing the series every month.

00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:23.525
After this, we’re interviewing the leading company Good Smile Company which is developing the figure culture!

00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:29.030
We’re going to ask what they are aiming for with their expansion to China!
