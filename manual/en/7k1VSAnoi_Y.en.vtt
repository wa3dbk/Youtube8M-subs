[Leonardo Drew: Traveling &amp; Making]

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.300
[Vigo Gallery, London]

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.660
Okay, what kind of questions do you guys have?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.300
I mean, I don't know too much about...

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.599
Stowe School, right?

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.879
So you guys are what year? What year is this?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.519
[STUDENT] Lower 6

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.369
[DREW] Lower 6? What is that?

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.869
[MAN] That's 17, basically.

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:33.529
[DREW] Seven...

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:34.360
[MAN] 17.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.380
[DREW] Oh, okay.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.199
I actually didn't get out...

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.549
I didn't realy get outside too often.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.360
Only recently, I've been traveling

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:45.569
and moving, and taking in new information.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.500
So, I think that if you allow your

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.739
antennas to sort of, like, reach out,

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.790
you'll find... you know, like,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.879
what it is you need for this part of your
journey.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:55.919
You know?

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.189
So I've been traveling a lot.

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:03.470
Just recently, I returned from Lima, Peru,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.040
and did the Nazca Lines.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.220
Visiting, like, Cuba,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.119
and Madrid, and Switzerland,

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.960
and all those things were done back to back--

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.610
one after the other.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.600
It was a realization that I could spend

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.710
that much time out of the studio

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.310
and not miss the studio,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.580
because life was going on

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.740
and art was going on within me.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.580
The art is fed by experiences.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.960
Traveling and digesting things,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.630
and allowing these things to sort of

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.830
influence your body.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.320
I know with all certainty

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.760
that all aspects of your body is a receiver
of information.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.200
The way the light reflects off of things.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.830
The way the wind blows or doesn't blow.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.729
I mean, all these things have an effect on
you.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.760
I'm a visual artist,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.450
so it's going to find its way out, you know,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.370
into the world through my medium.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.700
It says here--

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.930
to my grandmother from me--

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.009
it says, "Towards the end of my stay in Japan..."

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.520
Wow, this is from my trip to Japan.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.300
"I'm at the airport waiting to go to Okinawa."

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.819
"It's been an interesting three months."

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.819
"First week, I was invited to dance with the
older women of the village."

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.889
"Some of them must have been pushing close
to to 110 years old..." [LAUGHS]

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.380
"But man, they could dance!" [LAUGHS]

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.900
One of the places that I always wanted to
visit was Japan.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.159
I have no idea why that was so in my body
that I had to know this place.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.079
But, in 1997, I had the opportunity to go.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.180
"This part of Japan is colored with real soul."

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.540
"I chopped sugar cane and ate pig feet." [LAUGHS]

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.400
"Now that's soul food."

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.919
When I was in Japan, I was looking at

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.010
how to make color by natural means.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.620
"The colors on the beach were surreal."

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.580
"The water was both green and blue."

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.760
"The sand: white, white, white."

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.279
That was what I went there to physically learn.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.379
But, what I was there actually spiritually
learning

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.359
was a whole other thing.

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.999
And what inevitably ended up in the work,

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.609
with certainty, had to do with some of the
papermaking

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.139
that I was studying there;

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.669
ended up in the piece that I was doing at
Fabric Workshop.

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.709
And, even though I had not come to any conclusions
when I was in Japan,

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.799
I knew that was a door that I had opened

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.739
that had to be explored.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.780
So there's always these constant opportunities
to learn.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.200
As a receiver of information,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.760
I want to take in as much as possible.

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.620
I want to learn as much as possible.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.600
And I want to give back as much as possible.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.300
If you're open, then you can continue on this
journey forever.
