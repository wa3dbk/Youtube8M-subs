00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.660
so once you have your general position and
your right hand in place

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.420
the left hand is fairly simple

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.389
what you want to do is start with your
hand hanging, shoulders down

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.900
and you're gonna bring your hand over to
the neck by bending from the elbow

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.580
you're not gonna be lifting your elbow
it's just

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.130
your elbow remains next to your body and
your gonna bring your forearm up

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.390
by bending it 
you're gonna hit about the middle part of the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.169
the neck next you have to figure out the
position of your wrist

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.160
for the most part the palm is gonna be
parallel to the neck

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.750
and you want parallel but you don't
want it 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.070
touching the neck so if you're
touching it it's going to be really

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.430
tough to play on the first string

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.700
you don't want too far away either 
a good test for that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.950
is whether you can play a bar from
wherever you are

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.070
so if I'm too far down  

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.790
then I can't really play a full bar
'cause I won't be be able to reach the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.790
six string and if I'm too close then and I 
can't play the first string so

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.790
you have to find that middle place where

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.660
no matter which string I play on I can
easily move my first finger

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.340
from a non bar to a bar

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.920
without having to make any major
adjustments the other thing to look out for

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.550
is your thumb and for a lot of the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.770
acoustic players the thumb can be
actually part of your left hand fingering

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.060
because the classical guitar neck the
fretboard is so much wider

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.210
we can't really use our thumb to play bass 
notes so it needs to remain behind the fret board

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.800
and the bar trick would actually help
with that because if you're playing a full bar

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.550
there's no way you can fit your thumb and have
it showing so 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.920
so if you're doing everything right
your thumb is not gonna

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.350
be able to come out from the back of the neck

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.080
now when you gonna move back to the
first position

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.619
your elbow has to follow 
you can't obviously you can't remain like this

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.710
you still don't wanna be lifting it 
and there's two reasons why you don't

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.810
wanna be lifting it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.360
first when it's hanging down you're more
relaxed you not holding anything up

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.670
and second because it's hanging its
weight is gonna help you

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.720
with pressing down the notes if you're

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.820
if you take it off the weight you take it
out of the equation

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.980
then all of the heavy lifting is left
for the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.620
the thumb here and that's just going to be
really tough you wanna

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.470
have your elbow help out your thumb so it can
get a bit of a break

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.360
so once you figure that out have your

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.049
elbow hanging and be able to play a bar chord

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.970
no matter where you are so you can play
a scale for example 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.190
you need to be able to do it with 
the bar and without it so

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.060
and doesn't matter whether you're gonna
switch in the middle or not

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.090
it's shouldn't really alter your 
left hand position

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.980
once you have those basics down then
everything else

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.290
is gonna be adjusted they're obviously
going to be some really

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.400
awkward and unusually shaped chords that
you won't be able to hold your hand

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.379
straight just to get the note 
those will be the exceptions

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.299
to the bar rule 
and everything else will follow that

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.750
I hope that helps with positioning of the
guitar later lessons we'll go in to more

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.060
details on different techniques and we'll
talk about the specific technique

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.980
in each lesson 
thank you for watching
