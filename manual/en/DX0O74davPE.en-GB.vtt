00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.700
Being a Time Lord can be a lonely existence.
Travelling through all of space and time in

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.379
your TARDIS,
Saving humanity every now and then,

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:07.589
Playing the recorder (or guitar) when you
get a bored.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.510
Which is why any good Doctor needs a firm
but friendly companion to keep them company-

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.120
and on the straight and narrow
-as he bounces around through time and space.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.510
But being a companion isn’t easy,
there’s a whole list of things you have

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.620
to do, for example:
Asking all the questions,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.740
staring in awe-struck wonder at EVERYTHING,
twisting ankles,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.660
screaming,
telling the Doctor he’s wrong,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.590
wandering off,
hitting Daleks with baseball bats,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.539
having timey wimey babies,
dying,

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.300
not dying,
and generally making the Doctor a better person.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.920
And that’s not to mention the bonkers family
life you’ve left behind.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.239
To find out how best to manage life aboard
the TARDIS, we spoke to current companion,

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.920
Clara. A.k.a. Jenna Coleman.
What’s been your most memorable moment on

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.450
the programme so far?
Oh my goodness, there are so many.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.510
There are so many in and out of the show.
I think the World Tour was obviously quite

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.810
a huge moment for the show. Obviously the
50th.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.160
Tom Baker coming on set. A big moment.
For me a big defining moment is always the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.259
TARDIS on the clouds and the spiral staircase.
That image for me is quite a striking, strong

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.969
and I think it’s quite close to the heart.
Clara and the Doctor’s relationship is a

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.690
complex one, with the two of them sometimes
at odds with one another.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.430
How do you view this relationship?
I view it as an unlikely relationship. Which

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.040
I really like.
Because like, you kind of wouldn’t put the

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.490
two together but yet in a way they’re so
similar in a way.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.139
And they connect on a certain level.
Yet they aren’t afraid to challenge each

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.920
other. To not get on. To kind of call each
other out.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.609
Yet they’re so bonded.
So it’s not- it’s a really. It’s a really

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.200
complicated relationship.
But a really deep one I think.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.810
It can be fatherly daughterly at times.
It can be her dealing with a toddler at other

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.619
times
They equal, they’re on a equal level friends.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.229
It’s her being the social mediator for him.
It’s him kind of reigning her in as well.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.049
So it’s a wonderfully strange and charming
relationship I think.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.790
How do you feel when you see people cosplay
Clara and also when you see outfits that haven’t

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.090
even been seen on screen yet?
I love it!

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.620
I love the effort people go to. I have to
say it’s really flattering for a start.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.810
But also just to see the detail and how much
effort people go to. It is a really ace feeling

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.600
actually.
To look at- to see loads of girls actually.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.040
I have to say like recently doing conventions
and things like that I’ve been really flattered

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.060
by the amount of like young girls
that have seemed to have taken to Clara and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.870
that’s pretty nice.
Why do you think Clara continues to travel

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.470
with the Doctor even though it’s really
dangerous?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.620
Because I think once you’ve been through-
Once you’ve looked at or a tiny look at

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.140
the possibilities of time and space, like
how could you ever go back?

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.370
Ther’s er- He’s kind of opened up this
er-

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.361
Crack of what the universe can offer and I
think once you’ve had a taste of it, it

00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:03.970
would be very hard to go back to normality
And I think that’s going to be a huge problem

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.300
for her.
A little bit addictive.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:15.140
Very addictive, I imagine. Very hard to give
up I’m sure.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.940
Hello, I am Captain Derek Latimer and I am
UNIT’s Head of Risk Management and Workforce

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.940
Safety. In this module…
The Doctor

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.819
During your time here at UNIT, you my find
that the planet is invaded by extra terrestrials.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.870
That’s aliens to you normal folk.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.069
If this happens, you may be asked to call
Principal Scientific advisor to UNIT, The

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.069
Doctor.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.010
That is THE Doctor. Not YOUR Doctor. Very
important difference.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.050
Ensure you take note of the number on your
screen now.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.910
Now sometimes, the Doctor may call upon UNIT
for help.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.620
Captain Mugambo is about to get a very important
phone call.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.640
Urgent call m’am relayed directly from HQ.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640
Who is it?

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640
It’s the Doctor.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640
Question.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.680
What you would do, would you now:

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.380
A. Ignore the call

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.510
B. Run away screaming

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.340
C. Take the call and notify your commanding
officer

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.340
You have chosen to ignore the call. You are
now a slave to a mighty alien power. All hail

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.269
the great intelligence. Well done.

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.349
The correct answer was C. Take the call and
notify your commanding officer.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.449
Just as Captain Mugambo has done.

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:35.969
Hold on to your pants chaps. This is classified
information. The Doctor is an Alien.

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.300
From time to change he may change his appearence.
Don’t know why. We don’t know how. And

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.660
it’s a pain to print out all those ID cards.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.629
So to make sure you know you’re talking
with THE Doctor, here are some things you

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:49.629
can try.

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:51.370
This blue box. Don’t go in.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.729
He has two hearts. If possible, place both
hands on his chest to check.

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.169
Unless of course he has regenerated into a
woman. In that case, it’s probably not cricket.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.680
He usually carries a screwdriver. It may look
like a toy available for £11.99 at all good

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.639
retailers. But believe me, it’s not.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.159
He usually travels with a companion. But I’ve
been assured it’s not romantic.

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.960
And finally, all hell follows in the Doctor’s
wake.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.169
Be prepared to run and make sure you fill
in your risk assessment on ‘Slips and Trips

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.749
Whilst Fleeing from Alien Hoards’.

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:34.309
Congratulations on completing your training.
Remember that the Doctor is classified information.

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:40.490
So if this has been leaked and you are not
a member of UNIT then forget everything you’ve

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.530
just heard immediately.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.000
We know where you live.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.599
And if you’re lucky enough to meet the man
himself, don’t forget. Salute.

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:48.599
Dismissed.

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:49.979
So what do you think, brisket for lunch?

00:05:49.979 --> 00:06:04.309
So it’s been ages since we’ve done Cosplayer
of the Week so we thought we’d do one now!

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:05.659
Our cosplayer of the week is…

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:11.760
Tom and his sister Victoria as the TARDIS
and all thirteen doctors at once! See if you

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.770
can spot an item from each – they’re all
in there!

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.770
Fantastic work!

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.159
Also, we should talk about Mission Dalek!
That’s your chance to tell the story of

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.870
how the Doctor met the Daleks at the start
of Series 9.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.999
Head over to bbc.co.uk/doctorwho for full
details and advice.

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.419
This week’s annotation attack is dedicated
to some of our favourite Mission Dalek submissions.

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.889
Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got my own
mission Dalek to be getting on with!

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.449
See you next time!

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.680
SMALL HUMAN FEMALE SIGHTED ON LEVEL 3

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.379
WHO YOU CALLING SMALL? YOU’RE NOT EVEN THE
RIGHT DALEK!

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:45.199
Actually, I am quite small. I’m the 5”
Character Options figure, available from all

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.199
good retailers!

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.199
EXTERMINATE!

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:47.799
Right, where’s my baseball bat?
