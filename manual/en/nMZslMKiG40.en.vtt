Hey, Jay with Rocky Mountain.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.000
Today we're going to give you some tips on installing an FMF pipe.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.660
This bike is the CRF 450, 2013.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.980
Very similar to what you would do on any of the '09 - '13 CRF 450s.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.340
Pretty simple deal - FMF, it's a very nice quality pipe and we're going to install it in this bike right now.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.540
We'll to start by removing our seat and two side number panels.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.420
Now we're going to loosening the stock clamps. There's three of them.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.670
One at the mid-pipe and then one of each of the tail pipes.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.680
Remove the mounting bolt, and the mufflers will come off.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.680
They have a stock gasket that holds them fairly snug, and you just work them right out.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.580
We're going to do the same thing to the other side.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.600
So you can remove the mud flap by two simple screws with a Phillips screwdriver.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.980
You probably don't have to. It's a whole lot easier with it off and out of the way.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.940
So after removing all the mid-pipe mounts, we can remove the whole mid and tail section.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.280
The stock clamp is a little tight-fitting in between the shocks, so you have to wiggle it through to get it out.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.900
With a 12mm T-handle you can remove the two nuts right at the cylinder head.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.260
Okay, so the stock flange can sometimes get a little bit bent, and so it can be difficult

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.780
to pull off of the stock studs.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.619
You might need to pry it a little bit. The stock gasket is still there, it's a crushed brass washer.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.619
It still looks to be in good shape, so we'll just re-use that gasket.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.960
Okay, so at this point it can be good to get the spring started on the flange before you put it on.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.960
It can be difficult to get them started sometimes, and sometimes they want to fall off on you.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.139
So you want to kind of work them in there.

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:09.940
Get your nuts just barely started or so, and then you can pull the springs to get them

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.400
hooked onto the head pipe.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.920
You hold it in place while he tightens up the two nuts.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.620
And you just want to get them about three quarters tight at this point just

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.320
so you can get everything started and lined up.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.240
So we're not going to tighten them all the way down.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.180
If you tighten them all the way down, you probably won't be able to line up your mid and tail pipes. 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.950
And now we just tighten right here.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.670
You don't want to over-tighten cause you can bend this aluminum flange pretty easily.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.500
It doesn't need a lot of pressure. Just get it snug and make it even on both.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.100
You can see that there's an even number of threads sticking out from each side,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.940
and you kind of make it even on both sides.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.880
Go back and forth between the two different sides as you tighten it up.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.760
With the FMF there's no gasket in between, it's just a metal to metal slip fit.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.320
So you've just got to make sure you can just wiggle it on into place,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.520
and then you'll line up your mid-mount and get that bolt started and you just want to

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.000
get it maybe halfway, three quarters of the way started so you can still work with everything else.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.200
After the mid-section the tailpipes, they just drop right on. 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.240
Just slide them on and use your stock bolts.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.120
Pretty simple deal in this case. When there are other bolts required FMF will supply the other bolts,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.930
but in this case all the stock bolts are repainted and used.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.440
You want to push the cans as far forward as you can usually and then tighten up.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.760
We're going to start at the back. Now we are going to tighten these all the way and move

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.520
our way forward.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.120
So we're going to tighten up both tail sections, mufflers, and then tighten up the midsection.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.700
And then tighten up our head nuts.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.780
So that's about all there is to install a set of FMF pipes on your CFR 450.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.710
Pretty simple deal. You can pick them up at rockymountainatvmc.com.
