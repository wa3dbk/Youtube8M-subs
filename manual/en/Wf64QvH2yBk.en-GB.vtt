00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.800
They currently hold
the national kapa haka title

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.840
for both primary
and secondary levels,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.880
and now Te Wharekura
o Rakaumangamanga

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.920
prepares to take the stage

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.560
of the Tainui secondary
schools competition.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.520
Our reporter Pere Wihongi
spent the day with them.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.920
Even though they hold
the national title,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.120
the pressure is felt more
when standing back home.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.120
The pressure doesn't change
for the teams

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.840
who will stand this weekend.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.960
We feel the pressure every time.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.160
They've been practising
for several weeks.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.400
It's been long, so long!

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.280
We've been focusing on the goal,
a journey soon to be over.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.640
There have been ups and downs,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.440
but at the end of the day,
they'll be ready for this Saturday.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.520
But behind all the practicing,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.280
the group looks
at dedicating themselves.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.680
Such as the passing of their
patriarch, Ned Koopu.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.160
We still miss Ned.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.120
It has only been a week
since his passing

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.520
and our thoughts
are with the Koopu family.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.920
He used to be a teacher
at our school.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.960
He also helped compose
'He aha tenei?',

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.640
a popular song at the school.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.040
So Tama Te Rerewa
is mentioned in our choral

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.720
to honour the love he had for the
school and the people of Huntly.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.920
And it's only in addition
to the final goal.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.880
According to the group,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.960
they are focussing on themselves
to achieve their own goals.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.840
Holding fast onto the songs
and history and all its meaning.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.240
And if we can accomplish that,
we can do it.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.800
Putting their trust
in the words of Potatau;

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.000
a nibble that's hooked
these determined students.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.040
Hold fast the truth,
faith and love.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:53.440
That's the school slogan
that will guide us into the future.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.560
Good luck to all the kids, teachers,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.840
parents and families that will be
attending this weekend's event.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.120
This Saturday,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.080
of the Tainui regionals
will be at Claudelands.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.200
Pere Wihongi, Te Karere.
