Welcome to Chicago

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.030
What I really like from Chicago 
is it’s a beautiful city, 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.290
it’s modern city, 
I really like it. 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.300
Chicago I think you can do everything. 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.460
It’s awesome!

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.970
I love to study here in Kaplan because
it’s in downtown, it’s the perfect location.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.260
I get to college by overground train, 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.350
I love it because you can have 
a good view of Chicago 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.740
it’s awesome! 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.270
Teachers are very professional, 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.710
it’s friendly so you just feel like 
you’re learning everyday,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.890
I really like it! 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.540
We only hire the most qualified teachers, 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.640
our teachers also have international 
experience which we feel is very valuable.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.710
I love the way that they teacher 
here in Kaplan

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.090
because they can teach you 
and you can have fun at the same time.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.440
They treat you like you’re a unique
student in the classroom.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.390
they are really nice person.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.310
The facilities there’s a lot to offer, 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.800
we have several computer labs where
students can check their email,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.340
have access to internet of course, 
there’s also an extensive library 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.430
for students to check out resources 
to study before or after class. 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.470
Yes of course I go shopping in Chicago 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.040
especially at the Magnificent Mile, 
it’s one of my favourite places to go. 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.670
You have many many stores, 
I really love it.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.770
The ‘Bean’ is one of the most interesting
sculptures in Chicago. 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.810
You can enjoy just sitting in front of 
the ‘Bean’ you know it’s reflected.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.180
It’s really fun, 
I really like it. 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.830
You can go by boat trip, it’s awesome. 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.610
You can see all around the river, 
they have all the history 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.410
about the buildings. 
The guy in the boat trip is very informative

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.840
and you can learn a lot of thing
about the city.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.960
My English has improved in a big way 
because when I arrived here 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.160
I couldn’t make a conversation with somebody,
but now I can speak as well, 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.530
I can listen very well 
so it’s awesome. 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.880
You can improve a lot.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.030
I worked at Kaplan for many years now 
and I’ve seen a lot of students 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.930
who come on their first day 
and they’re feeling a little bit nervous 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.320
and it’s really exciting for me 
to have the opportunity to see them, 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.950
you know, grow so much and become
so independent over time, 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.750
and really exciting to see them 
improve their English

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.490
sometimes even over a short 
period of time.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.350
I feel great to be here in Chicago. 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.310
I am enjoying the city, 
I am enjoying the school. 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.330
To come here at Kaplan, 
I feel like it’s the best thing I ever did.
