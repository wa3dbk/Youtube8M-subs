00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.560
Seeking the secret of a beautifully lush landscape
that gets the whole neighborhood talking?

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.309
It's as simple as choosing the right plants.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.620
These five, easy-care shrubs will fill your
yard with handsome foliage and colorful flowers.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.670
Our first pick is Sweet Summer Love Clematis.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.760
Sweet Summer Love is a well-behaved version
of the famously easy Sweet Autumn Clematis.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.940
But as its name implies, it blooms in the
summer.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.470
And its flowers are violet, instead of plain
white.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.100
With its delicious cherry vanilla fragrance,
it is the prettiest, most foolproof clematis

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.560
you can grow.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.309
Try pairing Sweet Summer Love clematis with
a tidy Boxwood, like North Star, or Sprinter,

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.330
for a cottage, yet classic, look.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.110
Tiny Wine Ninebark is a whole lot of plant,
in a little package.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.649
It has the same rich red leaves and pretty
pink flowers as other Ninebarks, but it reaches

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.519
just three to four feet tall so it's easy
to add to your landscape perennial beds, or

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.249
try it in a container.

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:12.509
And because it was developed from Summer Wine,
the most disease resistant Ninebark available,

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.189
it looks fabulous all summer long.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.499
The dark foliage of Tiny Wine is the perfect
companion to the fresh greens of Limelight

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.759
or Little Lime Hydrangea.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.039
If the bigger, the better, describes your
floral attitude, put Let's Dance Diva!

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.179
Hydrangea at the top of your shopping list.

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.829
Let's Dance Diva! has the biggest flowers
of any re-blooming hydrangea.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.350
Yes, that's right!

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.859
A re-blooming hydrangea.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.579
With individual florets spanning over three
inches across.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.029
Flowers can be a delicate pink or an enticing
lilac depending on your soil.

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:52.340
It looks great both ways.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.810
Let's Dance Diva! is a real show stopper.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.099
But, she'll be glad to share the stage with
a pretty companion like Snow Princess Lobularia

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:01.969
sweet alyssum.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.249
Bloomerang Dark Purple Lilac is the newest
re-blooming lilac.

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:11.280
It's just like the original Bloomerang, but
with deep purple blooms that add drama and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.170
sweet fragrance to your garden in spring,
late summer, and autumn.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.500
For the best repeat performance, give the
plant a light trim after its spring bloom.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.450
Because Bloomerang lilac takes a break in
early summer between its blooming periods,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.470
it's best paired with a low-growing rose like
Oso Easy Lemon Zest, which will begin to bloom

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.990
as the lilac winds down.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.360
For a versatile shrub that blooms like crazy,
and asks almost nothing in return, try Fire

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.080
Light Hydrangea.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.490
Everyone can appreciate this showy and easy
to grow panicle or PG hydrangea.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.690
Fire Light has huge clusters of flowers that
start off-white and turn ruby red.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.310
And, it blooms every year, no matter what
the weather.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.420
Even in chilly zone three.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.870
For a beautiful display from spring through
fall, try planting Chardonnay Pearls Deutzia

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.060
at the base of Fire Light Hydrangea.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.700

thirty varieties of Proven Winners flowering
