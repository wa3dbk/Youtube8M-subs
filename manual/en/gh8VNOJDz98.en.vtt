00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.600
He saw a dead crow, in a drain,
near the post office

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
He saw an old man, gasping for air
and a baby barely able to breathe in a crowded morning clinic

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.700
This land is so rich
why should we suffer like this?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I want clean air
for my grandchildren

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I want the damned fools
to leave the forest alone

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I want the trees to grow, the rivers run free
and the earth covered with grass

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.900
Let the politicians plan how 
we may live in dignity.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now and always.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
He saw the homeless living on the streets helpless near government offices

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.500
He saw the society
accusing the poor as being lazy

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.800
He saw the rich, robbing from the poor
even when they were born unlucky, born with closed doors

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
He saw university students
always seeking for academic improvements

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
trying to be lucent
trying to be brilliant

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but when they graduate

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.600
when they are conferred the graduation scroll
they live a life being trolled

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.700
working a lifetime to pay back the study loan

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This land is so rich
why, should we suffer like this?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.700
I want clean transparent economy
for my children

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.700
I want the corrupted fools
to leave this country alone

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I want the youth to grow

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.200
the society free from hegemony
and the country living in social racial tolerance

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Let the youth! Not politicians!

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
plan how we may live in dignity

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now and always.
