MILES O'BRIEN: The prickly pear cactus salad. It's a delicacy

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.470 position:88%
in Mexico. But it seems these cacti have uses beyond the

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.830 position:83%
culinary, cleaning up oil spills and purifying water.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.670 position:89%
NORMA ALCANTAR: You can see how it's really easy to grow.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.730 position:83%
MILES O'BRIEN: With support from the National Science

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.370 position:86%
Engineer Norma Alcantar is using the gooey flesh of the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.330 position:81%
cactus, called mucilage, to clean up polluted water.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.170 position:97%
Her interest in green chemistry came from her grandmother, who

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.970 position:94%
told her of using cacti to clean river water in rural Mexico

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.900
as a young woman.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.170 position:97%
NORMA ALCANTAR: They will take the cactus plant, but they will

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.100 position:92%
cut it, they will boil it, and they will use the water from

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.170 position:56%
that preparation to clean the water.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.100 position:94%
MILES O'BRIEN: When Alcantar tested that process in her lab,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.500
she was amazed at the results.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.330 position:86%
NORMA ALCANTAR: I couldn't believe it. I was like, "Are

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.130 position:97%
you serious, it really works?" because I thought I will see an

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.670 position:94%
effect, but I didn't think I will see an effect so dramatic.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.830 position:80%
MILES O'BRIEN: These biobeads are made of mucilage.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.270 position:70%
NORMA ALCANTAR: This is a controlled, initial

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.330 position:97%
concentration of the metal blue dye versus the one that has been

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.800
in contact with the beads.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.470 position:89%
MILES O'BRIEN: After an oil spill, cactus goo could be an

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.670 position:86%
alternative to chemical dispersants, like those used in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.870
the Deep Water Horizon cleanup.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.900 position:86%
NORMA ALCANTAR: The same action can be done with a very

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.700 position:75%
low concentration, and makes it very sustainable

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.030
and fairly inexpensive.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.730 position:91%
MILES O'BRIEN: Alcantar did water quality tests in Haitian

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.970 position:94%
refugee camps after the 2010 earthquake, finding high levels

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.530 position:89%
of heavy metals and bacteria in the drinking water. While

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.570 position:98%
there, she kept an eye out for cacti, and they were everywhere.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.730 position:64%
NORMA ALCANTAR: This is in a gas station.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.370 position:91%
MILES O'BRIEN: Tests back at her lab confirm that mucilage

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.870 position:92%
could successfully clean the polluted water from Haiti, and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.500 position:92%
that's significant. In the future, cacti could be harvested

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.700 position:84%
locally to decontaminate drinking water quickly, after

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.970 position:89%
disaster strikes. Using a natural product to clean water,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.800 position:94%
it's a sharp idea. After all, there's no reason to get stuck

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.500
on the old way of doing things.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.000 position:59%
For Science Nation, I'm Miles O'Brien.
