00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.950
Before I make my first cut, I like to take
a piece of masking tape and put it across

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.910
the backside of the board so it covers about
three quarters of an inch. And this is going

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:26.689
to help; this is going to help keep the board
from tearing out and getting a real torn up

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.060
cut. As you can see, this edge of the board
right here that was cut on a table saw with

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.090
no tape. And you don't want to have this rough
edge here when you cut your pins, so this

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.480
piece of tape will help keep this wood from
tearing out. To make the outside pin cut,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:55.630
I'm going to put my board flush up against
the plug. Hold it firmly to the jig, and make

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:11.350
my cut. And move the board over, and set it
right down on that plug. And this is what

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.810
holds it in place to make sure that your next
cut is the same size and the same distance.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:02:17.129
This is what we have when we're done. This
is going to be a front piece on the box. It

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.019
could be side piece, it could be a front piece,
but whatever, you're going to need two of

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.620
your pieces cut like this, and two of your
pieces are going to be cut like this. This

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.829
is the one that has the shoulder instead of
the pin here, so it fits inside, like that.

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:43.639
So to make this cut, I'm just going to flip
my scrap over, and get the other half inch

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:50.139
square block that I cut that we talked about
before, and put it right up, next to this,

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:55.739
butt it up there, like we did in the beginning.
Slide this board up next to it, and make sure

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.439
they're firmly against each other, and then
we're going to make that cut.
