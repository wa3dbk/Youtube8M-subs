00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.490
Now in this segment we are going to show you
all the movements of the cameras. To begin

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.450
with we have got one of our wheels turned
incorrectly on our tripod so the easiest way

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.100
to control that is to turn your control wheel
until it locks back in place with the other

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.211
two and moves with them. Now on this particular
tripod there is a control to where you can

00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:26.869
move all three wheels at once or just one
wheel at a time making the other two stationary.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.660
Now you usually don't use that unless you
are having to make a smooth semi circle with

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.740
the camera. Now with this particular camera
the control wheel is located right underneath

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.290
the camera. With this you can control where
it is going. It is kind of like the steering

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.829
wheel of a car. It will let you pull it left
to right, forward and back, whichever way

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.199
you steer it, just like a car like I was saying.
Now just above the control wheel we have if

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:06.250
you can see in here, we have our pan friction
and lack. This lever here is a lock pulling

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:14.080
it to the left, locks it so you can't get
it to move. You never want to have it locked

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.780
during a show. The friction here is basically
the friction like this and it has a lot of

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.860
play in it so it is way too easy to move.
You are going to want to tighten up that friction

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.500
so you have a little bit of force against
it just like that. You don't want to have

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.210
too much otherwise it looks jerky when you
are moving the camera. Now on the other side

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.560
here we have our tilt lock which if you turn
it as you are looking at it to the left hand

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.560
side and lock it so it won't tilt. You always
want to have it to the right hand side during

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.710
a show or any operation that you are doing.
Now on the other side of the camera is your

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.640
tilt friction which is just like the pan friction
all it is basically is now you turn it in

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.830
or out depending on how loose you want it.
This is way too loose see how it is moving

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.000
on its own. You want to have it just tight
enough so that way when you move it you feel

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.170
a little friction against you.
