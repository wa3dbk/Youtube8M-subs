00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.179
&gt;&gt;Ankerberg: Alright.

00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:08.950
Two important verses that, after the rapture
and before the second coming, talking about

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.160
this time of tribulation.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.250
The apostle Paul writes, “For God did not
appoint us [as Christians] to wrath, but to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.890
obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ
who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.400
we should live together with Him.”

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.050
And in Revelation 3:10, God tells the apostle
John, “Because you have kept my command

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.340
to persevere, I will also keep you from the
hour of trial which shall come upon the whole

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.630
world to test those who dwell on the earth.”

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.300
What do those verses mean?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.579
&gt;&gt;DeYoung: Well, those are two perfect proof
texts that the rapture is the next event before

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.360
the wrath of God is laid out on the world.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.460
God has to bring the earth and all earth dwellers
into submission so He can give His son Jesus

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.809
Christ the 1000 year kingdom at the time of
His second coming.

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.850
In 1 Thessalonians 5:9, which is the verse
you mentioned, he is now into sending a letter

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.310
to the people of Thessalonica.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.780
He had been there three weeks earlier; he
had led them to the Lord; he taught them about

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.090
the rapture of the church.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.780
They were concerned that the rapture had happened.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.930
He said, “Wait a minute.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.430
The rapture has not happened, because we are
not in the day of the Lord.”

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.869
That’s a very important phrase.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.760
The day of the Lord is any time in history
when God intercedes in the affairs of man

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.030
personally on the earth.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.049
And the day of the Lord starts after the rapture.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.150
The rapture, that’s what Paul is teaching
us there, the rapture is not a part of the

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.160
day of the Lord.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.590
It proceeds the day of the Lord.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.170
Over there in Revelation 3:10 he says, “I
will keep you from.”

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.600
Now, notice the grammatical statement there.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.240
“I will keep you from;” not take you out
of.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.200
The Greek grammar is “I will keep you from,”
not “take you out of” that terrible time

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.159
of testing, or the tribulation period.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.740
The church is not going to be in the tribulation
period.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.090
We, therefore, suffer no condemnation of the
Lord.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.179
He’s done everything to purify us, to take
us into the heavenliness with Him.
