00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.888
 

00:00:06.888 --> 00:00:07.910
Hey, everybody.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.010
I'm J-Mac, and I'm going to
show y'all all about our shifter

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.030
boot and bezel kit for
'87 and '93 Mustang.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.400
To start out, you'll want
to remove your shifter knob.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.360
Simply unscrew it off
the shifter handle.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.790
Then, grab hold of
your shifter bezel.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.700
Pull it up off the
console, and then

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.862
remove the shifter boot
off the shifter handle.

00:00:30.862 --> 00:00:33.320
Then you'll want to go ahead
and remove your shifter handle

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.990
because the console has
got to come out of the way.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.060
For more information on
removing your console,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.450
check out our video on
latemodelrestoration.com.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.700
I'm going to go ahead and
get all this out of the way,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.408
and we'll move onto
the lower shift boot.

00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:49.880
 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.380
Now with the console
out of the way,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.170
you have access to your
lower shifter boot.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.870
Go ahead and remove
the four 5/16

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.690
headed or 8 millimeter headed
bolts that retain the shifter

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.816
boot to the transmission
tunnel of the car.

00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:21.180
[DRILLING]

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.300
Now if you're still running
the stock shifter, or something

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.560
like a triax, your
shifter boot should still

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.290
be pretty much intact,
and you can just

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.540
lift it up off the tunnel.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.470
Now with shifters
like this PRO-5.0,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.390
you have to trim the boot to
get it around the shifter.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.516
So you just have to pry the
boot from around the ring

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:41.865
of the shifter, and then you
can pull the whole boot assembly

00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:43.770
up away from the
transmission tunnel.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.410
Now from the factory,
you've got three staples

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.070
that will hold this rubber
piece to the metal trim ring.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.710
Just grab a straight
razor, and make a couple

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.330
little cuts, right where
those staples are at.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.370
That way, you can just
pull this rubber piece off.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.460
You won't have to
restaple it or anything,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.590
because the bolts will
actually hold it into place.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.889
That metal trim ring
just acts to spread out

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:14.170
the load of the bolts over the
entire rubber piece evenly.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.070
I can just pull that
rubber off of there.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.520
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.260
And grab your new boot.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.195
Line it up correctly.

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:28.070
 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.150
And then you can just drop
it back down into place.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.050
Now with the PRO-5.0 shifter, or
similar after-market shifters,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.320
you will have to cut
out that center section.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.780
With a stock shift, something
like a triax or even

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.170
our SVE shifter, you do not
have to cut the boot at all.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.300
It just simply goes
down over the shifter.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.590
Now if you need new
hardware because yours

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.720
is missing, rusted,
cross-threaded,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.050
we have a complete
hardware kit that

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.220
includes the speed
nuts and the bolts

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.500
to attach your lower
shift boot to the core.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.970
Now, I'm going to go ahead
and finish putting this on.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.810
Get the console back
in, and then we'll

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.510
show you how to put together
your new upper shifter boot

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.840
and bezel.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.600
Now that we've got
our lower shifter boot

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.580
into place along
with the console,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.990
we can go ahead and work on
the upper shifter and bezel.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.390
Now our 5.0 Resto
shifter bezel comes out

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.650
of the Ford original tooling.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.040
It even has the Ford
oval and the part number

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.740
cast into the back.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.370
And our new shifter boot?

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.980
Well, that's made out of leather
to replace the vinyl shifter

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.300
boot that your car came with.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.600
To install, slide your shifter
boot up into the new bezel,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.650
just like this.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.690
You want to have your large side
facing forward to the right,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.620
and then have the angle of
the shift boot pointing back.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.030
Flip it over, and you've got
four plastic tabs on the back

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.000
that you wind up with the
holes in the shifter boot.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.400
And we include the
needed retaining clips

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.980
to keep that shifter
boot in place.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.105
Go ahead and push those
down over the plastic tabs.

00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:04.212
 

00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:05.670
That way, your
shifter boot doesn't

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.447
go moving around whenever
you're shifting gears.

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:10.530
It takes a little bit of
pressure to get these on.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.000
 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.839
And then, the
plastic shifter bezel

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.790
also comes with
new retaining clips

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.080
that help it snap
into the console.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.850
Those need to be
installed as well.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:34.750
And they just simply push
into place, just like that.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.480
 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.310
Now, you can go ahead and
slide your new shifter boot

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.770
and bezel into place.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.322
Snap it into your console.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:54.855
Slide the shifter boot down
over the shifter handle.

00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:58.320
Then grab your shifter
knob, and screw it back on.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.720
 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.475
Go ahead and orient
your shifter pattern.

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:06.550
 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.330
Get it tight to where everything
is in the right place,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.760
and you've just fully installed
a new shifter boot and bezel

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.110
and a lower shifter boot
on your '87 or '93 Mustang.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.860
