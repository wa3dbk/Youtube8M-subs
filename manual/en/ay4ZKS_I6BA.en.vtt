Hello there unboxers!

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.300
This is Sakis Karpas from GameOver.gr in another episode of Unboxholics.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.300
Today we will take a look at K310 Washable Keyboard by Logitech.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.200
A keyboard that loves a wash.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.000
The retail package is simple and it's decorated in the usual colors of Logitech.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.000
The features of the keyboard are written on the back in multiple languages.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.200
We really want to see the keyboard, so let's open it!

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.500
Aside from the keyboard, we find two user manuals that are not important right now.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.350
The Washable Keyboard connects to a PC via a USB Cable

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.350
which has a cap for protection during the cleaning procedure.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.000
The K310 is a usual keyboard with a low-profile, framed key design.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
K310's design is simple and modern at the same time while the volume level of typing is very low.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.350
K310 features laser printed, UV coated keys, that won't fade after a wash.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.200
What we liked the most out of K310 is the feeling that the keys hover.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.000
More and more companies use this technique for their lifestyle keyboards.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.300
On the back side, Logitech added drainage holes for easy drying.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.100
Also, a brush with a Logitech Logo is attached on the back of the keyboard for a deeper cleaning process.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.100
Of course, K310 has 8° Tilt legs for comfortable typing.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.200
Printed on the back are also the cleaning instructions.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.400
It's not that we don't trust Logitech, but we decided to put K310 to the test.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.000
What's better than spilled coke on a keyboard?

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.370
And some ketchup...

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.500
Washable specs: Only Hand washable Max. 30cm of water (36 wash cycles of 5 minutes at 50 degrees)

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.050
K310 left us speechless.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.000
The drying process was fast and the keyboard is now fully functional.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.300
Logitech K310 Washable Keyboard is priced at €49.99

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.000
Overall, it is an extremely resistant keyboard against dirt with simple and modern design that can satisfy everyone's basic needs.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.200
Big office and stores owners should add K310 on their "To Buy" list. As well as clumsy people...

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.000
