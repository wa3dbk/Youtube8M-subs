Hi, I'm Dowell, at the Firehouse Car Wash.
We're teaching you how to wash your car like

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.250
a pro. Now, what we want to do right now,
is focus on drying the vehicle. We've now

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.219
washed it, we've rinsed it, we've let water
flow over it, got our wheels and tires taken

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.950
care of. One of the things we want to do in
drying the car, it's important we get right

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.939
on this. Don't run in and use the bathroom,
or the telephone, or jump on your cell phone,

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.830
because we've got to get the water off before
it dries. Water has minerals, it has deposits

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.259
in it, that are going to stay on your car,
and they're going to leave that film on it,

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.370
so we've got to get this off quickly, so what
we want to do, is we want to dry the car.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.950
Again, proper towels is critical. If you drop
the towel on the ground, get a new one. Don't

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.300
use the same towel. We want to get this towel,
and we want to wipe and dry the car, in the

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.730
direction that air flows over the car. Unlike
the Karate Kid, this is not a wax on, wax

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.441
off, where we're going in circular motions.
Just make real simple strokes, back and forth

00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:06.470
across the car to dry it, and frequently flip
the towel, to get a clean dry area. One of

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.100
the things we've found, is that if we have
a towel that's a little bit damp, it's easier

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.400
to dry the car. I know that sounds crazy,
but a dry towel tends to push water around.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.620
A slightly damp towel becomes a lot more absorbent,
so we can move across the vehicle much quicker,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.360
and we go back and forth, in the direction
of air flow. Now, when it comes to the grill,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.930
other areas, of course, you're going to have
to just, get into the nooks and crannies.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.030
Of course, my favorite secret is coming up,
which was the compressed air we talked about.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.870
After I've done all I can with my towel, I'm
going to grab that compressed air. I'm getting

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.390
one of my friends here, to grab that for me,
and I'm going to jump in, and everything that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.920
I couldn't quite get to. If I blow this back
out, I'm going to get a few more streaks,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.700
a few more water that runs out, so after I've
done that, I go back over. I can get those

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.090
final drops out, and make things look great.
Now, there is another part to drying the car,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.709
so stay with me, and we'll run over to that,
in the next segment.
