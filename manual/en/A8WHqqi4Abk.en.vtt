00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:08.559
I'm not usually a guy who says Me! Me! Me!

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.226
But to be a good fighter, you have to try to be number one.

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:18.012
You have to realize that tons of people are watching you.

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:24.923
I need an open mind to better control myself.

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:28.683
I'm focusing on that now.

00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:32.703
Yuya Yamamoto, 25-year old K-1 fighter!
Yuya Yamamoto, 25-year old K-1 fighter!

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.848
Even when I try to be objective it doesn't seem real.

00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:53.194
Of course, there's no doubt that I've been lucky.

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:56.056
But the fact remains that I won and I'm still here.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.185
I'll accept that and do my best.

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:04.486
Some people are just happy to be on TV.

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:09.200
But I want to see everyone's happy face when I win.

00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:22.438
I hate the way I fight now.

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:26.169
Even when I get hit, I go forward and hit back.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:32.631
But that's the best way to win.

00:01:35.647 --> 00:01:38.740
I've never seen such a strong fighter.

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:55.340
Petrosyan knows that winning means not losing.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.294
He bites and I'll bite back.

00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:59.413
In a world only the both of us understand. That's cool.

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:09.983
My body is craving something sweet.

00:02:09.983 --> 00:02:13.511
I have to be patient, but I feel sorry for my body.

00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:26.656
I always fight for the people who support me. I can't forget them when I'm in the ring.

00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:33.261
Whenever I hear my entry music I can feel tears welling up.

00:02:46.084 --> 00:02:51.916
Everyone says stuff like that, so I didn't want to say that.

00:02:51.916 --> 00:02:57.788
But that's how I feel.

00:03:02.028 --> 00:03:06.631
So whether it hurts, or whether I feel embarassed, I don't care.

00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:10.351
I'm going to fight to win.
