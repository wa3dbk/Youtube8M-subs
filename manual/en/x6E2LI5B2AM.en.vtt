00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:08.870
We generally start looking at value in terms
of all the different gradations of value you

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.680
can create because everything in our real
world has a whole range of values from white

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.779
to black. And there's all these grays in between.
I first have a demonstration of a series of

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.960
charcoals that come in a variation of gray
of grays so that you could get from a light

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.989
gray all the way down to a black. It's much
harder to do this. Here's a black charcoal

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.329
and the only you can't really get really light
with this. We can we can ease it out that

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.090
way by smudging it. And you can put on more
and get a darker value. But you're never going

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:57.140
to get with just one charcoal, this whole
range. In pencil, you can normally we find

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.500
that there's between nine and twelve different
scales of value. And in this one I've done

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.830
with different pencils. Pencils have different
weights. So here's a very light pencil, the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.900
F. And that's good for making a very light
value if you want to make a very dark value

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.160
you need like a seven, eight or nine B to
get as close to black as you can get with

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.630
a pencil. Graphite is never going to be as
black as charcoal. You can see the difference.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.520
It's just not in graphite to do that. But
you can get a really nice, rich, dark with

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:44.020
an eight B. Again as with charcoal, it's very
difficult to get these very light values with

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.850
an eight. I'm working with my pencil very
lightly, and this is about as light as I can

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.780
get with an eight. And you can see compared
to the value I got with an F. It this one

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.640
is really down down about here with a three
B. So you know you can create a good range

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.550
of values with just one tool. But if you want
a complete range of values, you might want

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.200
to give yourself a couple of pencils like
a two B, a four B, and an eight B would be

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.280
a great combination.
