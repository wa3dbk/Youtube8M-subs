What the heck is anchor text?

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.290
And why is anchor text important?

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.830
That’s what we’ll answer in today’s
video.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.820
Hi, I’m Dillon with Social Media Top Team.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.189
We help business owners grow their business
to the next level by leveraging social media,

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.190
email and high performance marketing strategies.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.029
Okay, let’s take a look at what exactly
anchor text is.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.270
Here’s a good anchor text definition.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.660
Anchor text refers to the visible, clickable
text in a hyperlink.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.070
They are the words that turn your mouse cursor
into a finger-pointing hand.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.960
In modern browsers, it is often blue and underlined.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.390
For example, in this sentence, "Our online
video marketing strategy works great for getting

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.420
you new customers" online video marketing
is the anchor text for the link.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.420
Here you see the code.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.880
&lt;a href="http://socialmediatopteam.com/Online-Video-Marketing"&gt;
online video marketing &lt;/a&gt; Let's take a look

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.960
at this.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.900
Now, the anchor text once again, is online
video marketing, what happens is when someone

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:21.320
clicks on the anchor text, it takes them to
this link: socialmediatopteam.com/Online-Video-Marketing.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:30.410
So, you don't actually see the link, all you
actually see is the anchor text because the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.229
link is anchored to the anchor text.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.550
That's why they call it “anchored text”

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.340
Ok, let’s learn about anchor text’s importance
to your SEO.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.120
Search engines use this text to help determine
the topic or subject matter of the linked-to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.120
website.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.400
In this example, the link tells the search
engines that when people search for "online

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.409
video marketing", that we think that socialmediatopteam.com
is a relevant site for the term "online video

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.409
marketing".

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:08.030
If many other sites think that socialmediatopteam.com’s
page is relevant for this keyphrase and they

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.160
link to it in the same way, then top team’s
page can rank well in the search engines for

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.330
that keyphrase.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.519
Now, something important to know:

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.060
A very important ‘off page’ factor to
get high rankings in the search engines, is

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.720
having anchor text like this, from relevant
sites pointing to the specific page in your

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.730
website that’s been optimized for this keyword
in the anchor text.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.560
Yet we’ll cover how to do this, in depth,
in our next video.
