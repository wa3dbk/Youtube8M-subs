00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:16.221
The Kia Picanto's name is brilliant,
great for lame jokes.

00:00:16.607 --> 00:00:20.539
The car is nice and small.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:28.200
I can sit comfortably, but it's
cramped for taller people.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.064
The Kia Picanto
always has 5 doors.

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:38.424
3 doors is more sporty, but you
buy this car for practical transport.

00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:42.219
It's convenient for putting
kids in the back seat.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.304
The Picanto was introduced in 2004
and got a facelift in 2007.

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:54.820
It got a more happy front
with the headlights etc.

00:00:55.137 --> 00:01:01.848
Most Picantos have cool colors.
This one is hard blue.

00:01:01.848 --> 00:01:07.861
I like having color in my life,
or the car, at least.

00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:14.218
There's not much choice for engines.
There's 2 small gasolines and a diesel,

00:01:14.218 --> 00:01:18.627
of which 2 are for sale
in the Netherlands.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.350
ENGINES
gasoline, diesel

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.191
Picantos with an automatic gearbox
are rare, only 6% of those for sale.

00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:40.350
Stuff like parking sensors, heated
seats and satnav aren't commonplace.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.578
Some cars have these features, but
don't be picky with other specs.

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:51.155
There's not a wide choice.
There is for colors, however.

00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:56.271
Orange, yellow, red and blue
is available on more cars,

00:01:56.271 --> 00:02:00.613
so that's nice.
Prices start at 2,500 euros.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
PRICES
minimum, average, maximum

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.430
The reliability is OK.
There are some POIs.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.400
One is serious: a broken crankshaft.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:28.869
That's not very nice, but Kia
recognizes it and offers a warranty.

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:34.067
The Kia website says to contact
them with a problem car.

00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:39.743
The crankshaft problem
stops after 2006.

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:43.894
Bolts on the crankshaft
were too short.

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:51.955
Picantos may have stuck calipers,
or a spontaneous handbrake release.

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:56.553
The brakes warm up during driving,
cooling down when parked.

00:02:56.553 --> 00:02:59.821
They shrink, so the handbrake
may be released.

00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:02.809
Annoying when that happens next
to a canal and it rolls right in.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.110
Fuel pump contacts can go bad,
stalling the engine.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.845
It's not an expensive fix.
The last problem is rare,

00:03:11.845 --> 00:03:15.417
but it can happen:
the keys losing their memory.

00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:18.420
Then you'll have to go to the
Kia dealer to reprogram.

00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:27.043
It's not an expensive fix, so the
Picanto is mostly problem free.

00:03:27.043 --> 00:03:29.610
There's not many
recurring structural problems.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.230
There's exceptions,
but all in all they're reliable.

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:43.222
This car's color is nice, it
looks great. It's a good car.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.100
THIS CAR

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:06.400
