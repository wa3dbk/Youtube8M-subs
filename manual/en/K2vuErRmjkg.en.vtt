I think that the DCCU

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.020
aka The DC Cinematic Universe

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.260
is having some identity issues.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.780
Because I just got finished filming an episode about how much I LOVED

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:14.921
the new look at Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.880
only to then, uh, finish filming, go back online

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.654
and see these NEW photos arise

00:00:20.764 --> 00:00:22.284
from the same coverage
