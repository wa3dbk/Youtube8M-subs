00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340
Hey, hey Tessa!

00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:03.179
Tessa! Tessa!

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.880
Can you please do a hair tutorial?

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.755
How do you get your hair like that?

00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:08.525
Can you show us how you do your hair?

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:10.360
How you do your hair?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.887
Well, I'm gonna show you.

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:15.717
I will show you how to
get this beautifulness

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:17.055
on your head!

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.370
Well, if have a short, pixie cut.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.983
This video is: how to style a pixie cut.

00:00:22.983 --> 00:00:26.387
When getting your hair cut like this,

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:29.046
what I do is make sure that there's

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:31.919
a little bit of unevenness on the side.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.189
Also, what I noticed makes a
huge difference is highlights.

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:39.904
See how there's like
different colors in my hair?

00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:43.751
Because there's different
colors, it makes like,

00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:47.827
the spikes in different
hair styles stand out more.

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:50.725
So, your hair will look ten times cooler

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:52.641
if you just highlight it a little bit.

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:56.471
So, this little look
that I got going on here.

00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:57.461
See this?

00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.601
This actually,

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.302
is just the result

00:01:02.302 --> 00:01:04.402
of me waking up

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.180
after going to bed with wet hair

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:09.685
and using this hairspray.

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:14.035
It's number five freeze
hold, mega-firm control.

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:16.221
You need a lot of this stuff for this.

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.904
This is my favorite hairspray.

00:01:18.904 --> 00:01:19.737
It's the best.

00:01:19.737 --> 00:01:22.002
So, to achieve this kind of

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.817
really, really messy, almost mohawky look,

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:30.607
I'll show you how I comb it
after I go in the shower,

00:01:30.607 --> 00:01:33.182
and then I just literally go to sleep,

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:34.813
like, with one part of it up.

00:01:34.813 --> 00:01:38.330
This is actually my favorite
way to style my hair,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.214
because I just take a shower,
then go to sleep (laughs).

00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:44.914
So,

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:46.642
let me go take a shower.

00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:49.735
Hello, I am out of the shower (chuckles).

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:52.026
So, this is what my beautiful hair

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:55.542
looks like right after
I get out of the shower.

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:57.871
So, here's my comb.

00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:00.038
So, what I do is I usually

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.743
comb it down.

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:08.094
Lookin' a little emo
right now, but it's okay.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:11.068
So, if I was about to go to
sleep, what I would do is

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:13.390
I would kind of just,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.973
pick a side I want,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.820
comb it to that side,

00:02:22.454 --> 00:02:25.871
and then, while I'm sleeping,
here, let's grab a pillow.

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:27.522
So, I'll either, I'll like go like this,

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:31.945
I'll like flip it up, and
then I'll go to sleep.

00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:35.679
And then, in the morning, I'll
be like, "Oh, good morning!"

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.768
But then, it'll actually look good, okay.

00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:41.937
Also, I don't use conditioner in my hair.

00:02:41.937 --> 00:02:44.375
Again, I don't know if that
makes any kind of difference.

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.947
I like doing this rather than blow drying,

00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:50.477
but I'll show you the
blow-dried option, as well.

00:02:50.477 --> 00:02:54.983
I would just kinda, like, I'm
just kind of taking my hands

00:02:54.983 --> 00:02:58.778
and just kind of shaping it that way.

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:01.445
And like, I'll make little like,

00:03:02.992 --> 00:03:05.337
I'll just kind of scrunch
it together with my hands.

00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:06.708
It's really hard to explain.

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:10.258
So, that's just with my hands.

00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:12.413
This is just getting out of the shower,

00:03:12.413 --> 00:03:14.351
scrunching it with my hands.

00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:16.551
Next, if I'm using gel,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.280
I use this stuff.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.990
This stuff is

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.539
the best.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.287
It's Redken

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:26.387
Elastic Works 09,

00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:27.780
waving gel.

00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:31.367
So, I'll open it, I'll get a little bit,

00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:36.258
put it together, and then
I just kinda put it in

00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:38.609
with my hair.

00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:43.857
So then, I'll like, sorta
just put it up here.

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:44.690
Like that.

00:03:47.383 --> 00:03:48.324
Something like that.

00:03:48.324 --> 00:03:50.566
I'll do something like this,

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:51.399
then I'll

00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:54.566
get this stuff.

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:56.494
(can hissing)

00:03:56.494 --> 00:03:59.393
And kinda spray it into place.

00:03:59.393 --> 00:04:03.630
And then, take the
little stuff on the side,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.138
kinda go like that.

00:04:05.138 --> 00:04:07.305
(hissing)

00:04:10.092 --> 00:04:11.926
And that's one way that I'll style it

00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:15.311
and I'll style it like this
and then I'll just let it dry.

00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.410
So, let's say, I wanna use a blow dryer.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.184
Let me go get my blow dryer.

00:04:21.184 --> 00:04:22.324
(blow dryer whooshing)

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:25.907
So, I'll really just
take it from the back,

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:31.202
kinda take it in here,
hold that for a little bit.

00:04:31.202 --> 00:04:35.593
I always use my hands, I think
it looks ten times better.

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:39.676
And then, I'll take it
from this side, and go up.

00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:49.675
You see, it's kinda like
going down from this side.

00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.666
See how cool it looks?

00:05:04.594 --> 00:05:05.926
I'll hold this.

00:05:05.926 --> 00:05:07.762
Dry that a little bit, that just kinda

00:05:07.762 --> 00:05:09.845
helps the drying process.

00:05:10.965 --> 00:05:13.215
I'll like, make this go up.

00:05:15.097 --> 00:05:16.930
Again, crunch it down.

00:05:18.303 --> 00:05:23.238
With this stuff in, you can
kind of like, form your hair

00:05:23.238 --> 00:05:25.066
to how you want it.

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:26.483
Which is awesome.

00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:28.544
See?

00:05:28.544 --> 00:05:29.627
This looks...

00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:34.562
And then I'll like, just put that up.

00:05:34.562 --> 00:05:37.876
Just kinda twist it around a little bit.

00:05:37.876 --> 00:05:39.914
Just to give it a little bit of curly q's,

00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:42.997
a little bit of texture, if you will.

00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:46.826
There you go!

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:49.659
That's all there is to it, really.

00:05:53.414 --> 00:05:55.867
Now, let's see if I can Emma
Watson it from this point.

00:05:55.867 --> 00:06:00.061
Emma Watsoning it is what I
like to call when I sort of

00:06:00.061 --> 00:06:01.811
make my hair go down.

00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.806
Yeah, I can Emma Watson it at this point.

00:06:05.806 --> 00:06:08.473
(comb scraping)

00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:13.176
You can put it like more bang, like this.

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:15.123
And you can kinda just pick a side,

00:06:15.123 --> 00:06:18.212
sorta comb it to that one side.

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:21.129
Like this, and leave some bang, or,

00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:25.424
you can go back with it more.

00:06:29.366 --> 00:06:30.699
Leave less bang.

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:34.919
And kinda just leave it like that.

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.150
Or, you can even go like this

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.567
and just take a little bit from the back.

00:06:41.988 --> 00:06:44.185
I'm telling you, this magical gel,

00:06:44.185 --> 00:06:48.352
and just a little bit of
hairspray can do almost anything.

00:06:53.503 --> 00:06:55.336
This has like, a lot of product in it now,

00:06:55.336 --> 00:06:58.209
so it can kinda do whatever it wants.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.801
So, I'll end up doing something like that

00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:03.221
and then end up here.

00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:07.749
Get this bad boy, kinda just
spray it a lot in the front,

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:08.666
just 'cause

00:07:10.047 --> 00:07:11.807
we want that to stay.

00:07:11.807 --> 00:07:14.372
And a little bit on the side.

00:07:14.372 --> 00:07:15.872
A little bit here.

00:07:17.883 --> 00:07:19.716
And there you have it.

00:07:20.724 --> 00:07:23.891
The beauty, the beauty behind my hair!

00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:26.620
And that's how you do it.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.392
Peace out, guys, love ya!
