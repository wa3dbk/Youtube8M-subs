00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
You will need......

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.509
Ice, rock salt and a drink of your choice.

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.319
We used Cola.

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.690
Remember that normal salt will not work here.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.670
First off, remove the lid and remove the cylinder
from the blending chamber.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.100
Add a layer of ice...

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.480
and pour some rock salt over the top.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.300
Keep layering the ice and salt until you reach

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.400
the top.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.020
Put the cylinder back in the blending chamber
and clip the lid in to place.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.300
Flick the switch to freeze.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.600
Pour your beverage in to the square indentation,
this will ensure that the liquid goes in to

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.720
the right compartment.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.350
Keep going till the liquid reaches the max
fill line.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.040
Leave the Slushie Maker for 15 minutes or
longer depending on the consistency required.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.400
We found that after about 20 minutes the mixture
is a thick as it's going to get.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.340
Click the button to dispense, turn the dispenser
handle making sure you turn your glass to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.170
ensure it fills evenly.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.720
Whatever recipe you try just remember not
to be too shy with the rock salt.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.939
And if you're making alcoholic drinks add
your alcohol directly to the glass and not

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:46.560
the Slush Maker

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.720
So that's it.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.670
We hope this has helped if you're having difficulties.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.500
Stay tuned for future how to videos.
