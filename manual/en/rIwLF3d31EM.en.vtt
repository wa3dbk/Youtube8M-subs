00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:02.975
- I figured out what
our job is for this section.

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:04.518
We're just going
to look really fast

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:08.602
at some of the slides
that we have access

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:12.477
to online through our rock stars
at the University of Michigan.

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:16.101
This hopefully looks familiar
to you at this point.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:17.685
There's an entire section

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:19.226
on connective tissue,
but there's just

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.560
a couple that I wanted
to show up close and personal.

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:25.975
First of all, check out
this bad boy.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.894
This is actually skin.

00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:30.975
We're going to look at skin
in a lot more detail.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.975
Skin lines a space.
And so this, what kind of tissue

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.643
are you going to expect
to see right here?

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.727
Some kind of epithelial tissue.

00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:41.935
Is that where you're
going to look

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:45.768
to find your connective tissue?
No, no, no.

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:48.975
Because your connective tissue
doesn't line a space.

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.268
Holy, what a mess.
Seriously, look at this.

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:55.310
What?
This is crazy.

00:00:55.334 --> 00:00:59.727
This crazy mess where you
can actually kind of,

00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:04.018
I don't even think I see
a cell in this madness.

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:06.393
This just
looks like pure madness.

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:09.268
Maybe some of these dark
spots are cells,

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:11.310
but certainly not all of them.

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:16.143
What do you think these big
pink things are in a holy mess

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:20.935
of dense madness?
Those are collagen fibers,

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.560
you guys and those collagen
fibers organized in such

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:28.975
an un-organized way means
that this kind of tissue

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.435
is actually dense irregular
connective tissue.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:38.685
Like most things in biology
we label it as dense regular

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.975
or dense irregular
and that's just crazy talk

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:46.059
because it's a spectrum and so
sometimes it gets a little bit

00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:49.935
like is this irregular
or regular?

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.976
Is this dense or is it loose?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.351
It looks kind of, I mean
there's some space in there.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:57.852
To me, to my eyeball
it looks dense

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:01.643
because of the size
of the collagen fibers.

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.975
But you can imagine that there's
some variation here.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.435
That's fine.
Don't worry about that.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.975
Let's look at what I wonder

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:12.393
what do you think I was
wanting us to look at here?

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:14.810
First of all, holy space,

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:17.975
what kind of tissue are you
going to expect to see here?

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.226
That is going to be
some kind of epithelial tissue.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.894
Does it look stratified
or simple?

00:02:23.918 --> 00:02:24.975
I know you probably can't tell.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.143
I can because
this is quintessential

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:31.101
stratified squamous epithelium,

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:32.975
but what is
the connective tissue?

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.185
There's connective tissue
all over in here,

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.894
all sorts of different kinds
of connective tissue.

00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:41.351
This is probably
some kind of dense, regular--

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:44.477
I mean dense irregular
connective tissue,

00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:46.768
but these guys are
the ones that I wanted,

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.310
I wanted to show you them.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.018
This is actually
muscle down here.

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:54.143
But these, who's that?
Who does that look like?

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.477
I hope that it comes into focus

00:02:56.501 --> 00:03:00.975
this century
because our Internet is so slow.

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.351
You see something

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.975
that looks like this like
a whole bunch of empty holes,

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.602
that's adipose tissue.
This is a blob of fat.

00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:10.975
And somewhere oh,
there's the nucleus.

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.975
So there's the little nucleus
crammed down into the corner.

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.685
There's a nucleus crammed down

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.560
into the corner
of that giant fat blob.

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:21.226
Thank you.
And then look,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.975
this looks like it
looks kind of regular,

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.852
but it really, I would argue

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:28.810
it's probably not dense
regular connective tissue.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.976
You're going to see dense
regular connective tissue

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.810
somewhere that experiences like
a force in one direction only.

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:39.852
And really,
the only place

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:41.435
that we're going
to experience something

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.810
like that is in a tendon
that is attached to a muscle.

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:47.852
It attaches a muscle to a bone.

00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:51.226
So dense regular connective
tissue, there's too--

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.185
this looks too messy
for it to be dense regular.

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.975
It does look dense,
doesn't it?

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:58.268
So I'm going to argue that this

00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:01.643
is probably dense irregular
connective tissue.

00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:03.059
Let's see what the
other one is that oh,

00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:05.727
here's another example
of look at this mess.

00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:08.852
Really?
It just looks super like crazy.

00:04:08.876 --> 00:04:11.894
Look at all squigglies.
Those are all collagen fibers.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.393
It's interesting because we
see a bunch of nuclei here.

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:17.975
Those nuclei are
outside of the fibers.

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:19.351
Sometimes it's hard to
tell because they're

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:22.518
sitting on top of a fiber,
but they're actually in between.

00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:25.894
This is like a big ol' fat
collagen fiber right here.

00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:29.768
That means that
we're probably dense.

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:34.935
It looks messy to me so
it's probably dense irregular.

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:35.976
But these little guys

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.975
are actually outside of
the fibers themselves,

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.852
so that's how you know that
this is a connective tissue.

00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:46.351
So those are
probably fibroblasts.

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:47.643
All right, those are
the pictures

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:48.975
that I have to show you.

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.727
Now we're going to take
our connective tissues

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.518
and we're going to combine
them with an epithelial

00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:58.876
tissue to build different
kinds of membranes.
