Hey are you lucky, you're watching Sharp News!

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.460
You are actually like the tallest Captain America I've ever spoken with.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.180

6'3" on a good day?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.840
Sometimes I fell more like 5'9"

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.040
Do you want to do some Marvel trivia with us?

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.540
Just to test how good your Marvel knowledge is?

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.520
I'm probably gonna fail, but sure.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.680
All right, awesome.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.220
That's called a good attitude right there.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.100
Hulk

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.660

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.240
Hawkeye

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.560
The question was name five Avengers so that was incorrect.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.940
Because you successfully named six Avengers.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.480
No I'm just joking

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.060

Oh Coulson, he's not really a member of the Avengers

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.500
He's a member of SHIELD.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800
Name some of Peter Parker's girlfriends

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.860

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.360
No worries, no worries.
