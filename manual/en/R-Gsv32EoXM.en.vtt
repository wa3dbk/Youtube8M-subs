00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.840
Hey everybody, this is Fishthatwont quit again.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.270
I know some of my old

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.890
videos had a little bit of poor image

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.890
quality.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.890
I'd like to kind of make some

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.230
updated videos so you can see

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.860
the knot a little bit better and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.130
hopefully tie it a little bit easier.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.290
We are going to do the egg loop knot again
for you

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.290
here today.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.190
The Egg Loop Knot is really great

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.190
knot.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.190
It is a really strong knot you're going to
feel

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.190
confident with it in the water.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.340
Plus, it allows

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.290
you to kind of add things to the hook as

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.880
you know, baits, or attractants.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.880
Whether

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.840
it is eggs or shrimp or yarn with scent

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.840
in it.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.840
You can really use it for any

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.690
situation where you�re plunking or drift

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.739
fishing or even bobber fishing.

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:37.739
It's a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.739
great knot.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:39.739
so, to get started, you have your

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.620
hook in one hand, and the line the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.620
other.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.399
we're going to want to do is start

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.059
the line going through the eye the hook

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.870
in this direction and it's important it

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.030
goes this way and then I like to right

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.899
where it bends kind of put the line

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.590
there and hold it tight with my left

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.889
hand just like that.

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:00.399
now with this part

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.989
you're going to wrap it around the shank

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.489
of the hook and the line that you're

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.540
holding and with a thinner line you�re

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.530
wrap more and with a thicker line

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.110
you're going to wrap less and this is

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.800
about a 20 maybe 15-pound test if it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.671
was a monofilament so I'm going to do

00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:20.890
about 10 wraps to begin with so we got

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.520
one around the eye the hook then two

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.270
three four five six seven eight nine

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.590
we'll go with nine you can see you kind

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.950
of wrap it down the shank of the hook like

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.980
that now at this part of the line I like to

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.640
to hold to tight with my left hand just

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.880
like that that is important because if

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.860
it gets loose your wraps are going to

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.380
unravel and you're have to start from

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.890
the beginning now the next step is to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.780
grab the other end of your line that you are
tying. you're going to put it in the eye

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.880
the hook in the opposite direction and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.060
you can just go about a couple inches

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.551
here you're going to pull it through a

00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:00.290
little later and then what you're going

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.440
to want to do is take this part of the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.580
line and align it with the shank of the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.020
hook and hold it with your left hand so

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.150
now I got everything aligned on the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520
shank of the hook

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.350
and the loop line you're still holding

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.830
with your left hand and then we're going

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.770
to do is wrap this line around

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.160
everything that you�re holding

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.069
here and about seven more times with the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:34.280
this kind of a line we'll go one two

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.870
three four five six and seven now hold

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.190
it tight again with that left hand then
we're going to do is pull the tag end

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.980
through the eye and kind of go slow

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.600
sometimes it will get tension build up

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.770
over here and you don't want it to knot

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.850
up you're going to get to a point where

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.950
everything is really close what I like

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.300
to do is grab all the loops with your

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.380
right hand you can let go the other side

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.650
and then go ahead and keep pulling that

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.520
tag in until everything tightens up and

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.540
It will kind of go through your fingers

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.120
here once you're tight you can let go

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.620
and you'll see a completed egg loop knot

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.959
and what I like to do is tighten it a

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.319
little bit up it nice and cinched

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.480
together just like so this tag end

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.572
you're going to go ahead and cut and it

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:28.099
doesn't look that great

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.040
and then what you're left with is the egg

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.760
loop knot so basically here this line

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.520
that you just pulled through is your

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.819
loop then you can add whatever you like

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.630
Just tighten it down you're ready to fish

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.230
thanks for watching
