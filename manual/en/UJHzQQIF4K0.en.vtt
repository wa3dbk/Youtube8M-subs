BCL's easyPDF Printer also supports PDF security. PDF security is useful in a scenario where you would like to 
 share your document using PDF, but would like to control how your users interact with the PDF. 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:26.000
For instance, you might want to set a password just to open the PDF, or you might 
 want to modify the permissions for extracting, printing, or form filling on  your PDF

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400
Let's see how this works. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.733
We open our Word document in this case, and click on File,

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:39.800
Print, and be sure to choose the easyPDF Printer. 

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:43.400
Click on "Properties" and go to the Security tab. 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.667
Check "Enable PDF security".

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.000
If you would like to like to set a password for just viewing 
 the PDF, enter a password in the User Password field. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.533
Be sure to confirm the user password

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.400
and click OK.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.400
If you would like to modify the permissions for printing, modification, extraction, or the filling of 
 forms on your PDF, you will need to designate an owner password.  

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:25.200
Enter an owner password in the Owner Password 
 field, and confirm the owner password. 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:35.200
Let's say for example we do not want our users to print 
 our PDFs. Simply uncheck the "Allow printing" checkbox and click OK.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.670
Enter your serial number to activate your product, or click 
 "Try this product" to continue your free trial. 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.000
Choose a location to save.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.330
Our secured PDF is complete. 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.070
You see that it is prompting us for a password just to 
 view the PDF, so we enter the user password. 

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:10.200
Since we disallowed printing for our users, you see that the 
 printer is greyed out. Our user cannot print this PDF.

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:12.930
Thank you for using easyPDF Printer.
