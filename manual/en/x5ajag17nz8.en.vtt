00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.680
This video shows how to print a test page
for your HP printer.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.889
A test page provides useful information about
your printer. In addition, printing a test

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.650
page from the printer's control panel is
often a helpful troubleshooting step.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.600
First, slide out the input tray.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.810
Align a stack of paper by tapping it on a
flat surface.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.710
Load paper into the input tray until it stops.
Slide the paper width guides inward until

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.280
they stop at the edge of the paper. Do not
push the guides in so tightly that they start

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.800
to bend the paper.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.000
Slide in the input tray.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.000
Press the power button to turn on the printer.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.350
On the printer's control panel, touch the
Settings icon. This icon looks like a small

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.500
wrench.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.179
Touch Tools.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.800
Then, touch Printer Status Report.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.750
The test page prints.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.500
The test page can provide helpful information
about your printer.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.000
For example, if the test page prints successfully,
you know the printer is working correctly.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.600
However, if you are still having problems
printing from your computer, the causes might

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.560
be your connection, your computer, or the
printing software.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.890
If the test page prints, but shows smearing,
lines, or some other error, other documents

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.360
you print will likely have the same problem.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.500
The test page can also give you valuable information
on

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.030
model number
serial number

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.329
firmware version
and other helpful information for troubleshooting.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:52.000
