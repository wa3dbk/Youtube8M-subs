00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.370
 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.560
Hi everybody, so today I'm going to be doing a hair tutorial for you. Now the angles are gonna be 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.740
kinda weird on this one. Hopefully you can see everything on it, but what I'm actually doing 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.890
is an upside down and a regualar twist 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.090
for a ponytail. If you want you can take the hair and just 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.100
like put it up into a bun, if you want to be able to see the back better. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.210
The only challenging part of this is braiding your hair upside down. 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.400
That part of it, but once you get the hang of it, and if you know how to braid, it just is gonna

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.500
take a little bit of time. So if you guys are interested to see how 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.620
i did this look, keep on watching!

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.810
Ok guys, so first we're gonna take a small section 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.000
of hair by the very front of our forehead. Almost in a triangle type position. 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.180
Then what you're gonna do is split that into 3 sections. You're gonna 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.360
take the middle section and pull it under and to the outside. 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.450
Then again do that one more time, pull it under and to the outside. That's gonna 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.550
start our braid. Now to french braid you take a littel bit of hair from the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.730
outside and add that to our outside section, and then again 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.910
take the middle section, pull it under and to the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.970
outside where you just added the hair. Now go to the opposite side 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.150
add hair in, and again pull that middle section 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.320
under and to the outside where you just added the hair. Now we're 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.510
going to keep doing the same thing, adding hair, pulling the middle to the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.570
outisde and switching sides until you get to the point where you want your 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.760
ponytial. Now I'm gonna stop kinda early on because I want a 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.870
higher ponytail. (music...)

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.030
 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.200
 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.380
 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.560
Ok, so now I have it to the point where I want to stop. Where my ponytail is going 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.620
to be. So I'm just going to take a hair tie and I'm gonna pull that up into the hair tie. 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.790
That's just going to be a temporary hold until we're done doing the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.980
upside down part of our french braid. So, this is 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.170
what we have so far for the top braid. 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.350
Ok, so for the bottom part, we're doing as the top. We're doing a french 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.530
braid but it's just upside down. So the only challenge is just getting used to 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.700
the positioning of your hands. So, take your hair into 3 sections, 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.890
and the easiest way to do this, is to when you have the 3 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.080
sections, angle your hands downward. So, 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.280
not pointing towards your neck, but down towards the floor. Now take 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.460
the hair and do the exact same thing. Take the middle section and pull 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.660
it under. The middle section pull it under and then you're gonna 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.840
take the hair from the outside 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.010
and just going to add that in to the outside section. Now again, this might be a little 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.190
more challenging, just because you know it's at an odd angle. 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.240
It's just gonna take you a little bit of practice and then it will be just as easy 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.420
as french braiding from the top. So, again add hair to the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.570
outisde section, pull the middle under and to the outside 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.770
and then just keep going back and forth until you get to the very 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.960
end of your braid and then I'll show you what to do.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.150
(music....)

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.340
 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.540
 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.730
 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.780
 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.970
 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.150
 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.350
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.510
Ok, so now that we're towards the end you're gonna have just 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.710
small sections of hair. So just keep pulling hair from the middle of the ponytail until 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.890
you have all of the hair up. Then as you can see I'm missing a little part there 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.080
but pull all of the hair and hold it together with one hand, and then 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.260
take your hair tie and just pull the hair up into 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.310
the ponytial. Again make sure you're holding both sections tightly, so that 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.490
you do not loosen your braids, and don't 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.670
miss a strand of hair like I do. Ok guys so 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.850
that is the finished look. See the 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.030
back edn of it. So again, it just takes a littel bit 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.170
of practice trying to figure the upside down part of it. Um it is 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.350
a lot easier if you don't start with the braid on the top as 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.530
well. So if you just flip all of your hair over. Braid up until 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.680
the point where you want your ponytail. Then you can just have a regular 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.850
no braid there. Um either way it's a realy fun 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.030
look to do. I hope you guys have enjoyed today's tutorial. If you have please hit the
