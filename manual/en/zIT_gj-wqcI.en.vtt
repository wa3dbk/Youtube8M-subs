00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.000
Okay so at this point I think we should
do a focused spine assessment.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Should we look at the field guide so that we make
sure we follow all the steps? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.680
That sounds great.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.000
Page 19: Five steps.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the first thing Charlie,
I want to make sure that I ask you some questions.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.199
I may have already asked you some of these questions

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.310
and then I'm going to do some physical exam tests
and, again, I've already done these

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.000
so I realize I'm repeating them so bear with
me if you will.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Okay.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.485
What's your full name?

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.100
Charles Romeo Manganiello.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.359
Roughly what time of day is it?

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.010
About one o'clock. 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.010
Where are you?

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.900
At the Sinks Canyon Center in Lander, Wyoming.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.080
And one more time what happened to you?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.269
I was climbing the tree and there was some snow up there 
and I slipped and fell.

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.000
Okay, so he is oriented to person, place,
time, and event. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Have you had any alcohol today?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.500
No. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Any drugs?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.830
No.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.530
Prescriptions? Pain medications? 
Anything that might cloud your thinking?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.000
Not at all.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.760
Okay great. So he's sober.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.070
And we didn't find any injuries on head
to toe. 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.230
Is there anything that's starting to hurt you at this point?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.230
No.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.000
So he doesn't appear to be distracted by pain.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And he's calm and engaging in conversation so he's a reliable patient.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.600
Okay next thing Charlie. I want to check your hands and your feet again.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630
Let's start with your hands.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.010
Can you wiggle all your fingers for me?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.000
Great. Which finger am I touching?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.200
The left pinky.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.700
Okay how about over here?

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.820
The right pinky.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310
Okay, great.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.000
Go ahead and give me a squeeze.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.080
Hands feel warm to me with a strong radial pulse.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.140
That hand feels warm. Also a strong radial pulse.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.140
Are your hands warm to you?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.140
Yes.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.000
Do you have any funny sensations?
Hot and cold flashes, numbness, tingling? 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.530
Anything that's not normal for you?

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.530
No.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.130
Lets do the same on your feet.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.630
Can you go ahead and just bend your knees
for me so I can see your feet.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.910
Okay, go ahead and push down on the gas.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.980
Pull up.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.060
Okay, wiggle all your toes. 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.419
Which toe am I pinching?

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:07.419
The left pinky toe.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:08.419
Now?

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.000
The right big toe.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.000
Okay.

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.329
Your feet feel nice and warm to me. Do they feel warm to you?

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.329
Yes.

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.719
Okay, same question. Hot and cold
sensations, numbness tingling?

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.180
Anything out of the ordinary?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.180
No.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.699
Okay, so I've got good circulation, sensation, and
motion in all four extremities.

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:26.500
You agree?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.500
I agree.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:32.039
Okay, you can tuck your legs back into the bag. 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:38.450
I'm gonna take this bag out from under
your legs so we can roll you on your side one more time.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.579
Just like we did before we are going to roll you up on your side

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.000
and I'm going to walk my fingers down your
spine and I want you to tell me if I cause you any discomfort.

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:51.000
On my three. One. Two. Three.

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.109
Starting right back up here.

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.109
Any pain Charlie?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.000
No.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.000
Okay, I'm going to reach under these clothes again.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.600
Okay.

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:08.709
Still your spine?

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.709
Yup.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:10.709
Any pain?

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.709
No.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.069
Okay, we'll go back down on your count Travis.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.900
One. Two. Three.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.869
So Travis and Charlie, what we found on our
assessment is that Charlie is awake and oriented

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:29.879
to person, place, time, and event.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.559
He's sober

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:34.689
and he's not distracted so 
he's a reliable patient.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:40.000
Charlie, what I found on my assessment is
that you had good circulation, sensation, and motion

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.189
in both hands and both feet

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.719
and when we pressed on your spine from
top to bottom

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.500
you had no complaints of pain when I did that.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.709
So those are all the steps of the focus
spine assessment.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.999
At this point it is my recommendation that 
Travis can let go of your head

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.000
and we'll release spinal stabilization. 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.800
Travis, are you okay with that?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.800
I'm okay with that.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.000
Charlie, does that feel okay to you, that we let go of spine stabilization?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Yes.

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:07.449
Okay Travis, so go ahead and let go of his head.

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:11.000
Charlie we can get you into a position that's more comfortable for you.
