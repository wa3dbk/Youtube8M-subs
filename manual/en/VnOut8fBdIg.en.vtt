00:00:07.917 --> 00:00:10.400
Welcome to the Aqua Terra
Video Manual.

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:13.606
Positioned on the side of the watch
is the crown,

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:15.478
which is used for setting the time

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.695
and adjusting the time zone
and the date.

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:19.604
In its normal wearing position,

00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:22.558
the crown ensures
the watch is fully water resistant.

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:25.914
It has to be unscrewed
before the time can be set.

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:27.861
Although the watch is self-winding,

00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:29.708
when the crown is in this position,

00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:31.929
it can be wound forward
for extra power.

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:36.408
To set the time,

00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:39.587
pull the crown out two clicks
to its furthest position.

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:42.445
The seconds hand will stop.

00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:45.658
Turn the crown forward or backward

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:48.989
to move the hour and minute hands
to the desired time.

00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:57.330
You can adjust the time zone easily

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.625
to accommodate time changes
when you travel.

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:01.305
Pull the crown to position 2

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.338
and turn it forward or backward
to move the hour hand.

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:07.624
This will not stop
the minute and seconds hands.

00:01:10.092 --> 00:01:11.636
To adjust the date forward,

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:14.567
advance the hour hand past midnight.

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:17.613
To adjust the date backward,

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:21.711
move the hour hand back past 7 pm
to ensure it changes.

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:29.235
To re-seal the crown,
make sure it's in position 1.

00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:33.434
Then push it firmly
while screwing it clockwise.

00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:40.220
For ease of reading
in low-light conditions,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.191
the watch's hands
and applied indexes

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.823
are coated with Super-LumiNova
which emits a blue light.

00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:52.739
Thank you
for watching this video manual.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.106
We hope
you enjoy your Aqua Terra.
