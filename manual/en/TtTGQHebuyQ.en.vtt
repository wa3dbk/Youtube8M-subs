Hi Iâ€™m Debbie McCanna on behalf of Expert
Village.com, I am going to be talking to you

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.949
today about the care and handling of corn
snakes. In this segment we will be discussing

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.789
if having a corn snake is right for you. The
typical corn snake will live up to 15 years

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:33.100
with proper care. It also needs to be noted
that many snakes will eat live rather than

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:41.280
frozen and thawed food sources such as mice,
rat and even pinkie mice in the juvenile stage.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.579
You should consider the following questions
when deciding whether or not having a snake

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.440
is appropriate for you. First are you comfortable
handling a snake? Snakes are not wet. They

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.629
are shiny but they are not wet or gooey. They
are cool to the touch, have no protrusions

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.830
but should be handled with respect as they
are wild and not domestic. They can startle

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.660
easily and should never be handled while being
fed or shortly after being fed. Secondly,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.840
do you have small children or pets in the
house that either could harm the snake or

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.750
that the snake could cause harm to. If this
is the case, the snake should never be without

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.049
supervision and should always be maintained
in a locked habitat out of reach of children

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:38.560
and other pets. Are you comfortable providing
for the snake up to 15 years. In the event

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.140
that you had to move, would you be able to
take the snake with you or would you be able

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.280
to find a suitable home for the snake? Do
you have a source of food that might involve

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.710
live food from a local pet store or breeder
that could supply you with food throughout

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.310
the year? Do you have a local veterinarian
that specializes in exotic animals? Can you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.390
provide the proper habitat for a reptile and
are you willing to learn about the care and

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.820
maintenance of this pet so that you could
enjoy the animal while it enjoys being your

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.370
companion? If you can answer yes to these
questions, then a corn snake is the right

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.070
pet for you.
