00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.200
Today on this 2010 Chevrolet HHR, we're going
to install part no.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.370
24756 from Draw Tite.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.130
This is what the hitch looks like when it
is installed on a vehicle.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.650
Next we will give you some measurements that
will help you out in selecting some accessories

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.370
such as a bike carrier or a cargo carrier.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.910
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
outside edge of the bumper we're looking at

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.050
5 and 3/4 inches and from the top of the receiver
openning down to the ground will be 10 and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.050
3/8.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.330
Now we'll go ahead and show you how the hitch
is installed.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.191
Our first step is to go ahead and lower the
exhaust.

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:35.890
We will spray down the hanger with some lubricant
and go ahead and remove them.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:45.530
Alright with the exhaust out of our way we
can see where the hitch mounts up.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:01:08.320
We can use this existing hole right here however
we want to enlarge to 1/2 inch to make it

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.440
easier we're going to pull a bolt all way
through and this will be your access hole

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:27.650
and also as an attachment point 
and 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.240
it has to be identical on both sides.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:51.800
To install our hardware, we wil run a bolt
leader to the hole we drilled out 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:02.500
and out of the access hole.
