If you really like chocolate, these little delicious chocolate cakes with liquid core will be just the right thing for you.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.880
The recipe with the exact measurements of the ingredients is as always linked in the information box or you can find it directly on http://amerikanisch-kochen.de

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.180
Firstly, butter with chopped dark chocolate is melted 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.360
over a water bath with low temperature.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.240
During that time you can prepare the fire-proofed baking molds. 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.120
Brush them with soft butter

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.960
and put a right sized piece of baking paper on the bottom of the baking mold. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.960
Our baking molds have a diameter of 9cm and a height of 7cm

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.960
For the dough, eggs with vanilla sugar

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.760
Salt

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.760
and normal granulated sugar are mixed till everything is connected.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.480
Add the melted chocolate/butter mix 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.120
which should be warm but not too hot, otherwise the eggs could clot.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.160
Now add the flour.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.320
Additionally spread the dough evenly in to the baking molds. 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.600
Please only fill it up to two thirds of the mold, as the dough will rise during baking. 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.160
The little cupcakes have to be baked for 15- 18 minutes in the 200 ° (top / bottom heat) pre-heated oven.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.760
Please be careful! The ceramic molds are very very hot after baking. 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.520
Separate the edge of the cake with a knife. The bottom should loosen automatically because of the baking paper. 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.480
Then quickly flip the baking mold on a matching plate and take the cake off gently. 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.760
The cake you see right now was for 15 minutes in the over and its center if very fluid. 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.600
After 18 minutes ( which means 3 minutes later) the whole thing looks like this.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.960
The center is still fluid but doesn’t run that quickly anymore as with the first cake.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.840
However, the cooking time depends on your oven and the size of the baking molds.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.920
Depending on your taste, you can simply serve the cake like this

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.040
or with a scoop of vanilla, a little whipped cream, fruit or with powdered sugar.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.760
We wish you a lot of fun baking!
