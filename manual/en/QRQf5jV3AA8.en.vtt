00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.333
- Hey, we're friends,

00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.800
so I can ask you
a personal question, right?

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.800
audience: Yes.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.200
How many of you eat brunch?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.400
[scattered cheers]

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.000
Yeah?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.566
Thank you for answering
that personal question.

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.500
I was invited to a brunch
recently,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.733
and I realized
brunch ain't what it used to be.

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.600
You know, it used to be
a combination

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.433
of breakfast and lunch,
and now it's an excuse to drink.

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.500
[laughter]

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.900
Right? Is that what it is?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.066
[cheers and applause]

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.766
Yeah.

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.766
When I was growing up,
brunch was wholesome.

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.066
You know,
it was a wholesome meal

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.533
you'd eat on Sunday
with your family,

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.000
and your grandmother would make
her famous corn casserole

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900
and banana bread, and
you'd laugh and share stories,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.433
and then the kids would sit
on the porch

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:41.433
and smoke cigarettes.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.400
[laughter]

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.000
But then, I think it was around,
like, the '80s or something,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.266
someone invented something
called the mimosa.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.800
[cheers and applause]

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.500
In case you don't know,
"mimosa" is a Spanish word

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.933
meaning "drunk before noon."

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.200
[laughter]

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.133
[chuckles]

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.333
[slurring]
"Well, it's orange juice.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.033
"It's orange juice.

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.600
"Just do a little bit of--
put a little--

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200
okay, I'll take the champagne."

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.533
Someone decided that
brunch needed music,

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.833
so some places added
a piano player,

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.333
then maybe some jazz.

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.400
But that wasn't enough.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.200
Now they have a DJ
at some brunches.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.133
Have you been to those brunches
with DJs?

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.566
This is what brunch looks like
in Las Vegas.

00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.933
[laughter]

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.066
That's a brunch.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:29.600
It's a restaurant
called LAVO, and it's--

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.566
the bagel spread, I guess,
is on the other side.

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.366
I can't tell.
[laughter]

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.366
But that's their brunch.

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.066
There are brunches like this
all over the country.

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:39.600
Here's a flyer for a place
called Mojo's.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.966
It says, "Bottomless mimosas,
bottomless Marys."

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.866
No food is advertised on that.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.400
[laughter]

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.566
And she's got a dress on.
She's supposed to look classy.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.866
But you know she's wearing
the dress from the night before.

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.333
[laughter]

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.600
Here's another--
this is for an Easter brunch.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.033
[audience exclaims]

00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.666
I guess she's giving up clothes
for Lent.

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:03.066
I don't know.
[laughter]

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:06.066
[applause]
There's no food.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.333
I guess what I'm saying--
there are so many ways

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:14.566
to have fun on Sunday
without endless drinks.

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.666
I can't think of any
off the top of my head, but...

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:18.233
[laughter]
Who cares?

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:20.566
I can turn this place into
a club with four simple words.

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:22.300
It's time to dance.
