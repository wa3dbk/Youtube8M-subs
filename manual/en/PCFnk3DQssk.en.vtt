00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.370
where you seem to be
so little, alone

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:50.420
The quiet heals,
reminds you of what is real,

00:02:50.504 --> 00:03:02.280
transforming your dreams to be
reflections of Home

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.730

come to the quietness

00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:44.900
Allow your mind to rest
here in God's peace
