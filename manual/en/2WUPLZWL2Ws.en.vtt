00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:20.770
In the fast-paced, rapidly growing energy
and transportation industries,

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.023
gear components are front and centre.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:27.152
In many applications, they're the most
important, expensive

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.487
and time-consuming parts to machine

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.198
and with tightening technical
specifications

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.868
and increasing production demands,
it's crucial

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.705
that gear manufacturers in all industries
optimise their operations.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:42.751
The industry right now, fortunately,
is booming.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:47.255
The industry worldwide is enjoying
tremendous growth,

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:53.219
great pressure, which is then allowing us
to incorporate new technology.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:55.680
We have shortages in some cases
for machinery

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.767
and we most certainly have shortages
for qualified people

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:00.185
working in the industry.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.271
It is very beneficial to the industry

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:08.651
to have smarter and smarter machine
tools, more and more capable tooling,

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:12.072
accessories that are used in
the manufacturing process.

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:14.783
We are able, through productivity gains,

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:20.121
to replace some of the shortfalls we have
in the employees and the workforce.

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:23.041
To help its customers stay
on the cutting edge,

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:27.879
Sandvik Coromant has invested
significant time, money and resources

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.132
in the development of new
gear-machining tools and solutions,

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:35.303
many of which can increase productivity
by as much as 300%,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.682
as compared to traditional gear-cutting
tools and techniques.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.893
When I talk to customers today,

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:45.313
they see us as a fresh breeze
coming from the outside

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:49.442
with our innovative solutions
and this is exactly what we wanted to do.

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:52.904
People know us from being
the market leader worldwide

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.156
within general machining.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:59.703
And they know there's a muscle
behind what we're doing now.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:03.289
This has not been a cheap ride,
I tell you, but it shows our customers

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:06.001
that there's not just commitment,
but there is also power,

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.169
financial power behind what we are doing.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.796
And we are long-term thinking.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:13.591
Sandvik Coromant's wide selection
of indexable insert cutters

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.679
can perform a variety of gear-milling
tasks from roughing to finishing.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.016
What's more, new techniques
from Sandvik Coromant

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.435
are changing the face
of gear milling altogether.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:28.481
I showed an example of a gear wheel
that is produced by an HSS hob,

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:32.402
which is the usual way of doing it,
in 32 minutes.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:36.031
With our new product line,
we are down to four.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:39.826
Going from 32 minutes
down to four minutes.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:43.204
This is not an evolution,
this is a revolution.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.874
Invo-milling process is
a great technological event

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.459
in the gear-milling industry.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.295
And what it does is it gives you
the opportunity

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.797
to take the advantage of using
the machining technology,

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.051
which is 5-axis machining and programming,

00:02:56.092 --> 00:03:00.638
and use standard tools and
form a gear out of that combination.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.309
Where before you had to have
a special tool on a special machine,

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:08.605
now you have a standard tool on
a standard machine with special software.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.399
To ensure the highest level of R&amp;D,

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.028
Sandvik Coromant works closely with
industry-leading machine tool partners.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.948
Customers have hands-on access to
these collaborative insights,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.034
training and technologies

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:25.413
including the new Hofler HF1000
gear-milling machine

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.584
when they visit the company's Schaumburg,
Illinois productivity centre.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.420
Finally, Yellow Coat expertise

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.674
and support from a team of dedicated
gear-milling specialists

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:39.552
help customers identify and implement
the best solutions for their needs.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.264
&gt;From the early equipment research phase
to installation and runoff,

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:47.811
Sandvik Coromant is there to offer
the highest level of service

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.020
and application support.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.272
We supply support
with every tool we sell.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:56.111
Our people train weekly, daily, overseas,
here, to get up to speed with this.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:04:00.115
That's what we do with the customer too.
That's why I say we want to be a partner.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.492
We bring to them not only the tool,

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:06.079
the benefits of having knowledge
behind the tool.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:10.041
Being 8,000 people worldwide
makes a difference.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:13.670
It is not enough to want to support
a customer.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:17.007
You also need the hands and feet
and heads to do it,

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.758
and this is what we have got.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.847
We have got 300 dedicated...
350 dedicated people throughout the world

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:27.017
who are working with
gear-milling technology today

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:29.185
so when we say that we will show up

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:33.773
and we will take the customer by his hand
and follow him the whole way,

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.775
we have the substance to do it.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.527
It's more than a promise.

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.989
