&gt;&gt; Landry: We're here on Blair's Valley Lake trying
 to catch some bluegills.  It's a very nice day out here

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.859
What I have here is a bobber, a snap swivel

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:33.070
a slit-shot sinker, a snap swivel

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.390
and a size six hook.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.660
&gt;&gt; Eldon: still go him?

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.990
I think you still got something on there

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.990
keep reeling it in

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.290
[kids exclaiming, follow by scared sounds from Camden]

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.610
&gt;&gt; Eldon: there we go

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.060
there we got a fish
&gt;&gt; Landry: Yeah!

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.020
&gt;&gt; Eldon: What do you think of that, Camden?

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.520
&gt;&gt; Camden: Ohhh

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.140
&gt;&gt; Eldon: Landry pulled in a fish

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.280
&gt;&gt; Landry: Got a bluegill

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.220
&gt;&gt; Eldon: Yep, a little

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.330
sun fish or bluegill

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.990
or one of those species

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.360
&gt;&gt; Eldon: he's big enough to take home and get
a fillet off of, but I dont' know.. this is the first

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.290
one we've caught.  If we don't catch any more I'll
probably throw him back

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.409
but will put him in the bucket for now.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.020
[gentle music playing]

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.210
&gt;&gt; Eldon: he's still there

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.720
reel it in.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.720
keep the rod tip out over the boat.  Don't get it too
close to Camden, OK? There you go.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.900
Oh no, we lost him!

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.360
all we have is a worm!  But that's good, we can
cast it out again

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.530
&gt;&gt; Landry: awww

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.230
We didn't do all that great - we just got one

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.210
but hopefully some other time we can get three or four

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.560
or something like that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.430
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time!
