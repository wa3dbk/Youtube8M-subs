Hi there,welcome back to HuwsNursery and we are here in the vegetable garden and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.560
it is about mid-March so it is time to plat some pea seeds. So today

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm going to show you a really simple method to grow peas from seed, and this is basically 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.760
using a rain-gutter here, this is just and old rain gutter so you can find hem in

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.120
scrap yards or anywhere really. And all you need it some compost and some soil. 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.040
Firstly you want to fill abut an inch of compost and that is going to act as a base layer

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.120
where all the nutrients are, then secondly every inch along we are going to plant 3 seeds

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.160
along it, and then cover it with a couple of inches of  just normal soil. So lets start by filling

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.940
up this rain-gutter

00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:59.723
Here I am just filling up the rain-gutter with some homemade compost and what we will be doing is

00:00:59.723 --> 00:01:04.480
using 2 gutters as we do like quite a lot of peas, but if you have quite a small garden you can really have 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.060
as much or as little peas as you want. And just cut the rain-gutter to size. Really easy! I'm just 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.493
continuing to fill it up with compost about an inch deep.

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:27.123
Okay so the peas I'm using here are 'Meteor' and they are ealy-drawf peas because you can get

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.260
different height so the normal traditional peas grow to about 6 feet tall but these dwarf peas are good for small space gardens and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.000
only grow about 2 feet tall. So just what I'm going to do is place

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.480
3 seeds in a row, and then leave like an inch, maybe just over an inch

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.200
and plant another 3. and the continue to do that which may take a coupe of minutes 

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:04.317
but just do it for the desired length of the rain-gutter you would like. 

00:02:04.317 --> 00:02:08.801
Now you must be wondering why should you just put it in the gutter? Why can't you just

00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:13.180
put it int the ground? Well, theoretically you can put it straight into the ground, 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.860
but the good thing about using a rain-gutter first is that there is actcually two good things about it. 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.780
Firstly it stops mice from eating the seeds. And we have had  big problem with mice eating broad-bean

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.480
seeds and pea-seeds and you can actually see the tunnerls underneath where they go along eating

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.360
the seeds. So it is a good way to stop mice and also the other way is that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.260
it is really easy when you dig a little trench, 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.500
you can just slide all of the plants off and it is just so easy and I'll show you that in another video were

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.220
I'll be planting these out. And you will see for yourself how simple the methods are!

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:03.296
And so finally just get some general soil and fill up the seeds to the top. 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.460
And then after you have done all this you then want to place it somewhere high where any mice can't reach it 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.720
and in a few days in about a week or so, you'll start to see some sprouts appear in abut 2 weeks and then

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.040
wait for them to grow about an inch to2 inches tall and I'll be showing you in another video how to plant them out.

00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:37.384
And it is really fun! Just watching them all slide off. So I hope you enjoyed this video

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.600
thank you very much for watching! See you soon :
