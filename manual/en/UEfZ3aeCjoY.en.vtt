00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.142
Mobile's brought the web
billions of new users

00:00:03.142 --> 00:00:05.350
and has introduced a lot of
new possibilities for web

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.890
developers to take advantage
of such as direct touch

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.930
manipulation, high density
displays, and new hardware

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.880
capabilities, such
as geolocation.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.690
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.970
And we're going to look
at some of the trends

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.678
that we've noticed at
Google and tell you

00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:19.630
where there's great
opportunity for you

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.052
if you get the
fundamentals right.

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:24.590
The Google PageSpeed team
had a great question.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.680
For a mobile page,
does poor usability

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.212
diminish the benefits
of a fast page load?

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:30.920
Now, on the web, if
the average page load

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.179
time is about seven
seconds-- and we at Google

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:34.720
recommend that you
should aim to load

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.620
your page in less
than two seconds.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.327
But even if you do
achieve those goals

00:00:38.327 --> 00:00:40.160
and the user has to
spend an additional five

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.110
seconds pinching and
panning and zooming just

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.230
to find the content that
they're interested in,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.910
then the site really
isn't fast at all.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.860
We looked across
the top 1,000 sites

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.360
and sampled over a
million URLs at random

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.880
to determine how well
the web works on mobile.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.590
And we found some very
interesting results.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.090
We found that a
high number of sites

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.714
had content that forced the user
to pan, pinch, and zoom around

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:04.679
the screen just to be able
to get access to the site.

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:06.310
And from a recent
ad study, we know

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.640
that users hate
having to do this.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.280
We found that over 32%
of the top 1,000 sites

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.840
had text that was too small
for users to read comfortably.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.780
And this got even worse with
the long tail of the web.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.340
Now imagine you're
on your mobile

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.506
and you're viewing a page
that's not mobile friendly

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:23.940
but has been designed
to use a 12 point font.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.100
Because of the scale that
the browser introduces

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.170
it actually reads like
a four point font.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920
And this is just
not great for users.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.380
A large number of sites also
block the ability for users

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.710
to scale their screen.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.080
In a test that I run, 15% of
sites that had a viewport also

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.450
blocked zoom in.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.960
This is bad for
users who require

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.920
an enhanced accessibility
and are frequently

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.200
being blocked from being able
to view a page comfortably.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.930
Not only were
displays suboptimal,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.340
interactions were
hard for users, too.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.000
Over 60% of the
top 1 million sites

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.560
had issues with
interaction, where

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.982
elements such as
links and buttons

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:58.690
were too close to each
other for the user

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.210
to accurately click on and
complete their intended action.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.610
I've dropped this in because
it's a pet peeve of mine.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.150
I hate typing on
my mobile device.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.720
Yet many sites still
have really long forms

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.730
that don't autocomplete
or help me enter text.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.900
Why?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.470
And a recent study
by the Ads team

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.460
show that users hate having
to fill in forms, too.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.600
People still use Flash
and another embeds.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.200
These tools just do not
work in the mobile web.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.410
So why are we still using them?

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.160
For someone like me who believes
in the ubiquity of the web,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.890
it's clear that it's not
easily accessible everywhere.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.760
As depressing as these
stats are, there is hope.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.720
It presents a massive
opportunity for you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.090
and your business to get
ahead of the competition

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.030
and delight your users.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.890
The Google PageSpeed
Insights team

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.960
built a tool to help
you identify issues

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.630
with the performance
of your page load

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.000
and address these problems
with actionable guidance.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.730
We've extended this
tool to now include

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.691
detection of common
user experience issues.

00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:56.940
But how do you avoid these
mistakes in the first place

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.620
to build a great
experience for your users?

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.480
I'm going to talk about
seven simple steps

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.990
to get you started building
great mobile web experiences.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.990
Now this sounds
silly, but you would

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.760
need to understand that
you must go mobile.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.590
If you're not thinking about it
already your users will want it

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.210
and your competition are
probably already building it.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.710
Now there's actually
a lot of things

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.501
that you need to do
to go fully mobile.

00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:21.000
But these next set
of tips will help

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.342
you avoid the common pitfalls
of mobile web development.

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:26.550
The most important and
critical thing that you can do

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.070
is to always use a
mobile viewport meta tag

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.830
and always size it
to the device width

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.120
and set the initial
scale to one.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.220
This viewport will work really
well across all devices.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.265
Users hate panning.

00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:40.640
Always ensure that the content
fits in the viewport width

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.950
and does not force
the user to scroll.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.370
For example, developers often
don't scale their images

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.540
correctly or size tables to
fit on mobile, forcing the user

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.120
to pan left or right.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.279
Never, ever disable zoom.

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:55.320
Even though your users
hate being forced to zoom,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.840
there's very little reason
to lock this experience

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.480
even if you're building apps.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.580
And by making sure that
your users can zoom in,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.040
they will thank you for it.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.050
So simply use the default
viewport method type

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.827
we presented earlier
and you're good to go.

00:04:07.827 --> 00:04:09.660
When it comes to reading
text on the screen,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.640
the Apple iOS team have it best.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.960
Above all, text must be legible.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.770
If users can't read
the words in your app,

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.540
it doesn't matter how
beautiful your typography is.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.120
And the same
applies for the web.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.120
So we recommend that you
use at least a 16 point

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.590
font, sensible line spacing, and
a good contrast in your text.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.840
Limit the use of web
fonts to just the headings

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.440
so that the body
copy is immediately

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.330
visible to the user.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.130
Web fonts are loaded
from the remote server

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.713
and the text is
blocked from rendering

00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:37.350
until it's been
fully downloaded.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.210
So remember, the most
important thing in your site

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.240
is your content.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.380
Make it easy for people to
interact with your page.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.670
Increase the minimum
touch size to 48 pixels

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.150
and add padding of at
least seven millimeters

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.170
to areas of your site that
will accept user input,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.835
especially if there are
other touchable areas nearby.

00:04:54.835 --> 00:04:56.210
This will help
users and browsers

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.626
understand whether
clicks happened

00:04:57.626 --> 00:05:01.060
and complete the
action for the user.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.647
Make it simple for people
to enter data into a form.

00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:05.230
Guide users through
the data that they

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.938
need to enter on your
form by giving them

00:05:06.938 --> 00:05:08.430
a hint with a placeholder.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.880
For example, if you're
entering a telephone number,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.850
have a sample telephone number
in line in the form element.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.910
Add labels to tell the
user the type of data

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.910
and also drastically
increase the touch target

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.570
size for the form fields.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.100
For example, use the
label to tell the user

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.760
if it's a home telephone number
or a work telephone number

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.730
that you're expecting
in the form.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.620
Make sure you use semantic
input types, such as telephone,

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.470
number, and date to give the
user the appropriate keyboard

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.180
to make their lives
so much easier.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.970
Browsers on mobile
phones have great tools

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.200
to make it easy to enter
data, such as a phone dial

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.530
pad or even a quick hint with
the [? ads ?] sign on the form

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.030
when you're expecting that data.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.860
The browser understands
a huge amount

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.060
of information about you.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.325
So let the browser help your
users by enabling autocomplete.

00:05:53.325 --> 00:05:55.200
Tell the browser if
you're expecting a street

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.250
address, a credit card number,
an email address, or even

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.030
a person's name, and
it will automatically

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.992
fill out the form.

00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:03.700
PageSpeed helps with
most of these issues

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.658
so use it at every single
stage of your project

00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:08.610
so you can catch problems
before they occur.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.020
For example, you can use
the API to check your site

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.980
on every single deploy or build.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.580
And it's as simple as issuing
a cURL command to the API

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.510
with your site address.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.280
If you follow these simple tips
and use our Web Fundamentals

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.450
guide with PageSpeed insights,
you'll be off to a great start.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.430
Thank you for watching.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.310
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.120
Now go out and build some great
sites that work on all devices.
