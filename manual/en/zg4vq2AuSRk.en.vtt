00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.600
In this tutorial we will show how Melodyne is a great tool for

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.500
manipulating the dynamic range of drum sounds,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.000
a process also known as compression,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.700
without the aid of a compressor or other such devices.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.200
Here we have a drum loop already analyzed with 
Melodyneʼs percussion algorithm.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.800
You can easily see and hear that there is wide dynamic range

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500
between notes in this loop.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.700
By selecting individual sounds, we can easily 
change volumes by using the amplitude tool.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.450
A good way to select specific sounds is 
by selecting one or more notes in a bar

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.700
then going to "Edit" , "Select Special",

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.400
then "Select same beats in other bars".

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.400
You can then change the amplitude of 
the selected blobs all at once if desired.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.700
You can also go back and adjust individual blobs 
independently if need be.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.100
This method greatly narrows the dynamic range of the instrument

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.700
without the artifacts often created by 
compressors or other dynamic devices.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.600
Selecting groups of blobs and raising their overall volume

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.800
without altering their relative dynamics is easy and effective.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.200
Here weʼve selected some snare fills and raised their overall levels

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.900
without altering their relative dynamics.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.900
Another advantage of the Melodyne method 
is being able to adjust on a per note basis,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.900
the sustain, via the time handle tool,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.200
and the transient character via the attack speed tool.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.540
Of course you can still use your compressors 
and other dynamic devices

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.000
with your tracks processed in Melodyne.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.400
Here is an example of the classic New York Style 
or parallel compression technique

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.900
where the Melodyne track is blended with a 
heavily compressed version of the same loop.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.590
For the sake of comparison, here we have the original track,

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.500
unprocessed by Melodyne, going straight into a compressor.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.000
Here is the same loop after being compressed 
by Melodyne with no other compression.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.200
Lastly, the loop processed by Melodyne 
and fed straight into the compressor.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.000
All of these options are useful

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.200
and which to use depends on personal taste and the particular situation.
