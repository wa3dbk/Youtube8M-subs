00:00:01.032 --> 00:00:02.920
What's up guys in today's video I am gonna show

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.485
you how to unlock the Blackberry Q10

00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:08.076
in this case I have a Blackberry Q10 from T-mobile

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:10.697
and I want to unlock it so that I am able to use it

00:00:10.697 --> 00:00:14.527
with my GSM sim card from AT&amp;T

00:00:14.527 --> 00:00:17.561
Now I am gonna show you how to do this unlocking

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:21.102
step by step alright. It is very simple it will take

00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:23.858
around five minutes to get the unlocking process

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:26.856
running and you will only need your phone

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:29.967
and your computer with an internet connection

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.618
Now before we start I want to mention one thing

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:36.442
only looking at Blackberry Q10 its not free

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:38.910
Unfortunately there is no way to unlock this phone

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.014
for free, but trust me guys it is worth every penny

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:43.951
to get your phone unlocked and it is not really

00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:47.590
expensive. So with that being said lets begin

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.326
so first you open your phone application

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:53.095
as if you are making a call and you type in

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:54.494
the following command

00:00:54.494 --> 00:01:00.291
*#06#

00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:02.104
so as you can see here on the screen you will

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:04.285
get a 15 digit IMEI number

00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:06.872
That 15 digit number which is unique for

00:01:06.872 --> 00:01:09.295
every phone and based on this number we gonna

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:12.869
generate the unlock code to unlock this phone

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.352
so this is very important I would say its the most

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:19.035
important step of the whole unlocking process

00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:21.346
so keep it somewhere close because we gonna

00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:23.764
need it later to generate the unlock code

00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:25.784
so I am just gonna put it aside right now

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:27.991
and I am gonna switch to the computer so that

00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:28.883
you have a

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:32.447
because rest of the unlocking process takes

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:35.300
take place on this on a computer so let me just

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.736
adjust the camera a little, so there you go

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:42.575
so open your internet browser and you go to the

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:46.440
website unlockriver.com

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:50.164
now in this website we are gonna request the

00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:52.450
unlock code for your phone

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.670
so we just need to fill in information right here

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.166
in this area ok

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:02.592
so the first field it asks for original carrier

00:02:02.592 --> 00:02:06.295
in this case I have a blackberry from United States

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:07.904
and its T-Mobile

00:02:09.577 --> 00:02:11.782
in your case it can be any other depending on the

00:02:11.782 --> 00:02:13.451
original place where you bought it

00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:16.838
or the currently carrier which it is locked to

00:02:17.468 --> 00:02:19.843
then you select the phone brand in this case

00:02:19.843 --> 00:02:22.840
it is Blackberry and then it will ask you for the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.115
exact model

00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:26.866
in this case we have a Blackberry Q10 which is

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.219
down here

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:31.424
ok

00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:36.206
and the next step is the most important one

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:39.087
here you will have to insert the 15 digit IMEI

00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:42.299
number we got in the beginning of the video.

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.349
Alright so just copy it and paste it here

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.985
so I am gonna just go ahead and paste it

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:48.483
I already have it saved

00:02:48.483 --> 00:02:51.966
so just make sure it is exactly the same

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:55.213
because if there is a mistake here this unlock

00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:57.944
will not work ok so just make sure everything

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:58.965
is correct.

00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:02.221
Up next you have to insert here your email

00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:04.292
where you want to receive the unlock code

00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:06.301
because it is gonna delivered via email

00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:08.514
to your email ofcourse

00:03:08.514 --> 00:03:10.379
so I am just gonna go ahead and write my email

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.486
address here

00:03:12.597 --> 00:03:15.803
and you gonna go ahead and before you click

00:03:15.803 --> 00:03:17.885
unlock now you can see the price of the unlock code

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:20.393
and the delivery time, it will vary depending on

00:03:20.393 --> 00:03:23.703
every model, on every country it depends

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.655
right so we click unlock now

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:30.157
and you are gonna see a summary of your order

00:03:30.157 --> 00:03:32.677
in this page, so make sure everything is correct

00:03:32.677 --> 00:03:35.080
and you gonna proceed to checkout

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.383
as I promised I was gonna show you exactly

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.682
step by step how to unlock the phone I am gonna

00:03:39.682 --> 00:03:41.297
go through every single step

00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:44.516
so I am just gonna complete my payment here

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:46.654
Literally takes 10 seconds

00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:48.206
if you don't have a paypal account don't worry

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:51.040
you can use another credit card or any other

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.334
way of payment.

00:03:52.334 --> 00:03:54.410
But I am just gonna click now pay now

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.109
and you will see a confirmation

00:03:56.524 --> 00:03:59.539
of your payment right now

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.954
so just wait for the screen to be completed

00:04:01.954 --> 00:04:03.218
and as you can see here as it says

00:04:03.218 --> 00:04:05.415
thank you your unlock code is being generated

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:08.085

00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:09.295
for the unlock code

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:12.822
so it will take around couple of hours I would say

00:04:12.822 --> 00:04:15.455
so I am gonna show you how the email will look like

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.121
after you receive the unlock code

00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:21.404
so lets go to my email address to my email account

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.043
so I use email gmail

00:04:25.227 --> 00:04:30.601

00:04:36.378 --> 00:04:39.236
so yeah there you go as I said

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:40.515
sometimes it can take one minute

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:43.418
sometimes it can take 24 hours it depends on

00:04:43.418 --> 00:04:44.625
every model

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.380
in this case we have already received it

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.016
as you can see here it says your

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:49.402

00:04:49.402 --> 00:04:51.023

you will get the actual unlock code

00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:00.699
and for some carriers like especially the

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.200
Canada carriers you will get an extra code

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.213
service provider which I am gonna show you later

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.744
Let me adjust the camera one more time

00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:26.531
so that you have a better angle

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:27.161

so turn on your phone

00:05:31.753 --> 00:05:33.712
if it is not on already

00:05:33.712 --> 00:05:35.464
we gonna dismiss this screen

00:05:35.464 --> 00:05:38.898
we're gonna go to the main menu

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:40.583
alright

00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:41.453

00:05:41.453 --> 00:05:43.734
you're gonna pull down the menu that

00:05:43.734 --> 00:05:45.316

00:05:45.316 --> 00:05:47.441
and you're gonna select where it says settings

00:05:48.554 --> 00:05:50.560
alright once it opens you're gonna go down

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.055
where it says security and privacy

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:55.994
and up next you're gonna click

00:05:55.994 --> 00:05:57.812
where it says sim card

00:05:58.504 --> 00:06:00.760

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.215
you scroll down and you click

00:06:02.215 --> 00:06:04.210

you usually have 10 attempts

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.153
if the phone is new

00:06:13.153 --> 00:06:15.910

is little longer and it works 100% of the time

00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:26.334
so here is where you insert the unlock code

00:06:26.334 --> 00:06:28.162

switched to sleep mode

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.311
