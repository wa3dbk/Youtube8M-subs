00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.290
Do you want to know how to make an archaeologist
really mad, really fast?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.580
Ask her about the dinosaurs she's found.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.950
People use catch-all, shorthand terms for
things all the time, even in science.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.200
Like, we might refer to one kind of physicist
as an astronomer, even if he's never set his

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.670
eye to an eyepiece because the calculations
that he works on have to do with the motions

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.930
of stars and galaxies.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.960
It's just easier for people to understand
when you're at a cocktail party, and it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.010
basically accurate, so no harm done.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.390
But, to use archaeology as a synonym for the
study of dinosaurs and fossils and forms of

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.559
ancient life, which actually called paleontology,
is not lazy shorthand, it's wrong.

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.469
While the two disciplines do have some very
basic principles in common, mixing up archaeology

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.390
with paleontology is sort of like taking your
sick kid to a wildlife biologist for a diagnosis,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.160
or ordering a birthday cake from a chemist.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.469
People might understand why you've made that
mistake, but they would also tell you that

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:03.829
you are way off.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.640
So let me help you know your scientists.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.680
Archaeology, first of all, is the study of
the human past through material remains.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.500
Not human remains at least the majority of
the time, but through the traces that people

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.990
have left behind in the process of living
their lives.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.800
Those things could be artifacts, basically
any objects that a human made or used, or

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.400
features, things that people made that can't
be moved, like a wall or a ditch or an old

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.760
hearth full of charcoal.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.030
Paleontology, by contrast, deals with the
even more distant past; it's the study of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.460
ancient life of all kinds, mostly but not
always by investigating fossils, the mineralized

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.890
remains of living things.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.190
It kind of makes sense that the two fields
are often confused for each other because

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.440
they both use science to understand history,
and they both involve a lot of digging.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.360
In fact, the main thing that archaeology and
paleontology have in common is the basic understanding

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.220
that the deeper down you dig below earth's
surface, the farther back in time you go.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.920
The surface of the earth is always reworking
itself, after all, whether it's because of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.000
plants dying and turning into topsoil, or
volcanic eruptions covering everything in

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.810
ash, or floods laying down new layers of sediment.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.200
That's why both archaeologists and paleontologists
are trained in the science of reading these

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.770
layers, a branch of geology called stratigraphy.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.840
But that's about where the similarities end,
because archaeologists and paleontologists

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.799
explore the strata of earth at different depths,
looking for different things.

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.129
You might not have to dig too far to find,
like, stone spear points from a few thousand

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.799
years ago, but to reach back further into
the past and find a fossil of a Pteranodon,

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.700
you got to get into older layers of earth.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.829
So archaeologists study human history, but
humans have been around a long time, and we've

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.909
left a lot of history lying around, so it
makes sense that there are different kinds

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.010
of archaeology.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.689
Since most of our history hasn't been written
down, a lot of archaeologists study prehistory.

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.599
Now prehistory doesn't mean before there was
history; obviously there's always been history,

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.349
but simply a time before historical events
were documented, either in writing or in oral

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.069
traditions that can help us understand what
we find in the ground.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.599
So the investigation of cultures that thrived
before they fixed their history into words,

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.409
is prehistoric archaeology.

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.349
The stone age dwellers of the Levant, the
hunter-gatherers of America, even the cultures

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.930
that created Stonehenge and the great houses
of Chaco Canyon all fit into this category.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.889
But even after historical records started
to become a thing, there were still lots of

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.599
gaps for us to fill in.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.719
So historical archaeology is dedicated to
exploring the lives of people who lived during

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.719
recorded history.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.879
Classical archaeology, for example, focuses
on ancient western cultures like those of

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:28.950
Greece and Rome.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.709
Industrial archaeology explores old ways of
engineering, mining and manufacturing.

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.790
There's even a whole sub-field of maritime
archaeology, which just investigates shipwrecks.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.810
None of these fields, you'll notice, involve
raiding tombs or snatching golden idols from

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.930
booby-trapped chambers, or punching Nazis.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.340
Archaeologists just like to dig and find stuff,
and more often than not, leave them where

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.749
they found them.

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.139
Paleontology is just as diverse.

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.019
As soon as I mention fossils, you probably
go straight to thinking about dinosaurs, and

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.090
yeah, lots of paleontologists study dinosaurs,
but there are even more who study other kinds

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.639
of ancient life, salamanders as big as people,
sloths as big as bears, winged reptiles the

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.059
size of giraffes.

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.999
All of these animals were once real and are
now extinct, and they fall under the umbrella

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:12.299
of paleontology.

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.120
Not to mention all the other forms of life
like invertebrates like insects and mollusks

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.840
and plants and all manner of microscopic life.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.520
There are even fields devoted expressly to
the study of things like pollen and ancient

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520
animal tracks.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.259
So, next time you're at a cocktail party and
somebody says they're and archaeologist, ask

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.520
them about what sites, artifacts or features
they're working on.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.000
Maybe ask whether they do historic or prehistoric
archaeology, or if they work in the ground

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
or underwater.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.060
Just please, for the love of Pete, do not
mention dinosaurs or Nazis.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.050
