00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:04.279
Hi, I’m Terry Stewart with the Department
of Animal Sciences at Purdue University.

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.301
Tibia Hemimelia or typically goes under the
name of just TH is a condition where you have

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:18.530
a small body, very severe shortening of the
limbs, especially in the hind end. Has been

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.330
seen a little bit, recently in the Shorthorn
breed of cattle. The Shorthorn breed association

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.090
can do a pedigree search and tell you whether
your animals are suspect of this particular

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.680
defect and there is also a genetic test available
through various testing labs where you can

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.649
send in a DNA sample to verify whether an
animal is a carrier or not. Contractural Aracnodactyly

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.949
is a new genetic condition by name, but it
has been talked about in the last few years.

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.829
It is the one we have been calling fawn calf.
The American Angus Associaiton just announced

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:02.800
last week, which was july 20th, that a genetic
test will soon be available for this particular

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.820
condition which is, again, a single locus
recessive condition. The trait is characterized

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.670
by calves at birth having a very fawn-like
appearance, they tend to be frail, they have

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.090
a little bit of a hunched appearance and kind
of a hoppity gait., very reminiscent of a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.610
deer fawn. The main thing is to check with
the breed assiciations to stay up to date

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.810
on when these genetic tests will actually
be available in the laboratories. It is my

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.491
understanding that several of these AI companies
have already released information on the carrier

00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:42.100
status of sires that are available in their
line-ups, so if you’ve been utilizing AI

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.149
sires, you may want to check with your semen
supplier and see what information they can

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.399
give you.
Here is an example of hydrocephalus in cattle.

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.329
Hydrocephalus occurs in all mammals, that’s
why we put the picture of the little Chihuahua

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.749
down there just as a pointer that it occurs
in all mammals. Hydrocephalus is also called

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:07.369
water on the brain. It is typically controlled
by a single locus allele. There is also the

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.069
condition called neuropathic hydrocephalus
that’s been occurring specifically in the

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.900
Angus breed that is related to this condition.
There is a genetic marker for neuropathic

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.459
hydrocephalus. There is not a general genetic
marker for all types of hydrocephalus available

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.069
today. If you are having concerns that some
of your cattle may be carriers of neuropathic

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.900
hydrocephalus, check with the breed association
first and you can do a pedigree search and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.599
if the animal is suspect based on a pedigree
search, there are labs that can do a genetic

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.459
test for you.
Arthrogyposis multiplex, or better known as

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.490
curly calf because it is harder to say all
those other words has recently become of concern

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.930
in the Angus breed and a lot of public attention
has been paid to it. As you see in the right

00:02:52.930 --> 00:05:32.240
hand side,
there

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:55.849
is

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:11.680
a

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:52.729
picture

00:06:52.729 --> 00:07:25.169
of a white calf
