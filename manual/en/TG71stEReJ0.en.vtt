00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.400
DSM helps many cheesemakers and their
crafts to produce the best cheese possible.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.120
Today we focus on cheese ripening.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.840
The most lengthy part
of the cheesemaking process.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.040
But also the part which greatly determines

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.000
the flavor, texture,
and the quality of the cheese.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.240
During ripening there is always
a risk of mold growth on the cheeses.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.680
Some producers have found a good
alternative to prevent this

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.480
without adding any preservatives,
like CaBre in Italy.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.240
We embarked on this journey
with DSM about three years ago

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.360
in order to create a product
that is entirely free of preservatives.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.440
The Pack-Age solution
that was proposed to us

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.360
was seen as an important tool
in meeting our objective:

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.560
Making cheese without preservative but
with a rind that is completely edible.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.840
What we did, is apply this technology

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.360
to a specific type of product, provolone,
which will be packaged and cut

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.200
where there is a consumer demand
for a product without preservatives.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.960
Using this type of packaging
allowed us to develop this product

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.040
with significant increases
in production yields.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.600
The product has a higher yield
during the ripening process.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.320
It prevents the proliferation of molds
and reduces the formation of scrap

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.200
which is a loss
we're left with after cleaning the cheese.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.520
As for other cheeses, if we use
this packaging for grated cheeses

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.240
we can grate all of the cheese,
resulting in a 100 percent yield

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.320
because the rind isn't moldy or hard.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.200
You can use the whole cheese.
That's another important advantage.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.480
Package offers the best possible
combination.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.640
In terms of value, cheese taste,
texture and preservation.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.720
Especially suited for hard
to semi-hard cheeses.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.760
It's a desired natural ripening solution
for a broad range of cheeses.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.800
If you want to get more from your cheese
the natural way

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.400
DSM can help you make it happen.
