Hey guys

00:00:03.927 --> 00:00:05.927
Today we'll be making this really cute pop tart pillow

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:06.993
and the best part is there's no sewing required

00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:09.116
so let's get started

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:15.835
First you'll need some fleece

00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:19.254
fold it in half and trace your square pattern onto it

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.360
once you've cut it out you should have two identical rectangles 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.894
one for the front and one for the back

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:49.034
now just glue the outside edges of the pop tart together

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.513
just make sure that the good side of the fleece is facing inward because you're going to turn it inside out later

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.840
leave a little bit of space open at the bottom of the pop tart so that you can fill it with stuffing later

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.140
Once you've done this you can go ahead and turn it inside out and then add your filling

00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:33.414
Once you've finished stuffing your pop tart you can seal up the remaining hole

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.720
now you will need some frosting

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:43.168
I'm just using an old t shirt that I never wear, but you can use anything you like

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:52.354
Then just cut it out

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:56.698
Once you've glue the frosting onto the pop tart, it should look something like this

00:02:06.613 --> 00:02:08.613
Now it's time to add the face. I'm just using some goggly eyes and a cute smile that I cut out of felt

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.880
finally its time for the sprinkles

00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:18.528
I'm using heart shaped confetti

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:19.913
but you can use anything you want

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:28.334
And that's it, you're done!

00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.811
