00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.080
Kids: ''Yeah, so cool!'' ''This animation
is so real!''

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.819
30 years I've been doing this...

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.290
...And I've seen a lot of other games come
and go.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.089
Kinda sad.

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.059
Think about all those guys from ''Asteroids''

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:13.940
BOOM, gone.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.939
Centipede? Who knows who that guy is, you
know...

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.760
Look, a steady arcade gig is nothing to sneeze
at

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.439
I'm very lucky.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.460
It's just...

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.349
I gotta say... It becomes kinda hard to love
your job when no-one seems to like you for doing it.

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.349
All clear, the arcade's closed.

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.070
Shoryuken!

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.160
Whooh, what a day...

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.559
So, you wanna head to Tapper's, Ken?

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.789
If you're buyin', buddy.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.350
Quitting time!

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.190
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.980
I don't know... Maybe I wouldn't be feeling this way if things
were different after work...

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.430
But, it is what it is.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.650
Felix: Good job everyone!

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.470
Felix and the Nicelanders go hang out in their
homes...

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.980
Which he's just fixed, and everyone- you know...

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.840
They go to their homes, I go to mine

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.330
Which happens to be... a dump.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.860
And, when I say a dump, I don't mean like
a shabby place

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.060
I mean, an actual... dump.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.400
Where the garbage goes and... a bunch of bricks
and smashed building parts

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.350
That's... That's what I call home.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.260
I guess I can't bellyache too much.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.750
I got my bricks. I got my stump.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.750
It looks uncomfortable, but it's
actually fine. I'm good.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.890
But... if I'm really honest with
myself

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.470
I see Felix up there... getting patted on
the back.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.229
People are giving him pie. Thanking him...

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.229
So happy to see him all the time... Sometimes I think...

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.980
''Man! Sure must be nice being a good guy.''

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.840
 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.520
Nice share, Ralph. As fellow bad guys...

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.630
We've all felt what you're feeling and...
we've come to terms with it.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.200
Really?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.170
Right here, I'm Zangief, I'm bad guy!

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.420
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.080
Hi Zangief. I relate to you Ralph. When I hit bottom,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.340
I was crushing man's skull like sparrow egg
between my thighs.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.980
And I think: ''Why you have to be so bad,
Zangief?

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.260
Why can't you be more like good guy?''

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.230
Then I have moment of clarity.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.120
If Zangief is good guy, who'll crush man's
skull like sparrow's egg between thighs?

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.430
And I say: ''Zangief, you are "bad guy", but
this does not mean you are bad guy.''
