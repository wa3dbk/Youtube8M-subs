00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.700
Hi, my name is Brie Arthur. I'm a landscape

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.140
designer, and welcome to my garden! I want
to show how everyday Americans can turn their

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.900
suburban space into an oasis. So let's go
on a garden tour,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I'll share some of my favorite gardening secrets.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.600
Spring is the perfect time to get your fertilizer out and

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.890
weed your turf, so that you'll have lush,
green grass all summer long. Here's an important

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.100
tip--try to get your fertilizer out just before
a heavy rainstorm, that way it'll get watered

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.000
in and become activated. Otherwise, you're going to need to turn on your irrigation systems.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.100
Healthy turf starts from healthy soil. Be
sure to lay an organic, well dried composte

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.570
before putting out your seed or laying sod. This will enable the grass to feed from the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.000
ground up, and you'll have beautiful turf
all season long.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.400
Another great addition to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.100
your landscape is creating succulent containers.
These are very low maintenance, and add color

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.340
all through the season. They're simple--you
just plant them, tuck the soil around, and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.240
add a little bit of mulch. But one of my favorite
things to do to make my containers unique

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.350
is to add seashells and rocks that I've collected
from family vacations. This adds a great decoration,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.820
and helps reduce erosion when you're watering
the containers. Another thing you may want

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.979
to consider adding to your home living space
is a succulent table. This is a great space

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.979
for friends and family to gather for a meal,
and enjoy a beautiful, low-maintenance planting.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.030
And finally, no outdoor living space is complete
without a focal point of a hardscape--in this

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.690
case, a firepit. This is the perfect place
for friends and family to gather and enjoy

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.230
the garden. Be sure to surround it with plants
that you love, and that bring you great enjoyment.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.480
In my case, I've intermingled ornamentals
and edibles so that I can have a bountiful,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.980
beautiful garden all spring and summer long.
I hope you've enjoyed these lawn and garden
