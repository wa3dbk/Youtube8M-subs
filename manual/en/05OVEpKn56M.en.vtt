00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.709
Hi this is Jon. And in this clip we'll be
creating a parts list. To create my parts

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:14.089
list I'm first going to count up the number
of vertical slats that are going to be on

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:22.390
all the sides. I'm going to have two sides
with four and two sides with three. That's

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:31.990
going to give me a total of fourteen pieces.
And those pieces are going to be made out

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:40.410
of my treated 2x4's and they're going to be
14 inches long. And that's going to give all

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.810
of my sides. Now first off when we're calculating
our measurements a 2x4 piece of lumber actually

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.920
measures 1 1/2 by 3 1/2. So if I take a look
at the top view of my sides, I've laid out

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.800
all my pieces and when I do the math on that
I have 14 inches by 13 1/2 inches which is

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.920
almost square. Now on top of this I'm going
to be having my pieces that overhang. So I'm

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.130
going to be using these measurements that
I calculated as a rough estimate for the amount

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.550
of materials that I'm going to need for my
top cap. In addition my bottom piece which

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:33.420
is going to fit up inside the bottom of my
planter needs to be 11x10 ?. And I'm going

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.030
to go ahead and use those measurements as
a rough estimate for those bottom pieces.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:49.240
When all is said and done my parts are fourteen
2x4x14 inch pieces. And those will cover all

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:58.979
of my sides. I need four pieces that are roughly
2x4x16 for my top pieces. And then I need

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.080
five that are 2x4x about 11 for all of my
bottom pieces. And then of course I'm going

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.980
to need screws.
