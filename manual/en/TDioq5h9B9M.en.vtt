00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:17.598
I’m a scientician assistant.

00:00:17.697 --> 00:00:19.037
What does that mean exactly?

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:22.684
It means I research and filter ideas for the scientist I work for.

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:27.508
His name? Dr. Albert W. Wily, OBE, Ph.D.

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.568
But I just call him crazy Uncle Al.

00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:33.761
Nepotism rocks when you need a job in the evil mad scientists field.

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:36.410
However, crazy Uncle Al doesn't have a high success rate.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.206
The problem with your plans being foiled all the time

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.968
Is that you imagination well dries up a bit when it comes to designing.

00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:46.253
So it is my job to interview young scientists and get ideas for new robot masters.

00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:48.885
And then basically we steal them.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.209
Now my office isn't much. It's basically just a garage.

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:57.049
We need to keep a low profile to prevent our enemies and law enforcement from finding our location.

00:00:57.687 --> 00:00:59.077
So what have you got for us today?

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:03.506
Okay, so you know how androids have a problem working in extreme high temperatures?

00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:04.815
They don't, but go on.

00:01:04.913 --> 00:01:07.856
Well, say hello to Fiberglass Insulation Man!

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:11.601
He uses the sheets of the wall insulation to up the room temperature

00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.128
slowly overheating the circuitry of your foes

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:18.167
as well as simultaneously reducing the cost of your home heating bills, yeah.

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:21.143
Assuming that works, and it won't at all,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.739
Wouldn't upping the temperature just cause the robot master himself to overheat?

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:27.306
I hadn't thought of that.

00:01:27.518 --> 00:01:30.462
What if we use asbestos?

00:01:30.544 --> 00:01:32.390
You know, going off the health risk angle.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.282
And we could call him Asbestos Man, yeah.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:38.144
We're fighting androids. There are no health risks.

00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:40.875
And besides, didn't Marvel already do Asbestos Man?

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:41.758
Really?

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:43.425
That's a stupid idea.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.161
I know.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:45.453
Next! 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.604
Picture this! Mail Man!

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.678
He's exactly like Cut Man, except instead of scissors

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:54.194
he attacks with his arsenal of envelopes to give you papercuts.

00:01:54.357 --> 00:01:56.091
Because you know those hurt more anyway!

00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:59.717
Also he can order anything he wants online

00:01:59.783 --> 00:02:02.285
and get it in 4 to 6 business days.

00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.656
Unless Dr. Wily wants to overnight it.

00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:06.955
You didn't even design a robot master.

00:02:07.054 --> 00:02:08.444
I don't know how to draw.

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:11.518
But I do have this reference photo of Herb, the mailman!

00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:13.136
He's nearing retirement!

00:02:15.148 --> 00:02:16.873
It smells like gasoline in here.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.230
That's the lawnmower.

00:02:18.328 --> 00:02:19.113
Next!

00:02:19.277 --> 00:02:23.168
Introducing Inviso Man!

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:25.654
It's blank.

00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:29.068
Precisely. Your enemies will never know what hit them.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.698
You can't defend against what you can't see.

00:02:33.058 --> 00:02:37.897
What's more fearful than what you can't see?

00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:39.548
You're a con artist, aren't you?

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.396
No. Why would you say that?

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:46.023
Because you brought a blank board claiming to have invented an invisible robot master

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.718
without one mention of a cloaking device.

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:48.964
What's a cloaking device?

00:02:49.045 --> 00:02:50.138
My point exactly.

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:51.070
Worth a shot.

00:02:51.267 --> 00:02:53.955
I once sold an air guitar on eBay. Box included.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.576
Get out.

00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:55.378
Really, I did.

00:02:55.492 --> 00:02:56.931
No, I mean get out of the office.

00:02:57.062 --> 00:02:57.961
It's a garage.

00:02:58.043 --> 00:02:58.713
Just leave.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.398
Remember Fire Man?

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.126
This guy's just as good!

00:03:02.257 --> 00:03:04.404
Smoldering irons for hands!

00:03:04.502 --> 00:03:05.712
Iron's for feet!

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:08.067
And his head is an iron, too. Because, you know, because why not?

00:03:08.132 --> 00:03:09.424
Let me guess. His name is Iron...

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:11.173
One Hour Dry Cleaning Man!

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.841
Why didn't you just name him Iron...?

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.032
Because due to the strongly worded cease and desist

00:03:15.114 --> 00:03:17.028
my preferred name was not available.

00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:22.685
even though this concept represents iron so much better than the other one!

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:24.746
So your idea is to iron out our enemies?

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.186
Well the starch may inadvertantly short out their circuits.

00:03:28.252 --> 00:03:31.342
And he will clean and press your clothes in one hour or your money back.

00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:36.018
Why not, say, attack him with all the irons and, you know, burn him!

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:37.980
Well, because he...*cough*

00:03:38.143 --> 00:03:40.972
He obeys Asimov’s 3 laws of robotics.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.638
You built a robot master for the purpose of being evil

00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:45.874
and programmed it to refrain from being evil?

00:03:45.972 --> 00:03:48.965
We need robot masters who can attack, be evil,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.186
as well as occasionally perform household chores and genuine services.

00:03:52.284 --> 00:03:55.054
I failed out of evil engineering school.

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:56.003
Apparently.

00:03:56.281 --> 00:03:58.652
Beware of Vibra Man!

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:02.033
This evil robot creates supersonic vibrations!

00:04:02.262 --> 00:04:04.698
His lair is a rocky mountainside!

00:04:04.813 --> 00:04:09.136
As your enemies make their way, he will cause the supersonic vibrations!

00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:13.175
Crumbling the rocks from the cave dwelling cieling and crushing your enemies!

00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:15.563
Now we're talking! How does he do that?

00:04:15.644 --> 00:04:22.131
Well, he uses his 12 inch gold, semi-conical rod and inserts it into the ground spot.

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:27.200
We’re calling it the Diametric Infrasonic Loam Destabilization Oscillator.

00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:28.639
It has 3 settings.

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.078
So he, umm....?

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:37.962
Yes. Though it may take a while to find the ground spot that will cause the eruption while penetrating.

00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:43.655
When the task is complete, the Energy Pack will secrete a white lubricant preventing rub damage.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.585
Can we please find a different way to describe it?

00:04:45.683 --> 00:04:48.154
I'm being as direct with you as possible.

00:04:48.236 --> 00:04:49.577
And this method works?

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.948
I've tried it our many times on myself.

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:55.141
I wasn't even drinking anything!

00:04:55.207 --> 00:04:57.790
There are technical enhancements that have been made!

00:04:57.888 --> 00:05:02.729
For instance, the oscillater can be ribbed to help in stimulating the reaction.

00:05:02.876 --> 00:05:05.504
I, uhh, don't know what to say.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.349
Some interesting candidates today.

00:05:08.447 --> 00:05:11.243
Usually I take the concepts and present them to Dr. Wily.  

00:05:11.537 --> 00:05:13.404
But I still have some follow up research to do.

00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:19.270
You ready to test the prototype of Vibra Man?

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.450
Be right there!

00:05:23.373 --> 00:05:25.940
Okay, so this job doesn't entirely suck.
