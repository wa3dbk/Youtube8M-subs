00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:20.460
Welcome back to GoodKnitKisses and I'm your host Kristen. Today we're going to to do

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.869
do a rope scarf using ruffle yarn.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.160
this one is Red Heart Boutique Sashay

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.690
and there are other ruffle yarns out
there

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.090
see the mesh on here?

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.380
and we're gonna pull this out

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.730
and make a rope scarf just pulled from
the center here you can pull from the

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.050
outside

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.000
find the end

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.340
and we're gonna make slipknot

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.090
and instead of pulling out the ruffle
part of it we are actually keep that

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.000
part of our project and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.440
work it in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.870
so we are going to make a slip knot take
that back over the front and take the

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.410
back of the front again making slipknot

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.340
and this is done just for their hands
and you could make a more finish peace

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.300
with the large crochet hook

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.410
and check out the Crochet Crowd for some
really good videos on that, too. I'm just

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.940
gonna pull this through and make another slip knot

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.460
i'm gonna stick my fingers through
this little hole right here

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.439
through the slipknot and pull through &amp; tighten up

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.410
and then i'm gonna stick my fingers through
&amp; pull another part of the working strand

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.909
and continue

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.079
this is really very simple and this knot kind of  keeps getting bigger &amp; if you see i'm

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.060
not doing much of anything else but i can
pull on that working strand again and make

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.830
my knot smaller

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.840
so I want to continue on

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.630
making this

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.370
and see how simple it is?

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.660
you can leave holes in it

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.110
i know that michael so like at The Crochet Crowd and has all video he shows how

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.060
to do that and there are some gaps

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.940
but see how nicely this closes up when i
just

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.540
pull it i l taunt like that so i

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.990
pull it &amp; then pull it in like this

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.540
now i can't make the loose ones

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.000
like this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.610
and you get these loose knots but it is not
very consistent and if you use one of

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.430
the new really cool ones that are the
solid colors

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.669
and you want to be more consistent in your gauge

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.899
 your own knots are
coming so i think that the multi colors

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.959
do really well in this method

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.279
this is something that all you want to
do is continue on until you get to the

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:26.269
end of your ball. now you can use half a
ball for a small rope scarf or you can use

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.329
the entire thing I like to use the
entire thing

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:35.289
and then when I get dressed so i can
flip the scarf around multiple

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.729
layers around my neck like a necklace

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.879
and i can hang it at varying lengths. there are
some rope skirts out there where people

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.609
will connect them to be

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.609
all one link &amp; its connected all in one spot but it doesn't let you have variety

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.499
and wear it in any what that you want

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:51.509
so

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.680
I like to do it this way

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.919
and i'll show some pictures of

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.169
ones that I've made this way

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.019
and then all you do in the end

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.769
is you want to cut it

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.989
pulled it through

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.369
take your two ends here

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:15.130
put them together and you can add some
large beads to the end

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.289
to make it a little more fashionable

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:21.489
and go ahead in tie these pieces together in a
knot

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.719
and make sure that your tying this part
together

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.179
in a knot

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.919
not on top of these slipknots here

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.849
take that and you can take
your crochet hook and weave them in here

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.699
and you can make another knot here and
make it a little bit bigger to match

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.369
your gauge

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:44.839

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:51.839
rope scarf had a great day and happy
knitting &amp; crochet!
