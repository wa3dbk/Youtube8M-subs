Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this segment
we're going to talk about how to control Japanese

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.799
beetle grubs. Now the Japanese beetle is originally
from Japan but it's found all over the world

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:18.039
now. And it does lots of damage to plants.
It just eats away the leaves and there's only

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.019
a few ways that you can actually control the
population. It's much easier to control the

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.680
particular plants then trying to control a
whole area. But if you fight it a little bit

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.270
at a time, you can make headway and control
the grub and the beetle because the grub is

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.220
actually a little sea shaped worm that looks
and grows under the ground and it'll eat away

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.190
lawns just like the crane fly larvae will.
So sometimes you can confuse the one for the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.520
other, but they do lots of damage and so if
you get them when they first start, a lot

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.440
of times you can get rid of them naturally,
but sometimes if they control a whole area,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.550
sometimes you have to go and get some kinds
of pyrethrins which are a chemical that will

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.860
kill all the bugs in the area which would
be a very last resort. But we're having to

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.770
do that in some areas where they're just taking
over and its unfortunate because pyrethrin

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.570
is really a toxic chemical, it's just found
in chrysanthemums but they're finding that

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.580
women that wash their animals in a flea bath
that has pyrethrin in the when their pregnant,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.080
there is twice as likely of a chance to have
children with autism. So it's a chemical I

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.050
really don't like to use at all. But if you
do have Japanese beetle grubs, you can protect

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.020
your plants in a lot of ways. Just by hosing
them off with a hose. So if there's any grubs

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.940
in them, a lot of times you can wash them
out. So from the underside of the leaves too,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.590
just wash your plants very regularly, all
the leaves so even if they're on a drip system,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.770
make sure you water them by hand. A lot of
times by putting an oil, neem oil is an organic

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.240
oil that they're finding that is not so dangerous,
it's still an oil you don't want to use for

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.009
children under two, which makes me wonder
it can't be that naturally OK to use if they

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.340
still don't want to use it on young, young
children, but still, it's a little bit safer

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.409
than pyretrhin and by spraying neem oil on
any of the bugs, that works really well too.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:24.659
But my theory is, if neem oil works, so does
eucalyptus oil, lavender oil, vegetable oil,

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.579
olive oil, any types of oils work really well
with most bugs. So I just try to spray down

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.079
the trees and if you see any Japanese beetles,
just spray them with some oil and that a lot

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.841
of times it doesn't always kill them though,
because some of them can be really big and

00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:44.980
so there's really not a lot that you can do.
But make sure that if you do have problems

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.279
with them, especially near your home, that
you make sure that there's no access to your

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:54.569
house from the outside and close up any little
holes that all and that way you can control

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.359
the bugs inside and outside of the house.
