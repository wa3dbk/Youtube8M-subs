00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.460
In this Ravelry Tips video, I'm going to once
again take you inside my computer and inside

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.559
my Ravelry account to show you how to do different
things on Ravelry.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.820
And in this video I'm going to show you how
to add a project, which is a simple enough

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.350
thing but really important on Ravelry.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.030
We're all putting in all of this information,
and we're able to get information back out,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.140
and you don't even know the tiniest thing
about needle size or yarn amounts that you

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.960
use could actually really help another person.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.129
And the projects that we add and the information
that we add to our notebooks is really the

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.950
building blocks of the community and the information
that's shared.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.190
And depending on the time you have or the
amount of information you're willing to share,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.359
you could share more or less, I'm gonna walk
you through the steps for adding a project,

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.139
and we'll go through the different options
that you have.

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:59.309
Let's go ahead and take a look.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.470
I'm here on my notebook page and I'm going
to click on Add Project here at the top of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.750
the page.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.610
And for this first field that says Name Your
Project, and I can name the pattern anything

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.510
at this point, it's my own name.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.880
I'm going to say Mom's Cowl.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.290
Then Craft is Knitting, and this pattern is
available on website or download.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.090
The next field, Name of Pattern, you actually
have to put the name of the real pattern in,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.360
which is Sixes and Threes Cowl.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.260
And the pattern source, you can leave this
blank.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.820
I happen to know that Very Pink did this pattern.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:50.290
And once I have that filled out, I click Continue.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.820
And once this page comes up, it's going to
show me, I don't know why it's taking so long.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.570
There we go, it shows me the search results.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.890
You know, because if I put in part of a pattern
name, it would give me more search results,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.280
but there's only one pattern called Sixes
and Threes on Ravelry.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.480
And that's the pattern there, sure enough,
so I'm going to choose that pattern.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.430
And then it takes me to kind of the project
page for this pattern.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.590
And this is where I have the option to fill
in a whole bunch of stuff or not very much

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.650
stuff.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.129
The name is Mom's Cowl.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.849
I can say who I'm making it for, link to a
Raveler, the size I made, the pattern name

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.450
is already in there.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.599
And tags, this is helpful if other people
are looking for things or you want to find

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.180
something in your own pattern.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.819
I could type in Cowl Stripes, and then click
this tag button.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.349
And it gives me suggested tags that I can
select, if I like.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.379
I'm gonna click past that.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.870
Here I'm going to add the needle size that
I use.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.719
Again, if you don't know, you can leave any
or all of this blank, and just add the barest

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.529
minimum of things.

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.760
And I can click Add Yarn here.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.459
And I'm going to type in part of a yarn name.

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.590
You can type in the whole thing, but I'm going
to type in part to show you that I get this

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.629
whole selection of yarns.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.109
The one I used was Louet Gems Fingering.

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.370
Actually, I think that might be a different
one.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.370
It's fine.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.709
There we go.

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:25.709
Yes.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.609
I can select the colorway and the closest
color, and it gives me choices for dye lot

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.499
and everything else.

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:37.230
Where I purchased it, the purchase date, the
total paid, etc.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.239
And also, because this project has multiple
yarn colors used, I would wanna click Add

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.540
Yarn and go through those steps again, choosing
the other colorway.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.030
This pattern actually uses three colors.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.819
So I'll go through it three times, choosing
the different colorways.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.090
And then when I get down here to the notes,
I can type in anything I want.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.870
Now anyone can read what I type here but they
can be personal notes of something I want

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.870
to remember.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.029
You know, remember that if I want to knit
another one of these to add two inches, whatever.

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:13.709
Any notes for myself here or I can let other
people on Ravelry know any modifications I

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.919
made to the pattern or how much I enjoyed
knitting it.

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.100
The notes are for anything but just realize
that anyone could read them.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.730
Up here I can select the status of the project,
and I'm going to give it a big, smiley, happy

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.560
face because I really enjoyed it.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.530
When I started and completed the pattern.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.380
I don't always enter those things, but you
have the option of entering all this stuff.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.670
You can give a star rating to the pattern
and a difficulty rating.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:49.690
Click Save Changes and then you go up here
to a very important thing in Ravelry, which

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.950
is to add photos.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.760
This is loading but it's going to give me
the option of selecting a photo from my files.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.670
I'll want to have a photo already taken and
ready to go to add here.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.820
So I'm going to select Choose Files.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.600
I think the page is actually still loading.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.000
I'm not sure why things got so slow.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.190
And there's the file I want.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.400
I can search around for it if I need to.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.620
Open.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.590
And then I'll click Upload for Ravelry to
upload this file.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.910
There's one more thing that I want to show
you in this section while this is uploading.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.600
Not while it's uploading, once it's uploaded.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.810
You have the option of selecting several files
at once and uploading them, or I'm just doing

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.810
one at a time.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.820
And it's a good thing I'm only doing one at
a time because this just got really pokey.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.010
Okay.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.670
It is resizing the photo right now, and there
we go.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.020
The thing I want to show you is that we have
... This little box appears at the bottom

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.370
of the photo, and you're able to slide it
around to center the photo exactly how you

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.690
want it.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.750
So I'll get it just how I want it and then
stop clicking and dragging and it'll stay

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.940
there.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.320
And when I go back to the photo, the pattern
details, the photo shows up.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.380
And if I select a whole bunch of photos, they'll
all show up here on the pattern page.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.370
Anyway, I hope that helps.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.030
Again, it's your choice to enter as much or
as little information about the patterns that

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.030
you're knitting.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.070
But we all appreciate the nice photos of the
finished knits for sure.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:32.250
Good luck!
