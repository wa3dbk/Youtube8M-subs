A really important thing when you're using
a good product is a good tool. As a makeup

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.639
artist, personally, I really think that it
makes all the difference. There is really

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.660
no real thumb, but there are a few helpful
hints that I can give you today so you know

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.830
what tools to look for to really apply your
product the best you can. Concealer brushes

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.640
come in different sizes. I usually like a
size that really fits well right under the

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:43.870
eye area. I am using a synthetic brush right
now that has a lot of give, so you can really

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:53.420
curve around the features of the face. And
the trick about a synthetic brush or why I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.710
think it's a such a good idea to go with the
synthetic brush when you're using a cream

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:09.180
base product is that, it won't absorb the
product, so it will just be a medium to spread

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:19.280
the product evenly on the face. If you are
using a natural hair brush like sable, for

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.590
example, it tends to absorb the oils of the
cream base product. So I do think that a synthetic

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.310
brush works best. Look for a nice rounded
brush so you can really blend smoothly. Another

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:44.950
good idea to blend the product well is to
use a latex sponge. These actually come also

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.670
in all shapes and sizes and they're actually
fairly inexpensive, so you really don't have

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.310
to spend a lot. And finally, really, your
hands; your hands are not bad tools at all.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.870
The warmth of the finger can actually spread
a product much more evenly than maybe any

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:13.000
expensive brush or sponge. You can also, luckily
they come in different sizes too, so you can

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.260
maybe go in with your smaller finger to blend
smaller areas and maybe with your thumb, you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.950
can blend out larger areas of the face. Just
make sure you sanitize your hands frequently,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.530
because you really don't want to bring in
extra bacteria onto the face.
