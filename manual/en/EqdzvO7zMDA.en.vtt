00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
Chairman: Dear Director.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.120
Please

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.580
do not attempt to recast this investigation as
some type of personal vendetta.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.320
Our questions to this point

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.620
have been fairly standard.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.560
Your reactions have not.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.920
As such,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.440
we have secured all your records and logs

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.700
by the authority granted us by the UNSC.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.300
Now we shall see exactly what it is,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.400
that you have to hide.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.420
Washington: Alright, we got in,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.900
but that's only part of our mission.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.440
So no celebrating yet.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.720
Grif: Aw shit, and I was gonna be in charge of confetti.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.860
Washington: We still need to reach the A.I. storage facility.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.520
Security's tight 
since the Freelancers tried to break in here.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.420
Church: You mean when they tried to steal the Alpha before?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.240
Washington: Exactly.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.980
Grif: The Freelancers tried to break into 
their own command facility?

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.060
That's dumb.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.020
Simmons: That's what we're doin' right now you jackass.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.600
Grif: So? Just because we do something 
doesn't make it smart.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.700
Simmons: *sigh*

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.740
Tell me about it.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.460
Washington: I have the necessary clearance
to get close to the storage hall.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880
The plan is, I'll take Church as a prisoner.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.980
If I take more than one of you it won't be believable.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.220
Caboose: Agent Washington,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.580
I want you to take me instead.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.560
Church: What're you talkin' about?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.020
Caboose: I will be your prisoner.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.340
Let Church go.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.820
He doesn't have anything to do with this!

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.600
Church: Caboose, I'm not actually going to be a prisoner.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.980
I'm just gonna pose as one so that we can get past-

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.300
Caboose: Have a good life Church.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.160
Don't worry.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.180
I won't tell them anything.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.160
They won't get any information out of me.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.260
No matter how

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.840
nicely they ask.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.420
Church: Oh my God, just shut up.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.620
Sarge: Sacrificing himself for his CO.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.920
What a good soldier.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.880
Why can't you two be more like him?

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.060
Grif: What, braindead?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.760
Simmons: I would sacrifice Grif for you Sir.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.260
Sarge: I know you would Simmons.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.860
But it's just not the same thing.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.960
Simmons: No but seriously I would.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.860
Just give me the word.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.600
I'll do it right f***ing now, let's go.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.140
Bring it.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.380
Grif: Why are you taking Church?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.500
What about the rest of us?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.840
Washington: We're sneaking past seven levels of 
armed checkpoints.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.880
Are you volunteering?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.580
Grif: Uh, it was a hypothetical question?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.340
Washington: The rest of you hole up 
and wait for us to finish.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.840
And don't touch anything.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.160
Sarge: How will we know when you're done?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.200
Washington: When you see every guard in the base running in one direction?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.100
That means we're probably in trouble.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.020
Church: All the guards?

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.520
Whu- yuh- wait, wh-why are we taking Church, again?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.860
Washington: Just keep the guards off of us,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.660
and we'll radio when we're in position.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.300
This will be our extraction point.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.400
Grif: Keep them off you?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.320
Church: Yeah. Distract them, dipshit.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.160
Grif: How?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.000
Washington: Well,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.500
this is the center that came up with 
all the ridiculous scenarios

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.360
you guys have suffered through over the years.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.420
So have fun.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.640
Break some shit.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.520
Guard 1: Hold on, don't come any closer.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.100
I need you to stay right there, Sir.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.100
Washington: Understood.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.960
I need access to the next level.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.280
The Counsellor wants to interrogate another survivor from Outpost 17B.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.820
Guard 1: What?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.620
I thought all the Blues at Valhalla were dead.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.780
Where'd this one come from?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.160
Washington: I don't have to explain anything to you, soldier.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.160
Stand down.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.000
Guard 1: Sorry Sir, I didn't mean anything by that-

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.600
Washington: That's fine.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.540
I'll let it go.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.500
As you were.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.100
Guard 1 : Something doesn't seem right to me.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.320
I'm gonna have to call this in.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.240
Washington: Absolutely.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.320
Call it in.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.260
Let me just

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.760
NOW!

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.440
...

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.560
Church: Uh, hey can I get a little help I'm, out of bullets.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.440
Thanks.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.120
Simmons: This patrol was 17 seconds late.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.460
Who's runnin' this place?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.000
How inefficient.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.340
Sloppy...

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.320
Sarge: I'm bored outta my gourd.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.100
Grif: So what?

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.100
Bored is good.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.380
Bored means we're not dying.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.800
Boredom I can deal with.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.880
I have years of practice.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.100
Caboose: Yes! Grif talked,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.620
I won,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.680
I won the who can be the quietest game again.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.100
Grif: Yeah, good job.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.060
That's ten in a row for you Caboose.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.180
Hey, you know what? We should play again.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.520
Best 11 out of 21.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.380
Caboose: Yes.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.180
You're all going down.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.300
Simmons: Heh. We should try holding our breath next.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.840
Sarge: Well that's it. I can't stand just sittin' around.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.620
I'm goin' mad with anticipation.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.420
Simmons: We've only been here 12 minutes.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.240
Sarge: Are you sure?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.840
My mission clock says three days.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.780
Simmons: *sigh*

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.600
That's because you wouldn't synchronize 
at the start of the mission,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.340
remember?

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.780
I said we should synchronize,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.460
and you said

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.500
"Why would we synchronize?

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.480
It's like we're in the future, 
seeing what the enemy does before they do it.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.120
Why would we give up the advantage?"

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.060
Sarge: Come on, Simmons,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.540
who could possibly remember an annoying conversation

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.080
we had three whole days ago?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.500
Simmons: Twelve minutes ago.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.780
Sarge: Grif, what's your clock say?

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.420
Grif: Um,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.540
actually mine's a countdown 
to the next episode of Battlestar Galactica?

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.600
Priorities dude.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.820
Caboose: Ah- ah- I just won again!

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.680
Man,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.300
you guys are really bad at this game!

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.800
It's-

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.800
it's like you're not even playing at all!

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.140
Washington: Here. This is it.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.760
Church: Whoa.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.780
What is this place?

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.220
Washington: It's the storage facility for all the A.I.s.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.340
The rejects, the bad variants...

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.680
everything is here.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.020
Everything.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.400
Church: Dear lord,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.280
what're all these lights on the walls?

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.580
Washington: It's holographic storage.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.280
Church: And one of these things is Alpha?

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.760
Washington: You work on closing that door.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.340
I'll find what we're looking for.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.160
And when I do, every soldier on base is sure to come running.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.220
So be ready.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.800
Voice: Washington.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.360
Washington.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.660
Washington.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.920
You suck.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.420
Washington: Church I got it, get over here.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.540
Here, this is it.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.420
There.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.000
Church: Oh, great you found it already?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.340
Ow! Ah!

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.420
Washington: What's wrong?

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.460
Church: Nothing I just had like a weird flash-

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.120
uh,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.660
ah!

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.760
Washington: Are you alright?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.480
Church: Yeah, I think it's this thing.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.280
It's like,

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.460
sending out images.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.980
Is this the Alpha?

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.620
Washington: No.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.360
This is not the Alpha.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.320
Church: No?

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.420
Then what is it?

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.140
Washington: This,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.620
is Epsilon.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.840
...

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.460
This is my A.I.
