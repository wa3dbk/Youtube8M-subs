Kazuhisa Watanabe

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.496
Q: Tell us about the fight.

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:24.739
A: I don't like ground techniques. I thought I could power my way through, but I wasn't sure what to do.

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:46.928
Q: Were Tokoro's ground techniques too strong?

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:52.201
A: Well it wasn't so much that,

00:00:52.201 --> 00:01:03.206
but when I punched him and knocked him down,

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:12.006
I didn't know what to do after that.

00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:18.883
Q: You need to study more?

00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:56.502
A: Yes. Power isn't enough. I thought I could handle it at the end, but I couldn't and I realized the power of grappling.

00:01:59.928 --> 00:02:12.974
Q: Which are you more suited to, K-1 or MMA?

00:02:12.974 --> 00:03:01.569
A: I want to show my physical skill and my boxing skills so I'll take any fight.

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:11.316
I haven't won any fights this year so I'm not happy.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:27.073
I prayed, but it didn't help this time either.

00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:42.961
Q: Your abilities were highly praised this match.

00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:50.494
A: That makes me happy.

00:03:50.494 --> 00:04:05.471
I like getting complemented, but I have to learn to finish off my opponent.

00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:22.210
I couldn't trap my opponent and I wanted to press my advantage,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:40.419
but I didn't know what to do so I jumped (laughs).

00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:05.028
But I'm glad they liked my technique.
