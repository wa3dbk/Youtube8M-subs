00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.690
OK guys, I want to talk about why people fail
to increase their vertical jump.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.220
I want to lay down exactly how you can start
increasing your vertical jump in the next

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.410
2 weeks or faster.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.460
The first thing is, why do people not succeed?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.599
First is a lack of knowledge of the correct
principals.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.509
Second is a lack of knowledge of the correct
practices and jump techniques.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.749
So basically that is the difference between
what you do versus how you do it.

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.199
And there is a big difference that I'm going
to go into a little later.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.370
Third of all is a lack of discipline or ability
to apply proper jumping techniques consistently

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.260
over a period of time.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.870
And the last one is simply lack of proper
nutrition.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.590
The first thing you got to understand is that
strength plus quickness equals explosion (strength

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.900
+ quickness = explosion).

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.350
When strength and quickness are applied during
the same muscle contraction, explosion is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.760
the result.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.820
You have to maximize your muscle strength
and you have to maximize your muscle quickness

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.190
and neurological response to create that explosion.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.700
Now: endurance versus explosion.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.219
Training your jump explosion is counter-intuitive.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.380
You go out there and you jump for an hour,
working very hard.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.829
You are sweating, training hard, you feel
the burn and you think you are training correctly.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.090
Most of you are not.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.820
You have to train in what is called the improvement
zone.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.830
If your maximum vertical jump is 32 inches,
and most of your training is done jumping

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.889
at a 12 inch intensity, you are training yourself
to jump 12 inches over a long period of time.

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.240
You are training your jumping endurance.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.350
This is all about the quality over the quantity.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.389
Let me give you another example.

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:45.529
If you were a sprinter training for the 100
meter dash and your coach says you have to

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:49.640
run 2 miles everyday and it is going to train
you for that 100 meter dash.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.789
After that workout you are going to be tired,
you are going to be sweaty and you are going

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.350
to be training your jump endurance.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.939
No sprinter is going to train by running the
mile or 2 mile to run the 100 meter dash.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.939
You will be training the wrong type of muscle
fiber.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.959
So as long as you keep training your endurance,
you are not going to be training the right

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.780
type of fast twitch muscle fiber.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.300
There are 9 variables to your vertical jump
training.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.880
Each is going to contribute to upward explosion
and/or momentum.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.480
An effective program that wants to get results
very quickly is going to target each facet.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.360
So training multiple facets is going to create
greater and faster results.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.240
For instance: flexibility.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.590
Training your flexibility correctly is going
to give you more leverage on jumping power.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.390
Your form, fuel, your stability, you balance.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.140
Learning how to tweak how you jump is going
to help you tweak every aspect of your vertical

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.910
explosion.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.910
Nutrition is huge.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.170
It is huge!

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.170
Nutrition is a discipline.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.250
It is hard to get right but once you get it
correct you are going to maximize your workout.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.050
Your muscles are going to get broken down
each workout and if they don't have the proper

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.010
nutrition to build them back up and strengthen
them and prevent injury and have correct maximum

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.260
muscle gains, guys, you are missing out on
a whole lot.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.740
Now, I am going to tell you this over and
over again (a lot of people are), but most

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.420
of you are not going to capitalize on it.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.740
You are going to need a mentor.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.980
You are going to have questions.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.330
You are going to have legitimate exceptions
to this training program; to any training

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.311
program because there is no one size fits
all.

00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:19.890
There is no cookie cutter program out there.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.680
I provide 100% support via email.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.650
You are also going to have access to a forum
where other people are already getting the

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.300
results that you want.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.450
You can talk to them about their training
and what has worked for them.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.620
Guys, I am inviting you to take it to the
next step.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.020
If this makes sense to you; if you understand
how these principals are going to help you

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.941
jump higher and how training every facet and
training in the correct mode and the correct

00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:46.450
types of exercises, get the jump manual.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.530
I do recommend a weight room but I provide
an alternatives if that is not available.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.120
I am going to provide complete support.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.010
If you have younger kids or you are older
yourself, I guarantee you I have trained someone

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.010
in you situation.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.010
I guarantee it.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.430
I guarantee my training.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.780
That is 10 inches in 12 weeks.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.420
Is it really possible?

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.410
For 95% of you, it is going to be possible.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.540
For the very few of you that already have
40 inch vertical jumps, 10 inches in 12 weeks

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.160
is going to be a stretch because you are almost
at your physical capacity to explode.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.060
But I guarantee you my program is going to
help you reach your absolute physical capacity.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.380
This jump manual does not cure cancer.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.870
It's not going to do all the work for you.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.470
It is going to give you everything you need
to meet your vertical jump explosion goals

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.670
and your quickness goals.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.620
It is going to require a whole lot of effort
and dedication on your part.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.990
So guys, I'm just inviting you to take the
next step.
