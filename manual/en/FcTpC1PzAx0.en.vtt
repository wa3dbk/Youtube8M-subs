Hello, hello, everyone!

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.269
This is Joao from Kenhub, and welcome to another
anatomy tutorial where, this time, I'm going

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.620
to be talking about the anterior thigh muscles
and help you understand which muscles form

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.260
the anterior side of the hip and thigh and
how they work.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.539
Now, without further ado, I want to tell you
that the anterior thigh muscles are comprised

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.090
by two main muscles, and these are the quadriceps
femoris and the sartorius muscle.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.160
Let's start with the first one here on our
list, the quadriceps femoris seen now, highlighted

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.070
in green here on these two images.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.540
What you need to know about this muscle is
that this is a four-headed muscle of the thigh,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.500
hence the name: quadriceps, "four-headed,"
and almost completely covers the anterior

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.260
side of your femur.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.480
As you can also see here on both of these
images, that the quadriceps femoris is covering

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.620
the anterior portion of your thigh bone.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.219
And you can also see here other muscles...

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:10.939
