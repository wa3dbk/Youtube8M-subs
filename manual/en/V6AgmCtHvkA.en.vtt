00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.790
Today were installing the shower the shower
pan and the sides and the doors and everything

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.380
and we've what I found out is that my walls
are not squire there not plumb they bow in

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.200
they bow out. So what I have had to do is
come in and fur out the wall so that I and

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.100
I am going to have to take a piece of half
in plywood put over this furring to give me

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.020
a good solid back to glue my shower sides
to. It?s been a little bump in the road but

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.429
were making head way. The pan is set in place
the drain is hooked up. Were ready now to

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:42.670
cut our plywood screw it to the walls and
then start putting the siding on. The other

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.399
thing that we had to do is we had to pull
the shower valve out of the wall so when we

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.549
add our half inch plywood we can still get
our shower handle on and make the shower valve

00:00:53.549 --> 00:01:00.679
work properly. So were ready for the next
step. We've squired up our walls we furred

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:07.360
them out and now we have cut plywood to give
us a nice solid backing for our siding to

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.829
adhere to we have cut a hole for our shower
valve and now were in the process off screwing

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.609
off the plywood to the wall and then we will
start putting the siding on. We?re going to

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.859
cut the hole. This is the piece that goes
up against the shower valve and I am going

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:50.280
to cut the hole in it right now. Well there
we go. This is the right side of the shower

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.710
stall and we've put it up for a dry fit and
we want it to fit right down on the shower

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.159
pan so we've scribed it with a pencil. Made
a mark and I need to cut off just a little

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.020
bit so that when we set it there against the
wall it will sit right down on the shower

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:19.950
pan. So let?s cut. We've got our plywood up
we've dry fit our pieces we've cut them off

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.550
so they fit nice and tight and now were ready
to put the glue on and what I've got is a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:35.720
little notched trowel and I will take the
glue and put in on trowel and then just smear

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.140
it on the wall and you want to put it on you
want to caver your area pretty well. You want

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:58.720
this stuff to stick. Try to keep it off your
hands.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:08.510
You really want to get it down on the edges
so that the material will stick good and if

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.030
get any of this on the pan or anyplace that
you don't want. Barbecue starter fluid will

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.980
remove it real quick or soap and water if
you?re quick. I am using this scrap piece

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:32.040
of foam here just to keep me out of trouble.
Now I bought a gallon of glue I won?t need

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.900
anywhere near that much but I didn't want
to run out. So I will have some left over

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.400
when it?s all over. Ok, were just finishing
up our prep work for the first sheet of our

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.880
siding and I'm just putting a bead of cock
down along the bottom so that it will help

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.730
repeal water.
