00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.480
Cedars are one of the most versatile evergreens in Canada.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.660
There are very few areas of the country where you can't grow at least one variety of cedar,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
and they make a great looking hedge.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.700
Hi, I'm Mark Cullen.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.580
You know, one of the most asked gardening questions is "When can I prune my cedar hedge?",

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.520
and the answer is you can prune it anytime of year, even through the winter.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.960
I like to prune my cedars in late spring, and then another light sheering in early fall,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.580
because it's basically producing new growth throughout the gardening season.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.440
You know, pruning a hedge isn't so difficult if you keep just a few basic principles in mind.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.060
1. Start by using the right tools.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.960
For cedars and boxwood, anything your shaping that's fairly soft and green,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.920
I recommend Mark's Choice Wavy Telescopic Hedge Sheers.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.860
They have a non-stick blade, telescopic handles for better reach,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.000
and use a compound geared action with alignment support to make the pruning easier.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.560
2. You want to make sure that the top of the hedge is narrower than the base,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.520
so it's a pyramidal shape.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.880
The idea is to expose the sunshine to the hedge equally, from top to bottom, and let air circulate through it.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.300
The approach is the same, regardless of whether you are pruning an evergreen hedge or a deciduous hedge like a lilac.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.880
3. Decide what you want the hedge to do for you.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.820
If it's a hedge that's intended to be a screen, then let it become more informal and prune it less frequently.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.980
If you want a hedge that substitutes for a fence,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.460
then prune it more frequently, keep it fairly narrow, and make it conformed to the space that you've given it,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.540
and don't be afraid to prune the top.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.720
If you're pruning a yew for instance, you want to prune the top nice and even for a clean look.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.340
Finally, the pruning itself can be done on a cedar hedge virtually anytime of year.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.180
For flowering shrubs like lilac or forsythia, let it bloom,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.460
and within 6 weeks after it's finished blooming, give it a good hair cut.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.460
And there we have it, no magic, no secrets, just a little bit of knowledge,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.060
the right, of course, tools, good quality tools,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.680
and the job of pruning evergreens, cedar hedges, and flowering shrubs is easy.
