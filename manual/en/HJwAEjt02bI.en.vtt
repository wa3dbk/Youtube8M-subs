00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Cycling is great

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.500
It’s fun, fast, affordable, good for you and good for the environment

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It’s also very safe too, providing you stick to a few common sense rules

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.500
Before you set out make sure your saddle isn’t set too high

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.000
A quick way to check this is to sit on the saddle and see if you can rest your feet on the ground

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.000
This is something you may need to do in emergency stopping situations

Next, check the handle bars are secure

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
The tyres are pumped and of course, check the brakes and gears are working properly

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It’s also a good idea to keep the chain oiled and fit a loud bell

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You should do all you can to help other road users notice you

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000
So wear a reflective vest and bright clothing whenever you cycle

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Having a bright white front and red rear light isn’t just essential,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.000
it’s a legal requirement so make sure the batteries are fresh

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
particularly if you haven’t used your lights for a while

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If there is one part of your body you want to look after, it’s your head

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
A CE approved EN 1078 compliant helmet will give you the best protection

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Make sure it fits correctly and get in the habit of wearing it every single time you cycle

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Your ears can alert you to danger that your eyes may have missed

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
You can hear in 360 degrees and around corners too

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.000
So avoid using mobile phones, radios, or MP3 players as these will reduce your awareness of other road users

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.000
If you need a hearing aid to hear properly don’t ride without it

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Following these simple rules will allow you to enjoy all that cycling has to offer

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.500
without the worry

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.500
If you are in any doubt about your bike, clothing and safety equipment

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
check with your local bike shop, they’ll be able to help

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.000
Cycle Smart, Cycle Safe
