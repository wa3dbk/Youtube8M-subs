00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.699
Water has been used to extinguish fires since
man first walked the earth.

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.610
Water fire extinguishers are very effective
at extinguishing solid combustibles such as

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.779
paper, wood, solid fuels and fabrics collectively
termed Class A fire risks, commonly found

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.300
in most working environments.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.000
The water is discharged at the fire under
pressure and works by rapidly cooling the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.050
burning materials.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.760
This cooling produces steam as the water absorbs
the heat and evaporates.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.730
Any unused water soaks the fuel preventing
re-ignition.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.760
Water is the only fire suppressant that works
by removing the heat element of the fire triangle.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.329
Remember a fire needs fuel, heat and oxygen
to survive.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.030
A significant volume of water is required
to dowse a fire and for this reason water

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.990
extinguishers are not commonly available in
sizes smaller than 6 litres water capacity.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.410
The efficiency of water fire extinguishers
has been greatly improved by the addition

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.550
of special additives like glycol and soaping
agents that reduce the surface tension of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.369
the water and encourage the water to stick
to the fire to reduce wasteful run off.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.649
The resulting increase in fire fighting performance
by the use of water additives means this 3

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.960
litre water additive extinguisher has the
same fire rating as this much larger and heavier

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.060
9litre water extinguisher.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.840
Both carry a 13A fire rating.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.899
For optimum fire fighting power.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.349
This 6 litre Water fire extinguisher with
additive has 60% more fire fighting power

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:51.080
than the 9litre water equivalent and weighs
5 kilogramm less.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.709
The lighter weight makes them more manoeuvrable
and easier to use in the event of fire.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:02.420
Of course this lighter weight is a great advantage
when choosing water with additive fire extinguishers

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.009
as the extinguisher is far easier to handle
and operate in a fire emergency.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.710
Our 3 litre Water additive is less than half
the weight of the 9litre water but packs the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.710
same punch.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.250
Fair to say they are also far less obtrusive
in an office environment.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.750
Water fire extinguishers have application
in virtually every working environment as

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.480
solid combustibles be they tables, chairs,
papers , furnishings, plastics or production

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.240
materials are literally part of the fabric
of our working lives.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.340
But, and itâ€™s a big but, Water and water
with additive fire extinguishers can and should

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.219
only be used on Class A fires.

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:52.010
They should never be used on flammable liquids,
flammable gases, burning metals or cooking

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.459
fat fires and never where live electricity
may be present.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.510
To use water fire extinguishers on other than
Class A fires is potentially extremely dangerous.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.090
For this reason they are almost always teamed
with other types of fire extinguishers that

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.239
can deal with the other types of fire risk
present on the premises.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.090
Most commonly water extinguishers with Carbon
Dioxide or a Water Extinguisher with a Dry

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.760
Powder.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.980
Class A fires are the most frequent of all
types of fire in the workplace and in the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.720
home and water fire extinguishers will always
have their place as an economical and effective

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.709
safeguard to quickly prevent small fires developing
into infernos.

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.140
