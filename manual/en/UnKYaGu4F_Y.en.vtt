00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.920
I really feel i've developed a passion for the subject i'm doing, and for the work i'm doing here at the moment.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.840
It's sort of proved to me that this is what I want to go into in the future.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.800
Even though I'm a Microbiologist I've always been particularly interested in molecular biology

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.960
and i'm combining both here.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.280
My name is Rachel Kettles and welcome to my placement year

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.520
at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.960
There's a bit of a catch-22 where you can't get a job without experience, and you can't experience without a job.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.880
I hadn't really heard about the PTY scheme before I started at Surrey and then I saw the range of placements available

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.360
and I was able to decide a bit later on that, actually it would be a good thing to do

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.080
and luckily you can change on to a four-year sandwich degree at any point.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.960
My placement is sort of, half in-the-lab, half out-of-the-lab.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.760
Within the lab I do things such as; nucleic acid extractions,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.560
PCR gel electrophoresis, and then when i'm outside the lab

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.160
it's mostly things such as; keeping on top of my lab book, doing research on the project,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.480
and writing towards the report I have to produce at the end of the year.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.080
It also provides us with the opporunity to train people and show them

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.360
what the research enviornment is like

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.720
and we quite often find that students that come to us on an industrial placement also apply for a job later on

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.080
and those students then have a better idea of what we do here.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.200
They're more familiar with the work

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.480
and as a consequence, it makes them a better candidate.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.840
Now I feel i'd be a lot more able to work in a lab after university

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.240
which I don't think i'd feel able to do if I was going into a job straight from final year.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.840
I really think these skills, the references, and the contacts you gain on placement

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.120
really give you an edge over other graduates when applying for jobs

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.400
and as well as that, I think it's given me the time

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.920
and the perspective to decide what I want to do after university

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.720
and decide whether I want to do a PhD in the future.
