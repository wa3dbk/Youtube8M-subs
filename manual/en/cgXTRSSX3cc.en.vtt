00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:06.603
Yeti!
I am the Yeti!

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.908
- [Finch] Good morning, gentlemen.
- Finch.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:20.920
Where were you last night, huh?
What happened to that
foolproof plan of yours?

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:24.082
Well, I was going for a fashionably-late
entrance and I was too late.

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:27.025
So,
no ladies left.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:29.620
[Sherman] It was a very
special night, very special.

00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:32.326
- [Girl Giggling]
- Guys. Guys.

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:38.698
- I'll never forget this.
- Oh, I'll never forget it, either.

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:43.235
- [Sherman] Thank you.
- Uhh.

00:00:43.312 --> 00:00:47.409
- [Girl] Well, bye.
- Bye.

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:49.418
Bye.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:51.579
[Door Closes]

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:55.113
Fellas, say good-bye
to Chuck Sherman, the boy.

00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:57.855
I... am now a man.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.625
I highly recommend
you join the club.

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:06.103
We were doin' the wild thing...
all night. I'm exhausted.

00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:09.232
I don't get it. I mean,
how the hell did you do that?

00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:14.008
It was just my time.
It was just my time.

00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:17.814
Best of luck
to you boys.

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:23.286
- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.

00:01:23.357 --> 00:01:26.087
You know, we should
be happy for Sherman.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:29.688
[Sighs]
No, we shouldn't be.

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:32.700
You know, I put in months
of quality time with Vicky.

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:35.430
Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:38.200
- This is just wrong.
- No shit.

00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:41.766
How the hell am I supposed
to become Mr. Sensitive Man?

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:45.542
You know, we're all gonna go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?

00:01:45.615 --> 00:01:48.049
I mean, they probably have special dorms
for people like us.

00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:52.851
All right. I got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.

00:01:52.923 --> 00:01:55.391
It's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.826
Er, nah. It's...
It's more than an agreement.

00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:00.057
- What? A bet?
- A pact.
