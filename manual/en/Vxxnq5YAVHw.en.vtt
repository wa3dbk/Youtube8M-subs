00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:07.752
So many trailers are fast.  Time to take it slow

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:09.532
Like a boat!

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:13.220
Leviathan Warships by Paradox

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:19.439
Tactical turn-based strategy in a naval setting, what more could you want?

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.153
Blow up some ships.  You've earned it.

00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:26.556
Four different game modes

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:29.441
You're going to ship yourself

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:33.866
You want to customize that boat?  You want to add some armor?

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.463
You want to add a canon, a laser?

00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:39.905
Customize your fleet and play it against your friends, why not?

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:42.132
You're the boat boss!

00:00:42.132 --> 00:00:44.870
Fight on the waves and save in the clouds

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.962
You don't got to be in the clouds, you're a boat

00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:50.809
Boats can't fly

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.579
Canons, cross-platform, coal engines, customization,

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.741
Lasers, lifeboats, low-tides, leviathans,

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:01.276
boats, bombs, baddies... and birds?

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:03.967
You boat your ass

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:08.762
Single-player campaign stretching across four different platforms,

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:13.127
and when you're bored with that you're going to 
 play with your friends and shoot their boats.

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:18.361
This ain't no sixty dollar title... It ain't expensive...

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.039
It's cheaper than a real boat

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.641
Can't argue with that

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.693
Baby, this boat's going whether you're on it or not.

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.545
"Leviathan" means "big"

00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:32.751
The money we saved on voice-overs we put into the game

00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:38.331
Leviathan Warships from Paradox Interactive and Pieces Interactive

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:41.870
Ship Just Got Real

00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.689
Free shipping!  If you know what I mean...

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.590
But really it's digital...

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.090
There's no distribution costs
