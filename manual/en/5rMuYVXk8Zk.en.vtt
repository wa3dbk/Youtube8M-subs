(THEME SONG) This
girl eats food.

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.420
This girl eats food.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.815
JOANNA: So, I've just got all
the sweets I was never allowed

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:15.455
as a child.

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:18.535
Because when I was younger, my
mom used to lock me in a

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:21.100
pantry with only raisins
and dry Weetabix.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.020
Not letting me have any sweets
made me into a sugar fiend

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.230
when I was older.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.045
Oh, god, there was this guy
at my school called Kevin.

00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:31.030
I remember one lunch break we
all dared him to snort some

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.470
popping candy.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.280
First of all he put it in
his ear, fair enough.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.910
And then we made him snort it.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.240
It was funny for
about a second,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.920
until he was like [UGH]

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.030
and it's all popping
up his nose.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.490
What a dickhead.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.770
So, to make use of all my
culinary skills, I'm going to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.150
make the ultimate feast I
never had as a child.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.170
I'm going to have a popping
candy pavlova,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.640
and my fantasy Alcopops.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.110
ANNOUNCER: Popping
candy pavlova.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.580
JOANNA: Popping candy pavlova.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.379
It's a really easy recipe.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.040
It's just whipped egg whites and
sugar to make the meringue

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.010
base, then I'm going to sprinkle
it with a buttload of

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.540
news agent sweeties.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.610
ANNOUNCER: Meringue mix.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.460
JOANNA: Mm, phlegm.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.790
It feels like I'm cupping
a very delicate

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.040
testicle right now.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.840
It'll be like a fucking
huge marshmallow.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.340
Ah!

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.170
OK.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.740
So they're nice and fluffy,
so we need to start

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.120
dumping in the sugar.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.120
There's loads of it.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.110
You're going to add it
gradually, but it is literally

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.020
a bag full of sugar.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.620
ANNOUNCER: Sugar.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620
JOANNA: I think if I'd been
allowed sweets when I was

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.220
little, and just got it out my
system then and there, I'd

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.870
probably have a much more
refined palette.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.510
Because everyone else my age
started eating chorizo and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.590
liking olives and Guinness and
all the weird flavors, and I'm

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.840
still eating strawberry laces.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.430
The next step is to plop
it onto a baking tray

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.840
just like a cow pat.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.670
And you're going to put it
into the oven for an

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.200
hour on a low heat.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.450
ANNOUNCER: Squirty cream.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.020
JOANNA: So your pavlova's
cooked.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.640
You've had it out of the oven
for a couple of the hours, so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.600
it's nice and cool.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.920
So it's not going to
melt your cream.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.040
I love spray cream.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.200
It gives me a sugar boner.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.300
Oh, yeah.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.212
Just put loads on.

00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:24.320
Don't be a pussy.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.570
Just put popping candy
everywhere.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.522
ANNOUNCER: Decoration.

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:33.000
JOANNA: OK.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.500
Got the cream on.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.060
So now you've got
to decorate it.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.415
I don't mind nice girly
sweets like Flump.

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.180
It's Kind of pretty and pink.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.150
But boy sweets are
so much better.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.780
All the characters on boy
sweets look like they're

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.090
mescaline or something.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.370
Ah!

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.880
It's like a tongue deodorant.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.910
It's not that she's anti-sweets,
my mum, but she

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.520
just wanted to keep us calm.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.870
Because my brother was
fucking mental.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.340
He was always running into
ongoing traffic.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.010
And whenever my dad gave
me sweets, I was really

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.310
obnoxious, that's when I
discovered swearing as well.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.250
She could have given
us Ritalin.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.850
I would have been much
happier on Ritalin.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.100
Ah!

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.980
ANNOUNCER: Alco-float.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.080
JOANNA: So now, for the puberty
portion of my dessert.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.820
When I was a teenager, I
have to say, I was a

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.950
bit of a late bloomer.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.530
So when everyone else was
behind the park benches,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.210
getting finger banged, I was
just on my own, downing

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.970
schnapps and playing
with my Tamagotchi.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.484
Then just finish off with
the peach schnapps.

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:34.665
ANNOUNCER: Schnapps.

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:38.600
JOANNA: Have a swig of that.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.590
Mm.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.940
Peachy.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.920
Now it's got just enough room
for a dollop of ice cream.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.496
There we go.

00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:46.730
Look at that.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.750
The perfect peaches
and cream drink.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.240
So, there's my popping
candy pavlova and my

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.876
fancy Alcopop float.

00:03:55.876 --> 00:04:01.310
[EXPLOSIONS]

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.854
(THEME SONG) This
girl eats food.

00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:06.640
This girl eats food.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.115
This girl eats food.
