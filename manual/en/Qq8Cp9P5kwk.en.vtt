00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.000
In the morning at 7 o'clock I bike to my shop.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.160
And around 7:30 I start baking the cupcakes.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.000
At 9:30 the shop opens, so I have to be ready.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.000
My favorite cakes are the ones with fruit of the season. 
If there are Strawberries, you have to use them...

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.000
If there is Rhubarb, you have to take it when it is fresh and available.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.000
I really enjoy baking.
It makes me very happy to work this way in the shop.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.150
I enjoy working with fruit of the season and to make nice products.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:16.120
The customers really enjoy my pastries, freshly baked, on the season. It's really good!

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.150
If you would ask me what is the best cake of the shop... 
I would probably say, just try the cupcakes...

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.100
Many of them are made from the same recipes as the cakes... 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.100
so you can try everything, taste it and share it with friends... 
that's really nice!
