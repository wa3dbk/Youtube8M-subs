00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.649
These are the instructions for an easy origami
flower.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.070
The first step for the easy origami flower
go ahead and grab a sheet of paper and we're

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.750
going to make a diagonal fold with the white
side up, and we're going to fold it so that

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.840
it's nice and exact, so don't let there be
any white paper showing.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.650
Just go ahead and fold it all the way up so
it's nice and precise.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.830
Put a finger down there, and then slide your
finger down, and then over to the side on

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.919
both sides.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.580
Open that back up, rotate it and then do the
other side, the exact same step, so there's

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.570
two diagonal folds.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.989
Open it up and flip it over, so now the color
side is up.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.489
Now we're going to do two book folds.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.170
The book fold, we're going to take that bottom
edge and bring it up to the top edge.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.309
And again, you want to be as precise as you
can, nice and accurate.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.019
Fold that down, open it up, and then fold
the other one, as well.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.680
And after you've done that, go ahead and leave
that fold down.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.470
We're going to pick up the paper and right
where you see these lines, these crease lines

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.030
right here, go ahead and put your hands, pinch
it right behind near the top of that fold,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.409
and what we're going to do is we're going
to bring both of our fingers and bring it

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.810
together, so that all four corners are going
to come up and touch each other, right there

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.150
at the top.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.810
And then, go ahead and flatten that down to
make the square base.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.890
And we're not going to make any new creases,
this is just using all the creases we've already

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.170
made in the directions we've already put them.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.729
So nothing new is happening, we're just making
a new orientation for how all the flaps fold

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.820
together, and make sure that you have two
flaps on one side and two flaps on the other,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.390
instead of having three on one side.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.829
Make sure that it's nice and even just like
that.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.360
Next put the paper down and you want to find
out which side has these flaps, these excess

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.360
flaps.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.360
You want to have that pointed away from you,
so this is going to be the top of the model

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.329
with the flaps.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.880
At the bottom of the model we're going to
do two kite folds, so go ahead and take these

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.860
two edges.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.869
We're going to fold them into the middle of
the paper and it' going to line up right on

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.869
that middle line.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.160
So go ahead and fold that on the left side,
the right side and then also the back.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.250
Flip it over and do the two sides on there
as well, and when you do it on the back they

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.430
should line up and everyone should match right
there just like that.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.440
Next we're going to take the bottom of the
paper and we're going to fold it up to the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.130
top just like this.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.880
There's a lot of flaps in there, but that's
all right.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.260
Just go ahead and open that all the way up
and squish it all the way down.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.730
Now the last step we're going to open the
flower up.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.910
So what we're going to do is go ahead and
fold this flap back down and then what we

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.260
want, we want to take one flap, just one flap
of paper.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.780
There's a couple of them there, just take
the one flap and fold it down, and then take

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.449
the flap in the back and keep that on the
ground.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.380
So it's going to spread these two other flaps
right here, you're going to want to spread

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.380
out.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.699
So go ahead, and put your finger inside of
them, so you can squash them down, so you

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.290
can flatten them down.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:22.350
And then once they're nice and flat, you can
pick it up and look at it, and that's the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.540
easy origami flower.
