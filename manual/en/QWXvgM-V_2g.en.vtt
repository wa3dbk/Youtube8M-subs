00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.889
Potentially, this could be the crack in the
door that is gonna allow us to really break

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.820
the brain's code and understand some of the
really fundamental important aspects of how

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.100
it is that we're able to see, to remember
things, and ultimately to be able to function

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.830
as normal human beings.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.600
We know that the astrocyte is very important
for the energy balance of the brain, for maintaining

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.870
homeostasis, but what we discovered in this
paper is that it may also be important for

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.399
cognitive function, and in particular for
recognition memory.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.679
The story begins in the 1950s.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:58.079
When Einstein died, Marian Diamond obtained
samples of the brain and her goal was to see

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.890
if there's any difference between Einstein's
brain and her brain.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.640
And she reported that the only difference
she was able to find was in the number of

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.800
astrocytes.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.870
Einstein had more than the average person.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.750
Now, no one took that very seriously because,
again, no one thought that the astrocytes

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.320
played an important cognitive role.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.360
But now that we can study that with modern
techniques, we're beginning to appreciate

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.400
that maybe that's the edge that he had on
us.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.050
He had more and better astrocytes.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.040
The brain is never at rest, and the earliest
recordings from the scalp, called the EEG,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.630
reveal that there were oscillations occurring
at many different frequencies.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.380
You're all familiar with oscillations in the
air, it's called sound.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.330
Well, it turns out there are oscillations
in the brain.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.800
It's at a very low frequency, below the auditory
range.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.890
When you're at rest, the frequencies are low,
in the 10-hertz heart range.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.500
When you're cognitively active, the power
goes up in the higher frequency range, and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.830
in particular the gamma range, which is 30
to 80 hertz, and that's the area we're really

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.080
able to show that the astrocytes could influence
the power in that gamma range.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.840
It's been very difficult to study, and our
results are probably the first that are really

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.270
pinning down the link between these gamma
oscillations and our cognitive function, like

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.700
recognition.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.970
So this study couldn't have been done without
collaboration between three labs here with

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.760
the Salk Institute, my lab, Steve Hyman's
Lab, and Inder Verma's, whose expertise in

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.659
genetics was essential for being able to create
the tools we needed to actually do the research.
