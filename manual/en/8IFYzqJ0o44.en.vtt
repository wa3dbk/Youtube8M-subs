00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.600
When you think
of gingerbread,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.433
you probably think
of the holidays.

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:05.833
Today, we're gonna make
an easy gingerbread

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:09.433
from a vanilla cake mix that
just happens to be gluten free.

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:13.367
I've preheated my oven
to 350 degrees.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:18.467
To the bowl of your mixer,
first place the vanilla cake mix in.

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:22.067
Next, I'll be adding
two teaspoons of ginger,

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:25.533
one teaspoon of cinnamon,
and half a teaspoon of cloves,

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:30.967
one tablespoon of molasses,
half a teaspoon of maple syrup,

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:33.067
and four tablespoons of butter.

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:36.167
You can melt the butter
on the stove or in the microwave,

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:38.033
whatever's easier for you.

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.633
Put the bowl on your mixer.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.800
You wanna mix this
for 30 seconds to one minute.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.967
The mixture will look crumbly
when it's ready.

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:47.833
Use the paddle attachment.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.933
Okay, that looks good.

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.567
Next, we'll be adding one egg.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:00.500
I prefer to crack my egg
into a small bowl

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.767
because if any of the shells fall in,
you don't want that

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:06.633
to get into your mix.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.000
Add your egg.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.333
Next, we have
two-thirds cup of milk.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.433
Put about half of that milk in

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.700
and turn your mixer back on,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.467
slow speed, until the mixture looks
smooth and kind of homogenous.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.867
Okay, that looks good now.

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:28.533
Next, we wanna scrape the bowl

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:32.200
so you get anything that's stuck
to the inside of the bowl

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.533
down into the mix again.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:40.233
Turn your mixer back on
and add the second half of your milk.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.767
You're gonna mix this
till it's smooth now.

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:48.900
That looks nice and smooth.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.467
So, now we'll take
the bowl off the mixer.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.867
And we're going to scoop
our cakes into the mold.

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:03.833
I like to use a scoop.

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:08.967
It's easy to portion
and it's a little bit neater, I think.

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:14.033
Fill your molds about
three-quarters of the way full.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:18.800
Now, I'll put these in my
350 degree oven for 18-20 minutes.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.900
Now you wanna check
the cake

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.433
to make sure it's done.

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:25.233
I like to use a toothpick.

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:27.833
When you poke the cake
and the toothpick comes out clean,

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:29.433
that's when you know it's ready.

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:32.767
I like to use a cooling rack
when I pull my baked goods

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:33.933
out of the oven.

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:37.167
The air can get underneath
and your cakes will cool

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:38.700
a little bit quicker that way.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.300
In about 20 minutes,
we'll be able to flip the cakes

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.533
out of the pan.

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:44.600
Okay, so it's been about 20 minutes.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.800
Now we're going to flip these
out of the pan.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.700
Place a sheet pan over,
just flip.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.600
Remove your baking pan.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.933
Oh, you can see how some of this
is bubbled up over the edge.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:57.967
That's okay.

00:02:57.967 --> 00:03:00.267
So just take a paring knife
and go ahead and trim

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.100
some of that away.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.533
Makes a nice little snack
while you're in the middle

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:08.033
of your project.

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:10.900
Okay, one last little trim
and we're all done.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.133
Your family will be fighting
over the scraps from these.

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:16.333
To finish them,
we'll just dust them

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:19.600
using a sifter with a little bit
of confectioner's sugar.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.000
Looks like snow, doesn't it?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.567
I hope you give this recipe a try.

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:28.433
These gluten free gingerbread
are delicious!
