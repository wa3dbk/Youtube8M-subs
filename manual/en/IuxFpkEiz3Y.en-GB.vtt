00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.920
[Barry] CookieDough711 and boorider123 have requested that we do a granola bar!

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.800
[Ben] So that's what we're gonna do, and at the same time,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.380
[Ben] it's gonna cover up for those of you who want a breakfast for on the go.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.840
[Barry] Perfect!
[Ben] So 2 in 1.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.320
[Ben] We're gonna do a granola bar so it's based on oats

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.580
[Ben] and beyond that lots of nuts and dried fruit and bits and pieces, okay?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.180
[Ben] So that's what we're gonna do.
[Barry] Very healthy.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.900
[Ben] Kinda healthy. High in sugar, but other than that quite healthy.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.120
[Ben] A tin of condensed milk, 
[Barry] Yep.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.080
[Ben] If you could just open that one cos that's what we're gonna use to bind everything together.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.880
[Ben] We've got 250g of porridge oats here.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.160
[Ben] And to that we're gonna add 350g of bits.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.600
[Ben] And at this point, you can put whatever bits in you'd like.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.200
[Ben] Okay, keep it dried fruit, and or nuts.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.300
[Ben] But you could use pumpkin seeds as well, they work really well or sunflower seeds.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.520
[Barry] Bird seeds
[Ben] You could put in some dried mango–they pretty much are bird seeds.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.400
[Ben] But in these, they work really really well.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.820
[Ben] So we've got our almonds,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.940
[Ben] our cranberries and sultanas,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.660
[Barry] It's really sweet, this.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.900
[Ben] Yea, it's just sugars in the milk reduced down to a really syrupy consistency .

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.800
[Ben] So that's fine. So pop that in there and start mixing.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.180
[Barry] All of it?
[Ben] All of it. AAnd this is how easy this recipe is. The whole tin.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.040
[Barry] Gonna do a height of how high it can go. 
[Ben] Got a good drizzle going on there.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.780
[Ben] Don't forget to scoop.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.060
[Ben] Your arms aren't long enough are they really? Let's be fair.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.040
[Ben] You do that, I'll take it down there. {commotion}

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.060
[Barry] We good? 
[Ben] No we need all that in there, scoop all that out.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.480
[Ben] Meanwhile these pecans, I think pecans are a little bit big/

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.340
[Ben] so i'm just going to cut them in half.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.480
[Ben] So this is very much pick and mix this.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.700
[Barry] It's really sticky!

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.640
[Ben] So think of like a flapjack, which uses mainly porridge oats and butter and syrup.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.320
[Ben] It's even easier because the condensed milk takes all the hassle out of it

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.940
[Ben] and there's so many more bits in this than there would be in a flapjack. And nuts as well.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.620
[Ben] And the final bit, just a small knob of butter–if I reach under you there–

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.320
[Ben] melted, that's gonna go in there. It's about 40g.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.700
[Ben] Just enough to help bind it altogether.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.260
[Ben] Now at this stage, you can bake it off in any container you've got.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.580
[Ben] The key: make sure you've got something lining the bottom.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.200
[Ben] Cause it is sticky stuff.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.000
[Barry] I probably used the smallest spoon ever i just realised.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.240
[Ben] Do you know what? Someone commented the other day, you can't stop eating as well.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.040
[Ben] That you of all people, you nibble on everything.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.260
[Barry] Do you have an issue now to that?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.660
[Ben] There we go, so that's gonna go into there.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.720
[Barry] That is really good already.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.880
[Ben] I tell you what, it's not far off a cereal mix, really.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.100
[Ben] A good sort of muesli mix.
[Barry] Could you have that with a bit of yoghurt?

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.060
[Ben] They're different than porridge oats. The porridge oats at this stage are raw.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.040
[Ben] So they're not quite as good- they're not a problem, but they're not quite as good once you bake them or cook them out with milk.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.900
[Barry] ok

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.880
[Ben] So i'm just gonna grab a nice, flat clean spoon to push it down,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.880
[Ben] to all the corners. And then Baz straight into our oven, 
[Barry] How long for?

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.540
[Ben] 175ºC, for 30 minutes and it should go nice and golden around the edges,

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.400
[Ben] but it will still look pale and almost uncooked on top.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.620
[Ben] It's not like a flapjack. It won't go golden, but it is still absolutely perfect.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.800
[Ben] Now after half and hour in the oven, they're gonna come out.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.620
[Ben] Let them cool in the tin, tip it out, cut it up into monster slices.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.000
[Ben] Because it's so cheap, so much cheaper than the ones you buy in the shop.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.240
[Ben] Remember, we want that golden colour around the edge but still quite pale on top.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.620
[Barry] So for CookieDough711 and boorider123, that is pretty much it.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.780
[Ben] Absolutely, it's our ultimate granola bars, SORTED.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.280
[Barry] Beautiful.
[Ben] Sweet, chewy, crunchy,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.540
[Barry] Great for the go.
[Ben] Absolutely.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.620
[Barry] mm! Oh my god!
