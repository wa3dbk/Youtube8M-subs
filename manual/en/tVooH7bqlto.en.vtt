00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:05.053
Badr Hari

00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:14.823
Q: Tell us about today.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.437
A: Well, I lost, so I feel like all the work I've done this year is unfinished.

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:59.819
Q: Did you have damage coming into the final?

00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:07.930
A: I finished the fight quickly, so I had no damage.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.361
I was in perfect condition.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:41.372
Q: Has Schilt changed since the May fight?

00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:52.973
A: It's a different situation. That was a one-match bout, this is a tournament.

00:01:52.973 --> 00:01:59.069
Of course he trained hard, but so does everybody.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.420
That's not what decides the win. It was luck.

00:02:46.783 --> 00:03:04.670
Q: Your thoughts about the Alistair fight?

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:32.139
A: At the last Dynamite!!, Alistair beat me, but I wasn't in the best condition.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:43.247
This time, he said that MMA fighters were stronger, so I had to defend K-1.

00:03:43.247 --> 00:03:59.991
I'm glad I was able to do that.

00:04:52.361 --> 00:05:07.494
Q: Did you use all your strength in the Alistair fight?

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:25.696
A: It's all over and done with and some people might think that way.

00:05:25.696 --> 00:05:31.480
The truth is I just have to accept that Semmy won.
