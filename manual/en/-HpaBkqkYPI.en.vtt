00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.539
What do I love about classic cars?  Well it's really a multi-faceted

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.569
answer for me.

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.400
It's the feeling you get when you're driving
one of these great cars down an open road somewhere.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.899
It's a feeling that encompasses all of your senses from

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:29.899
sites to sounds to smells and there really is
no feeling like it in the world. 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.060
The really cool thing about collecting cars is you're

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.140
participating in a living tradition.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.500
These cars still operating on the roads
are kind of like history

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.210
right before our eyes

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.570
and i think that that experience of
tradition and history

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.570
carrying on day after day year after year is one of the coolest things that happens in our world.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.270
So, when we get somebody that comes to our door at Hagerty seeking just insurance

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.250
what I think we do when we we are at our very
best is we put them on this journey

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.519
A journey beyond maybe where they're experience in the classic car world was.

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.879
Whether it's 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.379
great service whether it's giving them

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.370
access to different sorts of information or a broader world of collecting. We put them on the journey.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.370
and then they get to enjoy their cars the way they want to. That's what we do when we're really rocking it.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.260
And we're never going to stop doing it
because i think it's what we ought to do.
