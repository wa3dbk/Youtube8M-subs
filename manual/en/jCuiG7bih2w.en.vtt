00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.210
&gt;&gt;Dr. Daniels: To all our new staff members
and faculty members, welcome to UT Dallas.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.840
I hope your first few days are as exciting
for you as they were for me when I first came

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.900
here a few years ago. You know one of the
great things about this place is that we expect

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.529
and exhibit excellent throughout everything
that we do and I know that you're going to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.210
enjoy being part of a place that places tremendous
pride on the work we all do. UT Dallas has

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.820
some important advantages over other Universities.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.320
One of the advantages are size. We’re at
a smaller scale than a UT Austin or a Texas

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.770
A&amp;M and this has a distinct advantage for
students and our faculty, and that advantage

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.850
is we can get to know one another. For the
faculty members it means that because it's

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.750
not an overwhelming scale the faculty can
get to know their students and vice versa.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.370
It's that scale and sort of the warmth and
the ambience of the campus that I think attracts

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.039
some of the very brightest people and the
most talented people to our campus and in

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.340
is one of our distinct advantages.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.520
Research universities, in fact universities
in general, are all about the students. That’s

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.909
why we’re here. Our students are our motivation,
they’re our enlightenment. They’re our

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.979
challenge in terms of teaching and learning
from students. There are so many things that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.130
UT Dallas to be excited about, but I think
the one thing that excites me more than anything

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.889
else is trying to imagine what this University
is going to look like in five to ten years.

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:43.149
We're rapidly ascending in status as one of
the major research universities of this nation

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.509
and what we're going to see on our campus
is even more brilliant creative students.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.219
Even more dedicated staff members and even
more groundbreaking faculty members. We’re

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.130
going to be building new buildings. We’ve
planted thousands of trees in the last few

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.979
years and you know what? We’re going to
plant a lot more trees. This is going to become

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.440
a bigger, even more dynamic, even more significant
institution. A Tier One University attracts

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.480
the best and brightest students. The most
creative and accomplished Teachers and Researchers,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.450
and pushes out extraordinarily talented people
and research discovery. The essence of a Tier

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.710
One research university is a major enterprise
that drives discovery and innovation and prosperity

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.110
in our community and our state.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.070
It's so much fun working in a major research
university just down the hall who knows the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.510
next new treatment for cancer might be forth-coming.
or perhaps the coolest thing you hear on a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.320
cell phone will be busting out of one of those
laboratories down the hall.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.020
And as you eat lunch with people and chat
with people it's so invigorating to be part

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.510
of something that's really important. So the
first few days, take it and get stock of the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.320
place. Walk up and down the mall and enjoy
those magnolia trees. Go over to the Student

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.760
Union and scope out some lunch. Try out the
dining facility.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.840
And I think what you’ll find every place
you go is a real sense of welcoming, family,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.450
community, dignity, and mutual respect. After
all, it’s not the buildings that’s important,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.330
important as they are, that make great universities
but it’s the people in those Universities.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.630
So, welcome to our campus.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.890
