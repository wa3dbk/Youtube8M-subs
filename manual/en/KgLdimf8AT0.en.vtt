Eighthinch.com - Everything Fixed Gear
This is the new Eighth Inch Bike Polo Mallet

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.780
Head we just came out with.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.970
Its a one piece injection molded unit from
hdp plastic.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.771
It features a 19mm sleeve which runs to the
bottom of it.

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:25.650
It doesn't come out from the bottom so your
poles aren't going to scrape the ground.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.410
We made it 19mm so that you could use a ski
pole flipped over on the non-tapered side.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.750
It will go right in there.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.860
We're working on some poles that will bolt
right in.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:46.070
What it also features is replacable end-caps
that can screw in with the included screws

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.239
and if you start to wear out your cap on the
bottom you can simply turn it 180 degrees

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.780
and you have a new surface to work off of.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.739
What we're also really proud of is the attachment
syste.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.179
Its a one bolt attachment syste.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:07.880
What you do is youjust take your poleand its
a one holesystem and it just goes right in

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.790
the mallet and one bolt goes in here on this
side and there's a recess pocket for a lock-nut

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.790
there.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.120
That's literally a one tool operation.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.160
You can change poles quite quickly.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.970
So you can see here you just drop the screw
in to the other side.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.170
There's a pocket on the other side so oce
you get your nut in on the other side you

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:45.290
just hold it with your finger, take your four
mm allen wrench, tighten it up, and you're

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.290
good to go.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.790
The sleeve, make sure it doesn't wiggle any
direction.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.790
The one bolt system holds it fast and its
real easy to go.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.510
We also have cut lines on here.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.720
Its 150mm standard if you want to cut it down
to 140 or 130 we provide the lines all the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.860
way around it to guide you in that.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.119
One of the great features about being injection
molded and not a homemade cut is that the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.610
surface is perfectly flat which means your
shots are a lot straighter.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.640
Also the same with the caps.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.200
The caps are so flat that your shots are going
to be a lot more accurate so the mallet heads

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.460
are going to be available real soon.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.210
They'll include the caps and all the screws
you need, also the caps as an aftermarket

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.230
product are available if you want to retrofit
those into your homemade mallet heads and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.030
real soon we'll be releasing our 19mm aluminum
shafts.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.030
Enjoy playing!
