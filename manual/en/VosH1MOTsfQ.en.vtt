00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.100
Curtsy. Oooooh yes--ah, ow.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.390
According to etiquette proper gentlemen bow--ooooh
yes---proper ladies curtsy. Keep going, keep

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.660
going. But the word curtsy emerged in the
early 1500s as a gender-neutral variant on

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.759
the word courtesy. It wasn't until about a
century later that curtsying denoted a feminine

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.230
gesture of respect, obedience or just general
inferiority. Course all sorts of courtly and

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.010
societal rules developed from there on how
to properly curtsy depending on the person

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.430
standing in front of you which usually just
depended on how much money he or she was born

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.210
into. Unless of course you're a debutante
today performing the Texas Dip in which case

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.110
honey I don't know why you're doing that.
Why the are men expected to bow---oooo yes--while

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.489
women curtsy--ooooo yes? Why the need for
these gender differentiated signals of respect

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.460
unlike say how both male and female soldiers
all salute? Two possible answers. Practically

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.940
speaking women might curtsy in order to keep
their head pieces in place. Every proper lady

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.910
knows that bowing with a tiara on is a fashion
disaster waiting to happen. I also wonder

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.610
whether curtsying was preferred to prevent
ye olde boob spillage out of ye olde low-cut

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.509
gowns. The second big reason why women curtsy
while women bow probably has a lot to do with

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.509
the fact that by the 1600s gender-differentiation
was all the rage. This was a time when there

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.530
was a lot of focus on the proper roles for
men and women with men having more public

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.630
facing responsibilities of course and women
being more concerned with the domestic and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.890
also the spiritual so at a time when proper
gentlemen and ladies would live such separate

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.849
lives and have such distinctly different societal
expectations placed upon them for how to act,

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:04.560
it's no big surprise then that they would
also be expected to even curtsy and bow differently.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.170
But I still think it might have a lot to do
with boobs not spilling out. You and you and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.350
you oh and yes you and you too and are we
still doing this I think I threw my back out

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.750
oh my my wrists are getting a bit tired of
doing this. Where did this accent come from?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.630
Oh who knows. Now it's getting louder.
