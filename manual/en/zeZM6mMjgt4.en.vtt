00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.990
How to Grow Tomatoes in Your Garden.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.840
There's nothing tastier than a fresh-picked
tomato.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.750
Enjoy a bumper crop this year with these tips.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.700
You will need A sunny spot A soil test Tomato
seeds or transplants A tiller Garden tools

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.230
Fertilizer Stakes or cages Recipes and plastic
cups and indoor planters.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.230
Step 1.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.760
Pick a sunny spot.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.750
Tomatoes need at least six hours of sun a
day.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.750
Step 2.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.650
Test your soil to find out what nutrients
it needs.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.170
Garden centers often sell do-it-yourself kits,
or you can arrange a test through the Cooperative

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.970
Extension System, a national agricultural
network.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.280
Find a nearby Extension office on the USDA
web site.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.280
Step 3.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.850
Choose the type of tomatoes you want to plant.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.299
Apart from taste, consider the hardiness of
the variety and whether it does well in your

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.140
climate and soil.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.290
Plant types that mature at different times
so you'll have a steady supply of tomatoes.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.360
Step 4.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.320
Decide whether to start your tomato plants
from seeds or buy plants, called transplants

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.320
or starts.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.860
You'll need six to eight weeks to grow plants
from seeds.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.950
Start the seeds in plastic cups with holes
punched in the bottom.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.299
Keep them inside, transferring them to larger
containers once they begin to sprout leaves.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.939
If you don't have a sunny spot for your seedlings,
set them under fluorescent lights for 12 hours

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:27.939
per day.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:28.939
Step 5.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.359
Once the possibility of frost has passed in
your area, it's time to plant!

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.090
Break up the land you will be planting with
a tiller.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.090
Step 6.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.759
Dig a trench about seven inches deep in the
area where you're planning to put your tomatoes.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.710
Add fertilizer, cover it with two or three
inches of soil, and plant the transplants

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.439
on top, spaced 12 to 18 inches apart.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.640
Bury the plant up to the first set of leaves
â€“ the whole stem can produce roots, making

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.700
for a stronger plant.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.700
Step 7.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.829
Water your plants daily for the first week.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.939
As they grow, they'll need to be staked, which
means tying them to a pole so they grow upright.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.609
Sturdy oak stakes work best.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:11.880
Using nylon stocking strips, tie each plant
to a five-foot stake that's inserted at least

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.910
one foot into the ground.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.910
Step 8.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.110
Consider growing your tomatoes in cages.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.569
Except for a little pruning, caged tomato
plants require less labor because you don't

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.590
have to use stakes or ties.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.610
Just put the cage over the plant and push
the legs into the ground to anchor it.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.700
Step 9.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.629
Read up on tomato recipes so you're ready
to make the most of your summer bounty!

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.230
Did you know Every August at La Tomatina Festival
held in Bunol, Spain, people pelt each other

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.430
with tomatoes in what's billed as the world's
largest food fight.
