TONY KAPECHUK: Hi, my name is Tony. And on
behalf of Expert Village, I'll be showing

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.840
you how to turn this check socket into a laminated
definitive prosthesis. Now that our lam is

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.930
set after about an hour or so, we can trim
it off and prepare to knock out all the plaster

00:00:13.930 --> 00:01:06.850
that's inside.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.039
Now, we're going to draw some guidelines on
here to give us an idea of where we want to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:24.389
cut off this extra material.
Now, we're ready to cut. Now, we're in our

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.079
grinding room. This is where we'll cut off
our extra material and knock out the rest

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.249
our plaster. We'll be using a cut saw for
this job. You want to be sure to wear a protective

00:01:33.249 --> 00:02:43.500
earring and a dust mask. Now, we'll just use
a screwdriver to pop up the top here. We'll

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.999
remove our felt; we won't need it anymore.
