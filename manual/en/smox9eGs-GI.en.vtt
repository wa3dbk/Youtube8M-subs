00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.199
Now you might say to yourself,

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.150
why is Bryan stopped on this road? Is it
to shoot close ups of those yellow flowers? And the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.830
answer is

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.059
no, but sort of, not quite, maybe.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.740
Actually why I've stopped was because of that
lone tree

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.100
on the dike here in West Friesland, Holland.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.189
Hi I'm Bryan Peterson and you are
watching Adorama TV.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.390
Adorama TV presents you keep
shooting,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.860
with Bryan Peterson. Where you'll learn unique
and creative techniques that will

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.750
elevate your photography skills.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.379
Hi I'm Brian Peterson and I'm the author of
the new revised edition of, Learning

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.600
to See Creatively. 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.440
As I mentioned I'm here on a dike you
can clearly see.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.460
I'm in West Friesland, Holland about 45
minutes north of Amsterdam,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.219
and the challenge that I am presenting to
you today is simply this:

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.770
selective focus. Which when done
correctly in a situation like this,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.799
will allow you to get down low, that's step
number one, and then

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.799
utilizing the flowers themselves as
little points

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.720
to create mergers with the busy
background of those houses.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.799
So you'd be moving around here too
noticing the butter cups, in this case, or

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:18.939
yellow dandelion's.

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.600
And how they line up and hide that
somewhat busy background beyond the tree.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.220
You will be shooting an aperture around
5.6.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.000
Focal length in this case is at 35-50mm range.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.470
And subsequently we're gonna end up with a lone tree

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.829
in what appears to be a meadow of massive

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.850
amounts of yellow flowers, and again
hiding

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.049
all those houses and distractions in the
background when combined with a

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.270
low point of view, and utilizing the
flowers as a way to block those houses.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.380
Hi this is Bryan Peterson inviting you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.740
to check out Adorama's latest contest

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.360
this could be your chance to win some
great prizes.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.659
We're all set up. I'm at 5.6. I'm gonna
get down low here and there is the tree.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.240
 This beautiful already.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.640
Moving over just a a bit this way. That
one white house is a small problem.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.870
Now it's gone. Click, and take a look at that.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.050
Pretty simple stuff. Again

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.530
selective focus, 5.6 keeps the
field limited

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.670
to the focused tree, and all that
foreground that we see there

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.519
is nothing more than out of focus yellow
flowers. You're racing off to the tulips.

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.599
Great idea but in your haste to get
there

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.980
don't overlook someone of the least and not
so obvious

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.310
photographic opportunities as well. Until
next time this is Bryan Petersen saying

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.300
