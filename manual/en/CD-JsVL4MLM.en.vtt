00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.200
space, final frotier

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:32.816
This are the cheap voygers of starship Tenderprise

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.200
to explore strange new forms of irony and humor

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:44.708
to boldly go where no fool has gone before!

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.800
Captain log, stardate 62.4.5, 001 for callers outside U.S.A.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280
we are orbiting around a unknown planet

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.100
out of fuel for a strike of gas stations

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.860
what about the planet mr.Speck?

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.620
yes captain, my eyes can't lie, it's a planet of class... mmmhhh...

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.990
what mr.speck?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.360
M captain, M class!

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:25.180
Mr Check Off, check the planet!

00:02:29.352 --> 00:02:32.350
Mr. Zulu, leave the worp!

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:37.140
what the hell you doing !?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
but you asked me to burp!

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.280
I asked you to leave the warp no the burp!

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
oooh, sorry!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 give me half an hour for the calulations

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:55.200
captain, I understood the reason why the Tenderprice is without fuel!

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:57.560
and how it happened, mr.Speck?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.760
i think because a fabric space-time split!

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.550
not just only the fabric space-time i think! 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.380
fashinating...

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.280
Mr. Scottex, come now on the bridge!

00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:21.440
but captain, I'm already on the bridge, which bridge do you mean?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.600
ah! forget about it! go in the transporter room!

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.680
oops!
