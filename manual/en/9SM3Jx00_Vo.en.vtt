00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.538
Different types of forehand net drop

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:10.707
I would like to show you different kind of forehand net shots

00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:13.672
How many kind of net shots are there

00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:16.674
what to use, when

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:17.557
normal net play

00:00:19.124 --> 00:00:21.474
for singles, doubles normal

00:00:21.474 --> 00:00:23.908
the net play you understood is

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:25.285
here net

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:26.675
ok

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:28.058
hold net

00:00:29.543 --> 00:00:30.860
hold net

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.297
now this is normal nothing special 

00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:38.229
that is net play, hair pin we call it

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.815
now next one is you can use it for doubles

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:46.601
because there are two, one is already at the net

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:49.238
take racket please, let me have shuttles

00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:52.838
thank you

00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:59.691
ok if you do the normal net

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:02.346
he can kill it

00:01:02.843 --> 00:01:03.991
normal net

00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.877
he can kill it

00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:08.844
so because opponent is already there in doubles

00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:12.213
when you have to do the net play it has to be

00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:13.095
it has to be flat

00:01:14.194 --> 00:01:14.827
flat

00:01:15.677 --> 00:01:16.243
ok

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.296
further play little bit more

00:01:17.296 --> 00:01:18.345
watch the shuttle fly

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:20.312
here doubles net play

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:24.243
try to kill it

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:29.213
flat

00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:35.731
now, that's for double net play forehanded

00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:38.480
next one is singles

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.997
singles its better to make the shuttle go steeper

00:01:42.997 --> 00:01:46.301
so make your opponent come deeper

00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:49.850
and limit what your opponent can do

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.630
only another net, cross or lift options he has

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.963
so this is singles net

00:01:57.963 --> 00:01:59.498
have a look please

00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:00.181
singles net

00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:02.067
it's little bit high

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:05.100
here but shuttle goes straight down

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:06.766
now watch the shuttle fly

00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:12.851
now try to lift it please

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.733
give it to me shuttles, leave it there

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:19.684
ok I will do that give net

00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:20.268
ok

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:21.451
try to lift

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:22.667
again

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.069
because its very tight, it only goes half

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.202
and you can kill it

00:02:31.202 --> 00:02:35.684
so singles net is more little bit high

00:02:35.684 --> 00:02:37.536
does not matter because he is at the center

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:42.001
then shuttle goes steeper

00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:47.304
ok one more please, with shuttle by hands

00:02:47.304 --> 00:02:52.921
so shuttle should fly your court and 

00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:57.705
very tight to the other side

00:02:57.705 --> 00:03:01.872
instead of doing that, opponent can easily come

00:03:01.872 --> 00:03:02.622
ok now

00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:08.506
next one is spin net

00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:13.674
you force your opponent and you knew opponent is doing net shot

00:03:13.674 --> 00:03:19.143
and you take it early and spin it to make opponent lift much harder

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:21.174
ok by hand straight please

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:22.958
further back

00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:28.133
so shuttle comes and you spin it

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:29.841
watch shuttles fly

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:37.023
ok same shuttle should go little bit up

00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:41.693
and should go straight down

00:03:41.693 --> 00:03:44.544
and I call it kind of winning shot

00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:47.760
one more

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.325
sorry

00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:51.345
keep going

00:03:59.346 --> 00:03:59.845
ok

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:04.495
so there are normal net (normal hair pin)

00:04:04.495 --> 00:04:08.778
doubles net - which goes flat

00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:14.828
singles net - little bit high but land very steep

00:04:14.828 --> 00:04:19.429
last one is spin net you take it early, spin it 

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:25.029
so opponent finds it difficult to lift and that's winning shot
