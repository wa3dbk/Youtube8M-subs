00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.090
their protests all over at the united
states and that these protests are

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.080
conducted by students staff faculty at
various colleges and universities

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.680
what they're protesting is uh...

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.070
how different states have cut funding
for up public colleges and universities

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.650
right so students are now forced to pay
higher tuition

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.289
at and they also are getting a lot less
academically a lot of classes and the

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:33.010
cut

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.060
a lot of students aren't even getting
accepted universities even though

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.580
they're perfectly qualified to get
accepted

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.170
so i think is a really big story and
these protests are happening today march

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.210
fourth

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.270
and uh... this is known as the march
fourth national day of action for public

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.530
education

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.410
and it's all over a hundred events of
thirty two states uh...

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.640
fifty eight members of the black student
union at u_c_ irvine two hundred that

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.040
people it's their fiscal state
university six hundred people at

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.690
berkeley's apolipoprotein at gathered

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.290
some other california schools that
students basically

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.420
cut off the entrance uh... to the
schools man know how we want a phrase

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.080
that the police the day that barricaded
so people in your through in what is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.440
this a got violent

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.730
yeah which

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.100
i'd totally kent's

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.590
first of all let me just say i'd love
these protests i think that this should

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.600
have happened a long time ago

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.270
public education is so important and now
it's out of reach for so many people

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.390
because it's become so expensive

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.590
just unbearable i you can't get quality
education

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.180
for an affordable price anymore so i'm
glad these processes are happening but

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.750
they can get violent if they get violate
the message is going to get skewed

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.790
people are gonna get distracted from
what the real messages

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.060
you know i hear you are right now
obviously that's true uh...

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.810
i'll tell you why i think you know that
that's one card out its windows smashed

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.600
is just one small incident among mike
tyson off hunger different gathering so

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.610
i want a blade over-hyped

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.020
at the same time

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.090
you start to get a sense of

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.849
how angry people right this is the anger
starting up a little you squeeze people

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.640
use reason he's he's the one one

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.859
parent in the store was like what

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.369
i

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.299
now have paid up more tuition

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.039
but i'm getting paid less

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.119
and i have less insurance higher
premiums i mean everything to squeeze

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.989
from all sides and it boiling over

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.569
uh... spoiling this boy in its morley

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.839
our politicians totally ignore

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.389
and they keep you know that they can
ignite for a lot look i think that this

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.790
is all the great size

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.850
okay because what usually happens with
our political system

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.170
is people allow politicians to get away
with murder until it starts affecting

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.610
their own pocketbooks and when it starts
affecting their own bank accounts

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.870
now that people are really feeling you
know the financial stress of what's

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.829
going on

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.749
their peak going to become more
politically active they're going to

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.309
exercise the power of their vote and
that's when politicians start paying

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.919
attention to that i really think that
it's going to be affected

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.719
because look what do you want you wanna
get reelected of course you wanna get

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.699
reelected corporate money means nothing
would you have

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.319
their constituent saying that they're
not going to vote for you if you're not

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.260
going to get reelected as losers
constituency real information

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.280
okay and they don't get misled et cetera
so i'd really look for example uh... it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.700
during iraq war there is some big
protest in the beginning at seven and i

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.929
think speeded-up

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:33.190
weicker's

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.900
it's where volunteer army in vietnam as
gigantic protesters you're worried that

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.970
you were to get drafted and sent so
broadway i would die for this right so

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.920
we didn't have as much but now i am is
right now it's affecting us right and

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.379
it's affecting everybody

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.779
so you can also get a four to go to
school your past

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.509
and on a night goes missile boils over

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:00.739
this is how civil rights legislation got
past it it was just about politicians

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.429
know what happened was

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.749
it was boiling over and people were mad
and they were prob that's everywhere or

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.010
even riots

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.529
and you don't have the people of our got
scared

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:13.819
and so when they got scared they wrote
target this has been crazy let's pass a

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.589
civil rights legislation promising that
ok i'm oversimplifying there but that

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:22.460
had a lot to do with it so the fact that
people are angry

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.320
and their protest not violent dole
smashed the window of this error

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.220
uh... and will force what worked best in
civil rights era was the non-violent

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.460
campaign

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.249
but the protest themselves or bank tax

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:35.159
okay

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.169
you've got to let people now with the
deficit we've had enough

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.999
and what are they because if you don't
let him know what they had continued

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.479
goes with it in the past

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.979
cut taxes for richest people in the
country

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.699
give the tax breaks that uh... corporate
america over and over

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.229
and where they can get that money you
hear from you or not

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.139
there'd be putting a client product

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.469
as usual america it's the younger

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:00.439
elitists

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.930
and this they have action

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.120
ivy is an absolute fantastico

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.160
before

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.910
moved forward
