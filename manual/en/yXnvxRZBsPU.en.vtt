Hey guys! It’s Phil from smilinggardener.com
and I, you know I wanna start putting some

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.950
lessons together for these videos, but I’m
just so busy right now that I can’t do it

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.400
so to be honest I don’t have that much for
you today other than just to tell you what

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.439
I’ve been up to with my organic vegetable
garden.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.880
And basically, a couple of days ago I was
just getting kinda fed up for sitting in front

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.250
of the computer all the time so I, I had a
basic concept plan for the, for my organic

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.430
vegetable garden so I just came out and started
digging.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.230
So I’ll show you what I have done with my
organic vegetable garden and it’s kinda

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.850
like a do today, but I’ve been doing a lot
of digging here as you can see. So what I’m

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.280
doing as I mentioned before is I’m, I’m
putting a vegetable garden, but instead of

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.760
kinda throwing it in the back corner of the
property which often happens I’m, I’m

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.810
designing it right into the existing gardens
making it nice and curvy and beautiful and

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.939
you know, keeping it just a few steps from
the kitchen door so it’s very easy for the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.391
chef to come out and get herbs and vegetables
and things like that.

00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:14.280
So you can see I’ve, I’ve kinda started
an edge here putting a nice, a nice round,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.431
friendly edge on there. I’m starting to
put in a couple of paths so I’m gonna dig

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:23.860
six to eight inches down here and continue
that path and just make it a nice solid path

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.700
you know by giving it a good base.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.800
Same over here where I gonna put in more of
a, more of a wood chip path and I have newspaper

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.770
under there and here you can see I’ve started
a sheet mulch, so I laid my newspaper down

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.461
right on top of the grass and I’ve just
put it you know pretty good thick layer of

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:47.299
newspaper and I overlap it and that would
stop the grass from coming through.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.950
And then, I got my horse manure on top, I
did not have that much but that’s, that’s

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.610
a nice little layer of horse manure to bring
in some beneficial microorganisms and some

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.830
you know, nitrogen and nutrients and earthworms
and things like that; and then later I’m

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.400
gonna get stroll and I’ll finish that this
weekend. So next week, I’ll have a finish

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.429
sheet mulch to show you and I’ll show you
the whole thing then.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.680
Other than that I guess the one thing that
is making my organic vegetable garden less

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.459
beautiful is I do have to put up something
to keep the bunny rabbits out, coz they like

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.669
vegetables just as much as me as I was saying
yesterday in the blog.

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:27.159
So I haven’t secured this thing yet but
I’ve rough in some bamboo and some chicken

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.029
wire and it’s fairly an intrusive, it’s
only a couple feet tall which I found in the

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.609
past is all I really need to keep the rabbit
out.

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.620
And that’s really all I have today. I guess
you can also see that the lawn is loaded with

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.439
dandelions. You know this is a world setting
out here so we don’t really tend to worry

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:51.069
about every heed the dandelions greens and
it’s fine but probably at some point this

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:59.080
year I will take a section and show you how
to get rid of those organically without digging

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.080
them all out.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.040
So yeah that’s what I got for you today,
hopefully I’ll put some lesson together

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.749
soon as I’m a little bit less overwhelmed
with this project. You know putting in a vegetable

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.629
garden is really not that bigger deal and
this is a pretty small vegetable garden I’ve

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.459
kept it small because, because basically that
I’m, I’m learning that’s about ten percent

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.400
of the process her, because what I’m doing
is everything I do I’m putting it on video

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.549
and I’m writing an article; and so it’s
really a lot of work. So I thought just this

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.639
year I’ll keep the garden small and manageable
so I can really focusing on, focus on the

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.760
teaching.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.669
So, yeah! I guess I should get a good before
shot here too, because I haven’t done enough

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.069
of that yet so that’s all for now if you,
if you, if you’re not watching this on the

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.569
website like if you’re on the YouTube or
something and you haven’t gone to the website

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.359
and picked up those free lessons I put together
the 15 vital lessons for becoming a better

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.359
organic gardener, check those out.

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.430
There’s some really cool lessons in there
and other than that I’ll gonna, I will be

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.499
putting some, some more lessons on video together
for you as soon as I get this project under

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.239
control here. So, yeah! That’s all for now
I hope you have a great weekend.
