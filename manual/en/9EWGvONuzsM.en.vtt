\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is one of Gerry's gangs
for the weekend of october, out here getting

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.400
training. on there different gloss machines.
And we've gotten a target here behind this

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.860
bush. we've moved a little bit of over burden
off the top. usually when you remove overburden

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.140
if the target moves, its surface trash, its
normally not gold. If you remove the overburden

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.060
and its still there where the dogs sniffing,
please don't pee there. Is a thats a better

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:41.329
indicator, that its a target or, theres one
thing thats got me fooled a little bit it's

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.570
this little bit its this little granular material
right here. This kind of material, when you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.360
have your machine set, very tight tolerances,
the good guys, we dig those ok, they fool

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.329
us. Mineralization. that stuff right there.
So you can see all this beautiful quarts laying

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.869
around out here, these big flat rocks, hopefully,
thats a piece of gold. Ok so come off to the

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.329
side, of where you think the target is , you
think it is right there? then bring your coil

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.869
right over here and ground balance, reground
balance. What we are doing is we are ground

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.939
balanced to that layer of dirt where we think
the target is, if we ground balance up here,

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.579
your fooling your self your fooling the machine.
Folks ground balance right off to the side.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.979
That's why we make this big flipping flat
spot. We are digging iffys that most people

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:53.139
miss. Can you guys here that? we are down
about 6 inches. ok so its right about there

00:01:53.139 --> 00:02:05.759
alright, I am going to take a little more
off. Getting down there, That is about 10

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:15.820
inches so far. Its rising up and then down,
just like I taught you guys from day one.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:30.911
Except not quite that loud. now lift that
coil and make it weaker. Keep lifting. Thats

00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:44.370
what we barley heard right at first, just
a slight rise. Thats how when you get down

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.299
to that hard pan folks, thats what you want
to do, go around it just like she is and break

00:02:49.299 --> 00:03:03.989
up and lift. and break those chunks out of
there. So it was right down to here from here

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:33.170
right up to here. about 10 to 12 inches. OK.
Husband and wife, great team, great team.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:51.269
now take half of that in your hand and sweep
the scoop across. If its a bullet Ill eat

00:03:51.269 --> 00:04:16.030
it. I see it, I see it, I see it. I see it,
yes. there it is. There is a nice nevada nugget.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:25.581
Nice probably a .6 .7 gram and look how deep
that was folks. Almost a food deep, thats

00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:28.689
the power of pulse induction minelab metal
detectors. }
