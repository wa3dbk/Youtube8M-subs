00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(cheerful music with vocalizing)

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:13.954
- Bonjour!

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:15.029
Comment Ã§a va?

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.562
How's it going, everyone?

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:18.923
So, for today's video,
I am going to continue

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:20.986
my bedroom decor series.

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:24.968
I plan on making a new
bedroom DIY once every month,

00:00:24.968 --> 00:00:27.112
so, for this one, I'm going
to show you how to make

00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:31.446
a few jewelry stands, and
these are great to organize

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:34.968
your necklaces and your bracelets.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.880
I'm going to show you
how to make two designs.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.259
One is inspired by the springtime,

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:42.998
so if you want to give your
room a spring makeover,

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:44.357
this is perfect for that.

00:00:44.357 --> 00:00:47.003
The second design is just
great to have all year round.

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:48.617
It's very simple and chic.

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:50.699
And these are things
that I found from home

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.557
and also my local thrift store.

00:00:52.557 --> 00:00:55.517
So I think that you guys are
going to have fun making this,

00:00:55.517 --> 00:00:57.591
and let's get started!

00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:59.528
Let's go down the list of
materials you will need

00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:00.549
for this project.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.093
There are two ways to make this,

00:01:02.093 --> 00:01:03.510
one using wooden dowels

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.366
and the other using a paper towel roll.

00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:08.592
For the base of the jewelry stand,

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:10.717
I will be using some candle holders.

00:01:10.717 --> 00:01:13.116
I found these from my local thrift store,

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:16.499
and they usually have these
for a really good deal.

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:18.814
For the rack, you can use
wooden dowels that can be found

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:22.297
at your craft store or a
paper towel roll and magazine.

00:01:22.297 --> 00:01:24.267
Other supplies you will
need on hand are either

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.375
a high temperature glue gun or E6000.

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:29.503
For the wooden jewelry holder,

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:32.509
you will need primer and
paint to cover up the work,

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.284
and then if you are using
the paper towel roll option,

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:39.344
you will need fabric or either
vinyl to cover the cardboard.

00:01:39.344 --> 00:01:41.291
Let's start with the
wooden dowel's method.

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:43.771
Making this is super easy.

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:46.430
All you have to do is find
the center of the dowel

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.229
with the ruler and pen.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.574
Then mark the center.

00:01:50.574 --> 00:01:51.968
Next, apply permanent glue

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:54.277
to the top of the candle base.

00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:57.596
Use the center point you made on the dowel

00:01:57.596 --> 00:02:01.055
to help guide you where to
place the dowel onto the base.

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:06.055
Let the glue set for a good 30
minutes or so before priming.

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:10.639
Once the glue cures,
go over it with primer,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.710
and then once the primer is set and dry,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.984
go over it with paint.

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:19.327
After a full day of
waiting for this to dry,

00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:21.416
it's now time to decorate it with some

00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:23.588
spring theme decoration.

00:02:23.588 --> 00:02:26.219
I found these cute birdies
from Michaels craft store

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.471
just like the candle jar tutorial.

00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.979
Do you guys remember that tutorial?

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:30.997
I love it.

00:02:30.997 --> 00:02:35.436
And since the base of this
is bigger than my dowel,

00:02:35.436 --> 00:02:37.590
I thought about using and gluing on

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.243
some fake flowers to hide that.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.688
I just love how this turned out.

00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:47.667
It looks so springy, almost
like a rose garden theme.

00:02:48.874 --> 00:02:51.645
To make the design using
the paper towel roll method,

00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:54.586
take out your fabric or vinyl of choice.

00:02:54.586 --> 00:02:57.929
Then measure out how much
material you will need to use

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:02.553
in order to wrap it around
your paper towel roll.

00:03:02.553 --> 00:03:05.923
Use your ruler for accurate
lines and measurement.

00:03:05.923 --> 00:03:09.441
(light guitar music)

00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:13.226
So here I have a rectangle
that I will be cutting out

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:18.036
and with a glue gun glue the
wrong side onto the paper roll.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.322
Wrap the vinyl fully around the roll

00:03:21.322 --> 00:03:24.951
and glue the end seam together.

00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:28.267
To make the paper towel roll
more sturdy and durable,

00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:30.705
I suggest for you to take
a magazine, roll it up,

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:33.503
and insert it inside the tube.

00:03:33.503 --> 00:03:35.600
Next, take the end of
the roll you just wrapped

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.907
and trace it onto the vinyl.

00:03:37.907 --> 00:03:41.073
Make a set of end caps and cut it out.

00:03:41.073 --> 00:03:43.680
Glue each one to each end,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.509
and then, lastly, the
glue the vinyl roll onto

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.058
the candle stick base.

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:53.058
(light guitar music)

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:58.085
I am so in love with how
all these turned out.

00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:00.508
Let me know which one
you will be recreating,

00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:03.348
and if you are, then
don't forget to tag me on

00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:05.485
Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:07.180
I will talk to you next week.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.063
Ciao!

00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:13.060
