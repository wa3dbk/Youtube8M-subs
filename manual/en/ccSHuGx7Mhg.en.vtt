00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.033
Welcome!  In this video, we will walk through the 
process of registering 

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:10.000
for a Student Orientation, Advisement and 
Registration—or SOAR—session at Missouri 
State University. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.066
Before you register, make sure you have the 
following information: 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:28.066
Your BearPass Login and password. If you 
haven’t created a BearPass Login, visit the link 
above and follow the instructions listed.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:34.033
Memorize your BearPass login and password, as 
you will use them to register for classes during 
your SOAR session.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:43.066
Dates for which you and any family members 
attending are available.  Remember, you are 
required to attend the ENTIRE session. 

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:49.066
The email and mailing addresses of family 
members attending with you.  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.066
Begin by visiting my.missouristate.edu and 
logging in using your BearPass login.   

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
On your My Missouri State portal, select the 
Academics tab. 

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:14.066
Find the channel (or box) labeled “New Student” 
and click the “Register for a SOAR Session” link. 

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:21.000
If you don’t see this channel, you may not be 
required to attend SOAR—contact the SOAR 
office for further assistance.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:29.066
The SOAR registration system will open.  Before 
you register for a session, let’s look at some 
features of the system.  

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.000
The left side of the screen displays the sections 
of the reservation system

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and notes which sections you have completed 
with check marks. 

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:40.033
The word “Incomplete” is displayed until your 
reservation is fully submitted. 

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:47.000
Blue boxes near the top of each section display 
important information and instructions for 
completing your reservation.  

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:51.066
Read this information very carefully as you 
progress through the system.

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:55.066
The first section displays personal information 
about you.  

00:01:55.066 --> 00:02:00.066
Make any necessary changes or additions, then 
click the “Save &amp; Continue” button near the 
bottom of the screen. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.066
The Questionnaire section asks you information 
that will help prepare you for your arrival at 
SOAR.  

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Select your major and enter in additional 
information.  If your major changes later, 

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:22.033
update this information at least five business 
days prior to your SOAR session.  

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:37.033
Once you’re done, click the “Save &amp; Continue” 
button. 

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:42.033
The Dates screen will display any open sessions 
you are eligible to attend. 

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:49.066
Sessions that are closed or you are ineligible to 
attend will not be displayed. Select the session 
that best fits your schedule.  

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.066
Please note that space in any session is not held 
for you by simply selecting a date—you MUST 
fully complete your reservation.  

00:02:56.066 --> 00:03:04.066
If you are attending a two-day SOAR session 
during June or July, you will also be asked if you 
want to reserve on-campus accommodations

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:08.033
 overnight.  Once you’ve made your selections, 
click the “Save &amp; Continue” button. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The Guest Screen allows you to reserve space 
for family members who will attend SOAR with 
you.  

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:18.033
To register family members, click the “Add a 
Guest” link.  

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:24.066
A new window will appear; enter the necessary 
information and click the “Add” button. 

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:36.000
Repeat this process for each family member 
attending. Once you’ve finished, click the “Save &amp; 
Continue” button.

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:43.033
The My Reservation screen allows you to review 
or change any of the information about your 
reservation.  

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:48.066
If you need to make any changes, click the “Edit 
Section” button for the appropriate section.  

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:55.000
Note that your reservation is still incomplete; to 
complete your reservation, you must click the 
“Submit” button near the top of the screen.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.066
As a reminder, no payment for SOAR is 
necessary at the time of registration.  

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:05.033
SOAR fees are not charged to your student 
account until you check in on the morning of your 
session.

00:04:09.033 --> 00:04:11.000
The screen should now note that your reservation 
is complete, 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and a confirmation email will be automatically 
sent to your Missouri State email account.  

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:22.033
Read this confirmation email carefully, because it 
contains important information about preparing 
for your SOAR session.

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:30.066
