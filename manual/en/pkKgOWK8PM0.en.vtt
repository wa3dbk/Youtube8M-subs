00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.549
Today on our 2011 Kia Sportage, we&amp;#39;ll
be installing a Curt hitch, part number C13120.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.390
Here&amp;#39;s what the hitch looks like installed
on our vehicle.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.200
Now we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and give you a couple
measurements to help you in choosing some

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.000
accessories for your hitch, such as a ball
mount, bicycle rack, or cargo carrier.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.560
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
edge of the bumper is approximately 5&amp;quot;,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.750
and from the top of the opening in the receiver
to the ground is approximately 12-1/2&amp;quot;.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.839
Now we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and install our hitch.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.900
First off, we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and point out
the four locations where the hitch will be

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.900
mounted to the vehicle.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.899
There&amp;#39;s two on each side.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:01:17.520
They&amp;#39;re actually weld nuts that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:35.020
are part of 
the vehicle&amp;#39;s frame.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:02:59.989
Now in order to actually get our hitch into
place, we&amp;#39;ll need to go ahead and lower

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.659
the exhaust.
