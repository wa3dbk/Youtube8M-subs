00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.469
- Hey friends, can we talk
about the Black Out Day

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.873
and how awesome it was
and continues to be,

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:09.343
and how exciting it is
to just see black people

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:12.680
embracing their beauty
and uplifting each other?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.948
It was just so bomb,

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:19.086
and just awesome and I just
want to say a big shout out

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.355
to the creators of Black Out Day

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.058
T'Von, expect-the-greatest on Tumblr,

00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:28.195
along with Melissa,
Blackout Queen and Nukirk,

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:29.129
whites will never know.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.031
I'll put links to all three of them in

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.165
the video description box,

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.333
and here's the thing.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.737
Whenever black people, or people of color,

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.873
or oppressed groups of people decide

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:42.008
that they want to change
the narrative surrounding

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.511
their existence and personhood,

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.814
(grunts) people always get upset. (laughs)

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.016
Always, like without a doubt,

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:52.319
and that's exactly what
happened with the Black Out Day.

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.421
It was trending on Twitter,
it was all over Tumblr

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:57.424
and as soon as we
started to get some shine

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.961
from news networks and
all over the internet,

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.264
there were people who
were like "This is racist!

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:07.235
"Why can't we have a White Out Day? Meh!"

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:10.704
Here's the thing, self love is
not putting anyone else down.

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:13.206
Saying that I love being
black is not saying that I

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.476
hate anyone who's not
black or anyone that's

00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:17.744
not black is less than me.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.981
The Black Out Day was not
about saying that other people

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.818
aren't beautiful, it's
about counteracting those

00:01:23.818 --> 00:01:26.621
negative stereotypes and
portrayals that we have seen

00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:30.090
throughout history and they
continue to this very day.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.292
Whether it has to do with,
deal with police brutality,

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:35.463
most recently we had a 19
year old kid, Tony Robinson

00:01:35.463 --> 00:01:38.432
was shot five times in
the chest, even though

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:41.768
he was unarmed, by a police
officer in Wisconsin.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.837
I made the mistake of reading
comments on some of the

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.640
articles about him and sure enough,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.509
people were justifying his
death by saying he'd been

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.245
arrested before, he was
a thug, he was never

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:53.914
gonna amount to anything.

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:56.483
We see this happen every
single time that there

00:01:56.483 --> 00:02:00.355
is a story involving a
black person who has been

00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:01.688
unjustly killed.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.758
The narrative continues
to be "Well, here's why

00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:05.392
"they deserved it,
here's the type of people

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:06.860
"that black people are."

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.362
And even having a black
president has not changed

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:13.033
how people talk about blackness
or treat black people.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:17.137
Just take a look at how people
talk about our president

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.473
and the level of disrespect
that they give him.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:24.078
Honestly, it is largely based
on the fact that he is black.

00:02:24.078 --> 00:02:27.883
The DOJ's investigation
in Ferguson revealed

00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:32.652
not only excessive police
brutality and racial profiling,

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:36.023
but they uncovered these
emails where police officers,

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:39.872
men and women who took
vows to protect and serve

00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:42.029
the people of this country,
were making racist jokes

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.364
about our president and our first lady.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:47.000
So, speaking a certain way,
dressing a certain way,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.269
having a certain amount
of money does not make

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.305
your blackness more widely accepted

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.741
or mean that you're not
going to face adversity

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.544
or stereotypes or racism.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:00.881
The Black Out Day really
was an opportunity to say

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.550
"Look, despite the things
that we encounter in the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.286
"world around us, we love who we are,

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.722
"and we are gonna uplift
ourselves and each other."

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:10.924
I think what was so powerful about it

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:14.628
was how many people shared
their stories on social media

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:17.664
to say how important this was for them.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:21.601
To love their hair, to
love their bodies, or maybe

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.336
they were non-gender conforming,

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.138
or maybe they were
someone with a disability

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:29.175
and they had not experienced a space where

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:31.177
their blackness was included

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.179
and they were told that
they were beautiful and

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:34.614
worthy of love.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:38.485
So instead of the normal
social media etiquette

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:41.755
where people take pictures of
people without their knowledge

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.490
and share it and make fun of them,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.594
or make memes about
black people and say just

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.129
really racist things,

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.666
or fraternities singing about
not wanting black people

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:55.002
using the N word in their fraternity,

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.736
which we recently saw.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.940
All of these things happen so often

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.908
that a movement like the Black Out Day is

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:05.011
really incredible and so needed.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:08.315
The same way that that powerful
Janelle Monae quote says

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:11.418
"I will love myself, even if
it makes others uncomfortable."

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.953
It doesn't matter that
people were uncomfortable

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:14.054
with the Black Out Day.

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:17.757
We loved it, we know that
we're fly and amazing.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:22.195
So, I wanted to continue that
positivity here on my channel,

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:24.531
so I asked a bunch of you to share photos

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:26.600
of yourself from the Black Out Day.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.401
I was gonna include them in a video,

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:31.337
so I'm going to show you just some of the

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:34.407
beautiful faces that came
across my Tumblr dashboard.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:38.745
(jazz music)

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:34.268
Check out the video description box,

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:37.204
I will put a link to
all the people featured

00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:39.568
so that you can continue showing them love

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:40.306
and checking them out.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:43.043
Thank you to all that
participated and supported

00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:46.645
and I will see you when I see you, bye!
