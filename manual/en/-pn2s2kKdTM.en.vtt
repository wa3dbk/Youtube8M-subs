00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.399
Now I would like to show you a little bit
about water testing. What I'm going to do

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:09.040
is take five mils of water, ordinary tap water,
put it in this container. We put a hardness

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.280
agent in there this is how the US dept of
Interior measures hardness in what's called

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.779
grains per gallon. Now when it turns a reddish
pink color like that, that means you have

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.000
hard water, but that doesn't tell me how hard
it is. They use titran solution for that,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.070
and every drop represents a grain, and we
just keep adding the drops until it actually

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.200
turns blue. That's four, five, six, seven
so that's hard water there, because its still

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.739
pink and it still hasn't turned blue. So we
will keep going. That's nine, eleven, twelve,

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:57.629
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen and its kind of
a purple so it looks like its about fifteen,

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.010
definitely blue now. You're about fifteen
or sixteen grains of hardness here at this

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.439
area in this home, which means that water
is extremely hard water. Now, I'm going to

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.399
do a PH test or potential of hydrogen, this
is done with what's called phenomenal red.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:22.429
You just add a few drops, five drops and shake
it and it will give you the color, in this

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.529
case you can see the closest lines up with
the second one from the top, which is 7.8.

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:33.130
That means this water is alkaline water at
7.8. And then the other one that I am going

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.229
to do for you, this is on chlorine. This will
tell you how much chlorine is in the water,

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:48.729
we add OTO, and then you can kind of see that
if you look at the back of this from something

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.469
that's white you can see that its actually
turned yellow. In this case, the chlorine

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:02.149
content is actually about 1.0 to 1.5 right
in that range which is actually just about

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.099
perfect swimming pool water. Because pool
water is 1.0 to 1.5 in chlorine content.
