00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.220
Death will come to all of us.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.560
Especially soldiers.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.620
You give your life away so others can live.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.620
And take life, but only God can give it.

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:43.533
What the hell are they doing here ?

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.740
They got their hands on a compound that kills humans and nothing else ?

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.600
Medical says they've never seen anything like it.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.040
Covenant's found the holy grail then, haven't they ?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.380
It's time to take the war to them.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.080
It'll be a bold move. Send a team in, destroy the stuff.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.280
I hear you need a ship.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.960
ONI work better alone.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.000
Shouldn't fear me, I'm just one man.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.820
One man that was a Spartan.

00:01:18.914 --> 00:01:20.914
Ready to go to hell, Colonel ?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.500
Never thought we'd set foot on a Halo ring.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.800
Are we really doing this ?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.320
Stay on mission.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.980
Found something.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.560
What the hell are they ?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.320
Fall back !

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400
We will not go out like this.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.820
My question to you, Commander Locke,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.800
how will you lead ?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.320
And for what ?
