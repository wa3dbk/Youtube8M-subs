[groans]

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.040
Simmons: What happened?

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.200
What? Am I dead?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.000
I see my body... Am I in Heaven?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.059
Why is my body speaking Spanish?

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.340
Oh no. Did I go to Mexican Heaven by mistake?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.100
That's like white people Hell!

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.179
I knew it!

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.600
You just wanted to become super popular so you could take my place.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.200
You're gonna regret this, Lopez.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.220
We'll all regret this!

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.200
Sarge: I still don't understand. How does more breaks make us more efficient?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.809
Grif: It's simple. If we have less hours to do work,

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.400
we get more done in less time. It's all ratios.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.100
Simmons! Where in Sam Hill have you been?

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.380
You sound weird.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.200
Yeah, almost like he's speaking a foreign language.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.800
But he's speaking very slowly and clearly, so I understand what he means!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.400
me, too

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.200
What have you been up to?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.260
Sounds boring.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.300
I didn't understand that one.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.600
Me neither. But boring is always a safe bet with Simmons.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.200
Good point.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.460
Ok. Bye Simmons.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.500
Good luck on whatever you're doing!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.000
[groans]

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.460
Instead of a big white blur, now everything's just a big black blur.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.760
Man. My head should only hurt this much if I had a lot more fun the night before.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.260
What?

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.500
Ow, Caboose, stop yelling!

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.020
Someone give me an aspirin.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.380
You guys are babies.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.900
Babies? You chucked a grenade at us, you stupid bitch. What do you expect?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.512
Hey, there's a big difference between a flashbang and a grenade.

00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:56.640
Doesn't seem like it.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.300
Well, if I threw a grenade at you, I wouldn't have to have this stupid conversation right now

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.100
I would just be stepping over some disgusting puddles.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.200
This is your girlfriend, I take it?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.800
Oh, yeah. Tucker, Tex, Tex, Tucker, yeah, you know.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.580
Sup.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.400
Hello.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.540
Are people meeting other people? I want to meet people!

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.240
No, you don't. And stop yelling!

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.800
[steadily increasing in volume] Nice to meet you, Mr. Yelling!

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.000
Yeah, why would you attack us? Weren't you coming all the way out here to help us?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.020
Hey, I needed to evaluate the situation.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.800
I heard someone was dead, I show up here and three idiots are standing around arguing.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.900
I'm not walking into that blind.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.880
So you made us blind.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.300
[mockingly] Oh, boo-hoo.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.500
It's not lethal.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.519
So what? That's what - that's supposed to make us feel better? A kick in the balls would be non-lethal, too.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.400
That depends on who does the kicking.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.040
Is that a threat?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.480
How about we just call it an experiment? See what happens.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.760
How about we agree to disagree?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.280
Good idea.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.119
So. Who's dead?

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.900
Oh, nobody. We just made a mistake. We thought -

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.300
Uhhhh, we thought we should bury our dead teammate and then take his name off the roster,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.800
so that no one can prove he was never here.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.340
We did?

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.700
Yes. Because that's what she is here to investigate, Tucker.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.020
And if that guy didn't exist, why would she stick around?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.900
Oh! Right. Yeah.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.600
I thought she meant some other non-existent guy who didn't die. Not that one guy who did die.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.400
Whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Why did you remove him from the roster?

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.369
Uh, I don't know, seemed appropriate at the time. You know, it's like a respect thing.

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:22.300
What was his name?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.800
Church: Anderson.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.300
Tucker: Smith.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.400
Well was it Anderson or Smith?

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.000
Uh...

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.600
Andersmith.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.120
Private Andersmith.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.920
Ander Smith?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.000
Oh, Mr. Ander...smith!

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.800
I'll always miss you! You were too young to die.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.120
Yeah, he was like ten seconds old.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.500
Shut up, Tucker!

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.000
Hey, Grif. Have you seen Simmons?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.400
Yeah, we're working on some equipment together.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.940
Donut: Together?

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.529
Yeah, he went up the hill. He said he needed my help, so I said "No problem.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.620
I'll be there in a few minutes."

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.160
When was that?

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.200
About five hours ago.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.800
Oh.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.600
So, how's the project going?

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.480
Well, he hasn't asked for help again, which means I haven't had to think of a new excuse.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.000
So, I'd say it's going great!

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.760
What's he doing?

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.740
I don't know. He's got some new toys or something up there, I guess he's testing 'em out?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.400
Toys?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.900
Yeah

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.680
Toys is a broad term, Grif. It can mean a lot of things.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.300
Gadgets.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.940
Go on.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.400
Electronic devices?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.240
I think I'll go check this out for myself.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.759
You do that.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.360
If I just wriggle free a - little - Maybe I could - loosen - this.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.500
There, I'm free! Now to take my place on Red Team again.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.930
Man, Lopez was right. I do say my thoughts out loud a lot. I wonder why I do that? I'm still doing it!

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.290
I really should try to stop. Okay. That was the last one. Hey, I did it! No no I mean -

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.520
Command, do you read me? This is Freelancer Tex reporting in.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.800
Roger that, seÃ±orita. We read you loud and clearita. How you doing?

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.669
Okay, I just need to make sure she sticks around for a little while.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.770
You know, so I can talk to her a little bit more.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.650
And investigating this dead guy, it's gonna be a good distraction.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.630
It doesn't bother you that you made up a guy out of nowhere,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.560
and then killed that guy, just to have a chance to talk to your girlfriend.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.800
No no no, it's like a net-

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.900
uh, whatever you call it. It-it's even. You know, he didn't exist before and he doesn't exist now.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.600
No harm, no foul. Right?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.020
Dude, you seriously gotta look into this stalker thing.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.840
I miss him.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.380
You miss who?

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.169
Andersmith.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.400
He's a reminder of how close we all are just to not being here one day.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.600
He wasn't here any days, idiot. He doesn't exist.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.360
Oh, how can you say that? Don't you believe in the afterlife?

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.129
Afterlife implies life at some point.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.220
He didn't have one.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.000
Because he was so young! He had hopes and dreams.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.560
He was a dream.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.800
Yes he was!

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.020
To all of us who knew him.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.100
Okay, I'm actually less worried about you now, and I'm more worried about Caboose.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.000
Caboose! He didn't exist.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.320
You never knew anyone named Andersmith. None of us did.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.840
Denial is an important stage in grieving.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.629
Yeah, apparently denial is an important part of reality, too.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.780
Yeah, take it from the guy who calls that chick his girlfriend.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.070
Roger that. Over and out, Command.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.840
Oh shit, she's done with her call. Quick, uh, talk about something else. Um...

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.400
Like what?

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.940
Anything, anything! Uh, uh, okay. You know what, I think you're right, Tucker.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.300
Cows can't talk. But maybe they can't talk 'cause just - no one ever taught 'em how to do that. Right?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.240
That might have been the worst ad-lib ever.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.880
You just blew my mind with the cow thing.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.660
that ain't hard dude

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.720
Alright, here's the deal. I'm gonna stick around until we get this dead guy thing solved.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.000
[exaggerated] Oh, really? Well, that's great.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.700
[still exaggerated] Isn't that perfect, Tucker?

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.520
Don't gloat.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.300
Yes, Miss Scary? I have a question. Um...

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.960
How are we going to fix the dead guy being dead?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.850
Oh, we're not. We're gonna even the teams. Come on.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.060
Let's go up the hill and kill one of the Reds. Then I can get out of this mud puddle.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.720
Oh.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.220
Hey.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
I'll even let you pick which one.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.300
Tex: Come on, let's go.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.780
Church: Well, this sounds like...

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.250
Church: fun.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.420
Caboose: Let's pack a picnic.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.540
Tucker: We could always just eat the Red we kill. Hey, Church. Pick the fat guy.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.500
Where am I...?

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.700
Oh, well that looks nice!

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.739
Oh my God! A giant person!
