00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.240
We're here in my apartment, in Paris,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.454
this is where I spend my time
when I'm not traveling,

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:13.901
which I do often,
but at least I have a place.

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:19.556
I'm going to grab a croissant
at the bakery, wanna come?

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:25.072
Boom! As I said, best croissant in Paris.

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:32.675
That's my spot in Bastille,
where I skate every day in Paris.

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:34.676
Also, now they have the modules,

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:37.444
so let's do a morning session,
warm up a bit,

00:00:37.444 --> 00:00:39.330
to start off the day right.

00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:50.993
We'll spend the day together,

00:00:50.993 --> 00:00:54.174
and I'll show you
my favorite places in Paris.

00:00:55.584 --> 00:00:58.157
Place des Vosges,
really a typical spot in Paris,

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.778
with its arcades, small boutiques,

00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:04.300
and above all, a park 
where you can chill with your friends,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.354
have a picnic, play petanque, or whatever.

00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:07.771
We'll ride bikes.

00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:21.271
I wanted to bring Corey
to Montmartre, to Sacré-Coeur.

00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:23.953
It has one of the most
spectacular views of Paris.

00:01:23.953 --> 00:01:25.663
Even though it's a bit touristy,

00:01:25.663 --> 00:01:27.976
it's still a cool place to bring friends.

00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:34.219
It's beautiful, isn't it, Corey?

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.325
Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.026
Busy morning, shot a lot of videos,

00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:42.042
We're starving,

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:45.109
so we went to eat at Mansart,
one of my favorite places in Paris.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.760
As you can see, it's a really cool place.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.329
To start off the afternoon,
the day is still long.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.116
Now we're at L'Encrerie in Saint-Ambroise,

00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:25.742
right near the Avenue République.

00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:30.146
All the tattoos on my right arm
were done here.

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:32.222
Leo did the ones on my upper arm.

00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:36.383
The ones on my lower arm were done
by Alex Dandy, Belzébuth.

00:02:36.383 --> 00:02:37.413
All were done here.

00:02:37.413 --> 00:02:41.873
I spent many, many hours here,
all good ones.

00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:01.449
End of this journey, it was really
a pleasure to share it with you.

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.837
I hope that you enjoyed
visiting Paris with Corey and me.

00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:07.396
Really, can't wait to do it again,
because it was awesome!

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:08.463
Kisses to all!
