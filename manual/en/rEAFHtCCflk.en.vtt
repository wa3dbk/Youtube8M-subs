00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.370
Begonias, now if you want a WOW
factor on your patio but go knees you

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.540
can't go wrong
beautiful colors really are lovely now

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.160
the normal begonias that you get in the
garden centres are ready Begonias

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.680
like this you put them out after the
first Frost's three to four centimetres

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.550
perfectly good give you a massive color
and easy planting but if you want

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.600
something on you on your patio in a pot
that gives you the real exhibition

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.220
quality wow factor five to six
centimeters now most of these for some

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.540
unknown reason are grown in Belgium and
everywhere else in the world they

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.600
measure the circumference of bulbs but
in Belgium

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.980
it's the diameter so five to six
centimeters is the measurement across

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.360
there now the cook just for those that
don't know because if you if you don't

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.829
know you don't the cooked bit down there
and the whole bit in there the hollow

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.820
bit is the top that's where the little
eye the little flowers could have come

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.090
from they come in packs of five or six
and what you can do is in a pan this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.080
size you probably three would be more
than ample most of this has developed

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.340
from the big stately homes where they
plant thousands of these things push

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.180
that down into a bed of compost just
three of those place down and you can

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.780
actually see them swell up and grow and
their little eye come out of the center

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.320
and they'll grow on and you put some
more compost on top that was the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.520
old-fashioned way of doing it now the
modern way is you do it exactly the same

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.049
as that only you put a layer of compost
on top just like you're putting a plant

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.560
in or planting a bulb of any sort you
put a layer of compost on the top and it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.760
really is as easy as that and you wait
for it to grow now what you need is a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.200
bright window ledge somewhere warm and
these will grow on your getting ahead of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.080
the game these are going to go out after
the Frost's probably early mid-may and

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.810
they're going to flower away
magnificently right the way through to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.060
October if you start them off in mid-may
obviously you're going to wait a month

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.700
for the matter actually to flower that's
getting ahead of things but these will

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.290
flower they will actually come out and
you'll get some magnificent six-inch

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.750
flowers
when your friends and neighbors come to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.830
see your patio and they see these they
think it's just gone to the gun spent at

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.960
center and spent forty quid buying a
huge tub of begonias when actual fact

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.510
for under a pound you can actually grow
these so that's under three pounds in a

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.730
pan this size you can have a magnificent
display right the way through to October

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.480
you really can't go old-fashioned maybe
but you can't go wrong with begonias
