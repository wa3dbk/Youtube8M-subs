00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.839
Hi, I'm Trevor Bending from OpticsPlanet,
and I'm here to talk today about

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:10.909
choke tubes

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.959
love that sound. Now if you're a winged
shooter, end of summer's coming, and that

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.829
means hunting season's coming. You've got waterfowl
and upland game coming up. And one of the

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.099
most important things you need to gear up
for and be ready for with your shotgun is a

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.269
choke tube. There's a lot of different choke
tubes on the market you have extra full,

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.679
full, modified, improved, and you have your cylinder
bores. What what does all that mean?

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.690
That's what I'm going to explain right now.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.220
So what a choke tube does

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.790
is basically control the spread of your
shot. When shot comes out of your shotgun

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.270
you know, little pellets, they're
going to be flying all over.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.270
So you need to be able to control it
depending what you're doing.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.640
So, for instance, if you're shooting turkey they
actually have turkey choke tubes, or they're called

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.990
extra full choke tubes, and that really
keeps a tight pattern on that shot

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.999
it doesn't let them

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.279
really expand out, and you need that when
hunting turkey because you're a little

00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:00.380
bit longer distance and you need
a tight group on your shot

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.800
because usually looking for that head hit,
so you need a really tight pattern on that

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.840
shot, so that's an extra full or turkey choke.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.870
Then you go down the line, now we have a
full choke, and that's still going to be a

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.170
pretty tight pattern. Not as tight as a
turkey choke but it's going to give you a pretty

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.130
tight pattern.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.460
So as you're going out there, the pattern of shot
stays tight, so you're going to be able to get a little bit

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.630
further shots.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.850
You use full choke tubes for trap shooting

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.259
if you're going to be target shooting with
a shotgun you have trap shooting

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.270
and you also want to use them for a little
bit longer distance waterfowl shooting

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.440
and you can also use a full choke
for turkey shooting again.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.499
Next down the line and we have modified.

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.099
Modified is going to give you little bit more spread

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.560
than a full choke tube will

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.960
and you use modified for a lot of just
closer waterfall, closer duck hunting

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.640
definitely a little bit longer distance upland
game. It kind of fills in that border right

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.880
there, so you have a little bit of waterfowl,
a little bit up upland game

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.480
and that's going to be your modified choking, you can also use modified for trap shooting as well

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.660
again.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.510
Next on the line is you have improved.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.189
Improved is going to be even a little bit
wider spread than that modified.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.610
Improved is great for most upland game hunting,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.240
it's great for small game hunting and
it's also when you get into the skeet

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.910
shooting. Trap shooting comes straight out,
now skeet shooting is coming back and forth

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.610
across you. Improved enters the skeet
shooting choke tube category as well. On the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.529
bottom end of that is you
have a cylinder bore,

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.660
a cylinder bore means there is no
choke tube, so it's just straight

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.010
no choke tube fits on the end of your
barrel, and that's really used for

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.239
military and police applications.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.279
Now last one I'm going to talk about
is actually a skeet choke tube.

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:31.159
It's a little bit different than the improved,
you have a little bit of a wider pattern and it's

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.839
really specifically designed for skeet.
All-round skeet shooting it's great, I

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:38.389
really wouldn't use it for  too much more
than skeet, it really has that design

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.979
purpose. So choke tubes are going to screw
into the end of your barrel, most shotguns

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.399
nowadays are designed with a removable
choke tube, so you can literally just

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.759
unscrew it. Most shotguns actually come
with a choke tube wrench, so when you get that

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.329
little wrench in your brand of shotgun
if you buy it brand new, that wrench

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.889
is used to unscrew that choke tube. If you
don't have that wrench, sometimes you can

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.239
actually just use your finger if it's not too
tight. I like to use a nickel trick

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.069
depending on your gauge shotgun, you can
use a nickel in there. Because choke tubes

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.049
you can see have some notches cut in the
top, and that's designed for that wrench

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.509
so you can take it out.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.249
So once again we have a turkey choke tube, full,

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.869
modified, improved, cylinder, and there's
that skeet choke tube, so a lot of examples

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.040
right there on the market,
a lot of options for you.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.499
The biggest thing is to make sure

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.629
you get the choke tube that you
need for your intended purpose

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.190
whether it be waterfowl,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.340
you know, goose shooting if you're going to be
shooting far away you you want that full choke,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.980
if you're going close range upland game,
pheasant, quail, you know you can use that

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.539
improved cylinder, you can use that modified
cylinder choke tube, so a lot of options out there

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.079
you know but it's really important that
you choose that correct option for your

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:40.739
needs

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.190
and most of the time you're going to end up
with a variety of choke tubes for your shotgun.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.630
A 12 gauge shotgun Remington 870 right here

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.010
this can do everything so a specific choke
tube for a specific purpose goes a

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.969
long way.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.069
You can find all these a OpticsPlanet.com
I'm Trevor Bending, thanks

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.209
