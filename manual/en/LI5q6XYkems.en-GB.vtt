00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.100
KAZAM are still a relatively unknown brand
in the smartphone market despite being on

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.500
the scene for 18 months now.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.690
The recent launch of the Tornado 348, which
measures just 5.5mm thick and has a Guinness

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.410
world record to its name grabbed some media
attention.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.820
The Thunder 340W is a little different.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.900
An entry level smartphone that is about function
rather than thrills with a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.869
Windows Phone 8.1 operating system
1.2GHz quad-core processor

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.100
4GB internal memory
512MB RAM

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.520
3G
4” touchscreen display

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.970
WiFi
GPS

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.430
5 megapixel camera
Dual SIM

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.260
and a 24 month warranty including a free screen
replacement

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.280
At £75 inclusive of VAT including a case
and for that feature set you really struggle

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.760
to fault it.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.750
Sub £100 is a very competitive market but
to get Windows Phone, dual SIM functionality

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.140
and a 24 month warranty it is quite simply
superb.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.230
In comparison to most phones I handle today,
the 340W is refreshingly small with a 4”

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.820
touchscreen display and the curved edges make
this feel comfortable in hand.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.780
Of plastic construction, it feels soft and
warm to the touch, but still robust. It is

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.920
not metal like the back cover may lead you
to think.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.340
At 135g it is not all that heavy but at 11.95mm
it is quite thick.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.990
The 340 does not look as sleek as the more
premium handsets. In fact the Thunder is only

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.050
fractionally smaller in width and height than
the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact which has a 4.6”

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.481
screen and a lot more high end specs. The
Sony is also much thinner, but possibly it

00:01:43.481 --> 00:01:48.500
is not fair to compare when there are about
300 English pounds between them.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.440
With a 480 x 800 resolution this results in
a 233PPI on the 4 inch LCD display.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.590
The display is functional and perfectly fine
for viewing web pages, responding to emails

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.320
and similar tasks.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.040
Unfortunately the screen is a fingerprint
magnet and not all that resitve to scratches.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.840
I should too mention being a KAZAM handset
on top of the 2 year warranty you get a free

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.780
screen replacement should you damage it within
the first year!

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.120
Running Windows Phone 8.1 it has quite a few
features packed into it.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.370
The main home screen is a hive of information.
A new wider tile setup you can get a lot of

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.650
information on the screen and the tiles can
be easily resized.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.200
Change the colour and theme of the main Windows
interface and set an image as your wallpaper.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.530
It perhaps does not conform to a background
as you would expect, certain tiles become

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.630
transparent so you see parts of it, not all.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.900
Sign in with a Microsoft Live account and
your contacts, calendar and emails will all

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.560
sync to the handset if you chose.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.220
Within the programmes menu you have useful
things like alarms, calculators, a data monitor,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.300
Facebook, FM radio, Office, OneDrive, OneNote,
music, games and much more.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.099
There is to the inclusion of HERE Drive+,
HERE Maps and HERE Transit which enhance your

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.489
navigation experience.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.160
Another couple of value added extras include
the news, money and podcast app as well as

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.990
Data Sense that monitors the level of traffic
both through WiFi and a mobile data plan.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.380
Windows Phone offers some great reasons to
switch from other platforms and perhaps has

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.460
a bigger appeal for those who work in organisations
that work with Windows systems and Office

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.790
365, all of which can be handled on the KAZAM.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.260
Recent additions to the Store, such as Dropbox
are great to see and shows app developers

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.670
are beginning to take more seriously the need
to develop for more platforms.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.890
Whilst at any screen you can slide down from
the top to get a notification panel which

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.360
has quick access to key settings such as the
ability to switch on and off Bluetooth, WiFi,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.520
flight mode, rotation lock and more. It is
here too that email notifications, text messages

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.540
and missed calls will show too.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.739
Press the search button and you are launched
into Cortana, Microsoft's intelligent assistant

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.220
or in other words their equivalent to Apple’s
Siri.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.920
Feeling a little more natural than Siri, you
can ask Cortana questions by voice or by typing.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.539
She can set alarms, ring people, send a message,
create a reminder and more.

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.990
Throughout my time with it, I found the general
performance to be acceptable. There were times

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.889
it seemed to lag slightly but I was mindful
of the price point. It is all to easy to get

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.300
complacent and compare it to smoother performing
products.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.219
Included on the 340W are the core connectivity
options you need. 2 SIM card slots that both

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:43.639
support 3G connectivity are included along
with WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS.

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.009
Thus wherever you are subject to the SIM cards
having mobile data plans you should always

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.449
be able to connect to the internet.

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.729
Where this comes into its own is if you have
a personal number and a business number or

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.229
maybe one for use in the UK and another for
use in Europe.

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.069
Within the settings you can select which SIM
you want to act as the primary for internet

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:08.969
connectivity. Should that SIM not have a connection,
you will have to manually switch to the other.

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.819
Because there are 2 SIM cards in the phone
there is a bit of a confusing setup in the

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.759
way in which you use them.

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.139
On the home screen there are two icons for
the phone and two for messaging. Within the

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.389
icon is an number that symbolises which SIM
they are connected too.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:29.930
The device charges and connects to a computer
via MicroUSB and there is a 3.5mm audio jack

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.279
for audio out.

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.950
Often in cost effective handsets one of the
first things to be sacrificed is the speaker,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.460
but in the 340W it is not all that bad.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.570
It could be better I am not going to lie to
you, but it packs a punch and is louder than

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.129
I had expected.

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:51.020
It lacks a little in the mid tones but it
is most certainly capable and passable.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.009
With a rear facing 5 megapixel camera and
front facing VGA camera you can take stills

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.819
and video as well as partake in video calls
with friends, family and colleagues.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.599
When capturing stills, there is no physical
camera shutter so you do have to touch the

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.470
screen but the compact size makes this a little
easier even if you are holding it in just

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.949
one hand.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:17.139
You can set the flash to on, off or auto and
there are various scene modes

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.349
You can also control the ISO, exposure, and
white balance.

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:27.110
When recording video you can record to a maximum
resolution of 800x480.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.300
You do too have the option of a video light
and white balance when when recording video.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.530
There are no options to capture stills when
shooting video or pause video recording.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.279
Disappointingly the camera is fixed focus
and there is no zoom. But for this price,

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.169
it is understandable.

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.729
It is here where the lower resolution screen
goes in favour of the KAZAM, because it draws

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:56.099
less power and this results in a battery life
of about 1 day from the 1500mAh battery. The

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.210
second SIM does inevitably have an impact.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.429
Your usage will vary to mine, but I was able
to achieve 8am-8pm quite happily most days

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:06.369
with light to moderate use.

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:10.889
If you know that you are not a big phone user
then you may get 2 days out of it, depending

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.729
on whether you are using both SIMS or not.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.169
In some respects today you get a lot for £75
and in others you do not.

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:20.990
I think it is safe to say here you get a lot.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.979
Offering dual SIM functionality with expandable
memory and all the Microsoft services for

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.090
well under £100 in my mind is superb.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.740
It will not set the world alight and you will
probably not be the envy of those sporting

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.620
the latest Samsung or Apple handset, but you
can take solace from the fact that you are

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:56.669
considerably better off financially.
