00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.083
Santa’s Christmas

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:17.417
By Lavina Tien

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.083
It was

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:21.167
a beautiful December day,

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:25.000
with clear blue skies

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.333
and snow-covered treetops.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.417
and snow-covered treetops.

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:34.250
Christmas was in the air!

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.000
But

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.083
up in Santa’s lodge,

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:41.250
all was quiet.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.417
The usual

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.083
hustle and bustle

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:46.583
of preparing Christmas presents

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:49.667
was gone,

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:53.833
for Santa had fallen ill.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:58.667
“Oh dear,

00:00:58.667 --> 00:00:59.583
what will

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:01.250
the children say

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.083
when they don’t receive presents

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.667
this year?”

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.417
Santa wondered

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:09.083
sadly,

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:15.333
as he lay on his bed.

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.583
Suddenly,

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:22.333
he heard a noise from outside.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:25.833
He looked out of the window

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:28.833
and saw his four reindeer

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:30.500
standing patiently

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.583
as usual.

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:33.917
But

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:35.833
they seemed quite out of

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:37.333
breath,

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.667
as if they had

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:39.917
just finished

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:43.000
a long trip.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.917
And as

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:47.333
Santa took a closer look,

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.000
he could not believe what he saw.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
he could not believe what he saw.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.250
For behind the reindeer

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.333
was a long train of sleds,

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:02.917
carrying little children dressed

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:04.333
carrying little children dressed

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:10.333
in all sorts of colors.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.667
One by one,

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:14.167
they hopped out

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.333
onto the snow

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:21.167
and headed towards Santa’s lodge.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:25.000
Soon came a knock on the door.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.833
“Come in!”

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:28.583
Santa called out,

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:29.250
for he was

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.500
extremely curious.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.167
In came a

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:36.250
little girl,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.583
hugging something soft

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:38.833
hugging something soft

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:40.917
in her arms.

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:43.000
“I heard that you were sick,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.333
Mr. Santa,”

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.750
she began.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.333
“So I’m giving you my

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:49.333
teddy bear,

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.083
to keep you company.”

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:54.917
“Why, thank you

00:02:54.917 --> 00:02:56.333
little Emma!”

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:57.917
said Santa,

00:02:57.917 --> 00:02:58.833
for he knew

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:05.667
every child by name.

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:06.333
Then

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:08.667
entered a young boy

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:09.500
with a red

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.167
package in his arms.

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:16.167
“We knew that you were ill,

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:17.750
Papa Santa,”

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.167
he said.

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:21.250
“So my family knitted

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.667
this quilt for you,

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:26.833
to keep you warm in the winter days.”

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:28.667
“Why,

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.333
what a wonderful thought Paul!”

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.750
beamed Santa,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.500
patting him on the head.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.417
And one by one

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:39.667
the children came in

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:43.833
through Santa’s door,

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.500
each with a special

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.500
gift

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.417
to wish Santa well.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.583
There were cookies,

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:54.500
pies,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.167
socks,

00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:57.833
mittens,

00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.667
books,

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:01.333
jigsaw puzzles,

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:06.667
and even a small Christmas tree!

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:08.667
“Christmas delivered to my doorstep!”

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:10.500
“Christmas delivered to my doorstep!”

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.583
exclaimed Santa.

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:13.500
“Come; let us

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.583
all share these wonderful gifts.”

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:18.583
all share these wonderful gifts.”

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:20.500
And he gathered the children

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.917
And he gathered the children

00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:24.583
around him in a big circle.

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:25.583
“Santa,

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:27.833
which present do you like best?”

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:28.750
Emma soon piped up.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.917
Emma soon piped up.

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:33.667
“My dear little ones,”

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:36.833
Santa replied, smiling.

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:39.750
“It is the love and kindness

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.833
that each of you

00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:43.667
has shown to me today

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:45.167
that is the

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:52.417
best present of all.”

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.250
He looked fondly at

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.750
all the eager faces

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.667
around him.

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:02.250
“This, my little ones,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.500
is the true meaning

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.333
of Christmas.”

00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:10.833
And with that, Santa gave

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:12.083
each of the children

00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:16.083
a big, warm holiday hug.
