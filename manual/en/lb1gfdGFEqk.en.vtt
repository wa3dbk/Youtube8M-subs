00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.919
In this video I am going to teach you two
tricks: Milk the Cow and Cattle Crossing.

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:05.290
They are very similar.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.620
In both tricks all you are really doing is
hop the fence with two hands.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.259
This is Milk the Cow.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.240
For Cattle Crossing all you are going to do
is take the yoyos and cross the strings, just

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.880
like this.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.780
Really, if you have seen the tricks you kind
of already understand what to do.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.620
I’ll give you a couple of tips that will
make the trick a little bit easier to learn.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.360
If you have already been learning your two-handed
looping tricks, then the lessons you learned

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.430
there apply here.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.750
Just like with two-handed looping it might
be a little bit easier to start with two yoyos

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.750
at the same time.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.840
Eventually you want to alternate them.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.570
The same thing is true when you do Milk the
Cow.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.700
It might be easier for you to start with two
at a time.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.900
Eventually, you really just want to get into
alternating them, because this is how the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.670
trick is properly done.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.190
To get into Cattle Crossing, what you are
actually going to do is you are going to angle

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.399
the yoyos in, just like this.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.079
What that will allow you to do is to cross
the strings, just like you saw.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.070
You want to make sure that you have the alternating
loops down really well before you start trying

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.180
this.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.960
You also want to make sure that you have the
angled loop down pretty well too.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.450
That can be, actually, pretty challenging
to learn, and to do really well.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.100
Once you’ve got that you are ready to learn
Cattle Crossing.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.549
What I like to do, is, instead of going right
into it - even though you can - I usually

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.020
start with Milk the Cow.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.010
That allow me to get the yoyos under control
a little bit, and then I can start slowly

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.040
easing them in, so that I can cross them;
just like this.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.900
You want to make sure that your hands are
actually close enough together so that when

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.420
when you are doing the trick actually do cross.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.050
Otherwise, if they are too far apart then
it won’t look like the strings are crossing

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.850
and it will just look like Milk the Cow.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.010
Anyway, once you get it, just keep working
on it.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.160
Like I said, that angled loop can be pretty
challenging to learn, but once you get over

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.080
that they are pretty great tricks, and a good
addition to your two-handed yoyoing.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.999
So that is Milk the Cow and Cattle Crossing.
