00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.101
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:04.870
It's actually Saturday, but Tuesday-me will
be on vacation so you're stuck with Saturday-me,

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.870
a.k.a.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.700
The-Fault-in-Our-Stars-movie-came-out-in-America-yesterday-me,
a.k.a. the tiredest me I have ever been.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.080
So okay just briefly, at the moment it looks
like The Fault in Our Stars is going to be

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.520
the number one movie in America this week,
beating out movies that cost like hundreds

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.070
of millions of dollars to make.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.170
The reviews have been amazing and according
to Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of people who've seen

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.590
it liked it, so just real quickly: YEEEEEEEEES!

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.320
Okay dramatic tonal shift, let's begin to
talk about books that are not yet movies,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.320
but should be.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.019
I'm speaking of course about Behind the Beautiful
Forevers, the book that we're reading this

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:37.159
summer in the Nerdfighter Book Club.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:41.699
I wanna start our conversation about it today
by talking about the first four chapters.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.449
So in this book we meet a bunch of people
who live in this slum in Mumbai called Annawadi.

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.530
Now those of us who don't live in slums tend
to imagine those who do rather monolithically,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.469
but it slowly becomes clear that there's a
lot of diversity in class and status in Annawadi.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.530
Right, like the life of a malnourished garbage-picker
Sunil is very different from the life of Ahmet

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.280
who buys and sorts that garbage, and very
different from Manju's life, who's aspiring

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.350
to become the first resident of Annawadi to
graduate from college.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.490
So that's the first and easiest level of complexity
that's added to our understanding of life

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.920
in places like Annawadi.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.220
Not all poverty is equal and not all people
living in poverty are identical.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.630
But it becomes much more complex, like we
think of government corruption as a cause

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.740
of poverty, right?

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.740
And it often is.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.689
But for Manju's mother Asha, it's also a way
out of poverty.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.479
We think of empowering women with loans from
microfinance organizations to be an engine

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.310
that can drive social and economic change
in communities, and it can be.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.909
But Asha hoards and abuses microfinance-loans
in order to get ahead.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.620
I should add here for all the Nerdfighters
who give loans via Kiva, that that's why Kiva

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.149
didn't work in India until very recently and
now does so only with, like, crazy lots of

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.149
restrictions.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.009
But anyway, the complexity that's most striking
to me is that we all think of funding schools

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.780
as being good, and it is.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.700
But Manju goes to a charity-funded college
were one can graduate basically by reading

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700
CliffsNotes.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.509
Although to be fair, that's also the case
with some American universities.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.079
For me, the brilliance of Behind the Beautiful
Forevers is that it refuses to allow those

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.031
of us who live in the rich world to hide behind
shields like microfinance and charity.

00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:09.860
In one of my favorite passages, a kid says,
"Everything around us is roses, and we're

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.920
the shit in between."

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.220
Boo goes on to write about pink condominiums
and glass offices shooting up all around Annawadi,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.150
a clear metaphor for the roses.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.540
The implication here I think is that without
manure, roses can't grow.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.420
In order to have all of our inexpensive consumer
goods, the rich need the poor, and we need

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.820
them to stay poor.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.190
That's a very discomforting thing to consider,
but we shouldn't look away from it.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.770
But then again, as Boo points out, almost
no one living in Annawadi is actually poor,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.460
at least according to official definitions.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.300
Sunil the garbage-collector may have to take
puffs off of discarded cigarettes to ward

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.820
of hunger pangs, but he still lives on more
than $1.25 a day.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.040
And when we say that a hundred million people
have emerged from poverty in India in the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.680
last few decades, we're talking at least in
part about residents of Annawadi.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.510
By many measures, life is better for people
living in Annawadi than it would be without

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.910
global capitalism and this fantastic growth
of the over-city.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.570
This is a book that resists reductive readings.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.800
No matter your ideology, it gets challenged.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.250
Okay one last thing: it seems to me that in
the first 100 pages, the greatest mover of

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.730
the narrative is not like corruption or discrimination
or ambition or any of that, but luck.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.840
Or fate, I guess, depending on your worldview.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.760
But I mean the chance of having your hand
cut off while working as a kid at a recycling

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.950
plant or having a bum heart or an alcoholic
parent or being falsely accused of assault.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.340
As Abduhl's father says, "Your little boat
goes west, and you congratulate yourself.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.780
'What a navigator I am.'

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.360
And then the wind blows you east."

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.800
So Nerdfighters, I'm interested in what you
took away from the first four chapters of

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.840
Behind the Beautiful Forevers, but I also
wanna know what you think of luck.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.910
Like how do you make sense of a world where
luck plays such a huge role in your triumphs

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.910
and tragedies?

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.910
Thanks for reading the book with me.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.580
Hank, I will see you on Friday.
