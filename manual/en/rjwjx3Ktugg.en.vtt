00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:07.433
(♪♪♪)

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.300
The new Artist Acrylic Mediums
from Winsor Newton

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.633
are a great compliment to
the Artist Acrylic colour range

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:18.067
'cause they have the same
cutting edge clear resin in them

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:19.767
so that you have
no colour shift,

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:22.033
and it's a pretty concise
range as well.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.667
Didn't want to have too many
mediums that get confusing,

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.200
so we've got
primers over here,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.200
you can see I have white
gesso on the board here,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.800
goes on very fluid and opaque.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.233
Also got clear gesso.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:34.133
I have a swatch of clear gesso
I put here that's already dry,

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.033
so you can see that you
can see your substrate,

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:37.133
or your surface through,

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.800
might be something nice
if you were working on

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.667
a wood panel,

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.900
and you wanted to
see the grain come through,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.767
and I also have some
that I just brushed out here

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.433
so you can see that it
goes on sort of milky

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.033
but it will dry clear.

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.933
I've also got fluid mediums
and gel mediums.

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.833
Remember that mediums are
going to change

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:52.967
either the sheen,

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:54.467
they're going to make
something more glossy

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:56.433
or more matt,
thicker or thinner.

00:00:56.433 --> 00:01:00.300
So the fluid mediums,
both matt and gloss,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.900
you can see go on here
very very fluid.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.600
I can really thin out my
paint and get it to flow

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.800
really really far,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.000
and then I have that
in matte and in gloss,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.400
depending on what sheen
I want to have.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000
And I also have gels,
a matte gel and a gloss gel.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.267
This one here is gloss.

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:21.300
And you can notice that
when this goes on,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.967
very very thick.

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:23.600
Very thick.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.200
The colour, Artist Acrylic
colour has a bit of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.533
a heavy body to it,

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.833
but if I want to extend
that and I want thick

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:32.533
impasto brush marks,

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.067
you can see how
that just kind of

00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:35.667
clings to my brush
right there,

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:39.500
and I can make very very big,
thick textural marks in there.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.000
And if I want
even more texture,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.967
I like the modelling paste.

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:43.100
This is kind of fun.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.567
You can take this,
really really thick,

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:49.500
and it holds
these great peaks.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.233
It's very flexible,
I could even sand it,

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.900
I could even carve it
which is kind of neat.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.000
If I want to put this down
and let it dry

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.400
I can put colour on top of it,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.767
or I can mix colour
into this,

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.533
and all of these are
fully intermixable,

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:02.167
so you can do all sorts of
customized effects with them.

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.067
So that's a really neat one,
I like that a lot.

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:06.667
Over here we also
have slow dry medium.

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:08.167
Now if you want to get
your paint to be

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:11.200
a little bit more slow drying,
like an oil paint for instance,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.633
you can add this to
a one to one ratio

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.067
to your paint,

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:17.033
and it doesn't have
an acrylic binder in it,

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.033
so you want to make sure
that you don't go over

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:20.267
that one to one ratio,

00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:22.433
and it'll slow down
the drying rate by 50%,

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:23.933
give you a lot
of time to blend,

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:24.833
and over here,

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:25.900
let's say you want to
do the opposite,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.267
you want to make your acrylic
paint more like watercolour,

00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:30.200
this is really nice
the Flow Improver,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.667
you add 10% of that,
no more than 10%

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:35.000
because it also doesn't have
a binder, to water,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.433
and then use that
as your medium,

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:38.600
get it to really flow
beautifully like watercolour,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.800
so that's that great
versatility of acrylics.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.500
And then over here
we have varnishes.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.400
We've got a Matt Varnish,
Satin varnish,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.600
and a Gloss Varnish.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.633
Depending on
what sheen you want,

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.000
what you like
for your paintings,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.267
you want to
protect them from dirt,

00:02:50.267 --> 00:02:52.300
dust surface abrasion
and things like that

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.633
and let's say the painting
does get a nick in it

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:55.367
or something later on,

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:57.800
got a varnish remover as well
so you can take that off

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.233
and revarnish,

00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:00.967
and then the back of
the label's important.

00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:02.033
Check out the back
of the labels,

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:03.200
check out your paint labels.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.033
Lots of good information.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:05.700
Lets you know
whether the medium,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.267
whether the varnish is
opaque, transparent,

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:09.433
gloss or matte,
fast dry or slow dry,

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:10.900
thick or thin.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.400
And then finally our brushes.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.033
Artist Acrylic Brushes,
black and white,

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:16.333
just like the tube colours,
just like the mediums

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:17.133
and varnishes.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.500
That way with this wide
variety of things

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.667
that you want to purchase
for making paintings,

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.967
across all of this you can
tie it in with the colours.

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:26.600
It's a synthetic brush but
sturdy enough to be able

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.800
to handle the heavy gels

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.933
and the heavy body paint that
you have with Artist Acrylic.

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:37.333
