[Arlene Shechet: Pentimento in Paper]

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.940
[Dieu DonnÃ© Paper Studio, New York City]

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.040
[SHECHET] I have this impulse to put a whole
block of color on the wood.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.980
[ASSISTANT] Yeah.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.040
[SHECHET] The thing that's unseen is sometimes
way more interesting

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.750
than what people want you to see.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.880
It's like looking at a construction site--

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.880
there are the things you don't see.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.800
There are the bones.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.930
They can be beautiful.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.180
All of these molds have been made in my studio
upstate.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.109
And what they are is they're molds of things
that have happened in my studio

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.950
as I'm working with the clay.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.930
Like, here. These are just my fingers in the
clay.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.639
I happened to have a brick that had glaze
on it,

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.649
so this actually the surface of glaze.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.249
See, that is the fire brick.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.420
Some of the paper pieces actually have a record
of this clay process.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.039
At the end of the day, I'll say,

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.849
"Oh, this looks really scenic,"

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.509
Or, "I like that way that tool makes that
mark."

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:11.009
So they're actually pentimenti of my sculpture-making
process.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.960
I really love the idea of color and form being
one thing.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.980
It's not that I've painted on the paper,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.610
it's that the color is the paper

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.350
and it goes pretty deep into that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.940
--[SHECHET] We could do yellow mush.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.480
--[ASSISTANT] This, with a little yellow in
it.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.440
--[SHECHET] Or just...

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.500
--[ASSISTANT] Or just yellow.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.660
--[SHECHET] ...that bright...

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.450
[SHECHET] In that way, it's very similar to
working with the clay,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.300
where the glaze and the clay become one thing--

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.980
one structure--a surface and form.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.820
--[SHECHET] So fun.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.240
[SHECHET] The thing about working with paper
is the immediacy of that entire process.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.100
I love--I love--seeing the thing and responding.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.980
--I think it throws it off a little, so...

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.520
[SHECHET] My assistants say that I make decisions
really quicky.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.319
--Chelsea, I think we should just press the
cotton on this.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.260
I love that feeling,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.920
and for me, maybe that's being in the zone,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.430
like, "Oh, let's let it rip."

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.450
Like, just take this chance because there's
another one right over there.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.630
That's why I work on five or six pieces at
the same time.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.270
--I still would like to see if we can get
some of that mojo going

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.490
--that was happening with this,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.540
--of making the sculpture and tearing away.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.880
--Here, check it out.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.840
I always talk about this like it's an athletic
event

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.000
because it's just, like, really thinking about
it a lot the day before.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.680
It's basically a month of preparation before
coming in.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.240
--24-karat gold!

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.860
It's expensive to do this.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.870
--Very expensive!

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.090
And we really need to consolidate our time
and use it.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.819
The fun of it is that you were prepared, but
then you don't know anything.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.740
--Oh, and then we have some holes.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.320
--Natural holes.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.499
Sometimes, the work that we do on a given
layer never shows up.

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.389
You never know it's there.

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.699
Although, I believe in the energy of it underneath.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.560
There's a certain physicality to it that is
exciting to me.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.160
--[SHECHET] It might be better this way.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.840
--[ASSISTANT] Yeah.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.640
--[SHECHET] The terracotta is beautiful!

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.660
One other way that this is similar to working
in ceramics

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.549
is that it never looks as good as it looks
when it's wet.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.479
This color is so good,

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.020
and you mix it, and you love it,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.820
and then it dries, and it's lighter.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.249
What I'm always pining for is the wet.

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.409
It's closer to the aliveness of the actual
experience.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.120
So in ceramics, you make it, it's wet, you
love it;

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.719
it's dry, it looks horrible.

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.979
You fire the first firing, it looks horrible.

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.519
And then you have to bring it back to life
with the glaze.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.840
[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.880
I got a letter saying, "Show up here and we'll
teach you how to make paper."

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:39.759
That's a situation.

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:44.519
It doesn't have any answers, it just provides
a forum.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:52.520
It provides a way to create that lateral expansion
of the practice

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:56.099
without knowing where it's going to go--

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.259
and I'm hungry for that.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.960
I'm in awe of people who do the same thing
for their whole lives;

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.900
but, it would not fit, in any way, my restlessness

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.260
and my desire to investigate on a much broader
scale.
