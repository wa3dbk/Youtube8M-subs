00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.110
I got just the thing, 
don't go anywhere.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.150
When I said extra long battery life,
 I was not kidding.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.130
Take a look at this HP Pavilion, 
this is a dv6-1240us.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.760
This is an entertainment notebook
and it has a 12 Cell battery.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.130
I mean,  come on, are you ever going
to run out of battery-life?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.540
You're going to have a lot of time 
to watch all your HD movies,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.850
get all your homework done.
You know, I can't think of anything

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.170
you can't do with this notebook.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.810
So, let me tell you 
a little bit more about it.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.880
First of all it runs on the 2.1 GHz,
Intel Core 2 Duo T6500 Processor.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.080
You have 4GB of memory, 
DDR2 RAM.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.550
You have a 320GB hard drive 
at 5400 RPM.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.310
Comes fully equipped with 
Vista Home Premium 64-bit.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.260
You don't have to worry 
about loading it on here.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.410
Comes preloaded. You have 
Graphic Media Accelerator 4500MHD.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.240
DVD burner with lightScribe.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.480
And look at this, 
you have a 16" display.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.770
And this is actually a 
WXGA high-def display

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.900
with a 1366 by 768 resolution.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.900
It's perfect for HD movies.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.900
You've got that 
16 by night aspect ratio.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.950
I cannot wait to 
watch a movie on here.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.320
You also have 
802.11 a/b/g and n wireless.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.420
So surfing the web,
checking the internet,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.760
all in the high speed
possible end.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.470
Not going to be 
a problem at all.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.170
And, this whole notebook 
it's really not too heavy.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.270
I would say the battery's 
actually the heaviest part.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.380
But it weighs just over 6 lbs.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.950
OK. And it's portable 
and it's really going to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.880
fulfill all of your
entertainment needs.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.280
So let's go along and
start with our tour.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.320
Starting up top here, 
in the bezel,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.100
you have a 
1.3 megapixel HP Webcam,

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.630
which is perfect for Skyping, 
or Gchatting or video chatting.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.030
You know it's great. 
My little sister just went off to college

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.260
and we video chatting 
the other day.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.700
So, this webcam will
definitely come in handy.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.800
Moving along. 
Again you have your

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.540
16'' WXGA High-Def Screen.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.600
And then along here, 
you will see you have these

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.160
Altec Lansing Stereo
Sound Speakers.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.150
And the speakers on these,
actually, are really high quality.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.690
And it's perfect for 
listening to all of your music.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.860
Also along the front, you also see
you have your control panel

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.180
for your power, your volume, 
and your wireless on and off.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.800
Right here on the front panel.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.170
OK, moving down below, 
you will see you have a full size keyboard.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.470
Along with a numeric keypad.
And take a look, the further we get,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.440
the more you see the
design elements come out.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.600
We just see this nice, panel
black finish with the stripes,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.270
these silver stripes coming through.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.850
And you have these 
swirls on the other side.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.220
The design, is actually really hip,
really cool.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.060
OK, so you have a touch pad right here,
with your left-click and your right-click.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.760
And a scrolling bar. 
Also your mouse lock right above that.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.850
So let's move on to the side.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.200
Right here you have your DVD burner,
with lightScribe.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.790
You also have two 
USB 2.0 ports right here.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.580
Your modem and 
your Kensington lock.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.350
Now let's go to the other side.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.950
So right here you have your Express Slot,
and we are going to open up

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.760
the express lock and you will see 
out pops a remote control.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.730
So this means you can have access
to all of your music, to your movies,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.960
you can even surf the web  
all with this remote control.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.060
So, you can be chilling in your bed and 
actually enjoy all of the entertainment

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.870
that comes on this Laptop.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.640
Alright, so you also have your 
Multi-Card Reader right here,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.970
this is for your XD, MS, 
your MMC, your XD,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.510
your Memory Stick Pro cards all fit 
into this card reader.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.850
You have a USB 2.0 port, 
right here.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.680
Then my favorite port of them all, 
the eSATA/USB combo.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.360
You got an HDMI port, 
so you  can easily hook up to a flat screen.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.370
Your Ethernet, your Docking Station port,
and your VGA port.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.800
Now, I'm going to close this laptop 
and show you the front cover design.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.840
And you can see the swirls.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.050
HP was feeling very creative when 
they made the design for this Laptop.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.820
And I just like it, 
it's really funky,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.220
it's really modern, it's fresh 
and I like the black and silver.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.130
So the two tone is 
totally working for me.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.990
Now, let's flip on over 
and as promised

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.000
you've got to see this
12-cell battery.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.640
It is absolutely enormous.
 Look at it stick out.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.300
Actually it acts as a stand almost,
it props up your Laptop.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.880
It's that big, 
so typing is a little easier.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.340
And this is a 12-cell battery.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.250
You know, most Laptops they 
really come with like 6-cell,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.170
some come with 9-cell.
This is actually a 12-cell.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.070
So, battery-life not going 
to be a problem at all.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.160
So there you have it.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.930

HP Pavilion dv6-1240us Laptop

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.640
