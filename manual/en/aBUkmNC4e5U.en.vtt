Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to show you

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.821
how to make a really great really simple chicken
recipe. It's baked chicken with pearl onions,

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:15.700
bacon and mushrooms. First of all you're going
to need a chicken, I have one medium to small

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.170
size chicken. It doesn't really matter what
size chicken you use just a whole chicken

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.050
somewhere in the, I wouldn't use a fryer which
it's a big chicken. But anything from just

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.480
a small to a medium size chicken that will
keep this recipe straight as far as the amount

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.344
of what goes in what. Salt and pepper like
always, you're going to need a little bit

00:00:37.344 --> 00:00:47.690
of olive oil here ( a couple of teaspoons)
1/2 pound of bacon this is plain grocery bacon

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.039
from the grocery although you can use pancetta
if you want but regular bacon is what this

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.280
recipe is written for cause of the way it
cooks out. We also got twelve cloves of garlic

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.020
(a whole garlic) not in the jar that doesn't
taste like garlic, pearl onions here, pearl

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.990
onions are basically like little small tiny
baby onions. You can find them at the grocery

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.160
store they are also called cippolini onions
you have to look around cause not all grocery

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.390
stores carry them but they're not impossible
to find. You could in theory substitute out

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.770
shallots or regular onions for this. This
recipe is designed to work with pearl onions

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.590
cause of there really sweet flavor. I also
got about ten of these mushrooms I usually

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.250
would do about sixteen or so but these are
really big as you can tell. When I was at

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.329
the store buying them, I noticed they were
really big what you are looking for here thought

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:51.799
is about an even amount of mushrooms to onions.
So I would just kind of eyeball them and figure

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.670
this; this is about the same number here.
I also have one cup of white wine. It doesn't

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.829
matter what kind as long as it's white. I
would stay away from sweeter stuff like desert

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.510
wines cause that would have a weird flavor
but anything that you don't mind cooking with.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.720
Also you want to make sure it's warm when
you use it, not hot room temperature is fine

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.101
because if it's cold, it will actually take
the heat out of the pan when you use it and

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:20.430
we'll get to that when we get to that step.
That is definitely what I would advise, I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.220
also have some sprigs of rosemary and thyme
here you're going to need; about eight or

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.510
nine springs of each. You can also do sage
if you wanted. I went with rosemary and thyme

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.950
cause they are two of my favorites and they
are very complementary to each other. So that

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.710
being said, let' move on to what equipment
we're going to need for this recipe. Actually

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.160
I forgot one ingredient, the one optional
ingredient for this is a little bit of flour

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:56.790
to thicken the sauce at the end just like
a teaspoon maybe depending on how much fat

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.680
we got out of the bacon that is completely
optional though but we'll get to that when

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.880
we get to it.
