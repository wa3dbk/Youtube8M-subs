SECRETARY KERRY: Good morning, everybody.
I am very honored to welcome somebody who’s

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:16.199
become a friend, the president of Nigeria,
President Buhari. I first met him when I went

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.669
over there before the elections, and we had
occasion to talk about the importance of the

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.079
election process. It was in the middle of
the campaign. And then I had the pleasure

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:33.219
of going back for his inauguration, which
was very festive and represented the

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.740
first transfer peacefully of power
as the result of an election,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.040
and it was a very, very important moment.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.690
Nigeria is an extraordinarily important country,
and we have very, very important interests

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.179
together. We have pledged with the President’s
meeting yesterday to work very closely on

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:08.159
economic development, on the economy, on counterterrorism,
on regional issues, but very importantly also,

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.829
to join together in an effort to do a better
job of taking on Boko Haram. The president

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:24.460
is deeply committed to this endeavor. He has
a military background. He has himself been

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.490
in combat. He has led the armed forces of
his country and he knows what this is going

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.659
to take. So we have a ready and willing partner,
and we look forward to developing our counterterrorism

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.380
and our counter-Boko Haram plans even as we
also work on energy development, on education,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.229
health, and other issues within the country.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.039
So we’re delighted to welcome the president
here to Washington. He’s brought a very

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:01.520
significant delegation with a number of governors.
That’s very important to the ability to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.300
put in reforms, and I might mention the president
is deeply committed to tackling the problem

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.970
of corruption, which has prevented the country
from doing many of the developmental and other

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.510
initiatives that are on the table.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.300
So Mr. President, we welcome you. We’re
really delighted to have you here.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.620
Thank you very much.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.960
PRESIDENT BUHARI: Thank you very much, (inaudible).

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.520
I’m very pleased to get this opportunity

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.780
to thank the Secretary of State because his
visit to Nigeria, which he’s just referred

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:48.150
to, since his visit seemed like a friend to
Nigeria. As the United States’ message sent

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:57.010
to the previous administration was clean and
clear that the United States would not accept

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:05.270
anything extraconstitutional, that prepared
the minds of Nigerians to back us and to arrive

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.410
where we are today. Nigeria will remain very
grateful to the United States, to the President,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:22.000
and to the Secretary of State. He saw the
president then, he saw the chairman of Independent

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.170
National Electoral Commission, and he saw
the opposition. And by the day, the United

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:39.010
States maintained pressure on the government,
the law enforcement agencies, and the election

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.030
officials to make sure that the election was
free and fair.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.920
We thank God, we thank the United States,
we thank technology for the introduction of

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.140
a permanent voter’s card and reader cards
made so much difference from previous elections.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.500
I thank you very much, Secretary. Thank you
very much, ladies and gentlemen of the press.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.800
SECRETARY KERRY: Thank you, Mr. President.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.900
PRESIDENT BUHARI: Thank you very much.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.600
SECRETARY KERRY: Happy to see you. 
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.120
Thank you.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.160
We’re going to have a working lunch now. 
Thank you.
