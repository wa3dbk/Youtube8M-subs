supply in our broader society.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.850
We need you to burst through these doors today
and proclaim to the naysayers and pessimists

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.700
that while the future is uncertain, it is
not beyond hope.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.280
&gt;&gt;Stroman We are here today because Temple
University believed in us, we are graduating

&gt;&gt;Magid I wish I was sitting out there with
you today, starting all over again, starting

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:29.889
with my dreams.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:36.110
There was a popular song when I was a student
at Temple that says in all: here's to life,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.749
here's to the dreamers and their dreams, here's
to Temple.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.869

&gt;&gt;Cosby Congratulations to you, you've got

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.909
