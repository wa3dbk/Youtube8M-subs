00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.569
GameStop has a deal for you! Oh wait...I read
that wrong. GameStop has a scam for you!

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.669
I’m Figcoinc, and this is DB News!

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.180
GameStop has recently announced plans to have
their very own in-store credit card! This

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.900
credit card will be rolled out to all GameStop
stores in the next couple months. So what

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.930
does this credit card give you?
Once you sign you are eligible for PowerUp

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.930
Rewards!, PowerUp Basic members get 5,000
PowerUp Points, and Pro members get 15,000

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.220
PowerUp Points! Basically enough to obtain
a Plastic Star Wars Stein, and a neat Boba

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.180
Fett necklace! You’re pre-approved for the
credit card if you’re a member of the PowerUp

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.640
Rewards Plan!
What’s the catch? An interest rate of 26.99%

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.300
APR! By the way, that’s twice the current
fixed rate for credit cards of 13% and nearly

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.829
twice the variable rate of 15%. So far, the
marketing materials want you to “Pay over

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.539
time!” like many other in-store specific
credit cards. So you can sign up for a really

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:23.539
low interest rate, but if you do not pay after
a certain amount of time - BAM - you get his

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.009
with a 27% interest rate! Nice huh?
To be fair to GameStop, this is no different

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.149
than the Best Buy card or even the Pay Later
deals that PayPal gives you. Yet, in my opinion

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.209
it is all a rip-off. Why does GameStop even
have a credit card anyway. I feel this is

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:50.209
aimed at the young, and dumb. Gamers who come
in, haven’t learned much about the the terrible

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:57.200
things bad credit can do to you, and sign
up thinking they are getting a deal. Shame

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.700
on you GameStop. I encourage anyone who gets
offered this deal to decline. Be nice to the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.489
associates, they are only doing their job,
but do not buy into this. Let GameStop know

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.540
via your wallet that you will not stand for
this nonsense.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.940
Let me hear your thoughts on the subject!

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.180
That’s it 
for today! I would love it if you like, comment,
and subscribe! As always, thank you for being

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.829
awesome!
