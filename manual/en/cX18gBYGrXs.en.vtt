00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Back cooking with Anne again.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.330
We're back in Anne Grimes' kitchen and it's
always great to be here because of the smells

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.630
and the tastes and the way stuff looks too.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.260
Today were going to be working more with recipes
out of your famous cookbook and that cookbook

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.609
is available where Mrs. Anne?

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.609
Where can people find it?

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.449
&gt;&gt; ANNE: You can find it at the Christian
bookstores locally or you can order it online

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.039
at www.AnnesDumplings.com.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.920
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Yeah, AnnesDumplings.com, your great
website, and most of the recipes that we talk

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.550
about are also on the website.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.220
What are we going to make today?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.380
&gt;&gt; ANNE: We're going to make Watergate Salad.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.399
This is a recipe that was given to me years
ago by...

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.570
&gt;&gt; HENRY: G. Walter Liddy?

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.560
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Well no.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.790
[laughing]

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.940
&gt;&gt; ANNE: I have other friends.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.940
[laughing]

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.960
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Why is it called...who gave you
the recipe?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.600
&gt;&gt; ANNE: I have no idea why it's called Watergate
Salad.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.670
A friend of mine that worked with me named
Ilene brought it to work one day and I said

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.680
this is the most wonderful thing I've ever
had and she said well let me give you the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.690
recipe so I put it in my cookbook and its
called Ilene's Watergate Salad because I don't

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.250
know who else to give the credit to.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.110
&gt;&gt; HENRY: So, we're making Ilene's Watergate
Salad.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.350
It's in the cookbook, so what do you do?

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.080
&gt;&gt; ANNE: And it's going to be online.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.060
Actually, this is very simple.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.360
This is one of the recipes that you can go
to your store and buy store brand because

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.170
now a days we find that a lot of the times
the quality is the same as the name brand.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.000
They just have the store brand name on it,
and so all of the items I am using today are

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.620
just the store brand and you can use any store
brand.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.930
&gt;&gt; HENRY: It's good to hear you say that.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.060
You can save some money that way.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.060
&gt;&gt; ANNE: That's right.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.060
Absolutely.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.060
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Except when you're buying dumplings.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.920
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Now, we don't have a store brand
dumplings.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920
Anne's is it.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.920
Don't forget

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.920
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Exactly.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.390
&gt;&gt; ANNE: So we have here, it's a whipped topping.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.740
This is the store brand.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.590
And I have this smaller carton which is twelve
ounces.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.370
Then I use pistachio pudding.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.590
This is an instant pudding.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.430
&gt;&gt; HENRY: That looks good.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.240
Let me tilt that up so we can see it.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.240
Yeah, look at that.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.200
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Don't you love those colors.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.590
It's like a Martha Stewart color.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.890
&gt;&gt; HENRY: And that's pistachio.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.890
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Pistachio.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.599
&gt;&gt; HENRY: And that's store brand as well?

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.599
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Store brand.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.830
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Store brand pistachio instant pudding
and pie filling, I have it right here.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.420
&gt;&gt; ANNE: And actually it's about half the
price of a regular brand type item.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.579
We have 15 ounce can of pineapple and I have
drained this pineapple.

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.090
This is just a one dish deal.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.760
It's a side dish but to me its like a dessert.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.720
&gt;&gt; HENRY: I was going to say people make this
like a salad but it's also a dessert because

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.900
it is so sweet.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.190
&gt;&gt; ANNE: It's so sweet.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.150
Add one bag of marshmallows.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.139
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Ah, very nice.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.139
Wow.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.780
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Look at the big snowflakes.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.519
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Look at that, look at that.

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.549
How good does that look?

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.769
&gt;&gt; ANNE: And we just fold these in.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.390
&gt;&gt; HENRY: You know it's amazing that some
of the things you do that taste so good are

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.719
so simple.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.169
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Absolutely.

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.349
I'm all for quick and easy.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.129
That's why my dumplings are so popular.

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.129
They're quick and easy.

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.159
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Lets show how it looks in the making
here.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.019
We're going to show the finished product in
a second.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.530
She's continuing to beat those...

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.069
&gt;&gt; ANNE: You just fold it in.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.469
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Those marshmallows, you're beating
them into submission.

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:34.469
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Right.

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:35.469
[laughing]

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.129
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Now for all practical purposes this
is finished.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.379
I have toasted nuts.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.110
You can use almonds or pecans and if you want
to put some in the dish, that's fine.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.469
I like to just garnish it on top because some
people can't have nuts and here we have the

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:49.469
finished product.

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:50.640
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Here's the way it looks.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.980
How good does that look?

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.249
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Now Henry said he'd never had any.

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:55.670
&gt;&gt; HENRY: I've never had Watergate Salad.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.459
&gt;&gt; ANNE: But he doesn't know anyone that would
be bad enough to be connected with Watergate.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.083
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Actually, I know G. Gordon Liddy.

00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:02.540
Remember he came to Greenville one time.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.289
&gt;&gt; ANNE: Alright, but we got a spoon over
there and we've got the dish.

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:12.230
&gt;&gt; HENRY: Alright, I'm just going to scoop
out some here, and this is my first taste

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.509
ever of Watergate Salad and....oh man.

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.970
&gt;&gt; ANNE: It's like a cloud isn't it.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.389
&gt;&gt; HENRY: I thought it was like a salad.

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.520
It's more like a dessert.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520
Anne's Dumplings.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.810
Get the book its online AnnesDumplings.com
or area Christian bookstores and make yourself

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.650
some Ilene's Watergate Salad.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.400
Thank you Ilene.
