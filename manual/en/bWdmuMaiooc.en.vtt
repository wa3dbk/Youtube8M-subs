00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.440
Biomechanical causes of knee pain are probably
one of the most commonly cited running

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.349
injuries, any way would be to have anterior
or front knee pain, pain behind the knee cap

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.450
pain around the knee cap area.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.050
Essentially, if you think of the knee as a
hinge or modified hinge joint that allows

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.810
you to rotate through.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.949
It has to be stable in both that position
and that position.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.140
It is a tension compression matrix, so, the
soft tissue holding it and pulling it against

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.000
itself in all the different directions.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.620
It's translating force that is created in
the hip and in the foot, ok, so as the foot

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.540
rolls in and out it moves the tibia as the
hip moves in and out it moves the femur.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.170
So, if your footâ€™s rolling in and your femur
is rolling out you get a twist going on at

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.460
the knee or vice versa.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.150
So, they have to happen in synchronisation
with each other the rolling in and out.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.379
If they don't you get the kneecap running
up and down out of its grove.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.930
Or you get excess load medial knee pain through
there.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.010
Also things like weak muscles on the inside
of your knee will mean that the kneecap doesn't

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.600
run smoothly so you start to get knee pain
like that.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.250
But, essentially, from a foot point of view
if you pronate too late into the step it rolls

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.130
your tibia in while your femur's trying to
roll your out.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.770
So you end up getting twists and compressions
and rotations there.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.000
If it happens too quickly you can get strains
down the illotibial band and into the outside

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.660
of the knee.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.350
If you have a blockage in the function of
your big toe, for instance, you can't bend

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.810
forward so some people might hyper extend
the knee or bend it too far backwards so it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.670
depends on how you're put together as to where
your pain will go.
