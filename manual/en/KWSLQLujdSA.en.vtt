Today on our 2013 Chevrolet Silverado, well
be installing the U-Ace Floor Mat kit for

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:13.299
the front and rear part number L1CH01801509.

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.630
Well start our test fit by removing the old
mat from the driver side.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:28.670
Well lay in our new mat and make sure that
it fits nice.As you can see here the thermoplastic

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.210
rubber is very durable.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.710
It wont crack or tear.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.500
Itll give many years of use.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.660
If you flip the mat over on the underside,
youll see the fiber technology which is the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.040
MAXspider Technology and this helps keep the
mat in place from sliding around and without

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.070
harming your carpet.Its got a good lining
that goes out around the contour of our vehicle,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.860
stretches up underneath of our pedals and
its got a grip here for when youre resting

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.710
your heel so you dont slip when your heels
on the brake or when your heel is resting

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:11.570
here for pressing on the gas pedal.Now, we
can go ahead and replace our passenger 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:03:26.310
side mat.
