&gt;&gt; We know it
isn't always easy being queer.

00:00:05.326 --> 00:00:06.796
People aren't always
as welcoming.

00:00:06.796 --> 00:00:08.416
&gt;&gt; And you can face
discrimination even

00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:09.476
from those you trust the most.

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:11.696
&gt;&gt; But here at UCL,
things are different.

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:14.666
We've made it our priority to
create a safe, welcoming

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.426
and friendlier environment
for everyone.

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:21.626
&gt;&gt; By promoting inclusivity
and tolerance across campus.

&gt;&gt; The LGBT Networks mean that
it's open to anyone

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:29.016
and everyone so just join us.

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:33.366
&gt;&gt; Whether you're straight, gay,
boy, girl, it doesn't matter.

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:35.886
We want to welcome you to
the university, and London.

&gt;&gt; New in the city?
Let's hang out.

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:46.696
Not new? Let's hang out anyway.

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:50.476
&gt;&gt; We run loads of fun events
including picnics, book clubs,

00:00:50.856 --> 00:00:52.826
regular film nights,
theatre nights,

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:54.496
parties and much, much more.

00:00:54.886 --> 00:00:57.086
&gt;&gt; We also work together
with other societies at UCL

00:00:57.216 --> 00:01:00.476
such as Jewish Society, Spanish,
European, Musical Theatre,

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.876
Scandinavian and many more,
to help create an accepting

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:04.816
and friendly environment.

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:08.706
&gt;&gt; We also host workshops with
support and community groups

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:10.276
such as Terrence Higgins Trust and
numerous other charities.

00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:11.746
Remember, play it safe.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:13.916
&gt;&gt; We host discussions: religion

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:15.776
and homosexuality,
gay family life,

00:01:15.996 --> 00:01:17.146
&gt;&gt; Or gay life throughout
the world

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:18.626
so come along and learn more.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.236
&gt;&gt; But it's not all
about students.

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:27.736
We also have a large and
active LGBT network for staff.

00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.386
&gt;&gt; Our aim is to create
a comfortable environment

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:34.246
for staff to be out at UCL
and create a tolerant, diverse

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:36.706
and welcoming community
for the students as well.

with friends or by yourself,

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:46.516
whether you're a postgrad, 
an undergrad,

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:48.716

whatever you're interested in,

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.776
