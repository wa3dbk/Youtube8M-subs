00:00:01.559 --> 00:00:03.180
What about Loch Ness?

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.330
It's a lake.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.940
I know it's a lake, I'm talking about the monster.  If he's real, that means dinosaurs are real.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.130
Dinosaurs are real.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.139
I know that, but they could be out there like rampaging through the city and stuff

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:21.819
I'm more worried about cthulhu.

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:25.289
Now listen close, people don't like too much exposition all at once, so I'm going to try to say this as fast as I can.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.390
I like exposition.
What?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.380
I like exposition

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.330
Well most people don't Blair.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.660
That's not really true

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.650
at the very least it's debatable.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.260
It's like when a Super Villain captures the hero.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.800
there's always a expositions in explain
why he's doing what he's doing

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.740
and sometimes that the best part of the
movie.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.640
And exposition can really save a movie.  Look at P.T. Anderson's last film.  What was that about?!  That was crap.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.030
Can I just say what I need to say without us 
arguing about it?!
You can, but it's not as fun.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.560
(hahaha)

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.410
Shut up!  Listen.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.700
Now the first thing we know

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.570
is that everything is

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.390
based on something real

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.770
which means every movie

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.260
book, video game, song, ect.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.120
based on something that really happened.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.510
Which brings us to the second thing we know.  We can't kill ANYTHING.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.710
uh...

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.120
question.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.650
What about things that are already dead?

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.480
What you mean like somebody else killed them before we got there?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.220
No like zombies,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.710
or vampires

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.229
you know their already dead so we can't really
killing twice?
 That's a good question.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.570
NO.  No killing at all.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.160
Do you want to start a war or a blood feud because you shot first?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.699
Ah, like Solo.

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:53.730
Ha, no.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.180
that imply there were two shots fired

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.510
and we all know

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.990
our boy Han, was the only one to fire at all.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.150
Continue.
Thank you.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.260
Whatever the monster is, we have to stop it, or 
trap it, or figure out why it's so fucking pissed off at us.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.620
Which leads us to the third thing we know which might be the most important

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.559
no matter what

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.680
must protect the human race.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.239
Doesn't seem very likely does it?

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.349
What doesn't?

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.790
Us, being the protectors of the human race.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.230
You know, we're only four guys.
I think you are forgetting that the busters of ghosts

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.009
were only four guys.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:34.599
Not really,

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.959
three of them were scientists

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.029
and one of them knew how to trap ghosts.

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.139
Shouldn't there be like some sort of government agency or something taking care of all this?

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.999
Yeah, well, there isn't, just us.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.279
Against every monster in fiction?
Yes.

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.279
Sounds like there's already plot holes.

00:02:54.279 --> 00:03:00.389
Oh, another question.
Yes the short guy on the couch?
Do you have any more of those yogurts?

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.609
Yes I do.

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:09.159
Can I have one?
Nope.  Yogurts are for closers.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.229
Shouldn't we be doing something?
