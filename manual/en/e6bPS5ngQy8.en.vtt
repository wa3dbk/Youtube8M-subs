00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.769
Some interesting statistics: 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.609
every minute 113 mobile phones are lost in the USA, every week 12 thousand of notebooks are lost in the USA airports and every month in London

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:28.609
cabs they find 10 thousand of phones. Gadgets
get lost. Philips has an interesting solution to this problem -- InRange breloque. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.230
What is it? That's a breloque with the built-in battery which works with iPhone via Bluetooth. IPhone has an application (looks like this) which shows where the breloque is. 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.930
You set 'range' and when the device is outside the scope, the breloque starts to peep. 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.989
It is always with you, it is whether attached o your keys or in your wallet or in your purse. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.100
For example, you stepped out of a taxi, walked 10 m and the breloque started to peep. Let's test it. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.100
Both the phone and the breloque started to peep. Everything works. 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.360
It works 3 months without charge from one battery. Two batteries are included. 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.360
The device will cost 49 euros. Now it's available only in Europe.
