00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.580
Hi my name is Bradon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:14.740
make a really great holiday caramelized onion
and sage stuffing. Here's a neat tip for getting

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.259
your batter into those cups a little easier.
Just put it into some means of pouring it

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:31.099
out. I'm using a measuring cup. This will
just make it easier to actually pour it into

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:48.920
the muffin pan. I'm just going to take my
spatula here, there we go, get in there. Alrighty,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:58.660
now let's get them in the pan. So now I'll
use my trusty monkey pot holder to grab a

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.170
hold of that tin. Now the thing that's really
important here is you want to make sure that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.330
they don't stick. So what I recommend doing
is using everyone's favorite non stick spray

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.460
on pan coating, and just so I don't make a
mess I'm just going to kind of hold this up.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.850
And really very very liberally spray this
stuff in here. Make sure you get all the edges

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.229
in the bottom just like that. Put that aside.
And now we're just going to pour this right

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.170
into the pan. I'm going to do about a half
of muffin here in each one, can probably get

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:47.740
about four or five out of this batch. Got
to get the spatula again, the ever trusty

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:59.450
ruby spatula. There we go. And now we're going
to plop these into the oven for according

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.600
to the package, fifteen to twenty minutes.
That way we can go ahead and get started doing

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.700
everything else while these go in the oven.
So, I'll be right back.
