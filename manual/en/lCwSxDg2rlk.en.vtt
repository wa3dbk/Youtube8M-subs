00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.900
Ideas: they can come at you fast, changing
the way you think about things, run your daily

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.760
life or work at your business.
At Missouri State University, we had a big

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.120
idea – one that would improve the quality
of life for those in the community and facilitate

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:34.790
economic growth – and we’ve made this
idea a reality. It’s called IDEA Commons.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.070
IDEA Commons is an area in downtown Springfield…a
new type of urban research park – where

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.770
people can live, shop, learn, create and work
– bringing together the University, companies,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.510
lofts, non-profits, retail space, and accommodating
people of all walks of life. It will help

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.620
to revitalize the area, retain amazing talent
and promote economic development.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.780
Essentially, IDEA Commons is a community within
a community that blends the elements of Innovation,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.890
Design, Entrepreneurship and the Art: all
the things that make a community dynamic and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.939
help it to thrive!
The St. John’s Medical Research Institute

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.030
is one of the many partners at the Jordan
Valley Innovation Center. This center features

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.109
state-of-the-art research and development
labs where scientists from the university

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:26.609
as well as corporate partners like us conduct
research and develop new, important products.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:30.939
The common denominator among all of the projects
is this: innovation.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:37.630
We’re excited to help represent the Design
element of Idea Commons. To be part of such

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.380
a progressive collective of creative thinkers
and community shapers, has been very rewarding

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.069
for us. And The Marlin Network of companies
really depends on emerging talent.

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.729
In fact over the years we’ve hired more
than 100 graduates from the MSU Art &amp; Design

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.500
program alone. And universities depend on
companies like us to give those students real

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.490
world experience. Or clients, like Starbucks,
see design as a competitive advantage, a differentiator

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.700
for their brand. And incorporating good design
into our workspace here at Idea Commons inspires

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.450
creativity.
You know design is part of the fabric of a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.560
progressive community like Springfield. For
us, we can be at our creative best, we can

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.080
work on global brands and enjoy an amazing
lifestyle in a vibrant community. It’s a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.570
great balance.
Becoming an entrepreneur is hard work – there

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.090
are so many plans to make and resources to
find. A few years ago we worked with the Small

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.090
Business and Technology Development Center
to help us through a transitional period in

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.060
our company – Gaskin Hill Norcross.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.840
We’re now playing a big part in the IDEA
Commons by planning and designing the renovation

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.900
for the former Willow Brook facility to make
it the new Center for Free Enterprise and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.481
Business Development. This center will have
incubator space for the entrepreneur who needs

00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:12.040
a place to set up shop as well as lots of
other resources.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.010
In short it will be a one-stop shop for an
entrepreneur’s needs, and we are proud to

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.550
take part in this growth.
When it’s complete, Brick City will be the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.400
home for the Art and Design Department of
MSU. &nbsp;The complex of buildings known as Brick

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.890
City will house all 15 of the department's
diverse areas of study and the Art and Design

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.510
gallery.
The arts, including all disciplines under

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.740
Art and Design are about visual communication,
collaboration of ideas and efforts, and conversation

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.710
about the visible world, the art we make,
as well as the cultural and historical contexts

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.100
that surround it. These three things relate
to the artist's ability to be creative. As

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.440
creative individuals, we see things that everyone
sees, while making connections that nobody

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.540
else has made. &nbsp;
Artists give visible form to these connections;

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.010
they contribute new thoughts and ask challenging
questions to help us see the world in new

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.760
ways.
It is the ability to do this that allows artists

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.650
to contribute to their communities on a university,
local, regional, and even on a global scale.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.970
&nbsp;Brick City and IDEA Commons will give the
Art and Design Department of MSU a perfect

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.400
place in which to do this.
IDEA Commons is a community effort to create

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.280
new jobs and recruit and retain talent in
our wonderful city…jobs that require forward-thinking

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.070
individuals – creative people who will continue
to develop the economic landscape of Springfield

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.790
for years to come.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.910
It’s your idea…IDEA Commons.
