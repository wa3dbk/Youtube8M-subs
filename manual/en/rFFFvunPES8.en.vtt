00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.500
I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.180
whether it's a cold soda or a hot
coffee

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.360
drinking a beverage can affect the
temperature readings taken by

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.940
oral electronic thermometers anywhere from
one to two degrees

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.550
research led by University of Virginia
Health System nurses shows that it can

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.590
take as long as 23 minutes

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.630
for body temperatures to return to
normal

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.790
there's many factors that can make it
complicated

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.970
many variables impact the accuracy of a temperature

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.260
things such as chewing, smoking,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.070
exercising, as well eating and drinking,
particularly eating and drinking

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.840
food and beverages that have a hot or a cold consistency.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.280
As nurses Beth Quartrara
and Tricia Jenkins take temperature readings on a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.340
regular basis.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.210
As researchers they discover that their
findings can improve the way they care

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.280
for patients.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.090
Well as a nurse, we need to stay on top of a
patient's vital signs. Their temperature

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.580
is one of the most important vital signs
because in our population

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.899
specifically

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.240
we have patients who have just had
surgery and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.470
temperature is an important indication
of

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.799
an affection, so we take temperatures
many times a day every day

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.259
in order to stay on top of that.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.100
To
get the results the nursing research

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.400
team placed volunteers in a
climate-controlled room

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.080
they measured their height, weight, and normal
baseline body temperature.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.830
When the volunteers drank cold
beverages it took 15 minutes for their

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.680
temperatures to return to normal.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.160
When the volunteers drank hot
beverages it's a 23 minutes to return to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.750
normal.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.810
The greatest implication is it reduces
the guessing game,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.480
we will more consistently have accurate
temperatures

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.630
because now we know that if you drink a
cold beverage you should wait 15 minutes

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.220
to be checked the temperature if you
drink something hot we should wait 23

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.910
minutes, so

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.940
on average were telling clinicians to
wait 30 minutes.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.040
Work like theirs not only improves
patient care but also adds to the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.799
overall quality of hospital nursing
programs,

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.980
something indicated by the Health
Systems recently gained

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.360
nursing Magnet status a symbol of
excellence.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.220
