00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.130
&gt;&gt;The Toyota Etios Liva looks good in bright
colors such as the Vermilion red car we tested.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.000
The Liva is powered by a 1.2 litre petrol
engine that puts out 80 bhp of power and 104

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Newton metres of torque.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:48.100
It feels easy to drive in city driving conditions,
but is not as peppy as some of its rivals.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.760
The Liva looks better than the Etios sedan
and is very proportionate.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:02.719
The top-end VX model has generous use of chrome
on the grille, door handles and boot hatch.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.970
The large glass area offers good all-round
visibility.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:16.280
The plastics feel hard to touch.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:29.750
But one thing is for sure, the Liva is a spacious
car, and can seat three adults in the rear

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:47.470
seat 
without a fuss because of its flat seat and

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.200
floor.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.540
The Liva’s electronic power steering is
very light and does not give good feedback,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.390
but it’s easy to maneuver in city traffic.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.630
There is a tall gap between first and second
gears.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.110
But torque delivery is quite linear and the
car can rev from as low as 900 rpm in any

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:23.290
gear without any jerks.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:03:10.069
It can cruise at 40 kilometers an hour at
just 1200 rpm in 5th gear, which should be

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:20.069
good for fuel economy.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.750
The Liva comes equipped with manual airconditioning,
and quirky AC vents which cool the cabin very

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.750
effectively.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.750
Mirrors are also manually adjustable.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.209
Instrumentation is basic with the stickering
on the speedometer and tachometer looking

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.569
a little garish.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:46.060
The fuel gauge is digital and the only other
function it has 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:56.040
is two tripmeters.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.910
The music system is a DVD-based one, but you
need additional cables for USB and Aux in

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.910
functions.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.930
Steering audio controls come only on the VX.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.270
The boot can hold just a few bags with about
251 litres of space.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.090
The folding rear seat does not fold fully
flat, but can increase load space a bit.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.340
Overall, with just the right bits of chrome
and alloys, the Liva is a practical car whose

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.900
unique proposition is the comfortable seating
it offers.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.280
The short gearing on the car, allows for great
city driving, but is not too peppy on the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:36.180
highway.
