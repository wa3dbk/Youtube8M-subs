Hi, ah, today I am going to show you how to
make a nice pop. It's really pop, and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.159
it's more like a fruit drink at same
time so I'm gonna show you how to make it. So,

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.310
all you have to do... is........

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.449
you buy this pop called

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.210
Diet Sunkist Sparkling Lemonade- you buy Sunkist Sparkling Lemonade. You

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.740
get one of those out.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.310
You will also need

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.050
some orange juice.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.700
So, I'm getting that right now. And....

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.440
Sorry, one second. Okay. So,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.360
you get your orange juice, and your Sunkist Lemonade. And....

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.810
all you have to do is....

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.550
you take a....... like a cup..... or- yeah, whatever. Okay.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.090
Then, all you have to do is...you just.. basically... yeah- you just

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.910
take this... and.. you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.830
open the Diet Sunkist

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.310
and then

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.010
pour some of it in. Yeah....

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.990
it's fizzing up

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.630
there we go

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.590
and... all you do is...

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.180
pour in a little more. A little bit at a time so it doesn't over-fizz up

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.460
and then, all you do is

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.530
you take your orange juice

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.510
and you just pour a little bit in there.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.520
This tastes REALLY, REALLY good.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.530
You might not like it, but... but

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830
I think it tastes really good. So,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.570
all you need to do is- you do that, and then, you don't even really need to mix it. You can just

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.000
drink it.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.900
Oh, that's very nice.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.829
so that is how to make

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.130
a fruit drink out of Diet Sunkist Lemonade and orange juice. Thank you,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.570
and bye!
