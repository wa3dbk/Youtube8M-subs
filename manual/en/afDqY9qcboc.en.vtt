Hi we are Dan and Judy on behalf of Expert
Village in this segment we are going to talk

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.460
about the types of car seats. The next style
of seat is called a combination seat. This

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.039
seat here this is used for the older larger
children this is only for forward facing it

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.390
can not be used rear facing. It usually comes
with a hardness at some point depending on

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.330
the seat it self when you exceed the weight
using the hardness you remove the hardness

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.470
and use the vehicle seatbelt through what
is called a comfort clip system like this

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.610
where the shoulder portion comes through here.
It could be adjusted higher or lower depending

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:45.010
on the child's size and the belt would cross
here and go into the buckle so you would have

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.950
the waist and shoulder section like that.
The next style of seat is called a booster

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.640
seat it comes in two varieties the backless
booster or a back booster. These typically

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.020
go from anywhere from 40-80 to a 100 pounds
depending again on the seat specifications.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.650
These are not hardness in the vehicle they
are used with the vehicle seat belts only,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.140
The difference on a the back booster and the
backless booster is this back this is could

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.640
be good if you have a child that falls asleep
a lot because this keeps the child up right.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.320
You have these side wings that they can sleep
against, this also has the comfort rotating

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.220
for the shoulders strap so it is good. A lot
of these backless boosters comes with a strap

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.290
that attaches to the base and can be used
to help position that shoulder belt across

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.340
the shoulder between the shoulder and the
neck. The last style we are going to talk

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.299
about today is a special made style this is
right safe vest this is used for special needs

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.920
children and or in a position where you have
only a lap situation and you can install a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.260
top tethered and this could be used to give
them a 5. hardness where they have the lap

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.500
support and the shoulder support. It is also
good for children who don't stand in place

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.340
because they could be tethered and hooked
in and helps retain them helps keeps them

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.819
in place.
