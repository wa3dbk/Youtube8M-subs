00:00:01.607 --> 00:00:02.803
Come.

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:06.607
Ah, Terry, come in, come in, come in.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.885
- Now, do you know why I sent for you?
- Not really, sir. No.

00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:14.963
Not really, not really. No.

00:00:15.052 --> 00:00:16.281
Well, um...

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:19.890
First of all, let me congratulate you
on winning the school poetry prize.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:21.376
Oh, thank you, sir.

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:25.414
Mr Drip tells me that it's
one of the most mature and exciting poems

00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:27.010
he's ever received from a pupil.

00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:28.893
Don't suck your thumb, boy.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.611
Well, I'm not, sir.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:35.418
No, it was just a piece of general advice
for the future.

00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:42.171
Now, Terry. Terry. Terry. Terence. Terenche.

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:45.619
It's about this poem, really. I've read it, Terry.

00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:47.581
I can't pretend to be much of a judge of poetry,

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:50.337
I'm an English teacher, not a homosexual.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:55.940
I have to say that it worried me.

00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:59.541
- Oh?
- Yes, worried me. I have it in front of me. Now...

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.062
"Inked Ravens of Despair

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:05.499
"Claw Holes in the Arse of the World's Mind."

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.384
I mean, what kind of a title for a poem is that?

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.543
- It's my title, sir.
- "Arse of the World's Mind"?

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.385
I mean, what does that mean?
Are you unhappy about something?

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:17.953
I think that's what the poem explores.

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:20.628
Explores? Oh, it explores, does it? I see.

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.626
Well, let's have a look
at what it explores, shall we?

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:25.594
"Scrotal threats...

00:01:26.475 --> 00:01:28.866
"unhorse a question of flowers."

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.631
I mean, what's the matter with you?
Are you sickening for something?

00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:34.312
Or is it a girl? Is that the root of the problem?

00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:36.867
It's not something I can explain, sir.
It's all in the poem.

00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.521
It most certainly is "all in the poem."

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.360
Now, "I asked for answers
and got a head full of heroin in return."

00:01:45.202 --> 00:01:47.112
Terry, look at me. Who's been giving you heroin?

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:49.719
This is a very serious matter.
We must do something about it.

00:01:49.804 --> 00:01:52.035
- No one, sir.
- No, no, Terry, I must insist.

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.764
It's in the poem. "I asked for answers
and got a head full of heroin."

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:58.043
This is a police matter.
You must tell me who's been giving you heroin.

00:01:58.126 --> 00:01:59.641
Sir, no one has given me heroin.

00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:02.800
So this poem is a fiction, is it?
A fantasy? A lie? What's happening?

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.366
No, it's all true. It's autobiographical.

00:02:04.447 --> 00:02:07.247
Well then, Terry, I must insist you tell me
who has been giving you heroin.

00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:08.729
Is it another boy?

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.530
Well, sir. You have.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.602
I have?
What are you talking about, you diseased boy?

00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:18.162
This is rank standing impertinence.
I've never given anyone heroin in my life.

00:02:18.252 --> 00:02:20.530
- No, it's a metaphor.
- Metaphor? How metaphor?

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:25.484
It means, I came to school to learn,
but all I got was junk instead of answers.

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:31.089
Junk? What are you talk...
The GCSE syllabus is most rigidly adhered...

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:35.650
- Well, you know, it's just an opinion.
- Oh, is it? And is this just an opinion, too?

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:39.700
"When time fell wanking to the floor,
I kicked his teeth."

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.375
"Time fell..." I mean, is it just put in to shock?

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.929
Or is there something personal
you want to discuss with me?

00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:46.581
"Time fell wanking to the floor."

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:49.176
- I mean, what does it mean?
- It's a quotation.

00:02:49.262 --> 00:02:53.382
Quotation? Quotation? Who from? It's not
Milton and I'm pretty sure it can't be Wordsworth.

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:54.977
- Bowie.
- Bowie? Bowie?

00:02:55.064 --> 00:02:56.897
- David Bowie.
- Oh.

00:02:56.986 --> 00:02:59.101
And is this David Bowie, too, hm?

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:03.422
"My body disgusts, damp grease

00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:07.582
"wafts sweat balls
from sweat balls and thigh fungus."

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.663
- I mean, do you wash?
- Of course I wash.

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:14.426
Well, then, why does your body disgust you?
It looks perfectly all right to me.

00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:17.549
Why can't you write about meadows or something

00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:18.985
Never seen a meadow.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:21.712
Well, what do you think the imagination is for?

00:03:21.794 --> 00:03:24.309
"A girl strips in my mind

00:03:24.474 --> 00:03:27.273
"squeezes my last pumping drop of hope

00:03:27.355 --> 00:03:31.269
"and rolls me over to sleep alone."
You're 15 years old, Terry.

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:34.555
- What's going on inside you?
- I think that's what the poem...

00:03:34.637 --> 00:03:36.913
What the poem explores.
Don't tell me, don't tell me.

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:38.992
I cannot understand anymore.
I cannot understand.

00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:40.797
Well, sir. You were young once.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.109
Hm? Well, yes. In a sense, I suppose.

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.079
Well, didn't you ever feel like that?

00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:48.711
You mean, did I want to
"Fireball the dead cities of the mind

00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:52.513
"and watch the skin peel and warp?"
Then, thankfully, no, I did not.

00:03:53.323 --> 00:03:57.921
I may have been unhappy from time to time
if I lost my stamp album or broke a penknife.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:00.884
I certainly didn't write it all down
and show it to people.

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:04.517
- Perhaps it might have been better if you had.
- Oh, might it, young Terry? Might it?

00:04:04.608 --> 00:04:08.204
I suppose I am one of
the "unhappy bubbles of anal wind...

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.528
"popping and winking in the mortal bath." Am I?

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.250
Oh, your silence tells me everything. I am!
I am an unhappy bubble of anal wind.

00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:20.402
Well, that's just how I see it. That's valid.

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:22.803
Valid? Valid? You're not talking about a bank note.

00:04:22.894 --> 00:04:25.648
You are calling your headmaster
"an unhappy bubble of anal wind."

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:27.448
I'm one, too.

00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:29.844
Oh, as long as we're all
unhappy bubbles of anal wind

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.451
popping and winking in the mortal bath,
then there's no problem,

00:04:32.537 --> 00:04:34.687
but I don't propose
to advertise the fact to parents.

00:04:34.777 --> 00:04:37.735
If this is poetry, then every lavatory wall
in England is an anthology.

00:04:37.816 --> 00:04:39.571
<i>What's happened to
The Oxford Book of English Verse?</i>

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.935
Where's that disappeared to in all this, hm?

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.898
Perhaps that's the lavatory paper.

00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:48.496
- Is that clever?
- I don't know.

00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:52.018
I suppose it's another quotation
from Derek Bowie, is it?

00:04:52.102 --> 00:04:54.458
I can't understand anymore. I cannot understand.

00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:56.543
It's not surprising, sir.

00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:58.502
Perhaps you're frustrated.
After all, it's a lonely job.

00:04:58.585 --> 00:05:03.138
I am frustrated. It is a lonely job.
I'm assailed by doubt and wracked by fear.

00:05:03.626 --> 00:05:06.779
Well, then write it down.
Write it down, get it out your system.

00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:09.143
"Assailed by doubts, wracked by fear."

00:05:09.228 --> 00:05:13.541
You think? Yes.
Assailed by doubts, wracked by fear.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.419
Tossed in a wrecked mucus foam...

00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:19.947
- of... of...
- Hatred?

00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:22.182
Good, good. What about "steamed loathing"?

00:05:22.432 --> 00:05:24.345
Better. You're a natural.

00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:27.187
Wrecked mucus foam of steamed loathing.

00:05:27.275 --> 00:05:29.584
Snot trails of dust

00:05:30.316 --> 00:05:33.389
perforate the bowels of my intent.

00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:36.275
Put on your red shoes, Major Tom...
