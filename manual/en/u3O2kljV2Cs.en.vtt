00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.130
Today on this 2012 GMC Acadia, we're going
to be installing Tow Ready Trailer Harness,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.570
part number 118451.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.780
The first thing we need to do is remove the
tail lights.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.550
There are two screws holding in each tail
light housing.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.900
We'll use a small flat headed screwdriver
to pop open the covers and use a 7-mm socket

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.350
to remove the screws and remove our two tail
lights.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.210
Be careful as you pry the mount not to break
off the positioning tabs or tear the wiring.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.379
With the tail light out, we'll go ahead and
disconnect it from the vehicle's factory harness.

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.870
We'll do the same on both the passenger and
driver's side of the vehicle.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.649
Next, we'll take our harness and connect the
end with a yellow wire to the OEM harness.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.869
We need to fuse the end with green wire as
well as our 4-pole down through the opening

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.399
between the body and the frame of the vehicle.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.179
We'll also remove these two body panel screws
so we can move the body a little bit to create

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.110
a bigger opening for fishing our wires through.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.130
We'll be using a piece of air line today to
help us fish it through, but you can use pretty

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:54.189
much anything that you can maneuver through

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:24.170
with the opening such as a 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:50.630
wire hanger.
