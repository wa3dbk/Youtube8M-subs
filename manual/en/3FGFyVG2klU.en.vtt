00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.310
With this year's E3 only weeks away, Sony
is beginning to take the wraps off its next

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.250
big product launch, the Playstation Move.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.260
Introduced at E3 last year, the Move uses
a combination of motion tracking and inertial

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.260
sensors to add motion control to the Playstation
3 console, hoping to recapture some of the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.980
market taken by Nintendo's Wii.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.300
Using the Playstation Eye camera, the PS3
tracks the glowing balls on top of the controller.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.640
By combining movements and visual tracking,
the console can then translate it into very

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.290
precise tracking in three dimensions.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.390
Sony's project leader, Richard Marks, said
that the Move is ready on the hardware side,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.489
with a slated launch by the last quarter of
2010.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.489
Dr. Richard Marks
Manager, Sony R&amp;D Special Projects

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.950
"The controller hardware is finished, and
the software libraries are finalized for launch.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:57.280
The games are still being finished up, so
it's a software issue as normal, so the game

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.940
teams will use it, everything up to the last
minute as always."

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.210
Right now, the Move currently functions with
several tech demos, including this one that

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.950
allows users to paint. The controller acts
as a brush, different colors can be selected.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.090
Users can also control the pressure of the
virtual brush for broad or narrow strokes.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.799
For designing beyond basic pictures, Move
software also supports 3D modeling. Dr. Marks

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.209
presented a method to lathe a piece of virtual
marble. He also took a flat virtual surface

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.220
and modeled it by pulling points in three
dimensions. NATS

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.139
Move also supports facial recognition. Here,
Marks can wear a virtual metal suit. The hands

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.219
are controlled by the Move controllers, while
body and head movements are handled by the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.630
camera's recognition software.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.729
Launching around the same time as the Move
is Microsoft's Project Natal, which does away

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.840
with controllers altogether. When asked about
Project Natal, Marks said combining cameras

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.889
and controllers was the best choice.

00:01:55.889 --> 00:02:02.979
"My belief is that the controller will never
go away completely. There are things already,

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.179
we do face tracking with the camera, and you
can do things where maybe your hand is detected

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:14.431
with a camera where you don't use a controller,
but so many experiences will always need a

00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:17.769
controller that now I believe that's a fundamental
part of the system."

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.319
The controller itself is made of black PVC
plastic, while the glowing ball on top is

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.329
a squishy but very strong rubberized transparent
plastic. It is lit by three different colored

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.549
LEDs that cycle through colors to differentiate
controllers to the camera. The Playstation

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.609
Eye can track the colors anywhere as long
as they're in the field of view.

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.049
"I think we're really proud of our accuracy
and precision and responsiveness, but you

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.780
know, those can always just get better. I
think they're to the level now that, because

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.730
human reaction is a certain speed they're
fast enough for that."

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.280
We noticed that the PS3 in use had E3 demos
ready to go, but we weren't allowed to see

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.620
them, so check back with us for more E3 coverage
and updates on the Move.
