00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.350
so i'm in Dallas Texas doing a Keynote Speaking
and I'm really excited to be here

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.749
but one of the uh... membership
programs or continuity programs i'm involved in

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.750
uh... the Robert Jones Beauty Academy

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.420
and Robert lives here in Dallas, So we
took a few minutes to do a quick interview

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.000
because i wanted to

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.590
introduce him first of all

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.229
and talk about what made him
successful in his career, So..

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.830
Robert, take it away for just a second

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.020
I do hair and makeup for photo work
thats what I mainly do now

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.950
and i

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.880
started out in a salon

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.910
I decided while I was in the salon, about 12 years
into my career, that I wanted to do this for a living

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.170
and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.730
so I decided to take a couple photography
classes and learn how

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.370
light affected makeup

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.770
so I could know a little bit more

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.560
uh...

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.309
and i'm one of those people that

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.400
don't worry about how

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.530
I can fail, I just figure out how 
to succeed in what i'm doing

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.659
so I just dive in,
Fake it till you make it

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.180
I had this portfolio that I did in school, I took it to
a modeling agency, "you've been waiting for me, here I am"

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.260
and they actually started letting me do 
model test shoots, and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.700
I shot test shots for models, one thing lead to another
eventually started doing jobs, commercials

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.080
magazine work, I've lived in. uh..

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.780
Germany, i've lived in Paris, i've worked all over the world

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.850
now recently i've written my fifth book

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.940
it came out in January 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.870
It sold out in 3 weeks, publishers already reprinting

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.690
uh... I work with celebrities, Cindy Crawford, Selena Gomez

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.580
Claire Daines 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.360
uh... I do all the promo ads for Showtime series

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.150
uh... I work with catalog clients, i've got some makeup clients

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.070
and so I kind of just work all over the world
doing that stuff

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.990
Amazing, so the thing I love about robert
is he was able to 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.939
start 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.299
from basically nothing and take his career to this level
now the key things that he's done there

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.040
as i've worked with him that I want to share with you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.140
uh... are Here's your take aways 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.539
Being a celebrity isn't all what it's cracked up to be
well I think if your whole goal is to be a celebrity, 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.300
then your doing the wrong thing
you need to pick something your

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.010
passionate about and work really hard at it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.229

about Continuity programs cannot be translated at this time

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.939
that

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.839
and lets be clear, a lot of hard work

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.019
robert jones works endless hours

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.329
he's very dedicated to what he does

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.020
we talk i'm only getting 3 days off

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.109
and we also talk about this to, this is 
on of the characteristics.  it doesn't matter

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.059
someone off the street for makeup, of if its 
Selena Gomez, Cindy Crawford, it doesn't matter

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.579
he will give the exact same attention.

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.439
the exact same engagement. 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.669
that he would anybody else

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.069
every body is equal

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.459
even if i'm doing a catalog job, 
JC penney vs nieman marcus, give it 150%

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.659
you have to always give it your all

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.120
and he's a prefectionist 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.540
