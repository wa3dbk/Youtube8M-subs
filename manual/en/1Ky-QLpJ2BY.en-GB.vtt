00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:04.205
Hello.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.960
This map, I'm sure you all
know that if the world gets

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.140
two degrees hotter than
it was in 1800, which

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.630
is the time around the
Industrial Revolution started,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.810
if it gets two degrees
hotter than it was in 1800--

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.100
we're nearly there.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.530
Some people think we've
passed it and it's too late,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.040
but then the earth
goes even hotter.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.230
You cannot stop it
going to five degrees,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.270
because everything kicks in.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.422
All the me-thing gets activated.

00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:39.130
All these things.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.960
You can't stop it.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.260
And the world will reach its
equilibrium at five degrees.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.270
And it will stop around then.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.380
All that's red is uninhabitable.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.810
And this can happen
within a generation.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.080
And I got really scared
about six years ago

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.560
when the famous scientist
James Lovelock, in an interview

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.390
he said by the end
of this century,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.300
his guess was that
there would only

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.060
be one billion people left.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.030
The earth will survive
in this poor state.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.170
But there will be mass
extinction of the human race.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.390
And it can happen very quickly.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.950
We might not be able to
prevent it, even at this time.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.690
But I am one of the
people who spends

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.580
an awful lot of time trying to
think what we can do in order

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.910
to prevent it.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.670
When I first started, there's
so many NGOs, so many charities,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460
so many people
thinking, what can we

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.810
do to make the world better
or to stop this happening,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.460
if they're an environmentalist.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.410
But first of all, I
want to explain to you

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.550
why this is happening.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.180
And I wrote a pamphlet, and
you can get this information

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.630
if you look at this
website, Climate Revolution.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.060
And it's the best thing
I've ever written.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.610
It's kind of a series
of bullet points

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.470
and it explains who are rulers
are and who runs the world.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.490
And it's very simple.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.390
People call it the 1%,
but of course there's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.700
an awful lot more people
involved in this structure.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.180
I've called it
vulture capitalism.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.000
The central bankers, there
are about 147 of them,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.450
and the world is run
for their profit.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.970
There are three groups
of people-- the bankers,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.590
I'm not talking
about every bank.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.600
I'm talking about these
central banks that print money.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.940
They're connected to the
monopolies, the people who

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.140
dig for oil, take out
all the finite resources

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.780
of the earth, and politicians.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.950
And the press is on
their side as well.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.050
And it's an economic
system that's

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.390
been going on for a
couple of hundred years.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.290
And everybody's so used to
it that they don't know,

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.820
they can't imagine
anything else.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.850
Anyway what happens is that
the central banks print money.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.870
But they don't need to print
money very often because they

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.590
have so much interest.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.250
They create debt and they
live off the interest.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.160
And it's only in
emergencies that they

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.740
need to print the money.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.950
You've all heard of poor
countries, third world

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.810
countries, who have to sell
all their assets in order

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.660
to pay the interest
on money they've

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.290
been forced to borrow by the
World Trade Organisation.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.460
It's a whole scam, and it's
actually a complete Ponzi

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.870
scheme.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.280
And it's called End Capitalism,
because we're the end

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.520
and people are getting
more and more desperate.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.830
The people-- who we might
as well call them the 1%,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.980
but-- like
everybody's connected.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.420
Everybody who makes
a decent living

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.020
somehow is connected
with this whole thing.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.360
Some people call it
the revolving door

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.100
as well, because the
politicians and the corporations

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.000
and the banks, they just-- when
you finish being a politician,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.950
then you can go and be an
advisor to a corporation

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.730
and make sure the politicians
do what they want.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.930
And that's how it's working.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.800
Anyway, and so the thing is, do
have a look at this if you can.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.370
Because if you know
this basic thing,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.530
you can work out everything.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.350
You can understand the
austerity, for example,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.610
in England.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.360
It's just a trick to help this
thing along and disguise it

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.365
a bit so they don't have
to print money too much.

00:04:55.365 --> 00:04:56.800
It's just all part of it.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.110
It's totally unnecessary,
all this kind of thing.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.950
You have to work it
out for yourself.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.640
What can we do?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.450
I thought, if I've
got a minute left,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.730
I could just explain
the Gaia theory to you.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.340
The Gaia theory is the theory
of this man James Lovelock.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.770
Gaia is the first name they gave
to the mother earth in Greece.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.460
Her name was Gaia.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.130
That's why he called
his theory that,

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.130
because his theory is that the
earth behaves as if it's alive.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.220
Maybe it is alive.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.660
Maybe the stones are alive.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.460
We don't know.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.050
I think there probably are
cosmic forces and everything.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.350
Anyway the thing is that
the biosphere, the life

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:47.080
form on the earth, regulates
the metabolism of the earth.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.340
It's a symbiotic
relationship whereby

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.700
the atmosphere-- the earth
is cooled through the life

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.440
forms that live on it.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.870
And it's never been
so rich before,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.160
and it's never stayed
so stable before,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.200
because it's also
subtle and rich.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.110
And we could carry on
for-- I don't know.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.830
Whatever.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.450
But we can't unless
we do something.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.360
Thank you.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.110
[APPLAUSE]
