Now, the rings are
a symbol of eternity,

00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:08.930
because in a ring there's no beginning,
there is no end

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.427
'cause it's a circle.

00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:12.596
That's kind of nice.

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:13.934
It's not like a triangle.

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.668
Triangle has,
like, a corner in the ends.

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:18.641
This one is a circle.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.768
Okay, we get it.

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:21.107
Three corners.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:22.771
Please exchange the rings.

00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:24.941
Larry, take that.
All right, yeah.

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:26.244
Thanks.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.979
Is a promise of your love
forever together...

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:30.078
Okay.
Okay. Beautiful.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.417
...for all eternity.
Okay.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.515
Because it's a circle.
CHUCK: Yeah, we heard about the circle.

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:34.991
Yes, we're familiar with shapes.
We got it.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.049
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:40.427
I now pronounce you
husband and husband.

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.490
You may kiss the husband.

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:55.377
I don't know.
Hey, man, you just gotta do this.

00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:57.540
What do you mean?
We got to do it.

00:00:57.616 --> 00:00:58.674
Kiss the husband.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.240
Yeah, we heard you.

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:03.319
Oh, come on. Let's just...

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.856
He's gonna take a picture,
we just gotta do this.

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:06.946
Mmm-hmm.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.648
Oh!

00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:13.154
That's how we roll
in our house, baby.

00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.425
Oh, yeah.

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.722
(EXCLAIMING)

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.172
Do you do me?

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:26.137
Oh, you couldn't handle it,
little man.

(MUMBLING)

00:01:40.358 --> 00:01:45.625
The wires are all in place,
and they have tapped all of our phones.

00:01:47.432 --> 00:01:49.923
The Chinese government
is in on it.

00:01:50.268 --> 00:01:53.931
And Elizabeth Taylor is Bigfoot.

00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:58.138
Turn off my brain.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.709

Hear, hear!

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:01.434
(GROANING)

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:04.882
There's a microphone
in the cake!

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.777
They moved it.

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:11.713
Yeah.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.350

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.771
I've been hit!

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.316
CHUCK: How you doing?

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:41.712
He broke his leg.

00:02:43.688 --> 00:02:45.656
Hey, how come your maid
ain't helping us out?
