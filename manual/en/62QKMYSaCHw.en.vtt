00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:19.869
E3, 2010.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:33.140
I’m sitting in Microsoft’s presser, struggling
to contain my laughter and contempt for the

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.469
woefully cheerful people touting everything
the Kinect can do (‘SUP, KRISTEN?), when

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.100
the flailing is broken by a clip video showing
some upcoming XBLA titles.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.129
One that caught my eye - even though it wouldn’t
be playable for another two years - went down

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.600
in my notes as “Odin Sphere for Furries.”

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.160
I wasn’t immediately familiar with the details
of the game’s creation; apparently, after

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.340
winning the 2009 Dream.Build.Play competition
for indie titles, it was picked up by Microsoft

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.469
Studios to be a proper XBLA release.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.160
And so they worked on it for two years.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.530
And I can tell you, it was time well spent.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.790
So an amnesiac swordsman named Dust wakes
up with a talking sword - honestly, who hasn’t

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.250
been in that situation - and some wisecracking
small flying thing takes it upon herself to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.250
guide him.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.230
(Begrudgingly, as usual.)

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.250
Yeah, the story’s been done, but chances
are it’ll fade from your memory once the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740
comedy begins to ramp up.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.570
Fidget, your Nimbat cohort, has no qualms
about bouncing one-liners off the fourth wall,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.020
the dialog with the townspeople is a highlight
of the game, the achievements are balanced

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.970
and well-thought-out (even the ten points
for putting poison ivy in an asshole’s laundry)

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.330
and there’s a pile of references here for
the true gamers out there.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.330
Mega Man?

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.410
That’s an achievement.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.820
Killer Instinct?

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.950
Yeah.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.070
Castlevania?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.610
Mmm... mysterious wall chicken.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.210
And while the large character sprites during
dialog sections look a bit goofy, they’re

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.420
offset by both the quality of the vocal performance
(which is significantly better than expected)

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.140
and the incredible visuals of the gameplay
itself.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.500
Yes, there’s some method to this madness,
involving your magic talking sword, a Dust

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.160
Storm whirling blade attack, the projectiles
Fidget can dispense, how those projectiles

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.920
get powered-up if they fly through a Dust
Storm, and the combo counter in the top right

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.050
which rewards over-the-top battle performance
with bonus EXP.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.440
You’ve also got a slot for quickly accessing
restorative items at the push of a button,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.610
several equipment slots for weapons and armor,
blueprints by which to make said weapons and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.270
armor from the detritus your foes leave behind,
a bunch of stats to juggle if you’re the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.120
sort to do so... and did I mention there are
challenge courses which reward speed and accuracy,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.530
turn it all into a score, and features leaderboards?

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.030
I called this game “Odin Sphere for Furries”
after a gameplay demo, but while the Vanillaware

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.260
classic might reign supreme in terms of character
design and storyline, Dust’s gameplay blows

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.260
it out of the water.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.410
More like “Odin Sphere without the slowdown,
optimized for Metroidvania enthusiasts who

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.970
appreciate a good laugh with their eye-melting
combos and nonlinear exploration.”

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.450
This is called closing the Summer of Arcade
with a bang.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.480
Took ‘em long enough.
