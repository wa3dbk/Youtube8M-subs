00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.920
welcome Wood Gas Stove Science where I
attempt to learn the science behind

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920
Wood Gas Stoves

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.269
 in this video I built

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.460
a glass outer can for the vortex

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.590
5.4 so we can see how the air flows

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.390
within a Wood Gas Stove

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.640
introducing GLASS

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.169
VORTEX 5.4 as you can see

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.609
the outer "can" 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.079
has been made out of glass vase it was

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.409
graciously donated by my wife and I
drilled

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.640
four fresh air intake all around the
outside

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.690
the inner can is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.290
simply the VORTEX 5.4 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.449
we've talked so much about in previous videos

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.879
 the lighting up the glass

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.039
VORTEX 5.4 is the same

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.879
and the parameters are the same as in all the previous videos

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.980
 1 cup wood pellets

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.780
and splash... well, maybe a little more than a splash

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.020
0f liquid HEET from the yellow bottle

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.119
and light it up

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.460
The gasification was a little bit on
the slow side

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.610
and I think it was because of the not so
perfect

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.000
fit at the top if the can

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.819
once the gas does start

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.690
you get that same beautiful
vortex flame that we've seen

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.679
other videos

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.719
the flame never got nearly as intense

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.520
or as high as the
original vortex likely

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.549
 that's due to the loose fit in the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.670
area around the top and and the
outer can

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.969
noticed that when

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.500
 burning punk stick is placed
inside

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.109
 you can actually see the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.399
gas pushing the flame downward and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.450
you can actually the smoke
being pushed downward and then

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.519
up the sides of the inner can

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.700
as they make their way the secondary
air ports here you can see

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.090
the fresh air intake working... pulling the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.830
smoke in 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.600
here's another view

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.250
 smoke

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.400
being pushed down out of the primary
air ports

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.280
and then the smoke moves up the sides

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.400
of the inner can and toward secondary air ports you normally can't see the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.660
wood gas being pushed out of the
bottom

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.880
and towards the primary air ports. that's why I am using smoke

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.100
to trace those airflows

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.280
you've probably noticed the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.520
quality of the video changes
quite significantly

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.460
I had major problems with cameras over
the last few weeks

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.720
and that's why it's taken so long for me
to actually get this video done

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.100
here's a great view the gas is being
burned

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.320
at the primary here holes and note

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.490
that when the flame is removed how much
brighter

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.150
the flame at the top gets

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.510
and then how much it reduced when you

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.860
put the flame back in the bottom

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.810
here's an interesting phenomenon when

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.720
I reinsert the stick into the HOT Wood Gas

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.370
rich environment it reignites

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.460
and starts to reburn the wood gas

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.460
This next clip does a fantastic job

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.420
about showing you how burning

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.360
the would gas that's coming out of the
primary

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.450
air holes affects the characteristics

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.060
of the burning flame on top of the stove

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.569
as you can see when you put a small
flame

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.829
it does affect it pretty well but as the
flame

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.039
under the can at the primary air
ports

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.900
starts burning more and more of the gas the flame at the bottom
gets bigger and bigger

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.710
the flame at the top of the stove starts to gutter out

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.300
it really starts to get low... now watch
carefully at the reignition of the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.820
stick as it's put back into the can... you
can see the wood

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.960
gas flare-up at the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.419
primary air intake and then shoot down
to the stick

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.850
very cool!!  here the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.610
stick is cool enough so it doesn't
reignite

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.340
and shows the smoke and wood gas being
pushed down from the

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.440
primary air and then up the sides again

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.139
Here new wood pellets are being put in...

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.130
new wood pellets smoke but smoke

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.610
is not coming up you can actually see

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.610
smoke is going down not coming up... it is going

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.270
down through the charred pellets... this view
definitely showed that the stove

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.000
is drafting downward

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.800
this next clip will be a demonstration
on

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.720
pyrolysis... the word pyrolysis

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.750
can be broken down into

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.800
PYRO meaning fire and

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.169
LYSIS meaning separating which

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.250
word pyrolysis means separating material
by fire

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.789
the true definition is a thermochemical

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.550
decomposition of organic materials
elevated temperatures

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.699
in the absence of oxygen... the gases
produced by pyrolysis of

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.259
wood are... carbon dioxide... carbon monoxide

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.360
methane... hydrogen... and various other

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.419
vapors... here I'm putting the punk stick

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.610
into the topof the stove all the way down

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.349
to the wood pellets if there is a
truly pyrolysis occurring

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.150
in the stove there will be an oxygen-free zone between

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.469
top of the pellets and the flame so when I remove

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:27.539
the punk stick from the stove

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.819
you'll see everything that was below the
flame

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.259
is not burned if

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.539
this was not true pyrolysis that would
have all been burned

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.610
all the way to the end... this next

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.710
clip will show that if you burn enough of

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.039
the wood gas coming out the primary

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.310
air holes you can actually extinguish
the flame

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.080
at the top... so here you'll see that the flame

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.330
underneath is burning bright and burning a
lot of

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.629
the wood gas and the flame at
the top just

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:06.230
went out

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:13.230
Let's watch it again

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.790
pretty cool, Huh? well I hope this

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.960
helps everybody understand the flow
inside of a wood gas stove

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.350
better if you have any questions please
comment

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.940
and this ends wood gas stove science

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.100
where I build and burned

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.729
a GLASS Wood Gas Stove... thank you for
joining me

00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:57.000
bye!
