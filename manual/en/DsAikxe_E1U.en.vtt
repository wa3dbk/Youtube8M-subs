Hi, I am Eugenie. 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.840
Today is for another microwave cake in a mug: Chocolate Bread Pudding.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.200
First, spread 2 teaspoons of softened unsalted butter on 1 slice of sandwich bread. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.780
I don’t add cream in the batter today, 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.360
so decent amount of butter is a definite must for this recipe. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.700
And slice the bread into small squares. 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.200
And add in a mug. 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.990
Just 1 bread is enough for one cup. 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.410
And tall mugs are not recommended. 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.570
Like this relatively wide ones are good.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.370
Then distribute 2 tablespoons of chopped chocolate between breads. 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.370
I love this Nestle dark chocolate, chocolat noir. 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.070
And dust with ground cinnamon.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.070
In a cup, crack in an egg and add in 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.070
Then cream together until white. 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.200
Make sure sugar is completely incorporated. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:33.750
Then add in 1/3 cup of milk and stir until homogenously combined. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:49.060
And carefully pour over the bread in the mug.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.560
Now microwave for 1 minute. Then another 30 seconds. 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.660
If the pudding is still liquidy, repeat microwaving for only 20 seconds each time until done. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:11.460
It took me 2 minutes and 10 seconds today. Microwaving time varies depending on a microwave oven. 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.600
Voila, 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.250
A bread pudding in a mug. 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.710
And never forget chocolate sauce. 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:27.190
Yes, it’s time for quick chocolate fix! 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.200
Bon appetit. 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:40.490
I love ever so soft bread pudding with melted dark chocolate and rich chocolate sauce. 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.530
You can also serve with my French salted caramel. 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.620
I have both chocolate sauce and salted caramel in separate videos. 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.320
I have raisins bread pudding for baking in another video.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:06.000
And also find my chocolate cinnamon bread pudding recipe for baking at eugeniekitchen.com. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.820
If you a fan of cake in a mug, I have two more recipes: chocolate cake and nutella cake. 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.220
Thank you for watching. Bye for now.
