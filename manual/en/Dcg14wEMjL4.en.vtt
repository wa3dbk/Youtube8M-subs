00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.000
Side scroll on the Oculus Rift with Eruption

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.000
Hi, how are you?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.440
Today I'm showing you a different approach to side scroll games

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.080
If you remember the Super Mega Mega video from weeks ago,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.439
in that game the character was inside a cylindrical dungeon

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.199
and he had to jump and climb

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.849
Today I'm showing you an open field game where we can

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.279
use the Oculus tracker for something else besides watching the environments

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.949
but also to anticipate the dangers

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.199
It's a new approach that shows that the Oculus Rift doesn't have to be

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.030
limited to first or third person experiences

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.030
This is the demo menu,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.850
we can start a new game, exit and here,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.790
when looking up, it gets closer so we can read the text

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.000
This is important because the current Oculus Rift has a very low resolution

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.060
and it's very hard to read the text from this distance, the A, the D...

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.000
Now it's much better

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060
Let's start

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.060
This is what I was talking about. In this kind of games

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.020
we are always in front of a TV or monitor,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.820
we have always seen the character in front of us

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.090
and the scenery that scrolls from side to side

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.190
Now we have the freedom to look around,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.950
up, back,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.069
watch all the environment

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:26.540
even zones that we would never see in this kind of game

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.000
But that's not all,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
we can also move our head

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to look ahead for hazards

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Can you hear that noise? Look at that fireball up there

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.070
It crashed just in front of me

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.070
I had more than enough time to react

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.070
Again, another one incoming... where are you crashing?

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.000
It stays just there, look how I can look at the rest of the map

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It looks like I'll have to jump over two lava rivers

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Ok, I'll carry on, just under this rock.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.410
I can anticipate jumps... more balls here

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.410
They crashed there and went to the right, so I'll jump over them

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.969
Again under a rock

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.969
Another double jump, very usual in this kind of games... some trees here

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:30.309
The Oculus Rift 3D effect is superb, as usual

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.309
It looks like this branch could pull an eye out of me

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.389
And here we have another jump test that, besides the balls,

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.089
there is a lava stream coming from the ground

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.489
I'll have to sync the jump to avoid it

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.689
I can keep looking forward

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:52.889
or backwards

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.899
So many times we wanted to have the chance

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:01.599
to look around in this kind of games

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.529
Especially games with beautiful graphics and environments

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.000
Games were we have always wondered

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.660
"What else can be hidden from my sight?"

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.660
Well, with the Oculus Rift, we can find it out!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.060
This jump is a bit tricky, it's quite big

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.539
And I'm hearing another fireball

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:26.039
Let's see where it lands

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.619
Wow, that was so close!

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.990
Well, I managed to escape

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.650
And here ends the demo, you have seen it's a very very very

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.130
interesting twist in platform games

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.670
See you in the next video!
