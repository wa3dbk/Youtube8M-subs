Hi! I’m Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village, and today we’re going

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.910
to talk about training dogs. So let’s talk
about teaching Rottweilers to heel. Rottweilers

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.290
can be very powerful dogs and very big pullers,
but Rottweilers can be taught to walk very

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.710
nicely on the leash. You need to make sure
your Rottweiler is paying attention to you

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.439
and taking cues about the appropriateness
of her behavior from you before you try walking

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.599
her in a crowded place. So remember, with
any training, you start small and gradually

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.710
add distractions and levels of difficulty.
Now I have what’s called a no-pull harness

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.890
on Ursa because she’s a not a big puller.
She likes to be by my side, partly because

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.710
she knows that I’m the cookie lady, but
also because we had been working on a relationship

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.269
for this morning. So what I want to do is
to say the command and start walking. If she

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.129
starts pulling, I just put a little bit of
pressure on the harness. If you’re not familiar

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.899
with equipment, be sure to check out that
video before you proceed. Now she’s intent

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.130
on other… oh! good girl… she’s paying
attention to me, so heel, I want to teach

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.400
her that heeling is a position. She keeps
her right shoulder, heel, even with my left

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.130
leg. Now there she started getting a little
bit ahead. So I put a little bit of pressure

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.540
on the harness, then repeated the command
for reinforcement, and every once in a while

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:33.080
Ursa, good, I’m going to get her attention.
Let’s go, good girl. I’ll get her attention

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.060
either with the name game or with just a little
sound. Good, now, good, one way to teach dogs

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.909
to pay attention to you is to vary your speed.
Sometimes speed up, slow down, now she’s

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.180
ignoring me because there are delicious acorns
on the ground. So I’m going to use some

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.290
food to get her attention. Good, I don’t
want to keep saying her name over and over.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.060
I don’t want to keep saying heel over and
over, and I definitely don’t want to pull

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:13.540
her bodily. I want her to work for me because
she wants to work for me, heel, good, Ursa,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.460
good, good girl. So there I kind of walked
into her because she was trying to tell me

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.030
where she wanted to go. Good girl, heel. A
little patting of your leg can help her know

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.780
to turn, good girl. And some time just walking
into the dog teaches them to pay attention,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:46.519
good, sit, good, very nice. If these methods
don’t work for your Rottweiler, check out

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.239
some of the other training videos. There are
different methods that work for different

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:50.799
dogs.
