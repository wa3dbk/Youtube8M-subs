Shanna Peeples: Yeah.

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:02.669
The President: Because, you
know?

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.303
You don't mind, do you?

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:04.037
Shanna Peeples: No.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.171
The President: You don't
want me to get my suits on?

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:05.939
Look all fancy?

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.941
Shanna Peeples: No, no.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.609
She is, she is.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.246
And she's retired from doing
physical therapy at

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.080

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.082
Shanna Peeples: Right.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.017
The President: Once -- I'm
taking a walk --

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:21.154

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:21.921
You guys doing well?

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.223
It's a beautiful day.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.024
I had a request from my

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.326
Female Speaker: All right.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.694

Female Speaker: All right.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:29.562
The President: And you know
what?

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:33.032
I will try one of your iced
teas.

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:34.167
Female Speaker: Okay.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.201
The President: That is

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.302
What do you recommend?

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:38.371

The President: -- Is it
pretty good?

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:40.840
Let's try that, why not.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.508
Female Speaker: Really
refreshing.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.375
The President: Okay, that's
what I need.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.042
Female Speaker: All right.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.144
The President: What a
wonderful summer.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.145
Female Speaker: Thank you,
you too.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:45.912

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:48.014
(laughter)

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.049
Three days a year, four days
a year and then that's

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.717
it, right?

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:51.217
Shanna Peeples: Yeah.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:51.785
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:52.552

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.788
I really do.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.191
It's -- well you know -- it
takes everything.

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.627
This is very difficult work;
it's very complex work if

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:04.164
you do it right.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.198

people?

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.300
Child Speaker: President

Female Speaker: Oh my
goodness.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.403

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.111
The President: Is that

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.447
So what are you guys doing
here today?

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:20.814
Female Speaker: What are we
doing?

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:21.347
Tell him.

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:28.655
The President: Are you sure?

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:29.923
Female Speaker: Yeah, we had
permission.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.658

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:32.759
Child Speaker: Yes.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.593

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:34.594
Child Speaker: Yes.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.762
The President: You guys are
being very quiet and very

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:36.696
well behaved.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.063
Female Speaker: I think
they're a little

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:37.931
overwhelmed (laughs).

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:38.631
The President: You know
what?

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.999
Let's get a little rowdy
here.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.067
Come on.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.535
First of all, I want a high
five from everybody.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.137
Come on, high five.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.238
Male Speaker: Go give the
President a high five.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:49.209
Female Speaker: Go give him
high fives.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.343
The President: Give me high
fives.

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.077
Female Speaker: Can I take a
picture of this?

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:51.978
The President: Of course,
we're going to pose for

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.146
a picture.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.113
Queso.

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.215
Multiple: Queso.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:56.916
Cheese.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.818
The President: All right
guys.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:01:59.819
Have fun.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.120
What are you guys going to
have for lunch?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.655
Child Speaker: Bowling.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.290
The President: You're going
to bowl for lunch?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.391
What are you having for
lunch?

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.593
Child Speaker: You.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:07.861

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.728
Child Speaker: Yes.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:10.930
The President: You can't eat
me for lunch.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.465
Then there'd be no
President.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.500
Female Speaker: Uh oh.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.768
Does anybody here want to
grow up and be a President?

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.871
Child Speaker: President
would be boring.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.640
The President: It is boring;
you sit behind your desk all

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.374
the time.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:22.609
It is quite a coincidence.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.977
I got the national teacher
of the year right here.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.346
(laughter)

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.481
She teaches savvy older
kids.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.949
Shanna Peeples: Yes, it's a
little bit bigger.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.484
Male Speaker: Thanks
Mr. President.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.052
Female Speaker: Thank you.
