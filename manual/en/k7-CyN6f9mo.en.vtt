Hi, this is Beth Essington for Expert Village.
I'm going to show you a couple of fun things

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.660
that I have made recently with crochet. This
is a purse actually I have made three or four

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.480
of them, some are already sold and gone. These
are a lot of fun, they do take a considerable

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.330
amount of work. Not really so much fancy stitches
as fancy yarn. Almost every row that you see

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.220
is a combination of two to three different
yarns. As you can see I got some metallic

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.860
in here, I got like a combination of sort
of a little puffy yarn that has little puffs

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.550
of fabric on it and lots of eyelashes you
can see, some gold metallic in here. This

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.110
handle here was simply a chain. Like I showed
you with the chain stitch and I made it very

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.612
thick and then I crocheted around the chain
stitch with a single crochet. So we got a

00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:56.470
nice light long handle and it works very well.
You can line these if you want or you can

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.480
not line them. A lot of people these days
are felting, which is taking like a wool yarn

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.690
and you put it in warm water and soap and
it will shrink it a little bit but it makes

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.560
the stitches very very tight, so when you
felt something you never have to line it because

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.240
the yarn comes together and it is very firm.
So then you just find yourself a real pretty

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.860
button and put it on. You can get little wood
things like this if you want to make it prettier.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.420
There is a variety of purse handles out there
now that are beautiful. You can even a lot

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.770
of times find one to exactly match your yarn.
With this I pretty much just went around and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.390
just pulled out all my red yarns and all my
red leftovers and threw in a little bit of

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.920
black and ended up making this. It makes a
very pretty design, I put some sequins on

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.110
the back and it came out I think pretty nice.
And this is the back of this one here. There

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.741
is just a lot you could do with crochet, it
doesn't have to be just scarves these days,

00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:57.570
you can do children's toys, purses, socks,
slippers, pretty much anything you can think

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.540
of you can probably crochet it into something
fun. So, this is just two of the items.
