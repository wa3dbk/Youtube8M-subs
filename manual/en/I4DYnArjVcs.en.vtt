Hi I'm Michelle and I'm here on behalf of
Expert Village. We are going to learn how

00:00:04.461 --> 00:00:08.270
to knit a scarf for beginners and while we
are doing that we also go over some basic

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.670
tips that you need to know to get started
in knitting. Another excellent stitch that

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.329
we can make the scarf is a rib stitch. In
fact I use this one as much as I use the garter

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:23.239
stitch. The rib stitch is similar to the basket
weave and that we are going to switch back

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:29.009
and forth between knitting and pearling. It
is different from basket weave however in

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.570
that we are not going to do a certain numbers
of rows and then reverse our pattern. Because

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.400
we don't want to create that basket weave.
For this scarf I'm going to show you I selected

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.710
to do a two by two rib pattern. So I knit
two stitches and then I pearl two stitches

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.320
and I continue to do that until I completed
the length of scarf that I want. I'm going

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:05.800
to start my two by two rib by knitting two.
Then remembering to bring the yarn from the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:18.960
back of my project to the front I'm going
to pearl two. Pulling the yarn back I would

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.920
then knit two that is the rib stitch. Continue
to do it all the way across. Always knitting

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.479
on the knit and pearling on the pearl and
you would see that the results is this lovely

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.900
little pattern that we have here. The one
thing you want to remember if you are going

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.830
to make a rib scarf is that because of these
pearl stitches in the middle would tend to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.840
be pulled in a little closer by the knit stitches.
If you want it to be a wide scarf you are

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.119
going to want to cast on plenty so you can
plan on losing about two thirds of the width

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.829
that you would get from something like a basket
weave or a garter stitch.
