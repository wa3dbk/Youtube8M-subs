00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.690
That's right, little deer.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.690
It's okay.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.520
Just...keep doing what you're doing.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.150
Keep eating those delicious flowers, and berries.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.360
It'll be okay.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.730
I'm just here to shoot you in the brain.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.010
It's Cabela's Big Game Hunter: Pro Hunts.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.760
See, I'm whispering.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.900
So you know that it's real.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:51.790
Anyway, much to the delight of the entire
state of West Virginia and PETA members everywhere...this

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.770
game was released to a sh*t load of platforms
earlier this year.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.649
Which means hurray for Derek, I get to kill
a sh*t load of animals.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.550
And I don't even feel bad about it, because
had wild boars invented guns first, that would

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.790
be me out there.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.580
Getting shot in the face.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.840
You call it being delusional.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.100
I call it being American.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.900
And hey, speaking of America...that's where
this game takes place.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.470
Because try doing this anywhere else but America.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.470
Can't do it.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.599
Anyway, Pro Hunts divides America into four
territories.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.530
Technically, Canada's involved, but...come
on.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.090
Is Canada ever really involved?

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.649
Each of those areas has its its own missions,
its own geography, its own beautiful environments,

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.590
serene, untouched by the inherently destructive
hand of man.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.710
Hey, I have an idea.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.670
Let's go there, and shoot black bears in the
goddamn head.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.670
Well, sh*t.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.670
So, if you're familiar with previous Cabela's
games...uh, this one's a bit different.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.670
It's not a gallery shooter, it's not arcade-y,
not on-rails...instead, it goes for a much

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.670
more realistic vibe.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.670
In fact, in all seriousness, this is probably
the most realistic hunting game I've ever

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.670
played.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.140
If you want to bag a trophy buck, you have
to put the work in.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.550
Like real hunting, there's a lot to do before
you ever pull the trigger...in Pro Hunts.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.810
So it works like this.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.920
You pick a territory, and you pick a hunt.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.780
And there are different types to choose from.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.700
There are ones with specific objectives; there
are free hunts, where you get to do whatever

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.360
you want; and there are pro hunts.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.220
These pair you up with a pro hunter, a person
I'm assuming actually exists.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.700
Although, I do have my doubts.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.209
Of course, no matter which one you choose...the
game plays the same way.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.540
Which is to say, you have to legitimately
hunt these animals.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.310
Staying down wind, finding cover, using calls,
the whole freaking deal.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.110
Every map shows you spots where the animals
might be, based on the time of day.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.200
But it's up to you to locate them, approach
them, and harvest them.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.730
Harvest is, like, a nicer way of saying "slay
them."

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.300
Ted Nugent calls it harvesting.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:03:07.710
So you know that it's real.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.160
So I mean, unlike some hunting games, this
is almost like a stealth game.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.370
It has a deliberate pace that's definitely
going to appeal to fans of games like Metal

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.620
Gear, and Splinter Cell.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.930
That is, provided those fans also like to
hunt.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.970
If you like to hunt and you like Metal Gear,
you're going to love this.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.120
Of course, on the other hand, the slow pace
definitely won't be for everyone.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.660
There are times when Pro Hunts just feels
boring.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.570
And to be honest, the game's realism only
goes so far, too.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.640
The fact that the game tells you where the
animals might be...sometimes, that turns the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.100
whole thing into a guessing game.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.890
But one thing I genuinely do like about the
game...are the graphics.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.690
Obviously, it's not some technically impressive
game, but...artistically, it works.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.790
The natural settings are both gorgeous and
faithful to their real-life locations.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.200
And I especially like the lighting.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.560
The same areas of the forest can look totally
different, depending on the time of day.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.430
Pro Hunts nails that, which is awesome.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.280
It adds an aesthetic realism to that already
realistic gameplay.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280
Although...again.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280
Technically?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.020
Could've used a lot more polish.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.410
I mean, I've never seen shadows do that.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.150
Of course, this is the Wii U version, but...in
this case, that doesn't really mean much.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.380
This version is pretty much identical to every
other version, and it only uses the GamePad

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.120
for the most minimal stuff.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.289
You can tap the map, to set a waypoint...and
you can do offscreen play.

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.230
That's about it, so...don't expect any GamePad
design, or anything very Wii U.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:49.640
It's basically a straight port, which...I
mean, to be fair, there's a place for that,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:59.820
too.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.550
Hunting games don't get a whole lot of respect
in some circles.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.530
And I mean, I'm probably as guilty of that
as anyone.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.910
But when you play one like this, it's hard
not to at least appreciate the gameplay.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.760
I mean, this is a pretty decent hunting game.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.613
The stealthy gameplay is actually fun, there's
a lot of different weapons to buy...and again,

00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:20.440
the locations are sometimes genuinely pretty.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.320
It's a game that demands precision, both in
approach and execution.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.830
Otherwise, you'll hear that a lot.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.120
It's Cabela's Big Game Hunter: Pro Hunts,
for the Nintendo Wii U.
