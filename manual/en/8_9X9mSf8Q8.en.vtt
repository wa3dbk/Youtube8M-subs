[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:15.352
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:17.060
WESTON KRUKOW: When
I dance, nothing else

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.310
is happening in the world, and
to be able to have that freedom

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.590
is incredible, and
I just get so happy.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.930
I think internally,
at first, at barre,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.860
I'm getting into my body.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.350
I'm trying to lift
out of my hips.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.590
I'm trying to really reach
and work on my footwork.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.350
And then, by the time
that I start warming up

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.430
and I'm understanding what I'm
doing, then I start to project.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.570
And I start to think, how can
I make this movement bigger,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.000
and how can I show what I'm
feeling inside on the outside?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.925
 I teach the men at the
University of Arizona School

00:00:54.925 --> 00:00:56.710
of Dance program.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.200
I teach them the ballet.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.730
--halfway.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.111
See how it centers halfway.

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:02.610
Ah!

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.038
That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:06.224
And now with that hand--

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:08.042
oh, that's beautiful.

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:09.500
WESTON KRUKOW:
Every day I come in,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.670
and he's ruthlessly
working on our technique.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.850
JAMES CLOUSER: The
attitude towards ballet

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.760
is an interesting thing
with young men today

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.190
because they come
from a background

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.710
where ballet is
something a little bit

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.330
foreign, a little bit elite,
a little bit fancy-pantsy,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.670
and they come from a milieu
where street dance is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.820
what turns them on.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.820
JORY HANCOCK: Here at the
University of Arizona,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.550
one of the most unusual
things about our program

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.650
is that we have so many men.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.270
Now, we're up to 45 or 50 men
out of 150 total students.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.656
That's more men than any other
dance program in the country.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:53.390
GIANNI HOWELL: Where I'm from,
we had guys at our studio,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.980
but there was,
maybe, one or two.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.010
So coming to a school where
there's 50 guy dancers,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.095
it's almost like a new
experience in dance

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:01.130
all on its own.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.900
I chose the
University of Arizona

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.270
because of their wide program.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.960
They have tap.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.620
They have jazz, ballet,
modern, musical theater.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.330
And me, being
primarily a tap dancer,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.200
that couldn't please
me more because now I'm

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.010
getting every single technique
in this one school, while also

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.629
on a beautiful campus.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.670
DAVID MAURICE JOHNSON:
For 15 years, I ran track.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.490
I sustained an injury my
senior year of high school,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.040
was put into ballet class as
rehabilitation, and loved it.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.950
When I graduate, I
just want to dance,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.270
in every aspect of the
word-- just choreography,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.000
teaching, performing,
traveling, getting lost

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.560
in the adventure of this
career and life choice.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.450
WESTON KRUKOW: I came
in really confident

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.070
in ballet, loving jazz--

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.380
I've done that the longest--

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.510
no experience in modern.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.370
And what U of A has given me is
an unbelievable, well-rounded

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.420
knowledge.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.340
JORY HANCOCK: The
students in this program

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.170
are so dedicated
to their art form.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.320
So they're really focused
on dance, but many of them

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.730
are double majors in
engineering, business, pre-med.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.230
So it's important for them to
be in a conservatory environment

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.740
like the U of A school
of dance but on a campus

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.439
that is a Research I university.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.730
GIANNI HOWELL: I want to
dance for the rest of my life,

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.950
but I also decided
to minor in business

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.650
because when I'm done dancing,
I want to own a competition.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.360
I want to own a studio.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.180
And just in case anything
happens with dance,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.510
I always have that
minor the fall back on.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.530
JORY HANCOCK: The Stevie
Eller Dance Theater

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.580
is a state of the art facility
with beautiful sprung floors,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.540
a nice big stage, a small house,
so the audience is right there.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.920
It's very intimate.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.080
And because it is
a small house, we

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.080
get to do a lot of
performances, so our dancers

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.100
are on stage 40 or
50 times a year.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.430
Like any science lab would be,
for us, this is our laboratory.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.780
