testing on doing testing until age of
sixty

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.929

stick that's why not i was like this and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.750
when this setback well let you know

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.790
discover what you're passionate about

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.530
and follow your dreams

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.270
okay now

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.460
begets crazy yet they wait to see
there's a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.950
they said you know what we're
kindergarten preschool canceling it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.250

head's exploding you're an american
nobody ok kiss have we ordered by

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.140
various things

no private schools alone

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.500
everybody has to the public school

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.530
and but what accommodation are not going
to no matter how come

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.329
get this

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.740
we're gonna pair teachers a decently

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.030
for the and we're gonna require them now
that i think they are ready to start a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.070
dentist sydney subtract

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.770
uh... but you know it's uh... if the
film was so they get health care et

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.479
cetera said and also keep in mind the
changed with the role of teachers they

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.370
became much more prestigious

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.050
like he was and it wasn't like how your
teacher whatever your big making a false

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.420
and i was like all my greatest teacher
massively this in our mind exploding

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.489
teachers or not it's harder to get into
the school

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.029
to be a teacher than it is

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.180
to get into school to be a lawyer or a
doc

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.980
any opinion as to series

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.699
and then they could become a teacher and
its revered in the this aside okay

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.019
no sanitize says until you're sixty

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.529
uh... and the list goes on a so they're
not even participating in the

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.750
international task as they like tester
earth are silly

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.880
which i find out what these kids want to
do

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.819
and and give them an opportunity to do a
well right

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.339
uh... in in the beginning of the two
thousand news two thousand two thousand

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:39.060
one

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.709
the not like you know what that says
that in the case of the hand here

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.209
callout it was a piece of study the
pieces that it has

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.559
okay so let's let's andrew them in there
and see what happens if we don't expect

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.319
number one in the world

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.939
were one in the world

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.680
and it's a lot less than a foot unit
that this thought

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.740
it must have an accident we're not even
trying pretzels which is try to get to

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.289
people if air tix right

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.870
they retested several times not that
you're in is suing years

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.359
consistently top three in the world

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.699
others are saying of course south korea
where we're gonna kiss of death

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.969
for particular riyadh everyday and
succeeding and that's a different way of

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:20.849
doing it

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.569
and look and that certainly don't want
to argue about what's a better way to go

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.490
so endemic the guy who's ahead of their
education

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.840
at the department at the base their
education issue comes on like this in

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.749
the u_s_

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.729
physical every store in atlanta

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.789
he's explain americans we don't do
competition americans are quite so you

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.249
had to compete

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:42.769
the noble tweet no we do cooperation

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.859
like the payment so i would be a private
schools up to though we don't have

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.139
private schools is that ok so anyway
what do private schools

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.879
critic middle but we don't have private
schools like

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.749
he's exploiting the system

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.639
and it's not getting into their head

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.309
lighted areas like that

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.349
so anyway the bottom line is

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.899
what uh... more competition right

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.769
it's like go there's not a lot of mine
is exactly opposite of the bottom line

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.539
and so

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.629
and he's written a book about it entered

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.659
and they say america's trying to learn

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.299
from the finished one of the of course
tackle wind in new york times coverage

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.439
of that story so different article they
quote that some of buddy from a

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.919
conservative think tanks a

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.949
all you can't you can't do it if it is
model here are the sale is a totally

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.059
different situation

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:31.389
uh... that you know whatever one there
much smaller mobile

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.889
we do it you justify states allow
compared to one of our states about the

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.139
same size conduct

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.840
disaster

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.949
double the world right uh... okay that's
all for now and i'd love this code word

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.430
they have a more homogeneous assigned

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.339
you know that missus code word for well
they're all what

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:49.990
a cable so forcier

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.289
are really so that you don't know what
which is a next-door neighbor

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.069
same exact

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.330
savings acct

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.069
homogeneous society

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:03.300
they use american model disaster this
core near the bomb

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.239
so what now

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:05.419
what now is

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.309
we're never gonna check no behind you
and our america is a story you know what

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.000
they say

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.120
well our education system right

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.279
pasand rivals but it's a vessel in the
world here

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.969
but we made in the past year like number
fifty remember nineteen your disasters

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.780
of the

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.880
holistic worst you were set
