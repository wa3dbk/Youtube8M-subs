00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.840
Alright, so we're going to talk about adjusting
brakes.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.840
These are V-brakes.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.099
These are pretty common on hybrid bikes, city
bikes or mountain bikes.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.730
The concept of adjusting them is pretty much
the same as all the other brakes, just some

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.800
minor changes.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.400
A lot of people have a lot of problems with
their brakes squeaking and that's a very easy

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.740
adjustment to fix.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.700
Basically what it means is your brakes are
pretty worn, so you want to replace the pads.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.530
You can see on the actual pads that there's
a wear line on most of them.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.430
So if it's past the wear line, or if it's
wearing incorrectly you want to replace them.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.740
This is a quick release right here.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.580
You're going to push these two levers together,
push down on this piece here and it opens

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.580
them up.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.670
So you can see the pads and see how they're
worn, and you may just need to replace them.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.809
They're pretty inexpensive.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.840
They go anywhere from four to fifteen dollars
a pair, so it's definitely worth replacing

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.840
them.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.059
It's a big safety issue.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.600
So to correct the squeaking, if they are new
brakes, you'll need to toe in the brakes.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.470
Brakes aren't meant to hit completely flat
on a bicycle rim and that's what creates the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.470
squealing.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:24.550
So the squeaking noise comes from when the
brakes hit completely flat, so toeing in,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.640
just imagine your toes going in.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.080
So basically, this is very dramatic, but when
the brakes hits, the one side hits and goes

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.450
down, and eventually hits the whole thing,
they flex.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:47.050
You can kind of hear the squeaking on this,
because the brake pads are completely flat.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.929
So what you're going to do is take your five
mm Allen and unscrew the brake.

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:00.180
You can see how it kind of shifts all over
the place, it goes up and down, side to side,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.099
it basically pivots on these washers.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.640
So you're going to toe in the brake.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.170
It doesn't have to be really drastic, it doesn't
have to be like that, but just enough to get

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.380
rid of the squeaking and so that it brakes
properly.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.840
Make sure it's hitting the rim really nice,
so it's nice and level to the rim.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.870
Also make sure it's not too low or too high.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.960
If it's too high, it's going to hit the tire
and could potentially blow up a tire from

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.570
all the friction and heat.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.560
If it's too low, it's just not going to brake
on the surface properly and you're not going

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.230
to be able to stop quickly enough.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.830
So let me just bolt these pads, and then we'll
see if it makes any noise.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.070
So now it's nice and quiet, no more squeaking.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.490
It's also going to brake a little better.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.350
But you can see how, if I spin the wheel slowly,
it stops.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.569
The reason for that is it could be either
too tight, or it could be mis-adjusted.
