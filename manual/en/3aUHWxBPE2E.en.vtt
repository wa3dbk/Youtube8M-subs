00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.660
I think God... err... Mother Nature... whatever you want to say designers. I think that

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.250
person or thing was an engineer 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.800
because him did a pretty good job designing us, but
did NO documentation.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.020
There's nowhere to go to look up for some so you have to do your own.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.500
I started compiling my own data.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.500
And I call it : "A Users Guid to Life"

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.080
And by the way, "Your results may vary".

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.150
I need you just things that I've noticed I can't explain some of them but they're just things I think you'll see some

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.349
things you can relate to this little
presentation and you will see

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.449
This is what I've noticed that happens at my gym all the time. Okay? That's a locker on my gym.

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.849
I walked in and I stand at my locker.  Right? Just get ready.  Within five minutes

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:41.820
the next twelve people that come in

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.469
THIS IS where they end up!

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.920
How... how is that possible?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.940
I just... I...within moments I'm surrounded by... 
you know

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.970
sweaty fat hairy guys.  There's huge locker
room and you guys bunk bunk cheeks

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.010
with me. What houses happening?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.420
it's next chart

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.140
I got this off the internet and a are
not direct USA today and this is what

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.900
they said

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.310
was the actual usage for the Internet
and they think they said reading email

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.370
30 fender time

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.170
working 22 climate I'm shopping 16 and I
looked at these numbers

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.410
I think theoretically this is what they
would like it to be but I don't think

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.960
that even close to the truth

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.080
after the numbers are correct but I
would be labeled the way I think it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.640
really is so I did

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.550
I think one percent the times actually
spent work big 5 percent the time is the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.080
spektr I'd prefer passwords

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.180
the Honeywell

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.740
with the cats made

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.690
now the third one a present a time spent
actually checking email

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.230
and one person at a time are doing by
actress Pam 30 percent I'm deleting mail

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.330
in March much ma'am

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.780
please tell me I'm not the only one
getting please

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.780
okay good just that makes me feel better

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.440
sixty percent a time is spent deleting
any spam spam that really quite annoying

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.440
get too much spam yes stop sending it to
me 22 percent I'm watching porn and 30

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.150
percent the time searching for more

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.950
the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.580
the at like Google people are
millionaires thanks to the more to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.480
happen in this country

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.970
now this next flight but when I put it
up here you're immediately gonna know

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.150
guys are gonna know what I'm talking
about legal work something vital social

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.060
situation

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.850
us is thats us men face almost every day
when we walk into a public restroom

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.730
and there's a guy already standing at a
urinal

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.290
were immediately faced with the question
which journal do we go to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.290
and really I put some thought into this
cuz I guess what guys and most guys say

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.130
I've got done a little engineering
analysis

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.110
most guys so you should go here let
solution number one now let's look at

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.350
that per second I think that solution
under now sis actually that's it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.740
that's too far that sent a message to
the other guy that you look weird

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.150
on Steinway far away from you

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.280
let a little insulting on the other hand
you wanna go here

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.570
because that sent a message hey man I'm
weird the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.420
said so I think

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.540
yeah in my house to take the best
solutions to go there

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.570
because that's good spacing and there's
plenty room for guy number three

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.980
and in the fourth guy have to choose
which two guys you like better

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.670
and I think the absolute worst solution
would be out there

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.670
the I gotta say I have always wanted to
try that I got hey how you doing

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.850
dead little bit work a half ago and nice
to meet you there
