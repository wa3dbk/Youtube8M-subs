Hello everyone, My name is Chieko Nakayama. I'm a nail technician.

00:00:11.556 --> 00:00:13.183
Nice meeting you all

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:20.435
Today, I would like to show you nail care tips that anyone can do!

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:23.632
Things you prepare
From left to right, Cotton / Bowl / Wet tissue / File / Wood stick / Buffer / Cuticle oil

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:30.542
First, I'm going to file my nails

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:49.634
You only have to do it gently. Applying too 
 much pressure can damage your fingernails.

00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:01.627
Ok, my nails are nice and short

00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:11.779
Next, you'll need a bowl of warm water. Soak your fingers to soften cuticles

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:23.827
After a bath is also the perfect time to do 
 a nail treatment because your cuticles are softened.

00:01:27.084 --> 00:01:38.177
It takes about 5 minutes to soften your cuticles. Once you've done that, 
 take your fingers out and dry your hands with a towel.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:55.670
Next, you will need a wet tissue, a wood stick and a cotton pad.

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:07.820
First, I'm going to wet the tip of the 
 stick and wrap it with cotton like this

00:02:13.494 --> 00:02:23.780
And then, I'm going to push back my 
 cuticles using the tip of the stick.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.770
Start from the edge and work your way to the center.

00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:54.920
If you apply too much pressure, you might get sore nails. You only 
 need a decent amount of pressure to push back your cuticles

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:10.560
One you've done that, you will see some white dead cuticles coming off.

00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:37.800
You can use a wet tissue to clean your nails. What I do is 
 I'm going to wrap it around my thumb and wipe my nails.

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:11.370
So far, I pushed back my cuticles and cleaned my nails.

00:04:12.394 --> 00:04:17.330
I'm going to buff my nails next

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:28.030
To do that, you will need a nail buffer. One side 
 should feel rough and the other should be smoother.

00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:37.710
First, I'm going to use the rough side and 
 buffer my nails to smooth out any ridges.

00:04:41.027 --> 00:04:50.570
Make sure you buff your nails in one direction

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:58.670
And then, we are going to use the smoother side of the buffer

00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:11.610
Make sure you buff every surface of your nails. 
 You can do this by applying gentle pressure

00:05:34.452 --> 00:05:39.250
Once you've done that, the nail you buffed should look shiner than other ones.

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.940
I'm going to do the same on other nails.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:50.870
I'm going to buff the rest of my nails to a high shine!

00:05:52.364 --> 00:06:04.200
Lastly, I'm going to rub cuticle oil into the skin around my nails.

00:06:11.015 --> 00:06:14.620
And that's how you take care of your cuticles.
