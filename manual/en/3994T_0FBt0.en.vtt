00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.000
Today, experimenting with shorting capacitors by using thyristors,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:16.000
finally I switch them off in order to check my motor that is working as a rotoverter.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.000
What is the minimum amount of real power that I can still run the motor on its nominal rotational speed?

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.000
Here is what I saw.
At the input voltage around 14.1 V

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.000
it draws input current 0.27 A

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.000
There is a watt meter here, which shows the motor input real power.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.000
(not very clear, but one division is 2.5 W)

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.000
We have now ... 1.3 ...

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.000
It has to be multiplied by 2.5 -- result 3.25 W.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This motor draws 3.25 W.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.000
This motor. it is a 5.5 kW, 400 V motor (not clear, sorry).

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.000
5.5 kW of power at 400 V.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.000
This motor can run on only 3.25 W when turning the shaft at its nominal speed.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.000
Of course it runs without a load.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.000
This is a trace on the capacitor,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.000
since the motor is run from 1 phase grid (through a variac).

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.000
I have another main watt meter here, but is shows all the power being drawn by things here, including the two oscilloscopes.
