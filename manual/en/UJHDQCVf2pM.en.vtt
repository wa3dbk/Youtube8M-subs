00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.150
Hi, I'm Brigitte and

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.210
this is Slope Style with skis.com. I have Bill from

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.410
Spyder who came all the way from far away to come here.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.550
Thanks for having me.
You're welcome. We're going to talk about the men's Propulsion

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.660
Pant. This is a special pant.
Absolutely. Unfortunately we don't have a sample of it.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.680
It's behind us though.
That's right, it's right here. Propulsion pant

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.810
is really a nice fitting, very, very comfortable pant

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.860
because the exterior's a very stretchy fabric and has a beautiful hand to it.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.890
It's a very

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.020
comfortable pant to wear and be outside in. It's insulation is

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.120
40 grams of Thinsulate which is the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.170
norm that we use for almost all of our pants. We found through the years, it's just...
Like the perfect

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.340
insulation.
And a nice weight. Not too hot, not too...not enough

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.490
most of the time. And it has some nice features to it.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.580
It has a removable suspender for people that want to use them but you don't need to.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.650
Has adjustable waist but it still has belt loops so if you don't want to use the suspenders

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.830
but don't want to use a belt, you can adjust the waist. It has belt loops if you want to use

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.970
a belt to make a little fashion statement. Hand pockets

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.080
that are zippered shut so you can keep your valuables where they should be on you and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.150
thigh venting which is zippers up and down, so that's nice.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.300
Fair amount of our seaming detail to get nice articulation in the knees.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.420
And then, of course, snow cuff for...

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.480
It's a nice pant.
It's got all the great features you'd look for in a pant.
Absolutely.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.550
What about the, I'm sure they'd want to know about the waterproofing.
Waterproofing.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.680
Yeah, there's two aspects of waterproofing is the laminate you use for

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.760
the standpoint of keeping water out yet water vapor evaporating and moving out and it's

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.830
20/20 on that pant so that's pretty much industry gold standard.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.990
Yes, that's very high.
And then pant is fully taped so all those seams

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.130
that go all over the place, there's no leaking because the tape is good and behind.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.230
And then on the outside of the pant, we put a little special product called Spylon that helps keep

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.300
dirt from sitting on the fabric or catching the fabric and 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.440
if you do get some dirt on it, it washes off.
You don't have to worry about it.
Yeah, washes off beautifully, yeah.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.570
And they do wash up nicely and just hang them to dry and they're ready to go the next day.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.640
Nice. And one last question. How is the fit?
The fit, yeah.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.690
Well, the articulated knees are

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.820
designed so that we have a nice silhouette or nice shaping. I wouldn't call it a tight fit, 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.910
I'd just call it a regular fit but with some shape to it because of the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.980
articulation in the knees.
Okay. Well put. Well thanks, Bill, for coming

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.170
in to talk about the Propulsion Pant and this is Slope Style with

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.260
skis.com.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.784
