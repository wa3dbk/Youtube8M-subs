00:00:06.148 --> 00:00:09.426
Traditionally when we think about robots we think about rigid pieces

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:13.316
that are linked together. Things like C3PO. Things like WALL-E.

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:16.625
What we're trying to do is build robots that emulate biological systems.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:19.886
So they have soft components, they are very deformable, they can

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:24.179
squeeze through small spaces and they can interact safely with people.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.030
And so what we're trying to do is to go away from metal a little bit.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.961
We wanted to develop tunable stiffness structures and materials.

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:37.753
The idea is that the robot should be soft in situations where we want to

00:00:37.753 --> 00:00:41.919
conform to the environment or squeeze through tight spaces, but we

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:45.924
also would need it to be rigid when we need to apply loads on the

00:00:45.924 --> 00:00:49.269
environment so that we can adequately push against objects and

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.632
that sort of thing.

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:54.537
So what we were looking for was a material that could shift between soft

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:58.644
and hard states. So what you're looking at here is a soft scaffold of foam

00:00:58.644 --> 00:01:02.564
that has been coated in wax. When the wax is heated you get the soft

00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:07.212
structure and when the wax re-solidifies it regains its rigidity.

00:01:07.982 --> 00:01:12.885
So imagine if your components were more compliant then perhaps we

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:16.339
could increase the robots capabilities. For example if you wanted to use

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:22.264
this composite foam-wax that has tunable stiffness properties to make

00:01:22.264 --> 00:01:27.119
some autonomous robot or to control the shape of a robot you can have

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.610
different segments of the foam coated in wax and selectively change the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.812
stiffness of them. So lets say you have three segments and you wanted

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:40.906
to just bend the middle one, you keep the outer two segments rigid

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:44.987
in the cold state, and you heat up the middle one so that it softens and

00:01:44.987 --> 00:01:50.854
you can bend it; for example by pulling a string or a cable that goes

00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:53.669
down the length just to bend that one. And then of course if you want

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:57.773
that shape or that segment to freeze in its new shape, you let it cool in

00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:00.077
whatever bent position, at room temperature.

00:02:00.077 --> 00:02:03.459
I think that the structures you are seeing here are just the beginning of

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.854
a whole new class of robotics. Again, imagine robots that have the

00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:11.739
same capabilities of biological systems. Mice, we all know we can't

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.534
keep mice out of anything because they can squeeze through tiny, tiny

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:18.494
cracks. This is something that could be useful for robots in

00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:21.911
search-and-rescue applications, where you have to go through rubble.

00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:24.957
It could be useful in medical applications where you have to squeeze

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:28.080
through small parts of the body. It could be useful in areas where robots

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.016
have to interact safely with humans; there's a whole host of applications

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:32.991
out there.
