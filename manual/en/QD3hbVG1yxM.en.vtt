00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.230
Here is the set up.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.189
I have a balance and two identical beakers,
which I fill with exactly the same amount

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.410
of water, except in one of the beakers there
is a submerged ping pong ball tethered to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.549
the base of the beaker.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.150
And in the other there is an identically sized
ball but made of acrylic.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.910
So it is denser than water and it is supported
by a thread.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.929
Now I want you to make a prediction.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.599
If I were to release this balance and allow
it to rotate freely, which way do you think

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:35.170
it would tip, toward the acrylic ball, toward
the ping pong ball or would it remain perfectly

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.170
balanced?

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.540
You can make your selection by clicking on
one of the on screen annotations or clicking

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.740
a link in the description.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.760
&gt;&gt; If they are both displacing the same amount,
like, I think it won’t rotate.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.000
So, yes, it will not rotate.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
&gt;&gt; Stay balanced.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.960
&gt;&gt; The ping pong ball does have mass, albeit
not very much.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.140
I would predict that this end will sink.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.750
&gt;&gt; I almost feel like this end would lift,
because it is lighter than ... but it wouldn’t

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.000
be pulling, because it is tethered to the
lever.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.049
I don’t know.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.869
&gt;&gt; I am thinking it would go this way.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.880
I am thinking because of the tension that
is pulling this up.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.670
&gt;&gt; So I guess if your summing the forces,
this one is more.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.670
So then this is going to rise.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.670
No...

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.670
All right.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.170
So I just switched my mind.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.240
I am going to go with this one is going to
rise.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.310
&gt;&gt; But, I mean, it seems like this shouldn’t
be contributing any force to this side, because

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.419
it is suspended and the forces are balanced.

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:31.280
&gt;&gt; That means you would have more of a normal
force on this side and it would tip that way.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.859
&gt;&gt; It will tip down on the ping pong ball
side?

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.189
&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely the ping pong ball side.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.189
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.189
That is so weird.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:47.179
&gt;&gt; So now you think it is going to up on this
side and down on this side.

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.689
&gt;&gt; Are you ready?

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.209
Three, two, one.
