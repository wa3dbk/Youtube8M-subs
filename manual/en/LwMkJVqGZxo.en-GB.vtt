00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.780
Imagine this rope

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.600
ok, pretend this rope just
goes on forever.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.700
Now imagine that this rope

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.460
is a time line of your existence.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.560
You just exist forever.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.100
You see this red part?

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.420
This would represent your time on earth.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.340
You've got a few short years here on earth

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.520
and than

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.760
you've got all of Eternity somewhere else.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.540
And what blows me away is some of you,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.960
all you think about is this red part.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.380
It's all you think about, you're consumed with this.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.700
You go oh man I can't wait till here.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.500
You know I'm going to work hard,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.680
I'm going to save, save, save,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.980
So I can really enjoy this part right here.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.920
You're consumed with that.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.600
And you think aww man am I going to get to travel,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.660
am I going to get to eat well,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.720
am I'm going to do this during this part

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.500
And I'm like are you kidding me?

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.820
What about this,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.300
what about, what about all this stuff

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.640
it's just its crazy.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.920
Because the Bible teaches

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.770
that what I do during this little red part,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.570
determines how I'm going to exist for millions

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.980
and millions and millions of years, forever.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.100
And so why would I spend this little red part,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.060
trying to make my self as comfortable as possible

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.220
enjoying myself as much as as I can.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.460
Paul says. "Look Im going to live my life

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.800
for this mission.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.980
I'm going to spend my life, invest my life

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.780
for this moment.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.840
When I cross that finish line.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.820
See I'm going to forget all this stuff

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.730
I could enjoy

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.630
I'm not going to look around

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.320
Im going to be like a runner,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.740
just looking at that moment when I face God.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.400
Because when I face him,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.340
than I don't get this chance over again.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.000
We've got one chance at this life on earth,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.840
and it can end at any second for any of us

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.820
We've got one chance at this and than comes eternity.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.440
You see people look at some of my decisions and say,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.500
"Oh you're so stupid,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.160
because thats really going to affect this."

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.380
and I go "No your stupid,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.880
because its going to affect all of this..."

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.080
Man, I am serious.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.700
I look at the way people live

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.360
and I go wow that is so crazy.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.460
You are so crazy.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.760
You're going to do that RIGHT NOW,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.560
just enjoy right now.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.820
Not even knowing if you have tomorrow

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.940
and you think thats smart and that I'm dumb?
