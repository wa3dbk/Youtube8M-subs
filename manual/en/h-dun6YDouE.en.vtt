[Mike] Hi I’m Mike from Huppin’s I’m
here to talk to you about MonsterVision Max

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.190
3D universal 3D glasses. These glasses are
compatible with nearly every television out

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.560
there today. Whether you have an older style
that uses the infrared output to operate the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.230
glasses or you have one of the newer ones
that uses radio frequency, this one will convert

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.449
all of your signals to radio frequency giving
you some definite advantages. These do not

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.430
require a direct line of sight, if you turn
your head and talk to someone about the movie

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.980
and turn back your glasses will still be on
and functioning properly. Should you have

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.480
a TV that uses the infrared technology it
is not a problem you still get all the benefits

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.460
these TVs offer by using this infrared adapter
that comes in the box. You only need one of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.260
these kits and then you can purchase these
glasses on their own, an unlimited number

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.000
of glasses can by synced with this RF blaster.
The RF transmitter is very easy to install,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.740
with this USB cable you plug it in to your
television on one end, on the other end you

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.860
plug it up to your transmitter. The other
connection will depend on whether you television

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.540
has a 3D port or if it uses infrared , one
cable can plug into the back of the set the

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.310
other cable will attach somewhere on the front,
in either case they both plug right up to

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.530
the transmitter. Once that’s done your connections
are complete. The glasses have lightweight

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.600
frames and are comfortable to wear. They fit
over prescription eyewear and they are rechargeable,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.990
they come with an internal battery that you
plug a USB connection into from your TV, computer,

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.930
anywhere you have a USB connection and let
them fully charge. First time should be about

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.770
3 hours by the way. After they are fully charged
you have about 60 hours of use from each pair

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.979
of glasses. Since the MonsterVision Max 3D
eyewear is compatible with all 3D televisions

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.010
you don’t have to worry about buying a specific
set of glasses. This is Mike from Huppin’s
