about their new Ferris Bueller slot
machine which will be introduced to

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.170

for WMS Gaming when the world's largest
slot machine manufacturers

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.380
and air that gaming show they have
Ferris Bueller's Day Off

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.320
new slot machines and they think and it
gets a little background on how this

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.950
came

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.820
to be in existence so Ferris Bueller was
one other licenses that internally we

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.930
chase in place to highlight a potential
on

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.140
in the execution on this game has been a
been excellent where you can see here

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.390
when we're playing at the 35 credit game

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.439
running thirty five lines on the base
game where you'll also see is a close 0

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.140
companion

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.140
now during a colossal rails is probably
be one about strongest performing for

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.090
sale products over the last two years

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.299
so with that with 01 an opportunity to
bring this into

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.780
more high-profile same what during this
guy what the players chasing the base

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.170
game

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.939
is the mystery feature when the mystery
fate is triggered it opens up this

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.619
colossal rails which increases the line
count to 120 lines

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.800
alright sounds like a lot of fun let's
take a look at some other bonus rounds

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.510
case a Ferris Bueller one other brands
we chased a lot internally

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.340
lot of familiarity a lot an all star
chick feel to it this one other licenses

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.290
which internally credibility excitement
throughout the tames

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.170
what we're trying to do with the same
import more importantly this is really

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.739
the first used to the colossal reels in
a high-profile

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.400
name so what we've got here we've got
the standard bye bye for real right

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.290
with what we call the companion colossal
real so anytime during the base game

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.080
we can actually access an additional
colossal reels which triggers any long

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.420
ones

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.670
2x so as you can see here which are
doing the mystery bonus here

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.230
so at any time during the vice game this
colossal reels will open up

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.390
and as we say on that top screen there
all along with multiplied by 2x

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.500
this is one of the games we've really
created for the entertainment by spy on

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.530
we've got in a multitude of many bonuses
throughout the game

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.980
work reading a lot of excitement with a
lot of the nostalgic film clips here

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.640
a lot a sound bites really bring the
experience in excitement of the the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.019
original Ferris Bueller movie

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.940
directly into the playa here

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.590
so quickly but I'll show you here as we
try to be quite candid with the with the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.840
pages that were implementing

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.420
we're trying to bring back a lot like a
moment that we utilized during the movie

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.379
and bring that excitement to the playa
so as you can see here when the bonus is

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.290
a triggered peres's ferraro be driving
around until it selects one of the major

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.420
by this is that we can trigger

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.470
I think one of the most familias
familiar scenes that were pitted

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.450
throughout the Bears feel that was a
final same

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.159
welfare's is trying to raise the
principal the headmaster back back home

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.390
without getting in trouble so what we're
trying to do here interactive pic beta

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.040
for the player

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.980
you make you mike is here to pick now
well done through

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.739
the basically the players trying to pick
that character to try and get into the

00:03:58.739 --> 00:03:59.569
into the beta

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.790
obviously fares affairs being the
highest paying buyers ann Romney baby

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.019
obviously the lower buying so we want to
try and get Paris all the way to the end

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.030
obviously maximizing our awards here so
when you make a pic

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.640
we're trying to create a little bit miss
mystery a little bit about anticipation

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.329
in today's

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.329
so could be anywhere from 1 through 4
spices

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.770
it doesn't say what that you would get
for farris up bears you actually go to

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.920
an additional pics grain

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.700
which opens up a multitude of different
values which can be awarded to the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.130
player

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.300
this is a penny machine nicer

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.570
the penny machine and when will this be
in the casinos

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.570
is actually just become audible now
there are people I spence

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.220
public within a couple the casino floor
this week so early numbers are looking

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.580
good

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.850
internally this is probably one of the
projects that we you know we had the

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.060
highest interest in as I spoke about
before

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.250
from a quality standpoint it's actually
one that found the least amount a

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.960
parasite

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.840
from a stability and performance
standpoint this one we're really looking

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.270
forward to getting out to the players

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.910
also get a free spin bonus for you now

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.370
so similar to the colossal companion
rails during the base game

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.830
during the free spins bonus we actually
bring back that excitement the colossal

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.810
real set and continue through

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.570
with 2x line place right in Taipei to
you have more opportunities to

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.820
to get more winning combination they
want things we're trying to do is

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.490
with a start against the players there's
obviously that entertainment back to

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.390
bring a lot to the video clips and I
love the sound bites the fire

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.290
but also give them something to chase
during the free spins so by opening up

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.910
the colossal real said and applying it
to X-wing to that really giving the

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.330
player the opportunity to really
maximize their win throughout this

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.870
