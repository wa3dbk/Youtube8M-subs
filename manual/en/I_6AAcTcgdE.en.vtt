00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.350
EA to develop future Star Wars games, Wolfenstein:
The New Order announced, and more!

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.470
Hey guys, I'm Jess, and this is the Curse
Weekly Roundup.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.210
First up, Disney and EA have signed a multi-year,
exclusive licensing agreement stating that

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.610
EA will develop and publish new Star Wars
titles for a core gaming audience, while Disney

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.800
retains certain rights to develop titles in
the mobile, social, tablet, and online game

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800
categories.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.090
People are NOT happy about this - one reddit
user compared the situation to giving a kid

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.860
to a family of psycho-chainsaw murderers - what
do you guys think?

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.860
LIttle harsh?

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.310
I think that's a little harsh, but let us
know in the comments.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.230
Alright, so this next game is one that I have
trouble pronouncing: apparently on Tuesday

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.440
Bethesda announced Wolfenstein: The New Order.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.210
If you ask ME, I'd tell you that they announced
"Woofensteen: The New Order," but that's just

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.880
my Ohio accent coming out - thumbs up for
regional dialects!

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.440
I actually pronounce this animal as "direWOOF,"
so there's that.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.320
Why don't you guys comment below and tell
me if it's Wolfenstein, Woofensteen, or....vulfeschtine.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.659
Anyway, The New Order is set in 1960 after
the Nazis won WWII, and will be out for 360,

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.070
PS3, PC, and next gen consoles during quarter
4 2013.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:29.109
Next up, you guys know GMod?

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.850
Stands for Garry's Mod, that game that people
use to make creepy little TF2 videos, right?

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.100
Nope, apparently some jacka at Olympus Games
trademarked "gmod" back in 2005.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.450
Now they're making a game called "gmod," and
here's the kicker: they're claiming that some

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.630
people are getting confused and finding Garry's
Mod when what they're looking for is the Olympus

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.749
Games' gmod.

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:48.240
Yeah, that's happening.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.599
And here's the kicker part 2: Olympus is threatening
to take Garry's Mod to court if they don't

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:58.380
a) buy all the gmod domains and twitter accounts,
or b) post a permanent link to gmod on garrysmod.com

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.869
and force the community not to abbreviate
Garry's Mod to gmod.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.240
What the actual ****.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.850
Moving on, for you Guild Wars 2 fans out there,
the game's getting a content update on the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.830
14th titled "The Secret of Southsun," which
is a continuation of of the Flame and Frost

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.220
Living Story, and to read all about that,
check out the post on GuildWars2guru.com,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.629
we'll drop a link in the description.

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.299
Also, we're hosting a couple of Guild Wars
2 tournaments - the North American one's on

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.000
June 2nd, and you can still sign up now until
May 24th.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.190
Any European viewers wishing to participate,
unfortunately you may have missed the deadline,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.410
unfortunately registration closes today, but
you can watch the European tournament streamed

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.390
online on May 19th on Twitch.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.540
And speaking of tournaments, we're right in
the middle of our Dota 2 Invitational, casted

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.720
by Ayesee and Merlini, and featuring a $10,000
prize pool and teams like Dignitas, NaVi,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.170
EG, and five others.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.189
You already missed the first two rounds last
weekend, but we pick back up with it this

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.269
weekend and next, so be sure to tune in at
Twitch.tv/curseentertainment

Finally, we've teamed up with SOE to give
away beta keys for Dragon's Prophet, so if

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.400
