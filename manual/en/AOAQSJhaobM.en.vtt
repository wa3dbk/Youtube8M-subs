00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.150
Walt Disney's second animated feature was
released in February of 1940 - and is considered

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.450
by many to be one of his most influential
movies.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.789
Although the $2.2 million dollar production
initially bombed at the box office, seven

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.840
subsequent re-releases following World War
II helped it eventually turn a profit, and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.700
today its total gross sits a much more impressive
$84 million.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.790
Like almost all of Disney's animated features,
this approved-rated narrative is based on

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.470
a famous, pre-existing work.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.030
In this case, "The Adventures Of Pinocchio"
a children's novel by Italian writer Carlo

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.700
Collodi is adapted to the 4:3 frame in wonderful
Technicolor by supervising directors Ben Sharpsteen

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.859
and Hamilton Luske.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.129
The imaginative story follows a puppet, brought
to life by a magical fairy who, with the help

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.019
of his cricket companion, attempts to prove
himself worthy so he may transform into a

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.019
real boy.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.190
Dickie Jones provides the voice of the titular
character with plenty of wide-eyed innocence,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.440
while Cliff Edwards does a convincing job
as the street-smart insect, who acts as Pinocchio's

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.440
"conscience".

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.510
He opens the film with the Academy Award winning
original song, "When You Wish Upon A Star",

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.670
a beautiful ballad that has become an undisputed
classic in the years since.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.660
His role as the helpful guide is far less
impressive, and honestly a bit superfluous,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.610
as he mostly just whispers redundant exposition
of what the audience is already thinking.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.800
Meanwhile, Christian Rub is featured as Geppetto,
the elderly father figure, who's late night

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.410
wish bring his marionette creation to life.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.140
What I don't understand is why Geppetto is
so shocked about a sentient puppet even though

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.560
he lives in a world populated by talking,
bi-pedal foxes and singing crickets.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.990
And what does this woodcarver do with his
new son the very next morning?

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.630
He sends him to school completely unsupervised,
even though the wooden boy has almost no understanding

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.030
of how the world works.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.410
It's these contrived circumstances and unsavory
characters manipulating our puppet protagonist

00:01:43.410 --> 00:02:22.630
that drive most of the 88-minute plot.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.749
In the film's most enduring moment, Pinocchio
is horrified to discover his nose lengthens

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.269
every time he tells a lie, with his fairy-friend
reminding him, "A lie keeps growing and growing

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.459
until it's as plain as the nose on your face."

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.819
It's a very overt metaphor, but a simple and
important one kids should be able to appreciate.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.930
Combining elements of slapstick cartoon humor
with some catchy musical numbers... the journey

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.659
takes our characters from imprisonment in
a traveling show to ransacking the decadent

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:46.769
Pleasure Island.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.760
The latter includes some inventive and interesting
animation when Pinocchio takes a slow drag

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760
on a cigar.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.660
Indeed, some pretty risquÃ© stuff goes down
that will likely disturb younger audiences,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.370
like drinking, smoking, kidnapping, property
damage, implied death, and three utterances

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.730
of the word "jackass".

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.859
There's also a few major plot threads that
remain completely unresolved: like whatever

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.389
happens to those boys-turned donkeys?

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.569
And did the nefarious "Honest John" character
ever get punished?

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.409
Anyway, the movie is a visual marvel, but
the multiplane technology used to animate

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.299
this feature makes the differences between
the foreground and background far too noticeable.

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.780
Backed by a pleasant and upbeat musical score,
this is a must-watch for all families, at

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.780
least once.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.099
Although the ridiculous events are rarely
believable, the light-hearted adventure reminds

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.890
kids and adults that sometimes, your dreams
can come true.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.989
This is a picture I enjoyed as a child...
but until re-watching it for this review,

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.200
I hadn't seen it in well over 20 years.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.249
Fortunately, it remains just as dazzling.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:42.219
"Pinocchio" may have a convoluted story, but
its endearing characters and lasting morals

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.209
make it a true classic, and a GREAT film.
