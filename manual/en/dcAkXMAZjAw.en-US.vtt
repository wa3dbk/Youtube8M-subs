How
change
brake levers
and clutch?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You
needs 3
tools :

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
a set
allen key 
(hexagonal)

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
a screwdriver

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.000
and a pipe wrench
of
10 or a key set to
pawl

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Start by
easier :

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
brake lever
right
of the
motorbike.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
A screw ...

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
A nut ...

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We take care of the nut ...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Then the screw ...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now install the new
brake lever.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We reinsert screw.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Check the brake system
is actuated when the lever
moves.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Check if there's playing

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
then use the tuning parameters available
on your example the lever adjustment
custody.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Let
right now
lever
clutch

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
always
without
difficulty.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Small difference, need to
screwdriver but your finger! And the key
10.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Be carefull to facilitate future, think
to "give slack" cable
clutch by acting on the
adjustment knob (left)

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
To avoid scratching the touch and
tank with tool, one can
simply rotate the handlebars.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Watch the new lever, it
has a slot for
clutch cable with lead
the end of the cable.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Be carefull to the system under
lever (little black box with a
piston into or out depending on 
whether the
pressed or not handle).

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
everything is mounted/fitted in 5
minutes, you
are pleased

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and there is 
the
drama! the
lever
clutch
does not 
return
more!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
No panic! You relaxed your
cable just before, so now you have just to
tighten again.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
You can also take the opportunity to
lubricate the clutch cable with new engine oil.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:07.000
