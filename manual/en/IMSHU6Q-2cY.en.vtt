00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.820
Where am I?

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.660
Geoff.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.900
Come forth.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.420
This is Heaven, isn't it?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.120
Yes.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.160
Come forth and be judged at the Pearly Gates.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.620
Oh.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.420
Seems you've done a lot of good things in your life.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.520
Well, thank you for noticing,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.940
I tried to be a fairly virtuous person.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.460
You know, I donated money to the Rotary Club.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.860
However... Seems you've also committed some sins.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.000
No, I don't... think so.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.140
Well, you pinched your sister when you were 8.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.460
You once pretended to have a British accent to sleep with a girl.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.620
She knew I was faking.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
You committed murder 387,406 times,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740
You have two unpaid parking tickets--

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.860
Uh, I'm sorry, what was that?

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560
You have two unpaid parking tickets.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.580
No, n-no the-- go back, the murder part?

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.900
Did you say I murdered somebody?

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.600
Well, that's what it says in this book, and Heaven doesn't lie.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.000
Are you calling Jesus a liar?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.520
Jesus, no, I--

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.840
I'm not calling him anything.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.260
I just-- It's a mistake, 'cause I never did that.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.780
My name is Geoff with a "G". It could have been a "J" Jeff,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.760
Potentially? I don't know.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.480
There he is. There's the man who killed me.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.020
Okay. That's a video game character. That does not count.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.420
Who ever said that?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.500
Who said that killing a video game character doesn't count?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.000
But, I--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.780
It's your intentions that matters. And in your heart,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.760
you really believed that you were killing that poor Goomba.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.100
You killed me, and over 500 of my family.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.380
My beautiful wife, Dianne.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.440
You horrible monster.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.880
But he's not even human.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.680
Oh.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.180
Well, now we can add "racism" to your list.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.680
No!

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.480
Well, if you want to talk about strictly humans,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.660
what about all those hookers you had sex with,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.100
and then killed to avoid paying them?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.540
Hookers? I never--

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.840
Grand Theft Auto?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.200
Yeah.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.620
Hookers are people too.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.400
Well... Technically they're actually 2/3's of a person,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.020
But you killed 46, so that's...

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.280
30.666...

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.180
I get the point.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.140
Moving along.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.760
Come on in.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.180
Where is he going?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.860
He is a bad guy. He's a bad, bad guy.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.280
He was just an innocent solider following orders.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.440
And honestly, I don't think anyone was ever killed by a Grunt.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.300
Ever.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.840
Yeah, but that's not fair.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.360
Oh. Oh! You want to talk fair now!

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.640
Let's talk about fair!

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.520
Why don't you ask the hundreds of soldiers that you killed in Call of Duty about "fair".

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.360
Or better yet,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.780
Why don't you ask that guy over there,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.300
about the time you sliced him in half and smashed his remains to a bloody pulp.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.960
Was that "fair", Sub-Zero?

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.620
Yeah, okay, I get it. That's gross and all,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.340
but, what about all the things I did right in video games?

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.540
Like the princesses I saved? And the worlds I saved?

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.680
There was a lot of saving.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.400
But what about the good deeds you didn't do?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.520
The things I didn't...? I-- What?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.120
Let's take Granny Redstone for example.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.260
How many times did she ask you to collect apples for her?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.760
I don't even know what game you're talking about.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.520
Well, doesn't matter, because she's dead now!

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.920
She starved to death,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.840
because you couldn't find the time to pick 10 apples for her and her family.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.360
10 apples!

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.760
Oh, what, so I'm supposed to do every side quest in every video game?

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.300
Oh, what, you expect me to let every single person into Heaven?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.380
Huh?

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.560
Why don't we take a vote?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.320
All those in favor of letting Geoff into Heaven, raise your hands.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.680
Asshole.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.800
Hey, come on, they don't even have hands!

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800
That is unfair!

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.300
Oh.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.020
NEXT!

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.160
[buzzer sounding]

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.620
[Geoff screaming]

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.960
Why am I still falling?

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.940
Oh noooo!

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.320
[Crying]
