Hi my name is Dave Andrews and today I'm going
to explain to you what Internet domains are.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.260
Now when you are using the Internet on your
computer it's important to remember that the

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.130
only thing that really matters to the computer
is a series of numbers that are called an

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.270
IP address. Now on the Internet world these
IP addresses are used to tie computers together

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.900
and that's how you identify a computer on
the Internet. What a domain name does is basically

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.550
make that IP address easier to remember. So
instead of remembering a whole bunch of numbers

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.052
that's a sequence of four that could be up
to three digits a piece, you just get to remember

00:00:40.052 --> 00:00:45.750
something simple like Google dot com, Yahoo
dot com. I'm going to show you how to identify

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.609
an IP address and show you how the domains
work. Now on our computer, just as an explanation,

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.780
let's pull up a command prompt by clicking
on the start button and we are going to go

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.409
to run on Windows XP. But on Vista I'm just
going to type command and press enter. Now

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.170
we are going to run a command called NS lookup
which does a domain name system lookup. And

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.710
that basically is going to return the IP address
that's assigned to a domain that we type in.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.759
So for example let's say MSN dot com. As you
can see we got an answer here, MSN dot com

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.259
is tied to the IP address two o seven dot
six eight dot one seven two dot two four six.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.079
So I'm going to come to the edit menu up here
and just do a mark, that way I can highlight

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.560
this address and press enter to copy it. So
I'm going to open up my web browser and just

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.789
to show you the proof of concept here, instead
of typing in MSN dot com, I'm going to right

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.869
click and paste in that IP address. Now in
my web browser I'm just connecting to that

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.690
number and I'm going to press enter. But as
you can see what I have gotten is MSN dot

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:13.900
com. My name is Dave Andrews and I've just
explained to you how domain systems work.
