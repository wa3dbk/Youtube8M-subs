00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.779
The Driver Finishing Program is a program
that we developed a number of years ago to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.660
give entry-level drivers an opportunity to
get into the transportation industry and gain

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.550
that valuable experience. A lot of drivers
that come onto Bison Transport aren't thinking

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.580
that we do not bring in entry-level drivers,
but we do. We bring in drivers with fresh

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.239
Class 1 or AZ licenses. We will do the in-cab
training with them over a period of 13 weeks

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.140
to ensure that they get the proper training
to do the job.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.540
Before this I was just working part-time and
going to university for computer science.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.530
And I got to thinking about that and decided
I didn't really want to be at a desk all the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.189
time. So figured I'd try driving for a while.
So far I'm really enjoying it. Oh, I think

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:10.189
right off the start you get the experience
with another driver with you. Being in that

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.240
environment where you have the opportunity
to make a big mistake, but the instructor

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.079
that's with you points out what's going on
and how you could make a better decision in

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:27.850
a certain situation. It's just really great
to be able to go and get the experience for

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.550
yourself without having to worry about making
huge mistakes because you have the instructor

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.800
there with you in the passenger seat the whole
time.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.380
Hood latch. Everything's secure. With our
tire, minimum 3.2 millimeters of thread in

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.120
three different places. We check the walls...

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.420
It's a gratifying feeling when you take a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.320
new driver out of a driving school and put
them through their paces, teach them safety,

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:59.329
run through all their pre-trip and air-brake
and driving. Within days, they start doing

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.329
it on their own and it's nice to see them
learn and develop and become a Bison driver.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.110
We operate good, clean, safe equipment. We
have great dispatch. We have good maintenance.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.110
We have good trucking facilities, great customers.
It just makes for a good overall experience.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.430
You start driving with the instructors and
as you go further and further into it, you

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.380
gain confidence at a level that's comfortable
to yourself. I was never asked to do anything

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.390
that I couldn't perform. And I felt that when
I did get released to drive on my own, that

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.200
I was comfortable being on my own. And I think
that's the biggest part of the program is

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.709
it builds confidence and you feel like you're
a safe confident driver when you leave the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.629
Bison Development Program.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.700
Well Bison is a really friendly company. They

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.000
really are focused on making sure that their
drivers are well taken care of and home when

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.370
they need to be, and have all the training
and resources that they could possibly need

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.159
for any questions that they may have or any
extra training that they might want.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.209
The quality of training at Bison Transport
through this program is very high-quality

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.049
training. We ensure that the drivers are true
professionals when they leave this program.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.610
The Driver Finishing Program actually encompasses
the first full year of employment with Bison

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.819
Transport. And the drivers that come into
this program, as I said earlier, have a fresh

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.969
Class 1 license. So they've got the, they
just got out of the driving school and the

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:40.900
word Finishing Program is important here because
we want these drivers to be true professional

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.969
drivers when we finish the first year of training
and mentoring with them.

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:51.560
I've been in sales all my life and enjoyed
it and had fun at it, but I always wanted

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.560
to drive and I thought if I'm going to do
it I need to do it now. So I decided to take

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.480
a course in driving. And I ended up at Bison
and feel very fortunate that Bison chose me

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.960
and I chose Bison.
