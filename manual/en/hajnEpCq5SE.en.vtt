The new MacBook

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:10.309 align:start size:84% position:16%
is the result of 
a collective obsession

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:13.446 align:start size:88% position:13%
to simplify 
its essential components

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:18.117 align:start size:91% position:9%
to create the most
efficient design possible.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.686 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's a product that
couldn't exist

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:27.060 align:start size:88% position:13%
without invention across
many disciplines.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.829
A full-size keyboard
is the most familiar,

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:33.232 align:start size:91% position:9%
comfortable, and
accurate typing platform.

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:36.736
It defined the width
of the new MacBook.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.305
To make it thinner 
and more precise,

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:40.940
we created a sturdy,

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.976 align:start size:91% position:9%
single-assembly butterfly
mechanism.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.446 align:start size:94% position:6%
Combined with a new
stainless steel dome switch,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:53.019 align:start size:97% position:3%
this reinforces the keyboard's
balance and stability.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:57.590
Each individual key is
now lit by a single LED.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:01.394 align:start size:97% position:3%
This enables better, 
more deliberate illumination.

A Retina display delivers

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:11.337 align:start size:84% position:16%
the very best viewing
experience.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.240
To engineer the thinnest
Retina screen for a Mac,

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:17.210 align:start size:81% position:19%
we've refined every
component --

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:21.581 align:start size:81% position:19%
from the glass 
down to the pixels.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.984 align:start position:0%
It delivers the vivid brightness
and performance you'd expect,

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:27.887 align:start size:88% position:13%
but in a design that's 
thinner, lighter,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.991
and 30% more power efficient.

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:38.598 align:start position:0%
We've designed a force-sensing,
multi-touch track pad.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.701 align:start size:91% position:9%
This adds a new
dimension of interaction.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:45.738 align:start size:94% position:6%
Touch sensors make the
entire glass surface active.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.041 align:start size:94% position:6%
Force sensors measure
a wide range of pressure --

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:53.946
from the lightest tap
to the deepest press.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.782 align:start size:91% position:9%
The pressure you apply
activates an electromagnet

00:01:56.815 --> 00:02:01.020
that responds with
tactile feedback.

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:03.823
So now instead of just seeing
what's happening on the screen,

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:06.125
you feel it, too.

To make all-day
battery life possible,

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:16.102
we have developed new
battery technologies.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:18.137
We actually changed
the construction

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.973 align:start size:88% position:13%
and internal
chemistry of the cells,

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:25.211 align:start size:91% position:9%
which are now manufactured
in discrete sheets.

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:28.147
These sheets are stacked
in a terrace structure

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.785 align:start size:94% position:6%
that was developed along
with the external enclosure.

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:37.156
The design allows for 35%
greater battery capacity

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.094
in this compact space.

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:43.663
To maximize performance,

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start size:94% position:6%
we took an extreme approach 
to miniaturization.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:51.070 align:start size:97% position:3%
Components were optimized
and engineered to fit together

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:55.808 align:start size:97% position:3%
to create the highest-density
Mac logic board yet.

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.843
It's actually two-thirds smaller

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:00.880
than any we've
designed before.

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:04.417 align:start size:97% position:3%
A fundamental goal was to
eliminate the need for vents,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.886
fans, or any moving parts --

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.891 align:start size:81% position:19%
allowing it to
operate in silence.

00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:15.528 align:start size:97% position:3%
By consolidating the
antenna with the bottom case,

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:19.999
we were able to design an
integrated aluminum hinge.

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.667
This innovation --

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.903 align:start size:84% position:16%
along with its unibody
enclosure --

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:28.140
makes this the first 
all-metal MacBook.

the new USB Type-C
connector is a single port

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:51.931 align:start size:94% position:6%
