00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Seven years.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.720
That's what a kura kaupapa Maori
teacher is facing

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.280
for sexually assaulting
male students

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.680
and supplying some with cannabis.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.000
Reuben Tapara taught

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.560
at the kura kaupapa Maori
in Putaruru

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.720
before he was charged
in October last year.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.200
Peata Melbourne was in court today

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.480
and joins us live
from Hamilton.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.240
Peata.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.480
Scotty, the families and victims
have long waited for the verdict.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.520
Tapara was not present,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.800
but he was broadcast from prison

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.560
and we were able
to hear and see him in court.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.440
The families of some
of the victims were present.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.880
Their lawyers did not allow us
to speak to them,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.520
but you could feel
their pain and anger.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.760
The mother of one of the victims
spoke to the judge today,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.560
at which point Tapara began to cry,
as did the mother.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.360
The atmosphere in the court room
today was tense with anger.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.200
Reuben Tapara was a teacher,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.040
but behind the facade
was something else.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.800
The board is sorry.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.120
Tapara taught here
before moving to another school

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.680
where his penchant
for sexual assault was discovered.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.080
In 2003, he and a group of students
visited the Cook Islands,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.080
and over a year later,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.200
a student came forward
to say Tapara had spoken to him.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.480
Tapara allegedly masturbated
in front of a student

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.480
and demanded sexual favours,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.000
with threats of violence
if the boy declined.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.200
Did he take his claims to police?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.560
The principal failed
to go to police.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.000
But the school's
private investigator said;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.200
the boy said nothing has come of it.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.360
But the school says Tapara admitted
to the 12-year-old's claims.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.320
Tapara also admits
to drinking alcohol

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.720
while children were in his care.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.480
The school did not fine him.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.040
At the time, what happened
to Reuben Tapara?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.920
Was he still teaching?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.440
He was.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.680
The New Zealand
School Trustees Associations says

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.920
they weren't privy
to the investigator's findings,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.920
and they say they did not sense
that anything was amiss with him.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.680
The teachers council says
they weren't informed,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.600
as does the head of Te Runanganui
o Nga Kura Kaupapa.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.200
I agree that the runanga should have
more say in these decisions.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.240
When Reuben Tapara moved

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.960
to Te Kura Kaupapa Maori
o Te Kaokaoroa o Patetere in 2008,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.240
the school supported
his application.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:33.160
Your school supported his
application for a job at that school
- is that true?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.000
It is.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.400
The school is taking a look
at their processes,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.760
and they have passed on the names

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.480
and contact details
of former students to police.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.200
This was Tapara's first offence.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.560
Today he talked about
his anger at himself.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.320
He thinks about
his crimes every day,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.840
and the pain that he put
his victims through.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.360
He's received threats,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.400
and he understands that
that's the price for his crimes.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.880
He apologised to the families
that attended and to his own family,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.560
and said he understood
the difficulties

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.560
they're facing at the moment.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.360
The sentence
was seven years in prison.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.960
Thank you, Peata Melbourne,
live from our Hamilton offices.
