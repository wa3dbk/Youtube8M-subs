00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.639
Today we are going to look at some of the
features on the Kelty Salida Two.

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.080
This is a two person, three season backpacking
tent.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.770
It weighs in at four pounds, eight ounces.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.590
There is just enough room for two people to
fit in there.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.330
It does have one door and a sin-gle vestibule
for storage and does come with a full coverage

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.110
fly that is seam taped and waterproof.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.060
So I'll peel the fly back here so you can
get a better look at the body of the tent

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.890
on the Salida Two.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.840
Most of the body is made from a dark, no see
them, mesh netting.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.360
This tent is going to offer a fantastic breathability.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.060
It is going to be perfect for three season
back-packing.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.460
Ands you will have plenty of breathability
to prevent some moisture and con-densation

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.989
build up in cooler temperatures as well.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.539
You do have a nylon paneling here around the
bottom of the tent.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:45.550
It follows all the way around.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.229
You have got a little bit at the top.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.139
But most of the tent body here is going to
be mesh.

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:55.109
And in the floor down here this is a seam
sealed waterproof floor.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.129
The material used here is a little bit more
durable than what is used on the upper of

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.129
the tent.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.190
So you have got a little bit more durability
and complete waterproofness in the floor.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.369
There is a single D shaped door on the Salida
Two.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.780
And there is a toggle system here that you
can anchor the door back with, kind of keep

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.420
it out of the way.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.390
Inside the tent here you have got just enough
room for two standard 20 inch wide sleeping

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.390
pads.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.890
If you are used to using a wider sleeping
pad, this tent might be perfect for one person,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.280
but for two people you are going to need to
stick to that standard 20 inch wide pad to

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.490
fit in here.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.359
On this side of the tent you have got two
small pockets in the corner, just enough room

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.549
to stuff a head lamp or a cell phone.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.350
Kelty does include gear loft with this tent.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.350
You can see I have attached it up here.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.009
It ties in to some webbing points in the corners.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.391
It gives you a really nice option for stowing
extra items in the tent and gives you a little

00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:48.850
bit more space inside.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.149
The Salida Two is a free standing tent.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.390
It has got two poles.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.380
Kelty is using a DAC Pres-cott pole.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.969
So they are lightweight aluminum, don't really
weigh the tent down, but you get some good

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.119
structure out of it.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.880
Because it doesn't have a third pole, this
tent isn't going to be super suitable for

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.600
any sort of like early spring, late fall use,
definitely not in the winter time.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.340
It doesn't quite have the pole architecture
to support a heavy load of snow or really

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.110
bad weather conditions, but it is going to
be great for most three season use.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.230
And you can see Kelty uses kind of a quick
clip system here.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.650
It is pretty easy to do.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.170
I mean, even with a glove or a mitten on you
can get away with it.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.160
We have got two double clips at the top here
that kind of anchor both of those poles together

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.190
that create that wedge pole design.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.220
The fly on the Salida Two connects to the
tent body through a fast tax buckle.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.220
And you can see here that the tent pole comes
down and anchors into a grommet and a piece

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.200
of webbing is attached to the body of the
tent.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.690
Your stake goes through the loop on the end.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.260
That fly attaches in through the fast tax
buckle and you can adjust it here.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.600
And these pieces of webbing on the corner
of this tent are color coded.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.510
Two corners are orange, two corners are silver.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.660
So you can easily match the corner of the
fly up with the correct corner of the tent

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.070
to make sure you have got the fly oriented
so the door opening and the vesti-bule connects

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.070
with the door on the tent.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.960
So you have got your full coverage fly.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.110
You can see it creates a vestibule space here.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.010
There is enough room to tuck a pack or a pair
of boots in.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.320
When it is closed over you can easily have
two packs, two pairs of boots in here.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.990
So it is enough space for two people to stow
their gear.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.100
You do have a nice rain flap over the zipper.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.410
So it doesn't allow rain to run in through
the zipper on the fly.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.180
And Kelty also has added these guide out points
on the side of the tent here.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.960
You will see these later in these orange pieces
attach to this black.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.290
It is a black piece of looped webbing.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.090
So if you are going to be in some sort of
like windier conditions or think you are going

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.500
to run into some bad weather, they do give
you this option to support that pole structure

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.810
a little bit better with the guide points.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.270
You will find one on every corner on each
pole.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.380
And along with that gear loft that is included,
you have some light weight aluminum stakes.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.260
Kelty does through in a little bundle of guideline
with some guideline adjusters.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.070
It looks like there is about four of them
here, which would easily do those other four

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.430
corners.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.680
So you have got some nice additions there
with this tent.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680
It is a great space.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.620
It is a good weight coming in at under five
pounds for two people.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.050
It is a really good value tent for anyone
that is looking to do some three season backpacking

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.380
and is looking for a solid tent that is going
to be weather worthy and hold up under those

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.760
conditions.
