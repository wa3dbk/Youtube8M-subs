Vsauce!

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.549
Baby hammerhead sharks are born in groups
of 12 to 15 and as soon as they're born they're

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.500
orphaned by their parents.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.730
The litter huddles together and swims toward
warmer water until they are big enough to

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.850
defend themselves... from cuteness

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.439
What the FAK
The facts and knowledge on killer animal babies

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.710
White rhinos can weigh nearly 8,000 lbs and
their babies are born weighing over 100 lbs

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.380
after a 16 month pregnancy!

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.150
Each female is only able to give birth every
two to three years.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.970
The babies nurse for up to a year even though
they can graze early on, and they stay with

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.230
their mothers for up to 3 years before venturing
out on their own.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.160
Baby rhinos are rarely attacked because of
their mother's vigorous protection and their

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.590
tough skin.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.360
Baby rhino fact: The moms use their horn to
protect their young.&nbsp;

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.450
&nbsp;
Wolves are known for their pack mentality

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.670
and amazing hunting abilities.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.580
They've entered folklore like Little Red Riding
hood and werewolves because of their fierceness,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.649
but it's hard to imagine a vicious werewolf
when looking at a baby wolf.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:12.010
Born in a litter of four to six pups, baby
wolves are faced with a mortality rate of

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.030
30-60% because of the numerous dangers around.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.640
The mother wolves do their best to protect
them by birthing inside of a den or cave and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.380
have even been seen acting as decoys to lure
bears away.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.820
They start eating meat at 4-5 weeks old, then
begin to hunt small animals like rabbits as

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.619
preparation to become a member of the pack
and hunt larger game.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.869
Baby wolf fact: Mama wolves massage the tummies
of the babies with their tongue to help them

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.039
pee!&nbsp;

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.819
Grizzly bears can easily overpower any animal
in their territory, even wolves and cougars

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.679
will give up their prey when a Grizzly approaches.

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.819
Hunters learn how to avoid bear attacks because
of the danger and the sheer size of these

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.990
animals but grizzly bears are often the most
dangerous when protecting their young.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.209
Usually in sets of two, Grizzly cubs are born
during the late winter months during hibernation

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.470
while the mother is in a deep sleep.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.969
Cubs will stay with their mom for 2-3 years
before venturing out on their own, and even

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.409
though the mother protects them, nearly half
don't make it past the first year due to disease,

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.989
starvation, and predators that include male
grizzlies.

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.069
Baby Bear fact: Baby grizzlies are able to
climb trees to catch prey and avoid danger,

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.099
but get too heavy to do so as adults!

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.019
Baboons warn off predators by walking in a
threatening manner while baring their large

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.060
canines and screaming, they're also fast and
strong, but when caring for their young it's

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.780
a much different story.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.080
Female baboons only have one baby at a time
that they carry under their belly for the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.480
fist five to six weeks, after which they will
hop up on their mother's back.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.879
They're protected by the entire troupe and
once males reach four years old they find

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.260
their own troupe, however females stay with
the same one throughout their lives.&nbsp;

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.159
Baby Baboon Fact: In baboon society babies
are protected so no other baboon will threaten

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.290
anyone carrying a baby!

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.739
Hippo's have been known to be aggressive towards
each other and even rumored to overturn boats

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.170
and be dangerous to humans but, they look
like this when they're born, so yeah.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.980
Mothers typically only give birth to one baby
at a time that weighs up to 100 pounds.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.269
They're born underwater, where they have to
quickly reach the surface to get their first

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.519
breath of air.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.680
Hippo moms have to stay in deep water to stay
cool and out of the sun, so baby hippos will

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.390
ride on their mom's back.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.440
Much of the mom's time is spent to protecting
the baby from predators while it is too young

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.219
to fend for itself.

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:41.640
Baby Hippo Fact: Standing up is hard...

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.140
Adult lions are fast, strong, and feared.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.200
Baby lions are adorable.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.319
Female lions isolate themselves in a safe
place, away from the pride for up to eight

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.719
weeks, while giving birth to one to six babies.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.890
There are all kinds of dangers the lion cubs
are faced with including hyenas, leopards,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.959
jackals, pythons, and eagles.

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.689
But the dominant males of their own pride
can often be the most dangerous.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.150
The cubs are very playful and the mother is
tolerant of their silly behavior because playing

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.909
helps fine tune their skills as adults by
first learning to stalk and pounce on each

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:15.909
other.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.019
Baby lion fact: Baby lions can nurse from
other females in their prides, not just their

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.019
own mom!

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.470
Despite being highly venomous and feared around
the world, the female king cobra is a very

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.970
dedicated parent.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.300
They build nests in which they lay 20-40 eggs
and they stay with the eggs until hatched,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.979
which takes 60 to 90 days.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.650
But once the baby cobras are born, they're
on their own.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.000
They are able to spread their hood and strike
on the same day they're hatched.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.020
But even though they are much cuter when they're
babies their venom is just as potent as that

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.800
of their adult counterparts.&nbsp;

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.990
Baby Cobra fact: There's a yolk sac in the
baby's stomach that feeds it for two weeks

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.370
until it finds food on its own.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.270
Adult alligators are prehistoric-looking and
frightening to almost everyone, but their

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.560
babies are much less intimidating.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.120
The babies come equipped with an "egg tooth"
that allows them to break through the shell

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.460
of their egg when it's time to hatch.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.310
Once they're hatched the mother will defend
the nest and help them get to the water to

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.680
avoid predation of birds and raccoons, but
their biggest enemy is adult alligators.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.520
They stay with their mothers for 2 years before
venturing out on their own, and can even be

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.710
seen riding on their backs.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.080
Baby Alligator fact: The sex of the offspring
is determined by the temperature of the nest!

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.360
I'm going to leave you with this...

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.720
What is it and what's its nickname?
