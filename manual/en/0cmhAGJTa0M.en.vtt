00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.340
Hi, I'm Tricia, an organic gardener. I grow
organically

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.340
for a healthy and safe food supply. For a
clean and sustainable environment.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.380
For an enjoyable and rewarding
experience.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.740
If you grow nectarines or peaches, then
you're probably familiar with public

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.150
enemy number one

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.270
for stone fruit growers. Peach leaf curl!

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.340
The unsightly red crinkling of leaves in
the spring

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.430
and yellow dying foliage in the summer
are hard symptoms to miss.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.989
Your trees will often cast off the
diseased leaves

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.750
and push out a second set but that takes
precious energy away from ripening

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.530
juicy peaches. Peach leaf curl is
typically more

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.649
ugly then it is dangerous however if
left untreated

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.710
long-term, it can kill the tree. Wet cool
springs are the ideal conditions for the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.870
fungus to spread.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
In the spring when the bud scales loosen
until the leaves are fully emerged

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.319
the can be infected by
overwintering fungus.

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:07.270
The wet carries the fungus and the cool
weather lengthens the infection window

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.820
because the leaves take longer to emerge. Unfortunately

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.510
there's not much you can do in the
spring to take care of peach leaf curl,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.649
however, you can make sure that the tree
is watered thoroughly

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.719
and fertilized so that it's not stressed
when its putting out at second set of

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:23.329
leaves.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.409
I like to feed peach and nectarine trees
with the foliar spray of kelp and liquid

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:28.969
fish

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.659
to stimulate the regrowth of leaves.
Foliar feeding is the best way to get

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.740
the fertilizer

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.049
to the tree rapidly. You should also thin
the fruit aggressively

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.229
so the tree won't be weakened by trying
to carry too much fruit with its reduced

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.640
leaf canopy. The only known effective
treatment for peach leaf curl

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.350
is a preventive fungicide spray in late
fall and winter.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.619
Spray as soon as the leaves have dropped. Treat your trees with a fungicide

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.009
labeled for the control of peach leaf curl
such as this Liqui-Cop fungicide.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.250
The addition a horticultural oil, like
the one from Monterey,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.190
acts a spreader and can increase the
fungicide coverage

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.740
in addition to controlling some other
stone fruit pests

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.680
and diseases. And as always, read the
label carefully

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.379
and follow all the directions and don't
forget your protective gear.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.000
Even natural products can cause irritants to skin

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.080
and to the respiratory

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.700
system. Spray the tree thoroughly to the
point a runoff.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.210
The active ingredient  of Liqui-Cop is
copper so try to avoid excessive runoff

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.290
into the soil.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.870
Years have repeated heavy copper
fungicide applications

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.090
can kill soil organisms. A single spray

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.600
is usually sufficient for control but a
second spray, just before bud swell is

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.870
a good idea in years with heavy rainfall.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.430
If there's any liquid left in the spray
after you're finished

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.290
be sure in dispose a bit according to the
labels on the product,

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.530
and no contamination of bodies of water.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.100
There is nothing better than home grown
peaches

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.400
so don't let peach leaf curl ruin your
crop an ounce of prevention will go a

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.290
long way.
