00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.089
tWitch: What's up, ya'll? It's the day before
Thanksgiving, a holiday that is known for

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:16.600
spending time with friends and family, but
more importantly having amazing dinner. Right,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.949
so, what are you doing?
Cameron: Well the average person eats 4,500

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.080
calories on Thanksgiving. I'm training, duh.
tWitch: You know you can make it fun and dance

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.359
it off.
Cameron: You're kidding!

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.590
tWitch: Seriously.
Cameron: I also only did like four of those.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.370
tWitch: Let's just get right to the dancing,
okay, so say that you actually ate 4,500 calories

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.800
on Thanksgiving.
Cameron: Do you think it was the same at the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.760
first Thanksgiving back in 1621? Woo, I'm
stuffed. I couldn't have one more bite of…whatever

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.989
you eat in 1621.
tWitch: Right and if only we could go to the club

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:07.670
as pilgrims and burn 240 calories.
Cameron: So today the most popular Thanksgiving

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.030
dish is, of course, stuffing. Okay, let's
say our favorite stuffings on three. Three,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.909
two, one…

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.909
Cameron: Sardine!
tWitch: Herb!

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.790
Cameron: Herb.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.650
tWitch: Well, Cam, you know you can take down
400 calories by doing a half hour of zumba.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.650
Cameron: Well you can't have Thanksgiving
without a ton of butter.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.119
tWitch: Right, who does not love butter, seriously?
Cameron: But luckily, you can burn all that

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.119
off with just thirty minutes of aerobics,
which burns 250 calories.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.810
tWitch: But whatever you do, do not combine
the butter and the dancing.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.860
Cameron: Okay, let's move on.
tWitch: Yeah, please.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.410
Cameron: Today at Thanksgiving we like to
enjoy pumpkin pie and you can burn it off

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.390
with just a bit of ballroom. Guess how many
calories you burn in just one hour of ballroom?

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.520
tWitch: Twelve.
Cameron: Higher.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.680
tWitch: Eight million.
Cameron: Lower.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
tWitch: Thirteen.
Cameron: Three hundred and twenty!

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.100
tWitch: Wow, that is a lot of turkey, I mean
how can we burn that off, Cam?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.100
Cameron: Uh, just one half hour of jive dancing
burns up to four hundred calories.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.950
tWitch: That's the hand jive, Cam.
Cameron: Oh. I guess you could say he's a

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.880
real jive turkey. Get it?
tWitch: Yeah, no, I got it. You know what

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.510
else burns a lot of calories, Cam?
Cameron: What?

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.760
tWitch: Sweeping.
Cameron: Awesome.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.090
tWitch: Yeah. 160 calories an hour.
Cameron: I can feel the burn! Wait a second. Is

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.450
this just to get me to clean up?
tWitch: Nah. Nah. Well, that's it for our

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.070
Thanksgiving list. If you have any other suggestions,
make sure you leave them in the comment box

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.620
below there and we'll see you next…
Cameron: Uh! You can really feel the burn.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.430
tWitch: Good, that means it's working. Good.
Right there. Right there.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.000
Cameron: I don't see it.
tWitch: Huh? You don't see it? That's why

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.880
you missed it cause you, you should see it.
Cameron: Woo, quite a…tWitch! tWitch?
