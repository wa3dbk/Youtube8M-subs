00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.540
Dr. Nate Storey: All right, this is Nate Storey
with Bright Agrotech and this is Part 4 of

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.959
our series on potassium.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:14.040
Now I'm going to talk about how we treat potassium
deficiencies and how we manage our systems

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.430
so that we don't end up with potassium deficiencies
really regularly because those can really

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.700
cut into our productivity.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.660
Historically we have had to supplement systems
with potassium whether it's a potassium carbonate

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.180
or a potassium-based hydroxide, we're adding
potassium to the system.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.070
Many folks who are adding seaweed extracts,
that kind of thing, they don't realize they

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.360
are also supplementing potassium.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:52.290
We use seaweed extract in our system, it's
got a rating of 0-0-10, this is our NPK rating,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.500
the kelp meal concentrate that we use has
this rating.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.390
You can see then that kelp and kelp meal is
very, very high in potassium.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.992
Carbonates and hydroxides are also high in
potassium and the nice thing is that this

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:18.710
is not supplementing nitrogen or potassium
so we end up when we put ... Sorry, phosphorus

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.600
... When we put a potassium hydroxide, like
caustic lye, caustic lye is a potassium hydroxide

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.880
... KOH, this is caustic lye, and this is
something that we'll use when the pH is very

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.880
low.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.560
We also have potassium carbonates, so this
is K, usually it's like a 2CO3, there's a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.070
few different carbonates there, and bicarbonates,
but we're adding carbonates and we're adding

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.610
hydroxides but they only work at low pHs because
both of these substances, our carbonates and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.210
our hydroxides will raise our pH.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.900
These are very, very basic compounds.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.009
This is one reason why a lot of people will
use kelp to supplement potassium in their

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.939
system because it's pH neutral.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:22.249
There are a lot of other substances that you
can use and depending on how your system runs

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.569
you can choose from a number of different
things, so I'm going to talk about those today.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.260
So far we've just talked about mostly substances
that we add to the solution.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.139
Now you can't spray something like kelp meal
concentrate on the plant leaves so you can't

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.559
apply it foliarly which means that the plants
absorb it directly through their leaves and

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.330
can utilize it.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.150
By and large most people were adding their
concentrates or their kelp meal concentrates

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.340
to the water itself, which is easy but not
always the most efficient method.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.540
There are a few other things that we can also
do this with, we use potassium sulfate.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.540
We use potassium sulfate here on occasion,
and most potassium sulfate has the rating

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.200
0-0-50.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:17.900
This is a very fast response, super fast response
potassium addition for systems and if you're

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.590
experiencing potassium deficiency and you
want to treat it in the solution I would highly

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.040
recommend using potassium sulfate because
you get very quick results.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.529
Now you can't really apply this foliarly,
that's one drawback, you don't want to be

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:38.750
spraying potassium sulfate on your leaves
but it works to correct these deficiencies

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.779
fairly fast in solution.

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:45.430
Now, if you're seeing deficiency symptoms
and you need to treat it right, right away,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.279
we're talking about like in the next one to
two weeks, then you're going to have to use

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.890
potassium chloride.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.690
Potassium chloride, it's a simple salt, a
lot of people people use it in de-icer, so

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.489
a lot of de-icing salts use potassium chloride.

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.489
It's a great, great thing to use for foliar
applications.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.650
Make sure that you check out the Vertical
Food Blog, I'll talk about how to dose potassium

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.410
chloride, but I usually recommend somewhere
around like 1/8 of a teaspoon, a very small

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.950
amount for each gallon of water that you're
going to apply foliarly.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.320
I want to make this clear, you apply this
foliarly.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.540
Not in solution, we don't want to be adding
this to our solution.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.560
This is a really great way to get a super
fast response out of your plants if you start

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.000
to see a potassium deficiency begin to develop.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.960
These are a few different options you have
for treating potassium deficiencies in your

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.920
system.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.570
Before you do any treatment, please, please,
please read the Vertical Food Blog, blogs

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.930
on this subject, they're going to talk in
enough detail that you can make the right

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.250
decision regarding which one is the best to
use and how much to dose it with.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.190
None of these things are going to destroy
your system if you add them.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.730
The big thing with foliar applications of
anything is that you can burn your plants

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.650
if you apply it at the wrong rate, so it's
always important to know what rates you're

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.220
applying, what substances you're using and
make sure that you're applying them at appropriate

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.020
rates to address the need of your system,
so please, please, please do read the Vertical

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.080
Food Blog posts on this subject.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.120
I'm going to go into a lot of detail for you
there and I don't want you to go out and just

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.440
dump a whole bunch of potassium sulfate in
your system and see something crazy happen

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.520
because you didn't know what you're doing.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.250
Please do check out the blog and I'm going
to go into as much detail as possible to make

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.710
this really easy for you.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.590
