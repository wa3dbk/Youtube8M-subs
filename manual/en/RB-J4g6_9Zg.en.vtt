John: Hi guys, John, here with RealTruck.com.
Today I'm going to show you

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.070
how to install the Recon LED Smoked Tail Lights
onto our Ram project truck.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.650
What we need to install these tail lights
is a T20 torqued bit. You can

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.339
either use it in a regular screwdriver style
or in a drill style. I like

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.829
the drill because it's quicker, faster, and
easier to get it done. Let's

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.140
get started on this!

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.700
This is a pretty simple three-step process
to get these new tail lights in.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.500
The first thing we're going to do is we're
going to take our T20 bit and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.870
we're going to take these screws out. There
is one down here and another

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.260
one right here. These factory tail lights,
along with our new Recon tail

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.260
lights, have these plug-typed styles here
that are actually sliders. There

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.300
is a slider that's attached to the body of
the truck that these just slide

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.350
in over.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.079
So when you go to pull this out, you want
to kind of pull it straight

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.850
forward. Just kind of pull it out and get
our fingers in behind it, then

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.810
put your fingers in on this side of it and
just give it a little tug. Once

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.030
you get it loose, do the same thing down on
the bottom and just pull it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.820
straight out. You can see here where those
slider points are for those.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.280
Once that's out, we just need to get this
thing unplugged.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.700
Our factory lights have this little clip mechanism
in here that just holds

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.549
this wiring in place. What we're going to
do is we're just going to take a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.810
little screwdriver and get up underneath that.
You just got to get that up

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.810
and then give her a little slide. Once that's
out and out of the way, then

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.390
you have another one of these safety pins
in here. Then just push down on

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.350
your lock there and you can pull that right
loose.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.060
I'll take these out. Our old light is out.
Now what we're going to do is

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.130
we're going to go ahead and remove these because
our new light comes with

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.260
new ones. Just take your pliers and kind of
grab behind them. Just pop

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.520
them out of there and toss these in the trash.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.480
What we're going to do is we're going to leave
our new ones in the slots.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.650
When we put the light in, we'll just press
them in so that way we don't

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.000
loosen this up because we want to keep a good
tight fit on here. It keeps

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.599
our light in there tighter and looks nicer.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.569
I'm going to go ahead and start hooking our
new one in. Our reverse light,

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.560
I'm going to go ahead and put it in here.
The next thing we want to do is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.560
go ahead and take this tan or brownish colored
wire and connect it up to

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.650
our new light wiring. Once we've got that
hooked up, then we can go ahead

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.650
and reconnect our main wire here.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.010
You'll notice the difference between this
light and the factory light is

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.660
that there is no clip for this. So what we're
going to do is we're just

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.360
going to tuck it up into the body of the truck
here. Once we've got that

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.000
ready to go, we can go ahead and get our light
lined up. Just line those

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.370
up. Give them a little pop, and there we've
got it.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.030
The next thing to do is go ahead and put our
torque screws back on the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.030
inside to hold this light in. That's how easy
it is to install our Recon

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.190
LED Tail Light. So what we're going to do
then is we're going to go ahead

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.159
and move over to the other side, put that
one in, and then we'll take a

00:03:53.159 --> 00:04:00.159
look at this whole thing and see how 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.750
it looks.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.900
Okay, guys. We've got those tail lights in
this truck so I'm going to go

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.060
ahead and turn this thing on so we can take
a look and see what they look

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.060
like. That completes our install of the Smoked
LED Tail Lights from Recon.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.470
So until next time, happy motoring!
