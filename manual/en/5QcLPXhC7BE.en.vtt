The great part about tofu is how versatile
it is and how it really picks up the flavor

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.150
of anything you are cooking. Its also got
a lot of protein, it's a fantastic source

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:24.119
of mono saturated fats and a really good complete
protein. It's also really good to cook with,

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:35.050
so I buy
refrigerated tofu and any refrigerated case

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:47.460
in any store, you want to drain out all the
water that it's packaged with. I used packaged

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.960
tofu that isn't refrigerated before and it
really just doesn't quick cook as well. So

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.510
now we have a nice brick of tofu, the medium
firm to firm will stay nice and solid when

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.700
you cook with it. If you use soft tofu, it's
going to fall apart, although soft tofu is

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.391
great for lasagna, soups, and smoothies. Go
head and slice the block right in half and

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:29.209
then you want to cut cubes that are about
half of inch thick and because its been stored

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:35.810
in water for so long, its still got a lot
of water so we're going to press it to help

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.479
it dry out a little bit, that way it'll absorb
our yummy spicy salty vegetable broth really

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.399
well. So we'll set it on a plate cubed like
this and you see its got nice cubes just like

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:00.639
that. I'm going to put a paper towel over
it and set another plate on top of it. That

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:08.650
will help absorb some of the water while we
prepare the rest of the stir fry. And this

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.780
should make enough for either 4 people or
2 really, really hungry people with little

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.560
bit of left overs.
