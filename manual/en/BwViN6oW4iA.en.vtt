Hey YouTube, welcome to my guide to buying wigs on eBay.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.960
A lot of people ask me where I buy my wigs from and, the majority of my wigs are from eBay.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.400
But when I tell people that they seem lost and, frankly, if you don't know eBay it can be a little overwhelming

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.130
So, I'm ganna break this down for you guys and share with you what I know

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.630
from purchasing wigs on eBay, my tips, and my guide.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.100
First of all, let me give you a list guaranteed good
quality wigs stores

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.249
There's Lucaille,  there's Arda Wigs, and there's Epic Cosplay.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.800
And next, here's a list of guaranteed good quality wig stores on eBay

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.220
Moemall, Cosplay Wig, and Wig Fashion.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.300
ALL LINKS BELOW

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.340
I know that these are good quality wig so, what's the problem?

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.200
The problem is that they're a little bit pricey. You are paying for the quality but,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.700
maybe you're on a budget and, if so eBay is the better place

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.320
to get a bargain. So, first thing you
wanna look at when purchasing a wig on eBay is

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.120
the price. An okay or good quality wig

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.789
will run from 16-20 for a short wig and,

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.330
then 20-40 for a long wig and, then there are character

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.229
specific wigs  that might cost a little
bit more.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.250
For example, Stocking from Panty &amp; Stocking

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.580
Not only is it a long wig but,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.830
it's very, very character specific so
it's pretty much

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.470
only made for Stocking.Although I'm not saying you can't wear it

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.000
for other things but, it's mostly made for that character.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.220
Some wigs will be listed as low as 5 or 8 dollars

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.000
but, I wouldn't trust these wigs. They're probably ganna be

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.770
Party City or Halloween store quality wigs.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.280
Which means that they'll tangle, they'll be shiny,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.880
they'll be thin. More likely than not you're ganna have some sort of problem with these wigs.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.460
When looking at prices just take into consideration that you're ganna get

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.740
what you pay for

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.369
The next thing you can look at when browsing for a wig is the stock photos.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.740
A lot of sellers will reuse stock photos and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.220
some people even steal photos from good
quality wig sellers.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.360
Here are some popular ones that you might come across while looking.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.250
I'm not saying that if someone uses

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.720
one of these photos that they're gonna
be a bad seller but you need to look out.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.360
Someone can use a nice stock photo, sell a wig for $8

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.320
and, then you're ganna get just that. An $8 wig.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.960
Sellers use this strategy to misrepresent what they're actually selling to you.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.460
But what you can do to avoid this is to

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.420
look for more photos, scroll down, check the description.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.700
Look for photos of the actual wig itself not of

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.600
a model in a nice styled, cut wig.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.560
So, after all of  that maybe you're still unsure on what wig

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.730
to get. Well you can always look at the
sellers ratings and, see what other people

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.520
are saying

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.780
in the feedback. Lastly I'm ganna tell you guys how to actually

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.620
search for a wig on eBay. Start by typing something short and generic

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.480
in the search engine. For example, "brown wig" or "white wig"

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.240
And then I like searching under the option "Buy It Now"

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.650
because then there's no hassle with

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.000
auctions and bidding, which you can do
get an even cheaper

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.080
price  but, this is an easier option.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.380
and then next to that there's a little
drop down box where you can select

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.020
Sort by "Shipping + Price: Lowest To Highest"

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.780
So, the cheapest items will show up first.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.910
On the side of the page you can search by "Length, Style, Color, Etc."

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.800
Use these filters to help you select a wig.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.700
Something I definitely recommend for you to select is

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.390
free shipping under the shipping option.
Sellers will list a product

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.320
for really cheap and then you think you're getting a deal but, when you click on the item

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.300
shipping turns out to be $30.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.680
It's not a deal, it's not what you wanna pay, this is another strategy that people use to get your money.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.350
Let me just say that, eBay can be really hit or miss.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.150
Before you buy anything my best advice is to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.630
be smart use your judgement.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.860
