00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.900
[children singing]

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.133
Mrs. Obama:
Twas the night
before Christmas,

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.500
when all through the house

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.200
Not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.667
You know this one, Santa, right?

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.633
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:23.333
In hopes that St. Nicholas
soon would be there.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.266
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:31.266
While visions of sugar-plums
danced in their heads.

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.667
Has anybody had any sugar-plums
dancing in their heads?

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.767
Me neither.

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.800
I wonder where
they got that from.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.433
And mamma in her 'kerchief,
and I in my cap,

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:46.500
had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.934
[baby cries]

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:49.800
Oh, Mom!

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.700
Help me!

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.333
Oh, no.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.567
Oh, goodness.

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:57.266
All right, this is
"The Night Before Christmas."

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.333
How many people like
the night before Christmas?

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.734
Christmas Eve.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.367
It's exciting, isn't it?

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.967
When out on the lawn there
arose such a clatter,

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:09.100
I sprang from the bed to
see what was the matter.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.700
Away to the window
I flew like a flash,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.400
Tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.667
What do you think was
going on out there?

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.900
Any guesses?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.433
Well, let's find out.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.100
The moon on the breast
of the new-fallen snow

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.300
Gave the lustre of mid-day
to objects below.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.433
When, what to my wondering
eyes should appear,

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:37.834
But a miniature sleigh,
and eight tiny reindeer.

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:39.900
Is that you, Santa?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.133
Oh, it's Santa.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.367
With a little old driver,
so lively and quick,

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:50.133
I knew in a moment
it must be -- who?

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.166
Audience:
St. Nick.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:51.967
Mrs. Obama:
St. Nick.

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:52.867
Audience Member:
Santa!

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:53.900
Mrs. Obama:
Or Santa.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.033
That's another name.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:56.467
That's true.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:59.200
More rapid than eagles
his coursers they came,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.333
And he whistled, and shouted,
and called them by name!

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.033
Do you guys know
the reindeers' names?

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.266
Audience Member:
Rudolph!

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.900
Mrs. Obama:
There is Rudolph.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.133
But he, for some reason,
isn't in this story.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:16.633
"Now Dasher! now, Dancer!
now, Prancer and Vixen!

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:23.633
On, Comet! On, Cupid!
on, Donner and Blitzen!

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:28.066
Here they are,
the mighty reindeer.

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:30.967
Where did you find
these reindeer, Santa?

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.400
The best of the best.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.700
To the top of the porch!

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.800
to the top of the wall!

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.133
Now dash away! Dash away!

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.900
Dash away all!"

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.467
As dry leaves that before
the wild hurricane fly,

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:47.934
When they meet with an
obstacle, mount to the sky.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:51.900
These reindeer are awesome.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.266
So up to the house-top
the coursers they flew,

00:02:55.266 --> 00:03:00.800
With the sleigh full of
Toys, and St. Nicholas too.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.834
How many people
have ever seen Santa

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:05.500
delivering toys on Christmas?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.700
You've seen him?

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.600
Oh, Santa, you're slippin'.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.533
[laughter]

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:15.800
And then, in a twinkling,
I heard on the roof

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.934
The prancing and pawing
of each little hoof.

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:22.200
As I drew in my head,
and was turning around,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.834
Down the chimney
St. Nicholas came with a bound.

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:31.467
He was dressed all in fur,
from his head to his toe,

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:35.700
And his clothes were all
tarnished with ashes and soot.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.834
It was really his foot.

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:40.166
I messed up that one.

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:42.667
A bundle of Toys
he flung on his back,

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:46.367
And he looked like a peddler,
just opening his sack.

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:48.400
His eyes-how they twinkled!

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.867
His dimples how merry!

00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:58.000
His cheeks were like roses,
his nose like a cherry!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
His droll little mouth
was drawn up like a bow,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.600
And the beard of his chin
was as white as the snow.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.767
See, Santa, do you agree?

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:13.700
Good-looking guy.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.233
The stump of a pipe
he held tight in his teeth,

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:19.800
And the smoke it encircled
his head like a wreath.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.433
He had a broad face
and a little round belly,

00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:29.734
That shook when he laughed,
like a bowlful of jelly!

00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:30.800
Come on, Santa.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.934
Mr. Claus:
Ho-ho-ho!

00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:33.100
Mrs. Obama:
There we go.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.834
Very good, very good, that's it.

00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:37.500
He was chubby and plump,
a right jolly old elf,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.567
And I laughed when I saw
him, in spite of myself!

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:42.800
A wink of his eye and
a twist of his head,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.333
Soon gave me to know
I had nothing to dread.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:49.467
That means you never have to be
afraid of Santa Claus, right?

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:50.734
Never, ever.

00:04:50.734 --> 00:04:52.934
Santa's all good.

00:04:52.934 --> 00:04:55.533
He spoke not a word,
but went straight to his work,

00:04:55.533 --> 00:05:02.333
And filled all the stockings,
then turned with a jerk.

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:05.166
And laying his finger
aside of his nose,

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:09.233
And giving a nod,
up the chimney he rose!

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:12.000
He sprang to his sleigh,
to his team gave a whistle,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.300
And away they all flew
like the down of a thistle.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.734
But I heard him exclaim,
as he drove out of sight --

00:05:20.734 --> 00:05:22.533
What did he say?

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:28.734
"Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night!"

00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:32.633
That means on Christmas Eve
you're supposed to go to bed.

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:35.100
[laughter]

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.567
You're not supposed to stay
up late on Christmas Eve.

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:39.233
Go to bed!

00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:41.266
That's the message from
Santa Claus, right?

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:42.433
Parents?

00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:43.433
Audience: Yeah.

00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:45.367
Mrs. Obama:
Go to bed.

00:05:45.367 --> 00:05:46.400
All right.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.033
Here, this is --
Oh, I'm sorry, Bo.

00:05:48.033 --> 00:05:49.166
Not yet.

00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:51.000
You can sit.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.967
- What a great story.

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:55.800
Mrs. Obama, thank you.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.934
[applause]
