Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:18.939
This is Stephanie Manley, with Copykat.com.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.449
Today, I'm going
to show you how to bake potato pancakes [inaudible

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.849
00:25] either way.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.031
They're delicious, and they have a few ingredients
in them.

00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:30.031
We're going to
use potatoes, egg, a little bit of flour,

00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:31.031
and onion.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:36.190
We're going to season
it with a little bit of salt and pepper.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.860
Now, the first thing you need to
do is go ahead and peel your potatoes.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.040
This recipe will make about.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.740
This
recipe requires about two pounds of potatoes.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.350
I like to shred them into a
bowl of water.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.350
This will help to keep the potatoes from oxidizing.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.940
Nobody
really likes blue or black potato pancakes,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.900
for some reason.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200
Dark colored
food like that is not often appealing.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.000
So, this will also get the starch
out.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.710
It helps make them nice and crisp.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:28.050
So, let me go ahead and grate this
up, and I'll show you what to do next.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.320
OK.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.110
Now that I have my potato in there, I'm going
to go ahead and grate my

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:44.600
onion and put about half of this onion in
here as well.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:54.659
If you just grate
your onion in, it means you can save a little

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.260
bit of time, which you're not
actually chopping an onion.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.010
It actually shreds up very nicely in here,
so

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.689
it's really my preference for making potato
pancakes, to go ahead and shred

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.690
the onion.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.349
So, the next thing I'm going to do is go ahead
and put my flour

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:22.610
and egg in a bowl here, and get those mixed
together.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:44.230
I'm going to season this up with fresh black
cracked pepper and salt.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.510
. Now
that I have my potatoes all squeezed out and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.959
ringed out really, really
well, I'm going to just go ahead and blend

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.110
this mixture together.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.370
Then,
we're going to take these over to the stove

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.959
top and start cooking these
potato pancakes.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:05.739
So in my pan, I have a little bit of peanut
oil.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.489
You could
use a little bit of duck fat, a little bit

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.460
of chicken fat, or butter.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.680
Any
of these are going to work really well.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.270
So, the next thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to take a little bit of this

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.710
mixture and just kind of spoon it
out in the pan.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:31.190
I'm going to pat it kind of thin, and we're
going to let it

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.190
brown.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.379
