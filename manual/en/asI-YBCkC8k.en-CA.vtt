00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.800
May, June, July, 2014 Queen Street East Track
Construction Closures Video

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.300
Brad Ross: Hi I'm Brad Ross, Head of Corporate
Communications for the TTC and with me here

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.690
is Andy Byford, the CEO of the TTC and we're
at the corner of Queen Street East and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.099
Leslie Street to talk about a major closure that
will be happening starting on May the 11

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.310
until June 21. Andy, what exactly is 
going to be happening here?

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.349
Andy Byford: Okay, so this work is part of
the overall project to introduce our new streetcars,

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.390
what we're doing specifically is constructing
a connection track between Queen and Leslie,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.399
down Leslie Street to our new streetcar facility
at the Leslie Barns, so it's a big piece

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.000
of work. It also involves not just laying
new track, we're replacing an 80 year old

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.500
watermain, so it's work that would have had to be 
done anyway so we're doing it in conjunction with

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.600
Toronto Water, it makes sense to be doing it all now and 
get the disruption over and done with in one piece.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.100
Brad Ross: And because this work is so major 
and it does require the closure of this intersection

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.900
to all traffic, including streetcars, and that 
will of course have an impact on our service.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.700
What does the diversion then for the 
501 Queen look like? - let's start with 501.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.400
Andy Byford: Okay for the 501, from the east
the streetcar will divert up Queen, go up Coxwell,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.100
along Gerrard and down Broadview.
Now that will add about 12 minutes to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.210
the overall running time so our message to our
customers is, please do take that into account,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.500
we do have to divert around this work for
the duration of the closure.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.100
Brad Ross: And then for the 502, 503 and for
the community in general there will be

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.300
a bus replacement service that 
will look like what exactly?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Andy Byford: Okay, so the bus service has
a slightly different route. It will go up Greenwood,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.700
along Dundas and then down Jones,
so it is a shorter diversion so the actual

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.280
overall journey time will be slightly less.
Now we are adding extra buses so we will

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.310
have a high frequency service.
Brad Ross: We're also adding, I should mention,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.450
increased service to the 83 Jones, the 72
Pape and the 31 Greenwood to get anybody who

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.600
wants to take the subway, up to the line 2
of the Bloor-Danforth line and that will be

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.320
added service as well. Andy finally before
we move down to Queen and Victoria to talk

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.170
about the closure there, businesses are open
in this area, pedestrian access and cycling

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.210
access will be maintained. Can we just talk
a little bit about what we've been doing

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.590
to aid businesses throughout 
this construction process.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.360
Andy Byford: Sure, well in many ways this
video is part of that, we've opened a community

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.200
office that's been open for some time to
keep local businesses and the local community

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.580
involved and understanding what we're actually
doing here. The key point to stress is, the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.190
local businesses are open, please do use them,
we will do our very best to minimize the disruption

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.800
that this type of work inevitably brings.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.970
Brad Ross: Absolutely Andy, thank you very
much. Weíre now going to head over to Queen

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.200
and Victoria to talk about a closure there
that will also begin on May the 11.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.000
Brad Ross: Okay Andy we're here at the corner
of Queen Street East and Victoria Street

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.200
to talk about a closure from May 11 to May 31.
Not as long as the Queen/Leslie closure, but

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.800
still a significant closure here at the intersection.
What are we doing exactly?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.200
Andy Byford: Okay, well this is an essential
part of our state of good repair program.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.700
Anyone using the 501 streetcar knows that
through this intersection the streetcar has to

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.140
slow right down and that's because of
the state of the concrete and the track, it's

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.150
basically worn out. So we will be replacing
the whole intersection during that closure

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.200
that you've just talked about.
Brad Ross: Alright Andy, so this closure of

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.400
this intersection will necessitate a diversion
of the 501 Queen, what will that look like?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.080
Andy Byford: Okay, so the 501 will divert
off Queen, it will go south on Church, along

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.650
King and then north up Spadina before returning
to Queen Street on its normal route.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.060
Brad Ross: And then Andy the bus replacement
heading west, what will that look like?

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.700
Andy Byford: That will divert via Church and
Richmond, going back east will be via Adelaide and Jarvis.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.800
Brad Ross: Okay Andy, thank you very much. 
We're now going to head over to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.000
Queen Street East and Broadview Avenue for 
a closure that will begin June 30.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.800
Brad Ross: And finally Andy we're here 
at the corner of Queen Street East

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.300
and Broadview Avenue where 
from June 30 until July 25

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.900
we'll be closing this intersection to be doing 
some significant track work.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.000
What exactly will we be doing?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.300
Andy Byford: Okay, so this is one of our busiest intersections,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.090
these switches and the track are heavily 
used, they are very intensively

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.900
worked throughout the day. So what we will
be undertaking is complete replacement of

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.289
the track and switches to maintain them in
a state of good repair and to keep them reliable

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.800
for many years to come.
Brad Ross: And of course the closure of this

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.100
intersection means that we need to divert.
So let's start with the 501 Queen streetcar,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.080
what will that diversion look like 
then on Queen?

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.870
Andy Byford: Okay so the diversion will come
off Queen, up Coxwell, along Gerrard and then

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.639
down Parliament.
Brad Ross: And then for the 502 and the 503

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.099
and the bus replacement we will have on Queen,
that will look like what exactly?

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.610
Andy Byford: The bus replacement service will
run via Carlaw, Dundas, River, to downtown.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.509
Brad Ross: And finally the 504 King will also
be on diversion.

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.610
Andy Byford: That's right. It will divert
up Parliament, along Dundas and then, ultimately,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.590
to Broadview Station.
Brad Ross: And finally Andy we are going to

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.259
take advantage of the opportunity that this
construction affords us to replace some rail

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.490
in the area, while maintaining 
an open traffic link.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.700
Andy Byford: That's right. We've done an
inspection of all track condition in the local area,

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.300
and there's a few local spots that
the rail just needs to be replaced.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.300
So my view is let's just get it all done at once,
let's only impact the community once,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.300
but on that point of community impact, the streets
will remain open so cars, bikes, they will

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.009
still be able to get through, the roads will
still be open, and critically the fabulous

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.999
shops, the local community, the local businesses
will still be open. Itís a very vibrant area,

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:38.900
there's great restaurants, great businesses,
do still please come and use them,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.939
they're open for business.
Brad Ross: Indeed Andy, thank you very much,

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.060
and thank you very much for watching. For
more information on all these closures please
