00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.200
Yeah and H2K it's a team you gotta watch out for

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Their SMGs are strong

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.800
Their Scope is incredibly strong

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.000
And the AKs are...

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.500
Just as good!

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Yeah just as good and they fill in the gap.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.500
JanzwE is pushing further forward

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
He has a good collection of frags awaiting there if he plays this correctly

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
Finds kaTana, goes look for the second

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.500
And he gets it! Janzwe going huge. Lovely plus ten!

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.000
And now only comedykk stands and there is no laughing matter anymore

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
As H2K get themselves in the lead, very early on.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.500
Jokes aside, Anexis had a cracking tournament!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.400
But there was one team that went one step further

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Coming all the way from Finland, H2K gaming!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.900
Going to switch between Ono and replan

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.500
As replan catches the eye of one

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.500
Janzwe drops froz

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
Now back on to Ono as janzwe gets himself the frag on mySn

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.400
We're running out of My Insanity players here

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.000
Janzwe just killing them all!

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Oh peace out!

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Oh my god Mats!

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.200
Oh the humiliation!

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.900
Jan " Paradox " Duchon, you organized it

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.900
So it's only your privilege to announce the MVP (Most Valuable Player)

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.000
Jan, who's the man who impressed you the most this weekend?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.300
We've made the decision that the MVP of this tournament will be JanzwE from H2K.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.000
JanzwE from H2K

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The MVP (Most Valuable Player) of the tournament

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Where is he?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Janzwe, you won...

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.900
MVP...

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.000
He looks a little surprised, a little shocked
