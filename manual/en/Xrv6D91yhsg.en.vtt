Hi my name is Connie and we're here at Hearts
Adaptive Riding Center in Santa Barbara, California

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.139
and I'm here for Expert Village. This is our
next class, that we're going to have right

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.290
here at Hearts. This is Christine. Yes, Christine
can you wave to the camera over there. Good.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.170
And this is Kristen and Kristen is hearing
impaired. And her mom is actually signing

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.289
to her so she's can wave. Thank you. And Elias
come over here. And this is Elias. He's our

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.410
third rider in this class, can you wave to
the camera. She's going to take your picture

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.540
today. Okay? Okay, what we're doing, we're
showing some mounting of some disabled riders

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.120
here at Hearts Adaptive Riding Therapeutic
Riding Center. The leader just brought in

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.300
Buddy the horse, and she's going to get him
still. The instructor has already checked

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.810
the saddle to make sure it's tight, cinch
is tight, we don't want the saddle to slip.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.130
As you can see the rider is getting on, trying
to pull herself up as much as possible. We're

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:12.270
using a ramp here, it's easier for especially
the smaller riders to not have to step up

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:26.049
so high from the ground. The ramp is right
there and they can just swing their leg over

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.049
and sit normally and then they walk straight
off the ramp towards the arena. Elias is about

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.799
to get on Rosa. Elias is a child with autism.
He's been riding here a short time, but he's

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.020
on a very quiet, calm horse. You see how he
tries to get on too quickly and Christine

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.020
is holding him back. She's trying to tell
him the sequence of events so he goes nice

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.020
and slow. Otherwise he might be really impulsive
and jump onto the horse too quick. Now it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.509
could be dangerous if the horse is flighty
at all. But this way, he learns to be patient

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.670
and he's listening to instructions. She's
giving him a lot of positive reinforcement

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.859
because he listened to her and slowed himself
down before he impulsively got on. Lots of

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.810
things can happened when the horse gets in
a confined space. That's why the horses have

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.279
to be very well trained and sensitized, desensitized
to everything that goes on around them, so

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:02.729
they stand quite still and will be patient
while the rider takes their time getting on.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.700
Sometimes, the riders will actually kick them
as they swing their leg around, or kick them

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.710
if they, or jerk on them. And all the horses
have to be pretty much able to deal with anything

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.210
like that.
