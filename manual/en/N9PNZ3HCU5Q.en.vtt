Hi, I'm Brigitte.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.210
This is Slope Style. I'm with Jill who is joining me from Burton.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.240
Today we're going to talk about the Mens Poacher Shell Pant.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.310
I gotta say, Jill, I love this pant just because

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.320
you don't have the logo in your face. It's kind of a little

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.350
subtle.
Yes, very low-key. There's an embroidered tonal logo

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.390
at the front zippered pocket as well as on the back flap pocket.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.490
Very low-key
So, what about, I think, first and foremost,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.540
what's the fit of this pant?
This is a Sig Fit pant. Our signature

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.580
fit. Just our classic fit. Allows room for layering

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.600
underneath. Not restricting at all.
That's good and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.620
I think the biggest thing about this pant is the value.
Yes.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.660
And it's also a shell pant. So, what's some of the benefits

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.680
of having a shell versus an insulated?
Shell's a great pant

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.720
to go with because it allows a lot of versatility as far as

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.770
lots of different riding conditions. You can wear it in warmer weather, you can layer up

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.790
if you want to go out on a really cold day and it allows for a lot of mobility

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.840
as well. You can kind of pick-and-choose how you would like to wear it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.860
so it's a really good, all-around pant.
What about the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.930
waterproofing and breathability of this pant?
This pant actually does have a 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.960
10,000mm waterproof rating which is great considering

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.990
it's a really great pant and good value and you get a lot of features at this price

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.020
point.
Is there any features you can point out for us?
Yeah, this pant does

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.060
have an internal waist adjustment along with a microfleece

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.090
waistband. It does have the inner thigh vents

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.100
as well. Also, still

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.130
does have the zippered pocket on the side and then one side you do have the cargo pockets

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.150
so you're not without room to put all your goodies on the hill.
Okay.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.200
What about at the bottom? Does it have any features at the bottom?

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.220
Yeah, in the bottom we have, um, this is our parking lot snap

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.250
so you reach underneath and snap up so you don't trash the back of your pants

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.270
in the parking lot. You have what we call ghetto slits down here for

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.310
a little bit more room and then we also have

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.340
underneath, we have the boot gaiters as well.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.350
And this is a mesh-lined pant so it does have a lining in it.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.370
It's not insulated but it does have a lining.
So, it's pretty comfortable too.
Yep.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.420
Great. Well, that's the Poacher Mens Shell Pant from Burton.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.450
This is Slope Style and thanks for watching.
