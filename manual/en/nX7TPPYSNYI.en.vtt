burke pickup truck florida authorities
are saying that a thirty year old woman

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.749
has uh... sold the baby boy

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.549
for nineteen ninety nine dodge dakota
truck in kentucky

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.680
and then flood to florida it's not even
that most of the truck loads

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.279
now let me know thirty miles right what
well i don't know but why do we have a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.340
picture of a honda ridgeline how is that
the best

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.069
picture to go along with the story

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.349
good question i did not so i did not put
the pictures for this i feel like

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.040
genocide is a little bit rusty

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.770
coming back from vacation

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.120
widest it just about the general idea
the penetrates more like a concept that

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.960
we should have had a picture of the
woman had a rand kaminski who was

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.690
arrested a couple weeks ago

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.360
at a wind dixie supermarket and she's
been extradited back to kentucky both or

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.280
teaser saying that she sold the baby
shortly after his birth in january

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.379
and uh...

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.730
that he did say that the couple accused
of of trading their truck for the baby

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.880
jeremy and jamie brown of laurel
kentucky have also been arrested for

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.320
human trafficking what we are here

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.940
selling your baby for a truck

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.870
or or trading your truck for a baby and
i understand which of these people

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.610
aboard is there

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.380
uh...

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170
to be perfectly honest

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.800
worry no about that the people who

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.690
actually took the baby maybe you're
trying to help it because apparently

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.660
uh... without anyone willing to sell a
baby is not going to be good for that

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.600
baby lets let's take it in ourselves
yeah

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.410
poke at this and i did

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.710
kaminski sold the truck after obtaining
exchange for her baby

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.860
for eight hundred dollars and from that

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.520
if these people uh...

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.369
if that's what they're trying to do he'd
also assume that they'd be intelligent

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.710
enough just to call the police and have
uh...

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.920
ito cpsc care todavia draco they did
that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.550
anything you know what what and the
question is his methods involved in this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.079
if you'll need a lot of drugs

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.180
there's something like this go away but
think about that the people say a lot of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.070
the problems related to drugs go away if
you legalize drugs and i agree that some

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.340
of them do

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.479
is this type of situation something that
would anyway improve if math for legal

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.949
but think about that this was still
happen

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.579
well i mean

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.510
if you think that by legalizing math

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.039
people aren't going to be addicted to
matt enacting away that we know addicts

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.809
it's going to happen

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.059
it would have to be that one p when math
is made legal

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.430
than people are no longer driven to do
things like this because of it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.010
and i don't see why that would happen
uh... i don't see the connection that

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.939
there will still be addicts there was
still be disturbed behavior

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.790
uh... louis actually once traded about
what was it we durables in amman groups

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.689
for a skateboard when we were in high
school that's the only time you traded

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.770
