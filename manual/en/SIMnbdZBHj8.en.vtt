Hello, welcome to MAXreportage for the new 310 PS AUDI TTS test drive on Ascari track 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It’s a quick test cause I need also write a paper and make pictures for the october issue of AUTOMOTO magazine.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
look at the special sport seats for the S model.  

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But the real revolution is the dashboard.  

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We can choose a lot of different view

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It’s amazing when you put the map 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here we can find some wonderful ventilation grid

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and quality is always perfect in a Audi

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
here the engine with a big turbocharger  

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the exhaust line and the haldex transmission connected with the help of ESP to be faster 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.300
here we go on Ascari track

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.300
a wonderful track

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Let’s go !

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
310 PS…it is not bad. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
with a quattro it’s easy but it takes roll

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It’s not really a track car. Not a TTRS !

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.000
We’ve got the S tronic gearbox

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that gearbox is enough fast

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
we can heard the exhaust when we change a gear. It’s funny!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The TT is much stable than sharp  

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the balance looks like a front wheel drive even if we have a quattro. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
a traction spirit in fact !

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and now I invite you to read AutoMoto Magazine in October with my paper and video about the access model of new TT

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
with only front wheel drive. And lower price. Not bad !

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
see you to MAXreportage…and AutoMoto of course !
