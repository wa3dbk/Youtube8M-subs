Welcome to Expert Village. This is Kim Brown.
In this segment, I want to talk about caring

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.110
for the skin before and after the wedding
day. It is very important to get facials ahead

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.820
of time to make sure that your skin has an
even palette, that you don’t have too many

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.240
dry spots or blemishes. You want to have the
perfect skin on your wedding day and that

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.360
is something that I would recommend to keep
up after the wedding day also, but you know

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.390
that day you are going to have spend a lot
of money on photographs, so you want to have

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.420
the best skin possible for that particular
day. Masks are great. If you go in to get

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.070
a facial then you are also going to need at
home care, so you want to pick a product that

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.409
is best for you. There are products for acne
skin, products for sensitive skin and depending

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.699
on your age, there are different products
for that. If you have redness to your skin,

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:01.760
you always want to have a cleanser, have a
mask or scrub that you use or both. A scrub

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.210
can be used 2-3 times a week and a mask could
be used once a week. Then you want to have

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.259
really good moisturizer; you just want to
have a day moisturizer and a nighttime moisturizer.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.030
After you cleanse, you always want to tone.
A lot of toners come in sprays which are really

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.469
nice; that way you get a nice spray all over
and you don’t have to use the cotton ball.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:32.880
When you are using permanent makeup like the
permanent lipsticks and they now have permanent

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.990
eye shadows and then waterproof mascara, you
are going to want to use make up remover and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.560
these can be a little bit oily, but you just
put them on a cotton ball, work it around

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.899
your eye and your lip area and then you will
use your cleanser and that will remove all

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.109
the residue. So after you have done that and
you have cleansed and you have toned, then

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.119
you want to have your moisturizer and your
treatments. Your aesthetician can help you

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.539
with that picking out the best one for your
skin type but it is just I can’t stress

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.049
how important it is to take really good care
of your skin so that on that day you look

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.790
your most beautiful. For more information
