Hi! My name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
expertvillage.com. In this clip we are going

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.919
to talk about the proper way to remove your
vehicle's serpentine belt. On any vehicle

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:17.330
that has a serpentine style belt, it is going
to have on it what is called an automatic

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.810
tensioner or a surf belt tensioner. In order
to figure it out how it works for the particular

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.810
vehicle you are working on, you are going
to want to refer to the pulley and belt configuration

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.810
diagram. That is this large picture here.
What this is is a snapshot out of your engine.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.810
It is going to list the various components
on the vehicle that is driven by the belt.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.630
In order to figure our how it works for the
particular vehicle you are working on, you

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.259
are going to want to refer to the pulling
and belt configuration diagram. That is this

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.020
large picture here. What this is, is a snapshot
picture of the front of your engine. It is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.851
going to list the various components on the
vehicle that are driven by the belt. It is

00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:47.370
also going to have a picture of the belt tensioner
and a description of how it operates. The

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.460
belt tensioner is a spring loaded device that
holds the belt automatically tight for the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.930
given load on it. The belt needs to be a little
tighter if you are running the AC and it can

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:14.590
operate a little looser if you are not. There
will be a description on the belt or on the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.250
diagram of how the tensioner operates. On
this particular vehicle, it rotates clockwise

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.770
to remove the tension. This is your belt tensioner
here. It is going to rotate down this way

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.899
clockwise. That will free up some slack in
the belt and allow us to slip it off the alternator

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.780
pulley. You want to be careful because once
the belt is off, it is going to spring load

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.689
to the automatic fully tight position. You
just want to be careful to avoid busting your

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.180
knuckles or getting your ratchet stuck. Most
of the time it will indicate by this square

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.340
what kind of drive will fit for your particular
vehicle. This Ford Truck happens to be a half-inch

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.369
drive socket driver. If you can see, I will
slide it into the picture for you. That is

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.760
your half inch drive. That square is going
to fit directly into that square there. Some

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.750
of them may be a nut, some of them may be
a 3/8's drive. What you want to do is refer

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.300
to this pulley configuration chart to determine
the proper way to remove your serpentine belt.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.690
Like I said they vary widely from vehicle
to vehicle, locations are sometimes easy and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.500
sometimes very difficult. Once you locate
where the operating lug is for your serpentine

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.590
belt tensioner, I happen to be underneath
the truck right now with my ratchet installed

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.430
in the lug. You are going to want to push
it in until it bottoms down and rotated in

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.820
the proper. Our pulley configuration chart
said we are going to rotate kind of counter

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.810
clock wise so we are going to go ahead and
as you can see the belt will get looser as

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.370
I rotate. Once we've got it rotated, just
pretty much pick a point and flip the belt

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:20.900
off of it and there we go. The belt is now
removed so we can get it off our alternator

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.420
pulley. As you can see once we've released
the tension on our serpentine belt tensioner

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.980
and slipped it off a pulley, we were able
to then remove it from our alternator. Now

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.170
this procedure is going to vary widely from
even gift make or given model.. Some are very

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.810
easy and some are very tough. You are going
to want to keep the belt in kind of the same

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.530
shape that was kind of the same general routing.
If you pull the belt all the way off, you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.230
are going to have to refer back to your configuration
chart for the proper installation. If you

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.290
are only going to want to slip it off, the
necessary pullies.
