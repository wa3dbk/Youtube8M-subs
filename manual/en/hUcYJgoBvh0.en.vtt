00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.870
AronRa's long boring speech discussed a strange
phenomena that occurred during his deconversion

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.620
that many I have heard mirrored along with
myself. There seems to be a tendency to lean

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.720
toward mysticism and magic or the occult when
the realization comes that religion isn't

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.250
real. It seems to be like a stopping point
or halfway house for a lot of recovering believers.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.570
I am guessing the majority of this phenomena
is caused by the fact that we are taught to

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.050
believe things without critical thinking and
evidence. We are not taught how the the scientific

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.319
process works so we doubt its claims, we also
want there to be something more magical that

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.109
this crappy existence seems to offer because
we've told for so long that life is horrible

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.670
compared to heaven, and we are still addicted
to the idea of knowing secret knowledge and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.019
power that dedicated scientists are too blind
with their need for evidence to see the truth.

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.090
That was my reason for it at least if you
had others let me know what they are.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.050
Nykytyne2 seemed to shudder at the idea of
this happening to the world as he seems to

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.870
see it as occurring to replace religion and
finds it vile because without a god to make

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.470
them do good things, they seem to be ridiculously
self-centered and follow a blind faith in

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.460
whatever mystical fad they are in at the time,
which can be very flexible morally depending

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.200
on what the person feels like doing at the
time. He raises some very good points but

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.180
I have a feeling this is going to have to
be a necessary growing pain if we are to become

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.350
a skeptical species. These people for the
first time at least tend to have more fear

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.119
of the law and consequences than they do of
their god which is a major step. Materialism

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.340
is a major problem but they seem to have inherited
that for this last generation of spend and

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.039
borrow Christians. When it comes to giving
to charity I am ashamed to say it but I am

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.869
horrible at giving to charity. I kind of destroyed
my mental construct for being charitable because

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.130
I was saving up for a big project that I thought
was going to generate a lot of money for charity.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.460
That and the economy feel through and I had
to work to barley keep my nose above water.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.409
Now that I'm more settle I and the rest of
the skeptical community should probably try

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.570
to figure a meme construct along the lines
of tithing but doing it out of kindness and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.950
not from out of guilt so you can give it to
some religious order.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.170
The problem with humanity is that it was never
given a handbook or any guidance when it emerged

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.540
as a species. The human race is sort of a
lord of the flies experiment which only we

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.800
the later decedents can look back at the data
and learn from. I feel like religion was humanity's

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.700
childhood when it needed a parental figure
to scare it into doing things. That parent

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.990
tended to reflect the parents they had which
tended to be abusive and violent but then

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.370
the world was pretty violent. Prior to the
rise of religion there was animism and prior

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.080
to that there was no religion. In my past
studies I read that archaeologists date the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.460
earliest evidence for the belief in a soul
about 200,000 years ago. Spirituality and

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.460
animism or ancestor worship from that point
on was a vague notion and it was there as

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.920
more of a consolation or imaginary friend
to help out or an imaginary bogyman to scare

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.650
you and your tribe for doing something dangerous.
Then agriculture and trade was evolved and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.800
people began going from xenophobic hunter/gatherer
tribes to people who interacted with each

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.840
other on much larger scales than could ever
before have been imagined. The steps to religion

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.810
came from new communication especially once
writing took off. During that time period

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.630
where police and courts weren't in the number
and logic that they are today religion kind

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.540
of needed to figure out a way to keep people
from going rampant and doing harm to others.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.360
There are roughly the same number of neurons
in an ant colony that there are in the human

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.050
brain however unless they evolve telepathy
they will not ever be as smart as us. The

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.860
speed in communication between all neurons
is what causes our conscious emergence. The

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.150
same is true about humanity in general. Until
recently we have all been very disconnected

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.060
with very slow communication between each
other, something that the internets and cell

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.450
phones have exploded in speed of the transfer
of information. When a baby is born relatively

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.450
all of its neurons are disconnected as a way
to save space so that it can exist the birth

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.400
canal with its giant brain. Only those linked
to instinct are intact. As the baby gets only

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.799
the connections are built from experiences
and interactions from the environment around

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.240
it. We humans have all these collective experiences
but for the longest time had no way to transmit

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.870
these experiences clearly quickly and accurately
the way we do now. The combined knowledge

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.660
of individual experiences could lead to a
much better understanding of the world. Like

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.210
ants we are all going around collecting information
and experience and feeding it into the and

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.260
raising the group consciousness. The queen
is a combination of our own minds and the

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.341
Internet. In some cases the humans are the
drones and in some cases it is the internet

00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:59.750
that is the drone. From this interaction new
ideas and information can be generated from

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.690
the knowledge gained from others to quickly.
Just like the formation of this video, one

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.560
neuron may fire and set off a chain of other
neurons firing as well, AronRa's and Nykytyne's

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.990
videos, thoughts and experiences triggered
my brain thinking about this topic and I was

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.120
able to discuss it based on my own experiences
and knowledge I gained. Who knows this video

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.270
may trigger other thoughts in peoples head
to create new videos.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.920
Now that humanity has increased its transference
of information the next stages of maturation

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.860
and morality are likely to occur. Groups of
people who would have never ever heard of

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.240
each other are now able to find each other
and coordinate for change and making this

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.370
a better place.
