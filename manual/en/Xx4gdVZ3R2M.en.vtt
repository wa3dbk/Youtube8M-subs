00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.590
If you look into how Tom Sykes has faired
in World Superbike this year, you realize

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.590
what a cracker, of a race machine, the ZX10R
is turning out to be.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:31.300
Tom clinched his maiden Superbike title this season,with 8 Superpoles,9 wins and 18 podium finishes to his name.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.359
So as I hop on to test, the next best thing to
Tom's championship winning bike, which is

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:46.700
the recently launched 2014 Kawasaki ZX10R,
I have a feeling, that my very definition of speed,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.800
is up for a radical overhaul.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.400
Kawasaki completely redesigned the ZX10R from ground up in 2011, making it, a whole 9 kgs lighter than the previous version.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.500
And it's angular bodywork, compact tail section and instrument panel comes straight out of their race machines.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
Add to that the sharp line-beam headlights,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.200
LED parking light and mirror integrated
turn signals and you find yourself staring, straight down,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.000
what is arguably the hottest
looking the ZX10r yet.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.000
But as menacing as it looks, the bike is quite
comfortable, especially for a supersport;

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.700
I mean It's race cut no doubt but, the compact
ergos means that its a lot lighter on your

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.200
wrists and back, it can be comfortable still
because of the adjustable footpegs.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.269
And when you finally set rolling, the first thing you
notice is how smooth the engine is with the

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.269
secondary balancer shaft smoothening out all
the edges.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.400
This is the most powerful ZX10R till date
Because the meat of the power is delivered

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.600
at 8,000rpm and the motor goes truly ballistic
another 2,000rpms later.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.200
What I loved or fell in love with, was its tractability and The
on/off throttle transitions, they are seamless.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.100
But if you still feel that riding a 200PS
bike machine on the streets is like sitting

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.200
on an armed missile, well you have three Power
Modes at your disposal and these can be changed on the fly.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.640
The slick 6 Speed transmission
too is a little on the taller side to maintain

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.500
the same linear power delivery across the
power band.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.700
The most apparent advantage of having such
a controllable power delivery is when you hit the corners.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.500
The engine braking too is
a lot smoother providing really good stability

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.700
at corner entry And with the safety net of
Kawasaki's brilliant Traction Control,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.700
I have never felt more confident attacking corners
on a litre class bike.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.600
Working in conjunction with the Traction Control,
is the Kawasaki Intelligent Braking System

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.940
which is the first of its kind on a production
motorcycle, which uses information from wheel

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.750
sensors as well as the main ECU to determine
how much and when to intervene at each wheel

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.100
and I liked this system but what left me wanting
was the braking on this bike in general,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.740
the rear brake especially has almost zero initial
bite, the front brake though is really good

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.600
in terms of feel and feedback and is very progressive
as well, but what it can do with is

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.000
initial bite upfront.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.680
The new electronic steering damper that increases
damping force not ony as the speed goes up,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.900
but also based on acceleration and deceleration.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.200
When it comes to handling the Showa Big Piston
forks ensure smooth damping and they prevent

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.900
front end dive, even under hard hard braking.
The rear Showa shock is impressive as well

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.580
soaking in bumps beautifully on the road and
is compeletely coustomisable coz you can fiddle

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.000
around with the compression, with the preload
as well as the rebound. Add then when you

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.100
add the compeletely revised chassis geometry
to the mix and have a ninja which has almost

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.200
intutive handling characteristics.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:30.600
So to summarise what distinguishes the 2014
Kawasaki ZX10R from the its competitiors is

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.900
its linear power delivery, its easy to live
with stance and it's advanced electronics package.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.900
It works with the rider, giving him/her
more control to get the most out of the bike

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.789
while transparently keeping the bike in check.
Kawasaki, I think they have a winner on their

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:56.789
hands with the ZX10 because it is arguably
the best Japanese litre class sport bike which

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:03.710
you can buy today and with the 15.7 lakh ex-showroom
price tag, it is also the most affordable.
