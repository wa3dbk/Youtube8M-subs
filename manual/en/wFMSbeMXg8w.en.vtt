[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:08.189
-Hi, I'm Chris Jaffe from Netflix.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.550
And I'm going to show you how
to use Netflix on your Xbox.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.760
To download Netflix on your Xbox, you're
going to want to go over to the apps

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.770
section, here.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.630
Go over to Netflix and hit Select.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.430
A LIVE Gold account is required
to use Netlix.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.310
So, you'll either want to sign up for an
Xbox LIVE account, or you'll want to

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.840
sign in with an existing account.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.685
Now that I'm signed in to Xbox LIVE, I
can just download the application.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420
The first thing that you'll see
is the ability to choose our

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.900
Netflix Just for Kids experience or
the normal Netflix experience.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.450
I'm going to choose the normal
Netflix experience.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.610
The first thing you'll notice after the
Netflix experience loads is all these

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.790
rows of all kinds of great movies
and TV shows to watch.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.770
So you can just simply move up and
down using the controller,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.310
across all of the lists.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.790
And you'll see all of these titles.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.780
And any time that you stop on a title,
you'll see that you'll get more

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050
information loads right
here about the title.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.610
And to play any title is
really, really simple.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.370
All you have to do is select Play.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.310
Just hit A on the controller, and
the title begins to play.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.340
As it's loading, you'll see all that great
information about that show is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.110
presented here on the screen, as well some
options to select other episodes

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.880
and to configure your
audio and subtitles.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.440
Let's do that.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.110
Let's take a look at the
audio and subtitles.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.210
Click down to bring up the menu, move over
to the audio subtitle selection,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.510
select it, and you'll see the subtitles
appear right here on your Xbox.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.060
Some of the other features you can
do on Xbox is, you can go in.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.810
And you could also rate the
title directly right here.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.760
I really, really am enjoying "House of
Cards." So I'll go ahead and give it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.630
five stars, because I love it.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.190
And that rating is captured right away.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.550
And I can go back, and this is all
happening while I'm in Play mode here.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.000
Fast Forward and Reverse
is also really simple.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.660
I just bring up the menu, which then
allows you to do Fast Forward.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.780
At any time in the Netflix experience,
it's really easy to search for any title

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.910
that you're looking for.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.330
Simply hit Y on your controller,
and the search box appears.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.210
And then you can just type
in any characters.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.000
So here, I typed in H-O-U, because I
was looking for "House of Cards.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.381
And "House of Cards" is
the first result.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.530
Thanks for joining us today.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.600
To learn more about Netflix on Xbox,
we hope you'll try yours today.
