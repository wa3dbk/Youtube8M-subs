00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.300
Our gardens need plenty
of water to stay healthy,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.360
a little bit like us, really.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.460
Installing an irrigation
system will save you

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.130
the hassle of standing around
with a hose in your hand.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.200
It'll also make sure
your garden gets

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.790
just the right amount of water.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.490
Installing your own
system isn't much drama.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.380
All it takes is a
basic understanding

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.290
of the plants in your garden
and a little bit of planning.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.390
I'll take you through
the job step by step.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.240
The first thing we need to do
is measure our water pressure.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.440
We simply time how long it takes
to fill your average 9 liter

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.310
bucket.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.750
Now, just before
you get cranking,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.520
just make sure that
your tap is on full

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.540
before you start timing.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.180
OK, that's 12.3 seconds.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.990
Next, we use this handy
formula to find out our LPM,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.590
or Liters Per Minute.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.180
So that's 9 times 60,
which is 540, divided

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.060
by our time which was 12.3.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.880
And that gives us 43.9,
our liters per minute.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.000
This is going to help
us decide exactly how

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.884
many sprayers or sprinklers
our system can handle.

00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:14.300
Now, it's really
important to draw

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.247
a scaled plan of your garden.

00:01:16.247 --> 00:01:17.830
I made a little
garden behind me here.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.320
We've got our nine
little sprayers.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.240
Now, my water source is on
the retaining wall over here,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.820
and we're going to have a
splitter off those to take

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.550
all those little sprayers.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.510
Around the front,
I'm using a scale map

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.240
to make sure all the
green areas are covered,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.950
using a mixture of pop up
sprinklers for the lawn

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.590
and a drip line for the shrubs.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.550
All this will challenge
my 43.9 liter flow rate.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.780
All in all, about three
lines, nice and simple.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.070
Now I'm going to use these
sprayers in this garden.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.260
They use one liter
per minute each.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.480
I've got nine of them,
so that nine liters.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.600
I'm well within my flow
rate, so we're good to go.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.740
So I'm just going to clear a
little bit of this garden away,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.550
and I'm going to run my pipe
down the back of this retaining

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.660
wall.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.940
And I'm actually going
to just clip it directly

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.490
to the retaining
wall timber itself.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.400
Now, I've already had the
plumber put a secondary tap

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.090
running off our main one
here, so all our connections

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.770
are nice and tidy behind the
back of the retaining wall.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.480
OK, we're starting
off with my tee.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.090
This simply just kind
of screws straight

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.292
onto the end of the tap.

00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:24.500
Now, the reason I've got a
tee on the end of that tap

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.362
is purely--

00:02:25.362 --> 00:02:27.570
I might want to spray that
garden a little bit later.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.410
So at this stage, all I'm going
to do is just put a stopper on.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.270
I've cut a short length of pipe.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.960
There's a stopper
on the end of it,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.660
so we're just going
to connect that on

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.430
and that's for later
down the track.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.320
Now, a little tip.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.990
Make sure you always put your
little clamp on your pipe

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.520
before you run that.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.030
If you find these are
quite hard to attach on,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.530
you can actually
dip the end of this

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.071
in a little bit of boiling water
and it's going to soften it.

00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:52.520
Today is a nice hot day so
these go on quite easily.

00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:56.630
Just put our clamp
back on there.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.740
Roll out your pipe, attach it
to the back of the retaining

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.450
wall using your saddle clamps
around about every two meters--

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.120
[HAMMERING]

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.090
--and then just simply bury it.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.770
I've laid the pipe
from the retaining

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.270
wall down to the garden.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.940
An elbow connector can
totally divert the water

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.190
under the wooden steps
and into the garden.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.360
All the pipes get held down by
these handy little pegs buried

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.430
into the garden to look tidy.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.630
Easy As.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.900
Now, through a series of
elbows, tees, and connectors,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.120
I'm just weaving my
way through the garden.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.950
It's really important that
we use these elbows and tees

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.325
because we don't want any
kinks in our hose whatsoever.

00:03:47.325 --> 00:03:49.760
Righty-o, I've run all my lines.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.949
Everything is nearly set.

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.490
A little tip for
you before you crack

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.342
on putting in your sprinklers.

00:03:54.342 --> 00:03:56.800
I'm just going to run my hose
here for a couple of seconds.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.970
It's going to flush
anything out of our lines.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.810
And then after that, we can
put our stoppers on and screw

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.820
on all our sprinklers.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.500
Now, I'm just about ready to put
the first of my nine sprayers

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.190
in.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.640
To do that, I've got
my riser, and I've

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.630
got my little
sprinkler head here,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.065
and I've got this lovely
little multitool here.

00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:17.230
The head goes in that.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.544
And that helps us wind that
little sprinkler head in.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.370
And on the other
end of this, we've

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.500
got a nice little sharp point.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.300
That's also going to help
us penetrate into our pipe.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.670
Now, I'm in this corner here.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.504
So my sprinkler head, I've
decided to use a 90 degree,

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:37.920
that way I'm not going to get
any overspray onto the path.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.730
Now, the other use
for this little tool

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.860
is we put that back on the
top of our sprinkler head.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.766
We use that just to twist it in.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.130
OK, so I've got our little
riser pipe stake here.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.120
These are dual-purpose--
they clamp onto our riser,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.210
and also hold our pipe down.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.410
Now, I'm using these
particular type of sprayers

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.060
because it's
perfect for the fern

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.360
garden and other tall plants.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.380
Now, turn on the water
and check your results.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.121
These adjustable sprayers allow
you to get the right angle

00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:37.745
on your plants.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.340
Now up the back, our spray
system is working lovely.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.590
Down the front here, we're
going to have a lawn pop up

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.980
system and a drip line system.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.000
Now, because we're using
two different systems,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.040
that means we have to
run two different lines.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.740
For that I've got on
this twin tap adapter

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.950
and I'll just plug in my
lines straight into that.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.890
We're good to go.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.910
Now, this strip line
system is absolutely

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.120
perfect for this type of
garden because what it does

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.270
is it waters the
roots of the plants.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.320
The trick to this is you
don't want the actual dripper

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.270
right at the base
of the plant, you

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.130
want it around the
sides of the plant

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.350
because that's actually
where the roots are.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.690
Just like our spray system
we put up in the back,

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.100
it's pretty much just the same.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.190
All we do is just ping
straight into our main line

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.132
and all our little
drippers just come straight

00:06:24.132 --> 00:06:25.090
off that nice and easy.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.460
And finally, the pop up
sprinklers for the grass.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.680
I've run the source pipe
around the outside edge

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.000
of the lawn using tee junctions
and elbows to divert it

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.360
to the sprinklers.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.790
A quick tidy dig to the
sprinkler position and I

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.710
can lay the pipe back
to the water source.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.190
Now attach the pipe
to the main line

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.320
and install the
other sprinklers.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.900
Replace the grass and it
should grow back in no time.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.490
Once again, turn the water on
and adjust where necessary.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.070
Now, the good thing about
these little adjustable ones--

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.270
I can either make
this 360 degrees

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.430
right down to 5 degrees.

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:09.750
Now, there we have it--
three different types

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.910
of water irrigation
systems for your garden.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.020
So hang up your hose and enjoy.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.920
Easy As.
