00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.729
There's two things about delivering a message

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.619
It's how you say it
which is important

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.390
but it's what you say which is
absolutely critical because

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.147
eventually you're delivering a message

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.499
Content is king

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.640
So what you say is absolutely critical

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.259
And you must be on top of the message
that you have to deliver

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.614
Several times I've seen situations where
executives are very busy did what they are doing

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:37.769
and they're suddenly called
in and told

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.528
Listen there's a conference,
you cannot go to the conference

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:41.911
Here's a message, you've got to record a message

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:45.240
that will be played out at the conference, 
at the offsite or wherever you are

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.180
And inevitably, it's a cameraman 
who is carrying the script

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.229
or it's a little kid from an 
event management company or an advertising agency

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.020
that comes and says here'syour script 
now say it

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.697
and it's amazing how many
times I've seen people

00:00:57.698 --> 00:01:00.210
look at it and say 'Oh my god, what have I got here!'

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.300
and then, they do one line and then they stumble

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.694
they do another line and
then they stumble and

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:08.038
inevitably, the message that goes across is

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.382
you record one line
and you pause

00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:12.470
then you remember another line
and then you pause

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.000
and the cameraman or the editor have
then got to join those two together

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.220
Have you been at conferences where you
see these little jump cuts?

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.113
where someone's saying something then jump
and he's saying something else

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:24.888
That's what happens if
you're forced to recite lines

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:26.780
that somebody else has written for you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.200
The best thing to do, therefore, is to write them yourself

00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:32.056
Because each of us has a certain way of speaking

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:35.052
There are words that we like, 
there are some words we don't like

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:39.338
There are some words you are  uncomfortable,
inevitably, you'll come and stumbled on those

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:42.859
So it's best to write it yourself.
Now when you write it yourself

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.580
you can also run the risk of writing it
like you're writing a press release

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.310
with lots of facts and it looks very nice

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.310
But when it comes to actually saying it,
it's a completely different experience

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.439
So when you are writing for speaking

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.959
as opposed to writing for reading, 
keep it very simple

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.479
Remember the key messages that you've got to deliver 
and focus on those

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.360
Don't try and remember the whole sentence.
Don't try to get into a recitation competition

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.889
Here's an example for you

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.229
If the script that's been given to you says

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:16.089
The thrust of our new initiative is to
explore rural markets which will allow us

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:20.789
to increase volumes also to 
sell our products at new price points

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:24.399
Now the language somebody else's.
You might end up having to remember

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.180
The thrust of our new initiative is

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.369
whereas the important point is to say 'explore rural
markets', 'increase volumes', 'sell at new price points'

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.750
So you can find your own way at coming to
explore rural markets

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.989
You can say, 'The reason we are gathered here is
because we are trying to explore rural markets'

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.400
or 'One of the objectives of all of us being here
is to explore rural markets'

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.369
So you can find own words to get to 
the key message that you want to deliver

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.859
What this does is it ensures that

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.939
your key messages are remembered
You could also use the help of technology

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.209
Write down the key messages on an iPad

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.199
or have someone holding a just behind the camera

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.038
Don't look up like that where the words are being displayed

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:05.459
Look at the words and then speak it in your own way

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.059
The worst thing you can actually do at a conference 
is just go there

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.296
take a prepared script and read it out

00:03:11.297 --> 00:03:14.149
I've been at a conference with the major company

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.830
where the head of that particular division came in, 
pulled out his script

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.750
and read in a wonderful clipped accent

00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:23.540
gave a long lecture, 
all that the company had to do

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.659
without once looking up

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.159
And the reason he had to do that

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.829
was he hadn't written his script,
somebody else had done it for him

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.599
He couldn't be expected to remember the entire script so 
all he did was

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.410
Just read that and then he'd turn the page, 
and he'd turn the page

00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:39.269
and it was over,
he said thank you very much

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.539
In that period, if the entire hall had got empty,
nobody would've known

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:51.229
I've also seen people take an iPad and start reading out of an iPad 
and then trying to scroll down and scroll up

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.319
No, it doesn't work

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.480
Just as what you say is important, how you say is important,
the combination of the two

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.860
will allow you to deliver the message
that is very important

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.649
it'll allow you to deliver a message that is memorable

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:04.189
and it'll allow you to deliver a message that is interesting

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.970
Make the start of your message and the end of your message 
very interesting

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.280
because then that will set the mood
