Hey everyone, this is Mei Yu, the creator of Fun2draw. Lots of you viewers have been waiting for a

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:12.574
cute strawberry

00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:15.774
It'll be Fun2draw one

00:00:15.774 --> 00:00:18.244
First, let's draw

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:20.545
a short, stubby stem

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:24.704
and from this short, stubby stem

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:28.864
let's draw some leaves sticking out

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:34.484
Just repeat these curved triangle shapes

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:38.345
so we got four

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:41.295
Add these little lines

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.985
This reminds me of a cute little

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:47.175
banana peel that's on the floor

00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:52.185
Once you have that little banana peel,

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:59.185
let's draw the actual shape of the strawberry

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.755
It is quite triangular, but also

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:10.425
really rounded

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.244
The points are really curved

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:17.265
'cause you don't want the strawberry to look too jagged

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:20.075
This'll be a cute strawberry

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:25.805
Some nice, soft curves are really good

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:30.215
Let's add those big Fun2draw eyes now

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:36.875
Those big Fun2draw eyes

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.515
There we go

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:40.685
and

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:46.295
that pupil is going to hog all the space in the eye

00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:48.035
Let's make it

00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:51.625
really big

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:57.655
So we've got one big Fun2draw eye. Let's go on to the other side

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:03.384
Actually, strawberries are one of my
most favorite foods of all time. They're so

00:02:03.384 --> 00:02:05.675
good and yummy

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:08.384
You can let me know in the comments below what are your favorite

00:02:08.384 --> 00:02:12.414
foods or fruit

00:02:12.414 --> 00:02:15.724
And also please check out my Fun2draw channel on YouTube

00:02:15.724 --> 00:02:19.694

favorite foods or fruits drawn out

00:02:19.694 --> 00:02:22.434
already

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:25.174

00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:28.054
what other cute foods you want me to draw in the future

00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:33.735
and I'll try my best to draw as many of your requests as I can

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:35.785
Alright, we need some

00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:40.764
of these

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:42.324
They're not sweat drops

00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:45.414
They are little seeds

00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:49.444
Just a few here, not too many

00:02:49.444 --> 00:02:53.184
If you like this video, please thumbs up, favorite, and

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:55.705
share it with your friends

00:02:55.705 --> 00:03:01.254
Let's repeat that a few more times

00:03:01.254 --> 00:03:04.384
This reminds me of a really stubby, fat

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:07.554
pile of... bleh

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:14.554
I didn't mean to say that, I meant to say it looks like a um, um, um...banana peel! (in squeaky voice) Let's continue on... Draw a little rounded triangle, a mouth, and... it's a happy strawberry!

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:36.184
With sweat drops, yay!
