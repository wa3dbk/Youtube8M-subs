Hi, this is Yolande VanVeen, on behalf of
Expert Village. In this section we are talking

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.410
about flower gardening, and in this segment
we are talking about how to pick soil. What's

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.690
the best soil and how much soil do I use.
My theory is with soil, we need to go back

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.699
to the natural, the whole ideal ... that your
soil should be composed of compost only. I

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.609
am talking leaf clippings, fir clippings,
and mushroom compost, sand ... and get away

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.960
from everything that is not natural. So everyone
wants to sell you the bonemeal, and they want

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.030
to sell you expensive different mixes that
have Vermiculite and all the different types

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.929
of man-made substances in them, and I found
that in the end, all that really matters is

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:53.019
compost. In nature, the leaves fall off the
trees and cover the ground, and that's how

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.199
it creates its own compost. So it's not really
that complicated. So when you are deciding

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.519
on your soil, I just get a good compost mix.
The mix that I use is called the four-way

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:11.590
mix. It's called the Irish mix. It has sand,
fir compost, mushroom compost, and all kinds

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.160
of leaf clippings and grass clippings in it.
So that together seems to work out really

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.160
well for me, and I don't use anything else.
In deciding how much soil to use. And so when

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:29.610
picking out my soil too, I want it to be loose
and moist and fresh, but not still steaming

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.500
hot. So you have to be sure when you get compost,
sometimes it's really hot still. Or if you're

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.520
making your own compost, and it's still hot
and steaming, then wait awhile. Give it another

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.460
couple of months. So whenever compost is really
really cold, then it's ready to use. It needs

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.640
to be airy. Sometimes a little bit of gravel
underneath your beds helps a lot to give it

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.991
good drainage. When I cover my beds, I usually
use mulch, grass clippings, leaf clippings

00:01:55.991 --> 00:02:04.170
on the very bottom. Then I will put a little
bit of ... six inches... or about three inches

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.950
of compost down. Then I lay my bulbs down,
and then another three inches on top of that.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.390
The beds only need to be about six inches
deep, so a little bit soil really goes a long

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.540
way. And nowadays, you can even buy the soil
and they'll deliver it to you. They shoot

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.170
it over the fence to directly where you want
it. So it can't get any easier than that.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.560
Compost is easy to purchase, you can buy it
at the garden center or you can buy it by

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.100
the truckload. So either way, you're going
to have great soil. Knowing that, let's talk

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.090
about in the next segment, how many bulbs
do I plant together? ...how do I plant my

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.290
groupings.
