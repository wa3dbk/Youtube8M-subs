Hi! My name is Ann and I am here to talk about
what we call in our kindergarten world literature.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.660
These are stories that when you have a chance
and opportunity. These are stories you should

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.460
be reading with your son or daughter at home
for example like The Three Bears or Three

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.970
Little Pigs, nursery rhymes certainly. These
are things you want to read over and over

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.029
again, Brown bear… brown bear… what do
you see. These are stories that you want to

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.760
do over and over again at home and again repetition
and modeling good language helps your child

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.120
to be a successful learner, to be a good reader
in kindergarten and you are learning to listen,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.760
to understand the elements of the story to
ask questions for example what do you think

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.410
is going to happen next. These are sequence
of events that you could go over. All these

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.110
are skills that will be tested and needed
in kindergarten to be a good and successful

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.360
reader. Nursery rhymes is something that many
people do not spend enough time dealing with.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.270
Nursery rhymes are classic. They are important
for the language development and certainly

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.990
one of my favorite books here is Mother Goose
and all kinds of rhymes here that children

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.980
would enjoy Jack and Jill went up the hill.
You are going over rhyming words, you are

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.840
going over what happened in the story and
how many people are in the rhyme. These are

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.530
fun ways to learn sounds, phonetic rules,
things that you need to be able to read well

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.520
in kindergarten and all your years in elementary
school and I would urge you to spend time

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.840
everyday 5-10 minutes. It does not have to
be a big block a time where you are going

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.820
over a nursery rhyme a day and again when
children know rhymes by heart this certainly

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.980
helps with phonemic awareness, with reading,
with skills that are constantly being tested

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.119
throughout the elementary school years. Thank
you.
