00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.180
Changing your quiz status to 'Active' allows
users to see and take a quiz.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.121
You can specify a date or date range that
your quiz becomes available to users.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.960
By selecting Display in Calendar, this also
adds quizzes associated with a date to your

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:30.439
course calendar.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.940
In the Additional Release Conditions section,
you can create new, or attach existing release

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.340
conditions if you want a quiz to be available
to users only after they fulfill other specified

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.740
tasks. Examples of release conditions include
completing a dropbox submission;

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.149
scoring a specified grade in a particular
quiz; completing a survey; and being enrolled

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.720
in a particular section. You can edit and
change release conditions by clicking the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.750
Remove icon or Remove All Conditions.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.740
If your organization purchased the Respondus
LockDown Browser you will see two additional

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.899
options on the Restrictions tab:
Respondus LockDown Browser: Required to take

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.210
this quiz Forces users to use the LockDown
Browser when writing the quiz. The user cannot

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.049
start the quiz unless they are using the browser.
Respondus LockDown Browser: Required to view

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.030
quiz feedback and results Restricts users
from viewing quiz feedback or results unless

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.310
they are using the browser. This option makes
it difficult for users to print quiz results

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.049
and make them available to others.
If you select one or both of these options,

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.200
users will see a Download Respondus LockDown
Browser link when they try to navigate to

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.799
pages that are locked. Users can click the
link to download a free copy of the browser.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.581
Under the Optional Advanced Restrictions you
can set a password so that in order to access

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.039
a quiz, users are required to enter the same
password you input here.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.609
The IP Restriction field means that users
can only access a quiz from the IP address

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:08.089
specified here. You would leave these fields
blank to allow multiple IP address access points.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.590
The Timing settings are very important for
determining how a quiz is going to work. If

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.440
you want there to be a time limit on your
quiz, set the amount of time you want the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.060
users to have in the Time Limit field.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.430
By selecting enforced, the show clock field
is automatically selected as well. This will

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.310
limit the amount of time users have to take
the quiz.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.080
You can also allow users a short grace period
by entering a value in the Grace Period field.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.799
The most common setting under Late Submissions
is the Auto-Submit Attempt.

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.640
This means that at the end of the time limit,
plus the grace period, the system will automatically

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.629
submit any saved answers and after that time
the student will not be able to make additional

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:00.390
changes to their answers or answer any additional
questions. All they can do is submit their quiz.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.900
You can use the Late Limit field to give users
a late grace period before receiving an auto-grade

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.900
of 0.
By selecting Allow normal submissions, users

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.720
can always submit their quiz, regardless of
time limits. If the quiz is submitted after

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.970
the Time Limit no points are deducted.
Notes: You must set an enforced time limit

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.599
to apply either Late Limit minutes or Auto-Submit
Attempt.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.750
When using Late Limit minutes, you can manually
change the auto-grade of 0 if you feel the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.620
user deserves a different grade.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.019
You can search and assign specific users a
different set of quiz availability dates and

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.030
late submission properties. Special access
properties enable you to increase the time

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.959
limit for special-needs users and allow different
start and end dates for individual users.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.079
Click Add Users to Special Access to create
special access to a quiz.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.090
Choose the individual or individuals to which
you would like the special access to apply.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:13.520
After you finish modifying special access
properties and users permissions, click Add Special Access.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.430
When you return to the Advanced Availability
section of the Restrictions tab, you can select

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.700
Allow only users with special access to see
this quiz to prevent other users from accessing.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.240
Assessments Tab

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.800
For this example, we will create a new Grade
Item.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.100
By selecting Auto Export to Grades, the system
can send auto-graded attempt scores directly

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.160
to the grade book if a quiz is associated
with a grade item.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.500
Under the Student View Preview, you can preview
what a student will see from within the tool.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.699
By editing the display settings...

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.180
...you can override display options and set
the features you would like to Show.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.270
When Automatic Grade is selected, users can
see quiz grades immediately after completion

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.270
and submission.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.169
You can allow users one or more quiz attempts...

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:09.170
...and calculate a grade based on their highest
attempt, lowest attempt, first attempt, last

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.770
attempt, or average of all attempts.
