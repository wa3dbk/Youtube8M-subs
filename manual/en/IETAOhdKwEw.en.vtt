00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:13.936
What are you doing there?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.863
I am prelubricating the main bearings.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.720
When you start it up,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.920
there is no oil pressure right away.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.720
It always takes a minute or so

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.240
for it to build it up. So one starts

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.316
with prelubricating, så it has lubrication

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.630
right away.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.093
Will you turn it to start position, or shall I do it?

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.760
NO, NO...

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.793
What are you doing now?

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.726
I am turning it up,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.293
to it's start-position,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.060
så that one of the pistons

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.526
is just above it's ignition point.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.060
I think it's here.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.733
Then one opens for the diesel-fuel.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.803
Opens for air, to start it with.
