How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Become
a Vegetarian or Vegan.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.120
Do you hate the thought of eating animals,
but Mom and Dad are die-hard carnivores?

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.990
Use cold hard facts to let them know that
going veggie is the way to go.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.130
You will need Health facts Environmental data
Humanitarian reasons A list of famous vegetarians

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.980
and vegans and a willingness to cook.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.670
Never change your diet without first consulting
your physician.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.670
Step 1.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.800
Point out the health advantages of vegetarians:
lower body mass, cholesterol, blood pressure,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.129
and rates of heart disease, type two diabetes
and certain cancers.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.129
Step 2.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.530
Argue that antibiotics used for growth in
animals can lead to antibiotic-resistant bacterial

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.140
infections in humans.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.879
Step 3.

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.969
Reference environmental data, such as habitat
loss, ecosystem damage, soil erosion, and

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.989
the greenhouse gas production involved in
growing animal feed.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.469
Fossil fuels are also a main component of
animal farming, and industrial fishing damages

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.180
lake and ocean ecosystems.

Step 4.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.159
Tell them that much of the arable land worldwide
is being used to grow grain to feed animals

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.460
rather than people.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.170
Many people are starving while animals are
being force-fed.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.810
Cruelty to animals is also implicit in producing
meat, dairy, and eggs.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.810
Step 5.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.310
Give them a who’s who of notable vegetarians,
including the Greek mathematician Pythagoras,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.630
Leonardo da Vinci, Mahatma Gandhi, and Sir
Paul McCartney.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.630
Step 6.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.700
Ask your parents for their support and listen
to their concerns and suggestions.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.289
They’ll be more open to the idea if you
get them involved.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.289
Step 7.

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.659
Invite them to help you plan sample meals
with alternate protein sources.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.710
Be willing to compromise.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.909
Some good non-meat sources of protein are
nuts, seeds, beans and lentils, tofu, soy

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.729
products, dairy, and eggs.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:50.729
Step 8.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.789
Offer to cook some of the meals.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.590
This will take the pressure off Mom or Dad
trying to juggle one menu for you and one

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.860
for the rest of the family.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.640

decision and willing to put in the work.
