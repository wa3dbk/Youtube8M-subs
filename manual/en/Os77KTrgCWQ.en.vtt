00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.170
The stabilization program is designed not
only for professional,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.660
but also for all amateur athletes,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.980
or every office employee trying to become
more productive,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.709
anyone wanting to stabilize his or her body,

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.860
or (wanting) to live injury free.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.380
Let me quickly get to the philosophy behind

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.500
the athletic training of the Spvgg. Unterhaching.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.310
We basically want to minimize

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.170
injuries

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.550
as well as the risk of injury

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.640
of our players,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.859
while making them more efficient at the same
time.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.100
By trying to work on imbalances,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.219
lack of mobility,

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.120
as well as lack of stability,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.090
we try to stabilize our players,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.090
while bringing out the best out of their bodies
at the same time.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.629
The exercises are important for core strengthening,

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.789
stability during dynamic motions in rotation,

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.359
as well as when landing,

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.309
the core should be active after jumping,

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.719
landing on one foot while playing basketball
or handball,

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.770
or in football, after performing a header.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.290
Additionally we have learned to perform

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.780
strength exercises

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.080
for all gluteal muscles,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.579
the hamstring muscles,

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.710
the gluteus maximus as well as the lateral
glutes.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.729
These exercises are important not only for
leg stability,

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.799
but also for effective movements during sprint
exercises.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.729
We have instructed exercises for the core
and gluteal muscles,

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.220
as well as (exercises for) the upper body
muscles.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.930
These muscles are very important especially
for people working in an office,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.579
because they often put pressure only on one
side of their body

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.780
and neglect the core stability muscles.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.820
Everybody should perform

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.329
the exercises for the leg axis, the squat,
and lunge

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.390
because the muscles of the leg axis

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.360
are the largest muscle group in the human
body

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.869
and they also keep your metabolism going.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.360
Athleticism is the cornerstone of every sport.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.410
You can't maximize your performance

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.750
if you're not a hundred percent fit.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.460
You have a chance

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.910
to set yourself apart from competition

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.540
by reaching your athletic potential which
is getting more and more important

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.540
because the level of technical skill and tactics

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.910
is so sophisticated.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.550
Athleticism in sports is more highly valued

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.790
in other countries like the United States

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.630
than in Germany

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.070
if we look at their weekly training routines.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.550
Let me give you an example by looking at a
youth or men's team

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.960
which trains two to three times a week.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.920
Dynamic warm-ups, aka (also known as) movement
preps,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.250
can be integrated into every training session.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.210
It is a more effective warm-up,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.820
because it lowers injury risks while improving
the athletic performance at the same time.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.590
That's why you should choose three to four
preps,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.040
and incorporate them into the warm up phase
of the training session.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.090
You can choose between the six to eight movement
preps

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.100
we have shown you in this film

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.630
and use three or four of these exercises

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.120
which warm up the different muscle groups

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.540
and prepare you for different movements and
motions as well.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.690
There a two ways to incorporate

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.120
athleticism and stability

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.260
into football training.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.340
One way is to start

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.290
right after the movemment preps

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.040
because the player

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.930
is under pressure

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.790
during the trainig routine

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.470
and actively focuses on the center his body.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.530
The stability exercises can also

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.670
be performed after the training session.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.820
Here each player additionally performs a basic
program

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.190
for 20 to 30 minutes.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.180
It's easy for coaches of other ball games

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.620
to incorporate the exercises we have shown
you into their training routine.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.080
The exercises are suited not only for football
players

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.610
but for any other ball player as well

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.790
because stability in the center of your body
reduces the risk of injury

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.260
while it also increases your performance in
running, jumping

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.040
and tackling.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.400
Every sport is a little different, of course.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.100
Therefore a handball player should be trained
focused on stability

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.400
while working with his arms

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.940
whereas a football player

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.870
should naturally be trained focused

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.350
on stability while working with his feet.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.470
Let's look at basketball for example.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.940
Basketball is a non-contact sport,

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.790
there is no tackling

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.510
like in football,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.250
but a basketball player has to move quickly
as well

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.750
while trying to avoid evasive core movements

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.180
which slow him down

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.180
and create a lack of mobility of the leg axis.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.510
Tennis players rotate their arms

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.620
and are often positioned in a low stance.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.590
Therefore exercises

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.470
for strengthening the hip muscles

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.260
are equally important for them

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.190
in order to prevent

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.950
possible disbalances.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.790
There is a high number

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.560
of match days

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.910
in Germany.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.190
Therefore the longer the player

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.770
is able to regenerate

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.520
the more efficient he is on a match day.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.420
Players who have a high level of physical
fitness

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.250
regenerate quicker than players who don't.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.050
They are able to train more efficient,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.920
for longer periods,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.210
and they are more concentrated and efficient

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.420
during tactical

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.530
and technical elements

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.200
of the exercises.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.270
This is all made possible

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.860
by a systematic athletic training

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.430
that actively trains all parts of the body

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:01.400
while working on possible evasive motions
at the same time.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.410
Even at a young age

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.780
you can train like this

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.110
using stablizing exercises in a playful manner.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.810
You can even incorporate athletic elements

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.530
in training eight to ten year-olds.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.720
However, here we make the kids use only their
own body weight

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.810
and we try provide

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.330
them with playful elements of training.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.260
It makes sense to test the body

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.220
to recognize deficits

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.590
and possible disbalances.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.490
The Spvgg. Unterhaching tests all professional

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.430
as well as youth players

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.520
for mobility

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.690
and stability

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.480
with the Functional Movement Screen

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.940
to make them more efficient

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.110
and to work on their limitations and deficits.
