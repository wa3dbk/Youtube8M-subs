00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.000
Training for Motocross is one of the least,
or I guess the most misunderstood parts about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.870
racing. A lot of guys, you know, think that
just going to the gym and, and pumping iron

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.099
and getting strong is the way to go, and a
lot of, you know, other people, think that

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.279
maybe going on cycling rides and doing endurance
and other guys just go out to the track and,

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.070
and ride. But at least in my, my experience
I've found that it's a combination of, of

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.570
all of those factors, all of those things
and a lot of other things that lead to a complete

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:36.739
program. Endurance is, is probably the most
crucial aspect of being, you know, being,

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.540
obviously being able to ride a long moto and
not fatigue and not become tired and putting

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.100
yourself in jeopardy of crashing due to that
fatigue. I accomplish my endurance from time

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.440
on the bike doing motos during the week, to
prepare for the races on weekends. Also doing

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.650
things like cycling, both on the road, and,
and mountain biking, swimming, lift, lifting

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.180
weights, rowing, pretty much anything that
can get your heart rate up and keep it sustained

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.030
is going to benefit you on the bike because
basically, at least I've found, that my heart

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.720
rate on my bike when I'm riding, stays elevated
for the whole time that I'm out there, more

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.170
so than any other, any other sport, or training
that I've done. That being said, riding motor,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.790
riding your motorcycle is the most important
thing that you can do and probably the most

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.030
beneficial. There are some of you that might
have full time job, it's difficult to get

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.670
out to the track every day or every other
day, and, and put your time in on the bike

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.990
but anytime you can get out, you know, make
sure you make it worth your while by simulating

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.970
your race, putting in consecutive laps, keeping
your heart rate elevated for, for as long

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.380
as you can. And that will really reap benefits
for you on the weekends. At the professional

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.860
level you need to do a lot more than just
ride. As I said before, weight lifting, swimming

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.130
and doing all these, these other things in,
in addition to even training your mind and,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.860
and learning how to focus and really, really
know what you're doing before you're going

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.380
to do it and really believing in yourself.
That's, that's also a, a crucial aspect that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.440
maybe a lot of, a lot of fans or a lot of
local riders don't see, but for me personally

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.160
that's one of the, one of the things that's
helped me to get where I am, is just having

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.270
that confidence in myself and that confidence
in my program to know that I'm better prepared

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.700
than anyone else. For training for professional
Motocross racing it's important to have a

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.790
complete program, all the way through from
getting the right amount of sleep at night.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.040
Your stretching is very important, being flexible
to avoid injury, even working with your mind

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.890
and learning focus and balance and hand-eye
coordination and just practicing all those

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.600
things in addition to the endurance and strength
training that, that you need to do to just

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.320
to be able to sustain yourself on the bike
for the length of period that, that a lot

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.230
of the professional races are. Those are all
elements of the program that will make you

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.310
a better rider, keep you healthy and, and
keep you feeling young. So those are some

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.340
of the things that you can do to prepare yourself
for battling either on the weekends or at

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.810
the, the national motocrossâ€™s and the professional
races across the country and also make you

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.470
feel a whole lot better about yourself.
