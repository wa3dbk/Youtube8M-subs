00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.019
Surface switching is a very important tool
that a lot of hoopers use when switching the

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.110
hoop from the front of your body to the back
of your body, or over your head to on your

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.110
body.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.660
And basically, what it means is the hand position
in relationship to your hoop is moving from

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.530
inside to outside, or outside to inside.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.470
And the way that we do this is a little maneuver
with the thumb.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.219
You want to keep the palm nice and flat and
keep the thumb ready to get in there and assist

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.219
you.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:55.510
So we're going to start with the hoop in our
vertical plane, hand roll going forward.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.480
Notice my thumb is up, my palm is forward.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.430
What I want to do now is I want to bring the
hoop in front of my body and then move my

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.200
hand from outside to inside the hoop.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.130
Notice my hand is inside the hoop now?

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.040
I'm going to grab it.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.830
I'm going to rotate so now that my hand is
on the outside of the hoop.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.540
From here, I'm going to stick my thumb in,
keep the rotation of the hoop going the same

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.150
direction, and then I'm going to release with
my fingers so that they can now come inside

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.860
the hoop to continue that hand roll.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.690
I'll do this again slowly.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.250
Inside the hoop, grab, rotate to the front
of your body.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.050
And now outside.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.540
Thumb in, release the fingers, hand roll in
front of you.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.110
Okay, so a little quicker.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.570
Hand roll, grab, thumb, fingers, switch.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.530
One more time, that same speed.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.930
Hand roll, grab, thumb, fingers.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.530
So this is really useful whenever you start
doing double hooping or being able to switch

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.810
from which side of your body the hoop is on.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.360
And that's how you do surface switching.
