00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We came up with the name "Kengugró" which is a wordplay based on the oldest dance style "ugrós"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and Australia's unique native animal the kangaroo.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, Keng-ugrós, Kengugró.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In English, "Erdély" is Transylvania,  

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
then we all know what "Maniacs" means.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Put them together and you get "The Transylvaniacs"

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We're based in Sydney,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
playing Hungarian folk music

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
mainly from Transylvania, Slovakia and Hungary.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When we play, the dancers come too,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Tonight, we have two dance groups here

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
One is Kengugró, from Sydney

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and the other is "Gyöngyösbokréta" from Canberra.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Kengugró was formed in 1986

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
as a national group

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
for those people who wanted to go and learn more in Hungary.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The plan was to go every second year, dancers from

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We had an Australian leader

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
who learnt Hungarian folk dance and also taught me.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's wonderful that Australia is full of people

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:20.000
who are interested in other cultures besides their own.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
A few years ago in 2006, we celebrated our

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
20th anniversary in Hungary.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We invited all of the dance teachers and musicians who have taught us over the years

00:02:37.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to a big party in Piliscsév.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The band started with a newspaper advertisement.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
"anyone who'd like to play interesting music please call"

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
...so that's how it all started.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
There have been many changes through the years,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but for the past ten years or so, this is how the band is. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
There's our lead violinist Mark, who is Australian

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but has learnt Hungarian.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Our singer, Gemma, who's also not Hungarian

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but sings in Hungarian.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and our double bass player Józsi who's Hungarian,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Our hammer dulcimer player, Tim, is currently touring Hungary and Transylvania.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Our other viola player, Sally, is now living in Hungary

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and organizes tours to Transylvania.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I first started music with the piano, 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
which my mother taught me how to play.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
She also played the accordion which I've now inherited from her.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
For my 21st birthday I received a viola

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
so I learnt the viola too.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I have two different violas, one is from Transylvania which has three strings and a flat bridge,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and the other is a classical viola.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.533
I also play accordion and double bass.
