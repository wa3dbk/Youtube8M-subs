00:00:01.808 --> 00:00:03.527
- [Voiceover] So really the main sort of

00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:05.814
underlying goal of stroke
treatment is really

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:08.333
to save as much brain tissue as possible.

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.912
As you probably thought, right?

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:12.548
Because by saving the
maximum amount of brain

00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:15.925
tissue, the idea is that
we only lose a minimal

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:18.387
amount of function, of bodily function,

00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:22.892
movement, vision, sensation, taste even.

00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:25.993
So, you might remember
that in any ischemic stroke

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.548
there's a core area of
neurons right at the site

00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:30.140
of the blood vessel obstruction,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.007
so there's brain tissue
there that'll usually

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.206
be irreversibly damaged
within a few minutes

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:36.738
of losing their blood supply.

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:40.847
So, that's not great,
but the good news is that

00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:43.042
there's salvageable
brain tissue surrounding

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.747
that core called the penumbra.

00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.698
So, this is an area where blood profusion

00:00:47.698 --> 00:00:51.019
has gone down because
of the blockage here,

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.531
but since it's still
getting oxygen sort of

00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:55.724
peripherally from these
blood vessels in the areas

00:00:55.724 --> 00:00:58.707
around it, these penumbra
neurons don't die off

00:00:58.707 --> 00:01:01.668
right away, and if the
person gets quick enough

00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:04.803
treatment then the
penumbra neurons don't die

00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:08.123
off at all in most cases,
the penumbra is savable.

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:11.467
So, when someone comes
in having had a stroke,

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.544
the healthcare team often is thinking,

00:01:13.544 --> 00:01:15.123
"Alright, let's get down to business and

00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:16.969
"try to save the core if possible,

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.849
"and let's definitely
save that penumbra before

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:20.429
"it's too late."

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.111
So, with all that said,
what sort of treatment

00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:25.165
can you get after a stroke?

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:26.884
Well, remember that depends on what type

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:29.821
of stroke you've had,
ischemic or hemorrhagic.

00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:31.945
And with ischemic strokes
you're usually given

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:34.371
aspirin to prevent new clots from forming

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:36.311
and thromobylics which try to break up

00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:38.203
the existing clot.

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:40.224
And with hemorrhagic
it's more about managing

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:42.325
symptoms and potential
complications in the

00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:45.087
initial phases of this stroke.

00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:47.422
Sometimes with an
antihypertensive to lower

00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:50.589
blood pressure, and thus
the amount of bleeding

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:52.681
that's happening in the brain,

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.781
and sometimes with an
anticonvulsant to prevent

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.882
any possible seizures,
and sometimes with drugs

00:01:57.882 --> 00:01:59.901
to reduce swelling in the brain.

00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:02.060
So a few different
medication options for these

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.886
two types of strokes, but
what else can be done?

00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:07.314
I mean, we've all seen
McDreamy the neurosurgeon

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:09.832
rush into the O.R. with his fancy hair,

00:02:09.832 --> 00:02:12.467
and his "it's a great
day to save lives" spiel,

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.209
what's he up to?

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.346
By the way, he's the neurosurgeon from the

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:20.211
thrilling drama "Grey's Anatomy".

00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:22.405
In the case of ischemic
strokes, the surgeons won't

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:25.273
usually be called to
surgery unless the patient

00:02:25.273 --> 00:02:27.932
isn't responding to thrombolytics.

00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:29.928
So thrombolytics are usually tried first

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:32.586
if the patient's still
within the few hour window

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.525
that they work best in.

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:36.569
Otherwise if the surgeons
are treating a patient

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.728
with an ischemic stroke,
they might be doing one of

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:41.720
a few different but
similar types of procedures

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.575
with the ultimate goal
of removing the clot

00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:46.444
that causes a stroke.

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:48.337
So, one little device
that they might use is

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:50.798
called the "MERCI Retriever", and this was

00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:52.780
actually the first ever
little gadget that was

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.916
approved for clot removal
after ischemic stroke.

00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:58.121
So, let's look at what MERCI stands for

00:02:58.121 --> 00:02:59.619
to get an idea of how it works.

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.521
MERCI's an acronym, right?

00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:04.240
So it stands for Mechanical Embolus

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.791
Removal in Cerebral ischemia.

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.056
And how does it work?

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.332
Well, let's just look at the general idea

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:13.271
instead of bogging you down with all the

00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:15.941
technical details here.

00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:17.741
So, essentially what happens is that

00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:19.911
as part of this procedure
a surgeon will insert

00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:22.981
a little wire into an
artery and sort of thread

00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:26.062
it up into the brain,
guide it along the arteries

00:03:26.062 --> 00:03:28.107
and get up into the brain here.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:31.448
And then the wire gets
pushed just past the clot

00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:33.041
and that thing in blue there is actually

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.522
a little sheath, the
wire is actually inside

00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:38.250
the sheath, and then when the sheath gets

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.105
retracted the wire starts to actually coil

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:44.148
up on its own.

00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:47.108
And then as the wire is slowly retracted,

00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:49.105
as you can probably
imagine it'll sort of catch

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:52.007
on to the clot, it'll grab onto the clot

00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:53.320
nice and tight.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.269
And then the wire and the clot together

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.544
they're both removed, and now blood can

00:03:58.544 --> 00:04:01.029
perfuse this area again and try to save

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.060
all this brain tissue here.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.692
So that's MERCI retrieval,
it's pretty cool stuff.

00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:09.060
And another way that
ischemic strokes can be

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.056
treated surgically is with suction.

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:12.241
So how does that work?

00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:14.098
Well again here, same sort of deal.

00:04:14.098 --> 00:04:17.019
A tube goes into the
artery and from here a

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.072
little wire is put through
the tube and positioned

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:22.592
so it's right behind the clot.

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:24.762
Then this tube sort of
turns into a little vacuum

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:27.339
cleaner that starts to
suck in, and while it's

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:30.601
sucking in, a wire gets
pushed back and forth

00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.412
a few times through this
clot to break it up.

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:35.542
And all the little
pieces that break off and

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:37.201
eventually the whole thing, the whole clot

00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:39.326
gets sucked into this little vacuum here.

00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:41.521
So that's the suction method.

00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:43.343
And so there's a few
other little variations

00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:45.223
on these two procedures for clot removal,

00:04:45.223 --> 00:04:47.616
you know, some using little mesh tubes

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:49.705
called "stents" and some others with some

00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:51.981
different mechanisms but
I'll leave it at this

00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:53.583
for now.

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.195
So those two that we just talked about,

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.354
those are treatments for ischemic strokes,

00:04:57.354 --> 00:04:59.617
but if our surgeon was
treating a hemorrhagic

00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:01.592
stroke where one of the major goals is to

00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:03.890
control the bleeding,
he might be doing some

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.050
other things, some different procedures.

00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:10.242
So there's one called "aneurysm clipping".

00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:12.622
And what that is is,
well we know that if an

00:05:12.622 --> 00:05:16.105
aneurysm in the brain
bursts or sort of ruptures,

00:05:16.105 --> 00:05:18.601
then it'll start to
spill blood out into the

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.247
brain space right?

00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:23.488
Well, one way to fix
that is for the surgeon

00:05:23.488 --> 00:05:26.146
to place a clip that
kind of looks like this

00:05:26.146 --> 00:05:29.223
thing here, it's like
a metal clip that then

00:05:29.223 --> 00:05:32.381
gets clamped on to the
base of the aneurysm.

00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:34.865
So now that clip has
blocked blood from coming

00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:37.222
through here and spilling
out, so now blood can

00:05:37.222 --> 00:05:39.939
just continue along its
merry little way, right?

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.096
So, that's one way to treat a hemorrhagic

00:05:42.096 --> 00:05:44.732
stroke with these clips.

00:05:44.732 --> 00:05:46.891
Another procedure a neurosurgeon might do,

00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:49.375
and again this is in
cases where a hemorrhage

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:52.197
was caused by a burst aneurysm,

00:05:52.197 --> 00:05:55.041
is something called "Coil Embolization",

00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:57.653
and in coil embolization you'll kinda see

00:05:57.653 --> 00:06:00.253
why this name is fitting in a minute here.

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:02.274
The surgeon will insert a little tube into

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:05.073
the arterial system again,
we're back to the tubes

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.695
again so it'll get threaded
up into the cerebral

00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:10.835
arteries until it's
basically right inside the

00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:15.015
aneurysm right at the
mouth of the aneurysm.

00:06:15.015 --> 00:06:19.019
And then, this flexible little wire gets

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:21.921
threaded in through the
tube and it starts to now

00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:25.137
coil up inside the dilated out part of the

00:06:25.137 --> 00:06:27.077
artery, the aneurysm here.

00:06:27.077 --> 00:06:29.943
And then more and more wire gets pushed in

00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:31.976
through the tube and
into the aneurysm and it

00:06:31.976 --> 00:06:34.738
just coils and coils and coils.

00:06:34.738 --> 00:06:37.478
And eventually blood now
can't even really enter

00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:40.079
that aneurysm even if it wanted to.

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.414
So, two things.

00:06:41.414 --> 00:06:43.921
One, blood can now start to clot right?

00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:46.104
It can start to clot
onto all this material

00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:48.437
in the aneurysm here and stop any bleeding

00:06:48.437 --> 00:06:51.293
from happening, so awesome, thumbs up.

00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:54.335
And two, blood in this
artery here now it doesn't

00:06:54.335 --> 00:06:56.517
even have the option to duck up into this

00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:58.920
aneurysm and cause trouble anymore because

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.173
of this clotted up coil.

00:07:01.173 --> 00:07:03.913
So now blood just
continues to go about its

00:07:03.913 --> 00:07:06.141
business I guess down over this way.

00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:08.220
So, double thumbs up.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.774
So, those are some of the
surgical interventions

00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:13.941
for ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke treatment.
