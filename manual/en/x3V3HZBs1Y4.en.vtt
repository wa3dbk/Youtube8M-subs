00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:09.466
[Upbeat music]

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.609
Severe weather can develop quickly. 

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:18.330
Advances in forecasting

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:21.070
allow the NOAA National Weather Service

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:22.983
to predict severe weather...

00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:28.520
before there’s even a cloud in the sky.

00:00:30.378 --> 00:00:33.875
Severe thunderstorm and tornado watches give you

00:00:33.982 --> 00:00:36.696
advance notice that conditions are favorable

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:38.100
for dangerous weather.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.229
When your area is in a watch,

00:00:41.643 --> 00:00:44.176
be sure to stay alert for changing weather.  

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:47.458
Remember, a watch is not a warning.

00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:51.786
A warning is only issued when severe weather is about to strike.

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:57.184
The NOAA Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.801
monitors weather conditions across the United States.

00:01:01.747 --> 00:01:05.507
They issue daily forecasts showing areas of the country

00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.576
that are likely to experience severe weather.

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:11.585
In the hours before storms form,

00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:14.111
the Storm Prediction Center discusses the weather

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.972
with National Weather Service Forecast Offices

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.014
within the areas at risk.

00:01:20.437 --> 00:01:22.910
The Storm Prediction Center then issues a watch

00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:27.392
to notify people in those areas to stay alert for severe weather.

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:32.445
A watch also includes information about what type of weather

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.943
you might see and the chances of it actually occurring.

00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:39.500
The risk level can range from a few storms

00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:41.154
with hail and high winds

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.870
to a Particularly Dangerous Situation 

00:01:44.142 --> 00:01:46.000
when deadly tornadoes could occur.

00:01:47.087 --> 00:01:49.901
The most important thing you can do when a watch is issued

00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:54.419
is to stay alert for developing storms and understand your risk.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.243
Be sure to tune in to your local news

00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:59.206
for the updated weather information.

00:02:01.018 --> 00:02:03.237
You can also get instant weather alerts

00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:04.796
from NOAA Weather Radio.

00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:08.620
Watches also provide an opportunity...

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.105
to review your family emergency plan as well as

00:02:12.213 --> 00:02:14.066
check your disaster supplies kit.

00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:16.619
When the risk increases

00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:19.211
and severe weather moves in,

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:22.200
you’ll be ready if a warning is issued.

00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:25.996
If you need help developing a plan for your family

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:30.960
or packing a kit, check out ready.gov for all the information.

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:34.940
Stay alert... and stay safe this storm season.
