00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.620
Manipulators allow you to quickly translate,
rotate, and scale objects. The manipulators

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.730
that come with the T-Splines plugin can be
used on all T-Splines and Rhino objects, including

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.250
NURBS and meshes.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.149
To activate the translate manipulator, click
the manipulator icon from the heads up display

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.320
or select from the dropdown menu.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.320
Drag a manipulator axis in the desired direction
to constrain movement to the X, Y, or Z axis.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.090
Drag a manipulator disc to constrain movement
to the XY, XZ, or YZ planes.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.430
Drag the center box for unconstrained movement.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.250
Double-click a manipulator axis to type in
an exact distance for movement.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.680
Enter a negative number to move the selected
object(s) in the opposite direction.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.670
Activate the rotate manipulator by clicking
the manipulator icon in the heads-up display,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.100
or by selecting it from the dropdown menu.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.100
The rotation manipulator is comprised of a
ring along each axis for rotation.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.240
It responds similarly to the translate manipulator:
drag a ring for manual rotation; double-click

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.749
a ring to enter an exact rotational degree.

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:37.520
Activate the scale manipulator by clicking
the manipulator icon on in the heads-up display, or

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.819
by selecting it from the drop down menu.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:47.520
To use the scale manipulator, drag one axis
to scale the object(s) in 1D.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.329
To scale in 2D, pull one of the grey discs
that lie in a plane.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:00.329
To scale in 3D, pull the center box. Double
click to enter an exact scale factor.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.999
With all the manipulators, you can act on one object, 
on parts of an object, or on many objects.
