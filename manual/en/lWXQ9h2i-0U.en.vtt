00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.800
&gt;&gt; ItÕs amazing, I didnÕt know much about
it before I came today.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.250
ItÕs for FR cars running on Continental tires,
everybody runs on the same tires so itÕs

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:26.260
a great opportunity to show everybodyÕs tunings.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:39.210
Well the Continental Extreme contact was a
great tire for me.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.330
I have a Nissan S13 with a S15 conversion
on the front.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:01:00.079
A 1990 chasis with a SR20 motor.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:08.820
For a street tire shootout, I think they performed
really well predictable and easy to drive.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.689
I rely on Evasive Motorsports for their custom
shocks and coilovers.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:22.499
They do my alignment and they really set my
car up and itÕs easy to drive.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.499
ItÕs a 2004 Honda S2000, itÕs a daily driven
car.

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:27.450
Basically, set the focuses on suspension rather
than power, so itÕs really reliable and itÕs

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.249
also smog legal so itÕs a good car.

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:35.270
ItÕs a supercharged S2000 that I didnÕt
even know was supercharged because the powerband

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.270
is so linear.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.399
ItÕs so drivable and itÕs a street car,
the car is great, the tires are great the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.619
engine is unbelievable.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.079
Shawn at Church does a great job at tuning
the powerband so I was out there just having

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.729
so much fun on the Continental tires in ShawnÕs
car and just having fun up here.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:59.990
ThereÕs some amazing prepared cars and its
really inspiring to see a group of guys and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.529
gals up here in an environment to be able
to have the same competitive running class

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:05.319
which is great.
