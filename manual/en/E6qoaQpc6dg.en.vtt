00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.259
THERAPIST
So, it sounds to me like you’re concerned

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.390
that you and your brothers are growing apart.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.380
OLDEST PIG
No!

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.619
I’m saying it’s scary to have a goddamn
wolf beast STALKING you and it’s scary when

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.090
your dip shit younger brothers don’t take
anything seriously and don’t seem to have

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.429
any concern for their own safety!

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.669
HIPPIE PIG
Namaste, brother.

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.560
I mean, who’s really afraid of the big bad
wolf?

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.210
OLDEST PIG
I would be.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.929
You built a goddamn house out of straw!

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.789
HIPPIE PIG
Half straw, half hemp!

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.330
It’s an organic hybrid building material
that’s better for the earth!

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.330
OLDEST PIG
Oh yeah!

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.579
That’ll be real nice when a rabid fucking
wolf dog is after you!

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:41.579
Jesus Christ.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.789
Am I the only one who has seen The Grey here?!

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:43.789
THERAPIST
I’m sorry...

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:44.789
The Grey?

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.789
OLDEST PIG
Yes, Liam Neeson?

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:46.789
It’s like Taken but with Wolves.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:47.789
HIPPIE PIG
Listen brother, I would rather be eaten by

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.789
a beautiful wolf in a home with a small carbon
footprint than live in a house made of brick.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:49.789
Brick! it’s dried mud ! I’m not going
back to that life!

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:50.789
THERAPIST
Okay.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.789
Well, we haven’t really heard from your
other brother...

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:52.870
YOUNGEST PIG
I like sticks.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.239
OLDEST PIG
He watched our dad become sausage.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.589
THERAPIST
Daddy issues.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.329
So tell me how did all of this wolf business
happen?

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.850
HIPPIE PIG
Well it all started last week I was just relaxing

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.850
in my house.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.479
Burning incense, listening to some Jack Johnson,
dreamscaping.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.850
And I see this beautiful wolf outside and
he yells to me "little pig, little pig let

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.850
me in."

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.850
THERAPIST
And you then said no?

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.930
HIPPIE PIG
I said, not by the hair on my chinny chin

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.930
chin.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.170
OLDEST PIG
How about, no fucking way are you coming into

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.170
my HOME!

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.820
I’m calling the POLICE.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.460
Get off my PROPERTY!

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.200
Did you see what happened to that red riding
hood girl?!

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.590
A goddamn tragedy.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.979
am I the only who doesn’t get his news from
a drum circle.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.020
YOUNGEST PIG
I like sticks.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.710
OLDEST PIG
Can it, sling blade.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.280
HIPPIE PIG
Oh you’re just jealous that I can grow facial

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
hair and you can’t!

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.530
OLDEST PIG
I can grow facial hair!

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.610
I have to shave for my JOB.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.070
Ever heard of one of those?!

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.380
THERAPIST
Okay, okay gentlemen.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.119
I can see we have a lot of different emotions
coming up here.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.329
YOUNGEST PIG
I like sticks.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.600
THERAPIST
Good Peter.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.869
Now please continue.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.960
HIPPIE PIG
Anyway, then his ASSHOLE huffs and puffs and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.260
he freakin blows my house in!

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.260
Total buzzkill.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.540
And I’m talking a HUGE breath here.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.470
Like this wolf has been doing some serious
tantric breathing exercises.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.470
THERAPIST
Go on.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.569
HIPPIE PIG
So then I run to Peters house and 20 minutes

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.750
later the same shit happens.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.040
Peter’s in his freaking underwear crying.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.280
The house is trashed.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.150
OLDEST PIG
So guess what!?

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.080
They end up at my place.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080
Safe!

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.599
And now my beautiful New Brick single family
home smells like patuli oil and is covered

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.980
in little sticks.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.790
Oh, and I’m pretty sure I have a dead wolf
stuck in my chimney!

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:51.440
YOUNGEST PIG
I 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.060
like sticks.
