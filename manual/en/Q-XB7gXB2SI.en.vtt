Wow these outdoor wireless speakers sound

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.170
great. (phone rings) Typical. Hi this is Brian
from AV Express...Hey Boss...Yeah, I am working.......I'm

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.910
working on, my review of these awesome bluetooth
outdoor wireless speakers.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.939
&nbsp;
OK ,hey gotta go, the water is calling me.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.939
I said my daughter is calling me. Close! Probably
should get back to work but want to at least

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.530
share with you a review of these fantastic
outdoor wireless speakers from sound appeal.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.640
&nbsp;
Do you own outdoor speakers?&nbsp; If so, they

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.760
probably have wires running back into the
house. Have to run inside to turn it down,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.850
change the music? Yeah. Want to work in the
garage or workout in your basement but not

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.730
have to wire back through the house to the
stereo system?

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.510
&nbsp;
Spend the summer out on the deck or by the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.259
pool and want to hear your stored music collection?
How about getting your music on your boat?

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.799
Well say hello to the speakers from Sound
appeal.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.350
&nbsp;
These Bluetooth wireless outdoor speakers

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.950
will play your music with no wires into the
house. Make that no wiring back to anywhere.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.009
No big receiver needed, and never have to
run back to another room or inside to change

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.049
the station, source or volume.
&nbsp;

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.490
&nbsp;
With these wireless outdoor speakers with

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.990
Bluetooth, you can wirelessly stream music
up to 60ft away from your smart phone, tablet,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.450
or any Bluetooth compatible device.&nbsp; It is
all controlled easily from your fingertips.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.569
&nbsp;
These stereo speakers have a 6.5" woofer that

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:50.509
delivers deep, rich bass. It uses a butyl
rubber seal around the driver to ensure long

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.389
life in all weather conditions. A one inch
dome tweeter relays smooth highs without harshness

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:58.789
so voices remain clean and clear.
&nbsp;

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.630
The built in high efficiency Class D amplifier
has been matched to the speakers. So plenty

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.009
of power to fill the backyard
&nbsp;

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.080
If you live in an area where it snows, like
me, easily take these speakers inside to your

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.970
garage, basement, or living room. Quickly
plug in and you are back in business. Or just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.349
leave them outside! They are not only waterproof
Bluetooth speakers, but weatherproof too!

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.350
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.050
As you can see with this diagram, set up is
quick and simple. Just plug one of the speakers

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.500
into a power source. Then one and only speaker
wire connection runs between the speakers.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.280
Turn them on via the weatherproof power switch
and connect to your Bluetooth device.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.200
&nbsp;
Just that quickly you are enjoying iTunes,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.070
google play, iheart radio, Pandora, or sports
radio to hear the game. Inside the cabinet,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.320
the walls have a thick rigid bracing to prevent
unwanted vibrations, allowing for clean, clear

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.340
sound at all levels.
&nbsp;

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.920
Heavy-duty powder coated mounting hardware
is long lasting and included to easily mount

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.160
to an eave or wall.&nbsp; It uses a posi-lock
design which holds the speaker at any angle

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.569
and is quick and easy to put up or take down
without tools.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.790
&nbsp;
The Bluetooth wireless outdoor speakers by

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.040
sound appeal deliver top quality performance
with deep bass, clear voice and simple connectivity

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.300
and easy control.

patio, deck, pool, garage or basement too.
