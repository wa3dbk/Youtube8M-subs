00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.790
Today we're going to be taking a closer
look at the Kompact Kamp Mini Mate

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.339
motorcycle camper trailer

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.970
the mini mate features a full
fiberglass body and lid design

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.050
has a double bed and sets up in

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.170
just two minutes

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.829
and i'm gonna show you

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.329
exactly how it sets up and folds down in
this instructional video

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.990
the first thing that you want to do

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.830
when

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.050
pulling into your campsite is

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.120
get the trailer level

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.910
there are four telescoping jacks

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.860
on the body of the mini mate

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.540
pull them down and adjust them to

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.750
make the body level

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.150
next i'm going to pull the luggage rack

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.070
off the top push two pins to release it

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.570
place it on the stands on the lid

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.090
unlock the lid

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.200
by releasing the hasp

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.200
and i'm ready to swing the lid open

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.490
now the way i have it folded down

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.119
i can pull this

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.830
back bow up

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.210
and the canvas comes up with it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.729
then you have a telescoping pole here
you color match the bow and the pole end

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:29.600
 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.880
we'll see when we take a look inside the
trailer

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.860
and i'll place it in between the two
upright bows

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.880
then i'll step inside the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.050
trailer

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.320
to get a better

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.170
angle here to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.950
pull it tight

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.900
push out the pole

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.640
and you simply twist to lock

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.570
and again with the bottom bow

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.570
place the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.740
pole into position

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.399
spread it out and twist to lock

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.639
so basically as you can see the

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:05.049
tent is

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.339
set up and i'm going to go around and

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.409
pull the drip edge

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.699
over

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:18.699
for rain run off

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.889
now as we look inside the trailer

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.809
you'll notice here that the body side
of the bed is lower

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.019
for travel so that everything can

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.529
fold in

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.109
and everything that's underneath there

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.579
is storage

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.839
it is fifteen cubic feet of storage

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:39.590
and it can be

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.759
accessed

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:41.829
without setting up

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.359
the entire unit

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.499
just by

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.229
swinging open the door

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.709
now as you get ready to raise the

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.180
body side bed up level with the lid

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.589
i will take out this

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.540
double bed insert

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.229
and the cushion

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:05.599
and swing this table board up on a
double acting hinge

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.189
pull the board supports upright

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.820
and fit it into the notch

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.849
for a secure setup

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.419
the cushion i'm gonna

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.869
turn a quarter turn to fill up

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:20.449
the gap there and make a nice tight fit

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:25.409
and your bed is set up there for
the single bed

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.419
if you need the extra

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.319
space extra bedding

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.159
you can then again insert your

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.169
double bed

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.529
for the extra space

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:42.749
here's a look inside after the bed is
setup you can see the room you have

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:44.379
there

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.749
there are

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:50.239
windows with screens in them for cross
ventilation

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.899
and here you'll see the color codes of
the poles and the bows red to red

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:56.629
yellow to yellow

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.049
and down at the end

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.539
blue to blue

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:05.289
now here you'll see

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.839
that there is a bungee cord on that far bow

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.029
i'll show you

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:12.939
how to use that

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.150
if you once again

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.419
take your cushions off

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.669
instead of swing the table down into
travel position

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.060
strap the bungee upright

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.919
put your cushion in upright

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.180
and your double bed insert

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.560
in as a bench

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.999
you have a comfortable place to sit

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:38.189
out of the weather

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.119
fold down is just in the reverse order

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:42.969
i'm gonna step inside

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.519
and lower my bed

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.120
release my

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.100
telescoping poles

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.100
and let the bows fold in

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.469
and pull the bows in

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:01.479
now for

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.599
the front bow towards the tongue i'm
going to release the canvas off of that

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.419
and let that fall down completely

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.280
and the back bow

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.019
near the door that you see here i'm
going to keep the canvas on just

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:16.469
relieve it a little bit

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.599
so that it folds down

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.400
that way when i pull the bow up for
assembly set up

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.070
the canvas comes up with it

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.310
and you can get in easier

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.469
you want to make sure to try to fold the canvas in evenly

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:34.449
and

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.679
smooth it out so as not

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:40.530
to create bunching

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.150
fold in all the edges here

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.900
get the drip edge up over

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.510
once it's nice and flat

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.650
you flip the lead over

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.300
i'm gonna take special note of these two
positions here by the hinge

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.229
making sure that i'm not pinching any of
the canvas

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.930
and then slowly

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.930
let the lid down allowing the air to
come out of the tent

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.460
and go around make sure all the

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.280
canvas is in

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.039
and you can

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.919
latch the lid with the hasp

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.249
put the luggage rack

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:27.629
back into position through the stands

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:31.149
put the luggage rack back into
position

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:35.509
placing it through the stands and
snapping into place

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.979
and once you put your jacks up you're
ready to hit the road

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.520
