A&nbsp;dragonfly&nbsp;is an&nbsp;insect&nbsp;belonging to the order&nbsp;Odonata, the suborder&nbsp;Epiprocta&nbsp;or, in the strict sense, the infraorder&nbsp;Anisoptera

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.320
It is characterized by large multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong transparent&nbsp;wings, and an elongated body

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.080
Dragonflies possess six legs (like any other insect), but most of them cannot walk well.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.800
Dragonflies are among the fastest flying insects in the world.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:48.880
Dragonflies are important&nbsp;predators&nbsp;that eat&nbsp;mosquitoes, and other small insects like&nbsp;flies, bees,&nbsp;ants,&nbsp;wasps, and very rarely&nbsp;butterflies.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:00.480
They are usually found around marshes, lakes, ponds, streams, and&nbsp;wetlands&nbsp;because their&nbsp;larvae, known as "nymphs", are aquatic

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.000
Some 5680 different species of dragonflies are known in the world today.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:15.520
In flight the adult dragonfly can propel itself in six directions; upward, downward, forward, back, and side to side.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.360
The adult stage of larger species of dragonfly can last as long as five or six months.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.760
They breathe through gills in their&nbsp;rectum, and can rapidly propel themselves by suddenly expelling water through the anus.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.680
Though dragonflies are predators, they themselves are subject to predation by birds, lizards....

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.320
... frogs, spiders, fish, water bugs, and even other large dragonflies.
