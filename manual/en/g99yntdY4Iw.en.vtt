00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.980
Hey everyone!

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.060
Jaystepher with Balloon Cart by Lego Creator.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.060
Set number 40108.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.880
Contains 66 pieces.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.660
Recommended building ages are 6 and up.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.960
Looks like we have a young child

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.900
purchasing a balloon from the balloon vendor.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.240
Here's his cart.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.400
Looks like we get to make the balloons and some helium tanks.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.280
It is packaged in a polybag.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.640
Let's take a look at the contents.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.580
The parts are packed loose in the package.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.900
One small folded instruction manual.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.920
Now let's explore the Balloon Cart.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.860
Before we take a look at the Balloon Cart,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.280
let's have a quick look at the minifigures.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.880
Let's start off with this young gentleman.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.380
He's got a big smile on his face.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.920
The graphics on his shirt are printed

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.040
The short dark-blue pants.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.800
Let's remove the hairpiece.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.000
He does have a double-sided head.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.940
This one is of him crying.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.420
Terrific minifigure!

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.220
Let's take a look at the vendor.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.620
It appears he's happy as well.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.620
Got the suit with the tie.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.440
That is printed on.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.060
Dark-red captain's hat.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.300
Print work does continue to the back.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.600
Terrific set of minifigures.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.020
Now let's explore the Balloon Cart.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.140
Let's have a look at this balloon.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.780
Very simple construction.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.560
It looks more like a lollipop.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.580
Here is the Balloon Cart itself.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.980
Got a handle on the front to carry it around.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.640
It does role in the two rubber tires.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.320
Got a container on the side

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.180
for extra deflated balloons.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.180
These can easily be removed

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.340
and put back in.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.480
Here's the rear.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.230
One is possibly for helium

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.770
and the other is for air.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.310
I'm not sure which one is which.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.800
Really nice cart.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.220
Let's taker our vendor

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.400
and our young gentleman.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.840
Let's give him a balloon

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.100
which is as big as he is.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.420
He even lost his hair over it.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.580
Okay....

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.920
Got to get it set just right.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.560
This concludes the review for the Lego Creator Balloon Cart.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.840
Set number 40108.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.930
Contains 66 pieces.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.490
Recommended building ages are 6 and up.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.370
For a small polybag set,

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.750
it has a lot of detail.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.170
It comes with two minifigures

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.770
and four balloons.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.170
It is a very colorful set.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.750
This will look good in any Lego city

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.950
or a Lego theme park.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.280
There were three spare pieces left over

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.040
which consist of two studs and one tap.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.720
These possibly can be extra balloons.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.140
Not much to say but it is a terrific little set for any Lego collection.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.380
Thank you for watching!
