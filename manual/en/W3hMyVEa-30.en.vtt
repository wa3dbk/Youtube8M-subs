Hi there! This is Daniel on behalf of Expert
Village. In this clip, we are going to be

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.360
installing a strike plate. We have mortised
out, we've pre-drilled the holes for the screws

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.550
so that we don't split the casing. Now we
are going to put the screws in. The easiest

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.450
way to do it because you are dealing with
3 inch and 1 inch screws. The 1 inch won't

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.460
hit the board in the back so it is not a big
deal with those ones you could just screw

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.420
those in with a regular screwdriver but you
are going to want to use a drill or an electronic

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.890
or a powered screwdriver in order to get the
longer ones in. Otherwise you will end up

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.890
stripping more likely not the heads of these.
Again, we are going to put the large screws

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.059
in the back. I'm simply going to start each
one of them so that my strike plates stays

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:24.780
in place. They go in nicely when you pre-drill
the holes. Now you want to make sure that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.020
you don't put the screws in all the way. You
want to go around in counterclockwise or clockwise

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:48.160
and slowly screw them in so that everything
lines up right.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.170
That is all there is to it.
