00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.450
Jeff from New Jersey, had a problem. He got
our splash guard and for some reason he wasn’t

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.969
able to peel the adhesive cover off. So, anyhow,
he ruined the first one. He had to take the

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.720
second one, and he ended up installing it
on this end, which meant out. And when he

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.490
told me about the problem, it was really disappointing.
So obviously, Jeff hadn’t seen the video

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.860
I had done for Christine, who lives in Denver,
who had this problem, six months ago. She

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.020
picked at the edge, you actually have to poke
the pin right in to the paper on the back,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.360
and then pull it up, and that’s the best
way to get it started. You just poke right

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.540
in through the paper, and right into the foam
adhesive, and then just peel it up, and it’ll

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.300
come off, on problem. But at any rate, for
Jeff, I decided to make a new shower splash

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.971
guard, I call it the “Water Stop”. It
doesn’t go up the wall 19”, the way the

00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:03.870
original one does, but what it allows him
to do, is make a mistake putting the first

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.670
one on. He can just take the other one, and
put it on in the same place because their

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.930
sort of ambidextrous. As long as you put the
wall portion on the inside, like this, it’ll

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.890
be fine. But if you wanted to put it on the
other end of the tub, the same thing applies,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.840
the wall portion, would then come over and
go on the inside, like that and it will still

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.330
look just like its supposed to. I painted
a couple of these, so I’m going to put one

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.530
of these on, so you can actually see the color.
I’ve just got a little straight pin, is

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.460
all I’ve got. Its going to go this way.
The wall side goes on the inside, so all I’m

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.380
going to do, is bend that over, and hold it
like that. Now, I need the bottom of the adhesive

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.360
to come off, there we are, that’s off. So,
all I’m going to do is hold that in position

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.859
like that, pull that to the end, like that,
and press it right down onto that grout (caulk

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.770
line), right into the corner. And then, from
there, I’m going to just lay this down and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.979
press it to the top of the tub. And there
we are. I can peel the rest of this off, and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:19.250
bring it up the wall. And there you have it.
Now I’d already cleaned this off with alcohol

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.200
and naphtha, so it was perfectly clean, and
the same here, and that’s all you need.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.910
And if you ever have to get this off. The
only way you can get it off, once its cured,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.850
is to cut it and peel it off. You’re going
to leave lots of that white tape gum on there,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.700
take some a mineral spirits. Here, they call
it varsol, but its mineral spirits, and they

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.520
usually use this to clean paint brushes. And
just paint that right on to that adhesive,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.030
what’s left of it, and then you can just
scrape it off with a Popsicle stick or something

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.910
like that. So there, these are 9” by 9”,
these shower splash guards. And that’s they

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.450
work, and that’s how easy it is to install
them. So, for the guys that hate reading instructions

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.430
and don’t want to watch the videos, maybe
this will be enough. Thanks for watching,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.900
talk to you soon.
