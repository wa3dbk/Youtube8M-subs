00:00:00.701 --> 00:00:02.302
(squeaking)

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:03.570
(pop)

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:09.943
(♪♪♪)

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.779
WOMAN:
If you were to visit Japan
at the beginning of May,

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.281
you would find
the air around you

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.816
filled with flying fish.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.818
Windsocks shaped like carp,

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.086
and known as Koinobori

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.488
are flown in honour
of Children's Day.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.790
The carp is considered
the strongest

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.292
and most courageous of fish

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.928
because it fights
the currents upstream.

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:30.497
Flying Koinobori
outside of a home

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.499
is a tradition
to honour the children,

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.068
so that they will grow up
healthy and strong as well.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.937
I'm going to show you

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:39.039
how to make
a beautiful Koinobori

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.073
that can
swim through the breezes

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.942
at your home or your school.

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:44.745
I begin with the piece
of Smart Fan.

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.848
This is a waterproof,
synthetic material

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.416
available in many colours.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.185
It's super strong,
and it's outdoor safe.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:56.056
I also have a small block
of Eco Karve,

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.357
block printing material,

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.193
onto which I've drawn
a scale shaped pattern.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:04.631
Using linoleum cutters,
and a bench hook for safety,

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:09.503
I carve a scale shape.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:11.538
So that the raised areas
that're left

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:16.743
make the design
I want to print.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.111
These tools are sharp,

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.782
so I'm careful to keep
my fingers behind the cutter.

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:29.456
And cut away from myself.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:36.730
Next, I fold
the fabric in half, vertically.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.300
And from a point about
four inches from the fold,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.909
I'm going to cut a curved line
to form the belly of the fish.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:59.553
I'll save those scraps
for making the tail later.

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:00.854
I plan for the mouth

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.256
by leaving about
two inches here at the top,

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:06.259
then mark the eye placement.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.732
The fabric is translucent
so I can fold it back over,

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:15.902
and mark the other eye
in exactly the same spot.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:20.340
Open it up, make sure you have
paper towels underneath it.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.510
Here's the finished block cut.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.117
Going to brush acrylic paint
evenly over the top of it,

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:33.920
then press down
to make my first scale.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.695
Repeat this multiple times.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:47.801
Not every print
will turn out perfectly,

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:51.638
and that's okay.

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:55.675
Once the scales
cover the entire body,

00:02:55.675 --> 00:03:00.814
I'll embellish the design
with acrylic paint.

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:03.116
This step shows
the painting in progress

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:05.252
with some white paint,

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:09.589
and also some
metallic gold paint.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:14.494
My next example,
shows the finished fish.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:20.367
That beautiful iridescent glow
is Sparkle Mod Podge.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.336
Now while this would be drying,

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.705
I would take the scraps
I've saved, paint them,

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.442
and cut them
to make tail pieces.

00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:32.779
To make the mouth
I folded the top over,

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:37.184
and used a blunt needle,
and heavy thread

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:38.618
to stitch a line across

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:42.322
leaving plenty of thread
at the end.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.292
Now I open a book ring,

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:54.234
and feed it through
the pocket I've created.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:59.639
One more stitch
holds the mouth closed.

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:05.045
The last part of this assembly

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:13.787
requires a line
of strong craft glue.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:18.024
Just along
the belly of the fish.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:31.938
Press it closed,
then take the tail pieces,

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:37.444
place a dot of glue
on all sides.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.222
Insert it.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:55.262
And use a paperclip to
hold it closed while it dries.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.765
Once the glue is dry,

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:02.936
it could be tied onto a dowel,
like a pole, or hung up to fly.

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.272
If it will be outdoors
I do recommend using wire

00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:08.141
because it'll provide
more strength than the thread.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.545
Full size Koinobori kites
such as these

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:14.714
can be made
following the same exact steps,

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:19.052
just use more fabric,
a larger scale,

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.922
and a macrame hoop
for the mouth.

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:24.724
You can view these instructions,

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:26.693
