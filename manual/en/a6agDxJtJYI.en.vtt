00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.480
Now here we are back at the bass pedals. It
can get, it's very easy to start jamming especially

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.471
when you put in gospel music or when you're
playing rock, there's, there are people that

00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:19.230
play more traditional styles of organ, but
here, we're kind of focus on gospel, contemporary

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.349
gospel. And, in that, in that room, you get,
it's easily to get excited. So when you're

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.440
playing the bass, sometimes you kind of stop
on the pedals and or you might stand. I've

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.632
seen in concert people standing up on organ.
Now if that's going to be what you're going

00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:42.670
to do, you know it's, I'm going to advice
that you use wisdom with it, because, with

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.170
this organ, this things are made in the 50's,
in the 60's and unless you have a brand new

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.830
organ, it can be kind of old. Think of like
stomping on your grandfather or your grand,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:03.190
maybe not. But here it goes, under the bass
pedals are these small ties here which connects

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.670
these very small button, that are like a finger,
smaller than my finger, that are being pressed

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.439
down. So keep that in mind, if you're stomping
on, on the pedals, that it's a very little

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.700
work that's going on on the bottom side of
here, very small action. So I can't say, because

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.249
maybe, you know, sometimes I'm the culprit,
I stomp on the pedals, but just keep it in

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:33.490
mind as you go along, you can get easy, very
easy to get excited and I find myself doing

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.479
a service, my friends make fun of me all the
time for getting under the organ and doing

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:54.770
one of these numbers, trying to get it, get
it unstop, 'cause sometimes it'll get stuck.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:03.499
So to avoid that, try not to stomp, try not
to stomp. Once again, try. Now the way that

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:08.490
you're going to bring that, bring that sound
out is by these two draw bars here, that's

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.750
where the bass pedals are located. That's
how you get the sound. Here, you can get a

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.650
little high in there if you want to. But to
me, in my opinion, it gets very nasal and

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.760
kind of annoying so, it depends on your style
after you develop your style. I keep it down

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.950
low, very rarely do I bring it up, pass that
if anything. So just a little explanation

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.689
and advisory notice if you're going to jam.
