00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.960
What advice would you give someone
thinking about going to uni?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.920
Don’t stress out
about your first degree.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.680
Most of my friends and I
have to some degree

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.600
have changed degrees
nearly entirely,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.920
whether it’s one of your degrees,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.680
or two of your degrees, 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.560
or just your majors or your minors.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.440
Don’t stress out, 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.480
the first years always
going to be a bit,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.880
oh see what I like,
see what I don’t like,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.520
you’re not going to like
what you start,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.320
I doubt it.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.080
I wouldn’t worry
if you’re sitting in a position

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.160
at the end of your first year
and you think,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.080
oh no I haven’t chosen
the right courses,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.400
or I didn’t do that from day one,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.960
especially at ANU where
you can transfer so easily.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.320
Yeah it’s like you don’t have to
make this life changing decision

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.160
at 17 moving away from home.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.880
And a lot of degrees they do
have a very common first year

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.080
and then you specialise.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.160
Which I think is really good
because like

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.800
when I left home I was like, 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.400
I want to be a mechanical engineer.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.240
I’m like
‘Oh engineering sounds good’,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.920
like that general area.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.680
And so, yeah, coming to ANU’s
really given me the opportunity

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.040
to explore what I like 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.400
and then go down that path

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.880
instead of being locked
into something

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.920
that I wasn’t passionate about 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.200
or that I wasn’t interested in,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
but still had to do any way.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.360
One of the pieces of advice that
I’d probably add is get involved in

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.120
as much as you can 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.720
and kind of step out of
your comfort zone a little bit.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.360
It can help you personally
develop so much more

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.640
but also like you will meet people,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.600
and you never know that
might help you discover a field

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.480
where you want to go 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.200
or it might even just clarify
what you want to do with your life.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.600
So I think ultimately just get involved
and enjoy it while you’re here.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.360
Yeah, I think it’s really important
to remember that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.320
universities not just about studying.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.760
There are so many
opportunities here.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.880
And just even like tagging along
with your friends to their lecture

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.600
can be like really rewarding.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.120
Even if it takes you away from
what you’re meant to be doing.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.360
Yeah immediately 
you can learn so much.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.600
You’re still learning.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.360
Exactly I guess another one
is like go to market day

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.960
in orientation week.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.520
Sign up to a few random
clubs and societies.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.480
Get as much free stuff.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.800
Yeah, free stuff as well.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.520
Yeah I’d also recommend
bring a bike,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.160
it helps to get between classes 
a bit quicker and that sort of stuff.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.000
And like I mean Canberra’s like
has so many nice bike paths

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and that sort of stuff.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.880
It’s relatively flat aside from
the mountains here and there.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.200
But generally to get around.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.960
There’s options.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.360
Yeah exactly.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.000
Well, I was really scared
coming in first

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.960
because I guess I’d never --

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.160
well I’d never left home and
I was coming to a new place.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.600
Yeah I would say chill 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.400
because there are a lot of
support networks around,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.880
there’s so many people around like

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.000
if you have any problems 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.280
like they’re always going
to be addressed,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.040
you’re always going to have a support
group network ready for you.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.480
When I said I was moving
to Canberra,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.800
people were like why Canberra?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800
Like what is that?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.560
So much.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.720
Yeah but like now I have
the answer to tell them,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.360
well no like we have not
just Questacon &lt;laughter&gt;

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.200
but a National Portrait Gallery

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.120
and we have a great
campus so yeah.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.800
And I think if you are
a prospective student,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.640
like just get in contact with the
colleges that you’re interested in

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.520
because when I came 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.440
I didn’t necessarily have
all the information.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.280
I just luckily it worked out.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.480
Whereas, you know, you do
have all the support there

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.000
from the people in the offices

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.800
and they’ll give you all
the information you need

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.880
to make an informed decision, 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.920
and to make sure that ANU’s
the right place for you so.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.680
I ended up taking a lot
of advice from people

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.080
who hadn’t come to ANU

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.560
and saying, “Oh no come to Sydney,
or come to Melbourne,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.360
do this.” 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.160
But just having a look
around here in O Week

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.440
and actually considering the options
that ANU would give to me,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.920
was the best decision I made
because I got to say,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.200
hey this is going to be
a really good opportunity

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.000
and it looks awesome, 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the people there say
it’s awesome,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.720
disregarding what a lot
of what people

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.600
who hadn’t experienced ANU
had said,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.160
was a really good decision
that I got to come here

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.840
and got to benefit from ANU
and they didn’t so.
