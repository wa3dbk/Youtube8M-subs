00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.690
You can use Avid’s Marquee software within
Avid Media Composer to create some amazing

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:05.960
effects.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.870
Check this out.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.660
To start, navigate to the toolsets menu and
choose the basic animation toolset.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.440
Since we are going to create some very large
characters, you will need to zoom out of the

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.530
Canvas area to see what you are typing.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.160
Click on the text tool, and give it a very
large font size.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.210
Go ahead and type your title.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.960
Then click on the edit tool within the toolbar
to select the text object.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.770
Within the Quick titles property box click
on the checkbox to change edge properties.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.640
Change the edge type to bevel wide.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.559
Then click on enable lighting.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.329
Next, drag your text object so it’s off
to the right side of the visible picture area.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.260
Now turn on the animation mode button.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.170
Move the playhead indicator to the end of
the Marquee timeline.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.600
Then move your text object off to the left
side of the visible picture area.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.760
If you play the animation you can see the
title now crawls across the screen.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.380
Turn off the red animation mode button.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.830
Within the Quick Titles Properties window,
turn off the main surface so you are left

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.990
with just the edge.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:42.530
Then navigate to the file menu and choose
– save to bin.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.520
After your title renders out, if you place
your title above some background video within

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.230
Avid, you end up with this.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:57.000
If you have a retail copy of Avid Media Composer,
navigate to the project window and click on

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.079
the effects icon.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.110
Then click on the BCC lights category.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.920
Find the BCC Rays Puffy filter and drop it
onto your title.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.340
Then click on the effect mode icon.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.870
Within the effect editor window, find the
title matte category and activate the ‘Apply

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.230
to Title Matte’ option.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.620
Then adjust the intensity and ray length to
your liking.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.790
Okay that’s it.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.150
Check it out!
