00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.059
Installing your Personal Caddy is a simple
and straightforward process.

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:23.550
Begin by opening the panel nearest to the cab,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.890
now take a pencil or any other writing
utensil and draw a line of the top of

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.000
t-nut.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.200
This will ensure that when you replace
your striker bolts you will not need to make any

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.290
additional adjustments.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.720
Once you've mark to position remove the
strike bolt.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.710
With the help of an additional person
lift caddy over the cover

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.300
and drop it into place between the striker clamps.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.350
Once your Personal Caddy is in place, take
the bulb seal attached to the caddy and tuck it

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.780
under the third panel.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.900
With your Personal Caddy in place and the
bulb seal tucked under the third panel,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.120
it's time to replace the striker bolts.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.120
Slide in your striker bolt and align the t-nut to the line you've previously drawn.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.520
Secure it

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.400
and once you've done the other side your
Personal Caddy is ready to use.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.470
One of the unique features of our
Personal Caddy is it suspended

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.130
installation,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.000
this allows for about 6 inches of
space below your caddy

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.840
so you can haul lumber,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.100
plywood,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.100
drywall, or any other longer items.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.410
One of the main benefits of our Personal
Caddy are its security features.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.640
By resting concealed below the tonneau
cover it is out of sight from would-be thieves.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.920
Another unique benefit of our Personal
Caddy is its ability to independently

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.949
lock from the rest of the truck bed.

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.969
That means if you're at home, work,

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.229
or on the job site 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.549
you can still allow access to the rest
of your truck bed 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.129
while leaving your Personal Caddy and its
contents

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.179
locked and secure.

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.809
Another great benefit of our Personal
Caddy is the 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.979
optional aluminum sliding tray.

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:35.059
This tray allows for additional space
to organize your smaller items up top

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.099
and also slides open

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.299
so you can store large items you don't
want your main compartment.
