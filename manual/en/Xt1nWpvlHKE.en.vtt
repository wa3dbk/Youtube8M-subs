00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.529
Now, I'm going to show you some basic bartending
secrets. The number one secret, that I don't

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.350
think most people know, is that secretly,
bartenders are not trying to get you drunk.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.330
As a bartender, it's kind of your worst nightmare,
when someone gets too drunk. First of all,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.160
you have to worry about them driving home,
and second of all, you just have to worry

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.400
about them making your job more difficult.
They're going to be running around the bar.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.570
They could be climbing on furniture. They
could be spilling drinks. They could be harassing

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.669
other patrons, so really your job is to not
get bartenders drunk, or not to get bartenders

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.480
drunk either, but not to get customers drunk.
The next thing I'm going to show you is a

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.989
trick with pouring, so say you do have someone
for example, who keeps telling you to make

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.460
their drinks stronger, when you know you've
put the right amount in, or for example, is

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.030
maybe has had a little too much, but you know
this is going to be their last drink, because

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.030
they already called the cab, so you're making
them one more drink, and you don't want to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.690
get them too drunk. I will give you an example
of what to do. We're going to fill our glass

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:02.611
up, and this is another reason why it's really
important to fill the glass all the way to

00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:06.930
the top. It's because it leaves less room
for alcohol. It leaves less room for mixer,

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.460
and it's just going to chill the glass really
well, so we're going to make a drink real

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.071
quick. Now, this is the secret. What you'd
typically do, is you'd make the drink first,

00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:18.460
and then you'd put the stir in, but for example,
if you would like to make someone think they're

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.420
getting a stronger drink than they are, you're
just going to put the stir right in the top,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
and when you pour the alcohol, you're going
to pour it right over the straw, and this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.500
can be kind of tricky. It's great to do this
if the person's not looking, but even if they

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.840
are, they'll think you're doing some sort
of a trick, so now the first sip they take,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.090
is going to be pretty strong, so that's one
thing you can do to make someone's drink a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.451
little bit, a little bit more, appear to be
a little bit more strong, and the other thing

00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:47.979
you can do, and again when you do this, you're
not going to want to mix it. You're just going

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.259
to want to leave it like this, because you
know right now, the vodka is on the straw.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.610
The other thing, is say for example you are
mixing the drink, and you want them to think

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.430
they're getting a stronger drink, you're going
to make the drink first. Add the straw, and

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.120
then tell them, you know what, I'm going to
add a little bit more, or if they tell you

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.649
to add a little bit more, and you just go
like that, and you literally put one drop

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.110
on the top of it, and this is kind of a way
just to make sure that your patrons aren't

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.650
going to be too drunk to drive home, or just
too drunk in general, and make your life difficult,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.680
and that is some secrets to bartending.
