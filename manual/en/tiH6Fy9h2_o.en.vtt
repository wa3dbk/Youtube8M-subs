00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.028
- Hi everyone!

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.821
How’s it going?

00:00:01.823 --> 00:00:03.113
Welcome back.

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:06.325
Today’s video, I’m going
to do a Dress It Yourself.

00:00:06.326 --> 00:00:08.578
I feel like it’s been such a long time

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.371
since I’ve done one, but since Fall is

00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:13.916
around the corner I thought
it’s a great time to do so,

00:00:13.918 --> 00:00:16.670
and I’m also really excited because

00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:19.965
Kohl’s had reached out
to me and let me select

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.466
some limited edition items from the

00:00:22.468 --> 00:00:24.801
Elie Tahari Capsule Collection,

00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:28.306
which is really, really amazing and nice.

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:30.225
So I can’t wait to share with you guys

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:31.851
the pieces that I selected

00:00:31.853 --> 00:00:34.061
and how I’m going to mix and match

00:00:34.063 --> 00:00:36.105
these pieces with things I already have

00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:38.275
in my closet for this Fall time,

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:40.695
so let’s go ahead and
jump right into this.

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:45.513
(‘Shake It Off’ by Rezonate)

00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:22.305
(‘Coloured Glass’ by Draper)

00:05:30.818 --> 00:05:32.110
That is it for today, guys.

00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:33.570
I hope you enjoyed this video.

00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:35.238
If you do, I would really appreciate

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.990
a thumb’s up, and also comment below

00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:40.160
letting me know which
pieces are your favorite.

00:05:40.161 --> 00:05:43.913
Mine is this jacket, the shirt dress,

00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:44.913
and the sweaters.

00:05:44.915 --> 00:05:46.331
I really, really love the sweaters.

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.751
If you guys are curious where to get these

00:05:48.753 --> 00:05:50.753
items from you can find them online

00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:53.088
or at selected Kohl’s stores.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.883

information below this video

00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:58.803
