On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Jim
Dufresne and I'm here to tell you about jazz

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:25.259
guitar.
Jazz guitar is like a language. It's not a

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:34.579
language but it is like a language in that
it is extensive in so many different styles.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:50.190
Solo jazz guitar tends to have a bass line
built in to the song.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.880
So your chord choices are going to be a little
different. You know, back in the old days

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:13.289
folk guitar you'd have the bass happen like
that (plays)... alternate bass (plays). That's

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:22.820
what we want to work towards, integrate the
bass line into the song. Sometimes bass can

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:54.040
be very simple... (plays)... or you can have
a walking bass... (plays)
