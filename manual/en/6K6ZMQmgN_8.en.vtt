00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:09.350
Hi, Robin here with another recent lesson.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.089
This lady was complaining of slice shots,
weak ball flight, high weak ball flight, losing

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.010
distance, didn't see much compression on the
ball, generally not getting a penetrating

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.210
ball flight.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.630
If this shot pattern sounds similar to you,
this might be a good lesson for you to watch

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.449
out.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.800
Like all of us, when you see your swing on
camera, very often you see many things you'd

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.260
like to change, but that's not the way to
go about improving your golf.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.370
You've got to focus in on what the most important
aspect is, what one thing you'll get most

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.110
improvement from, understand that, make the
change, and see what you get.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.570
Often other things will change in your swing
as a result of changing one thing, and that's

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.430
what we saw during this lesson.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.570
We focused in on the way her right arm moved
during the swing.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.650
You'll see in the back swing, there is no
loading of the right arm, no loading of the

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.870
right wrist, it's almost like she just lifted
her right arm in the back swing.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.900
Very similar in the down swing.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.720
The elbow would stay where it was as the club
head started to move.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.200
That would create no load in the club shaft,
no load in the wrist, separating the right

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.250
elbow from the left arm, obviously putting
the right arm behind her body and then a difficult

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.850
position to get the club on plane.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.810
Continue that to impact.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.100
Again, the right arm basically was not applying
any pressure to give any load in the club.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.740
You can see that at impact.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.890
The right arm is still very bent.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.850
This created a position where she couldn't
really pressurize - put any pressure on the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.970
ball.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.170
That's why she got a weak ball flight, and
also just the elbow being on this angle will

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.270
always result in the club cutting across the
ball on a load path, creating that cut shot.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.110
Two reasons why she would be losing distance
and accuracy.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.070
So, as I said to her actually, quite a complicated
a movement she had with her right arm and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.370
probably quite difficult to explain.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.220
But basically she wasn't putting any pressure
in her right arm during the swing.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.880
She wasn't loading her right arm in the back
swing, and she wasn't using her right arm

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.160
to create some pressure in the down swing.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.630
That's what we focused on.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.170
We started with a short club, I asked her
to feel like she loaded her right wrist in

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.890
the back swing, she felt like the club was
pressing against, loading into her right index

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.420
finger, that was a real key point.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.430
Her feet back point, if she was doing it correctly.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.350
And then load up more as she came down, putting
more pressure on the index finger.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.040
Feeling like there was a punch bag here and
she was trying to punch the bag with her right

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.850
arm.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.630
So loading the right arm in the back swing,
and then creating more pressure with her right

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.820
arm, punching the bag, leaving the club behind,
feeling pressure on the right index finger.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.900
A great exercise for anybody who is struggling,
early releasing, stooping, not getting solid

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.120
contact.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.900
She learned the movement first with short
swings, one arm only, and then just built

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.270
it up to her own club with the same movement,
loading the right wrist on the back swing,

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:41.150
and then loading the wrist and arm more as
she really felt some pressure pushing forward

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.760
towards the target with her right arm.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.569
Key point: Why she did so well in this lesson
was she understood the movement, and she learned

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.990
to feel the movement before she tried hitting
longer shots.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.209
We then, I'll come back to that.

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.960
You can see when she does right arm only,
the arm leads the club head rather than the

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.020
club head leading the elbow, and that's why
the arm always stayed in front of her body,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.580
keeping the club on plan.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.730
So then we started right arm only hitting
balls.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.280
I told her, this could be 70% of her practice
at the beginning.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:29.620
Again, loading the arm, loading the wrist,
using the arm to create the load in the wrist,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.590
very different look and impact.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:49.760
Built it up, short swings, same thing, loading
the wrist, putting pressure on the arm in

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.760
the down swing.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760
This is the end of the lesson.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.161
Even though it was a little fast forward,
I wanted her to do more short swings, one

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:58.350
arm only swings for a longer period of time,
but just to see what we got.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.900
First of all, I just said to her I know this
is overdone slightly, a slightly forward hand

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.620
position so she can feel pressure in the arm
this way, pressure in the arm this way as

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.320
the club head moves this way will really help
her to load the right wrist.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.690
While I would like to see it happen a little
bit earlier, that was still pretty good for

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.530
inside a one hour lesson.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.930
You can see a lot more load of the right wrist
in the back swing, more pressure in the arm

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.530
which it helps create that.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.330
And then this is the key, the same feeling
coming down, arm leading club head, right

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.170
arm pressured towards the target, leaving
the club head behind, loading the right wrist.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:48.160
You can see here at the impact, a lot more
pressure on the ball, she got a lower, more

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.810
penetrating ball flight with a more solid
contact.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.990
She put less effort in on the swing, but actually
got more distance because it's a more efficient

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.979
impact.

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.810
As I said to you, when you change one thing,
often other things change.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.570
You're going to see here a couple of key things
changed as a result of her working on this

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.570
one thing.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.750
Number one, her weight shift started to improve.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.070
Just putting pressure on her right arm toward
the target encouraged her to shift her weight

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.710
to the left foot, a huge bonus.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:24.300
And number two, very importantly for accuracy,
when we see the path of her club, obviously

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.449
you'll see a huge difference in the way her
right arm works here, finishing the back swing

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:29.449
and starting down.

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:37.430
The arm doesn't get left behind, but because
the arm is in a better position, now she does

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.110
not have this club moving to the left cutting
across the ball with a very low finish.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.150
The club travels more down the target line,
that's going to stop her slice, into a slightly

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.240
higher finish.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.490
So again, things were changing just working
on one aspect.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.210
So I hope you enjoyed that lesson.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.790
I think I'd say it's a good lesson for anybody
who is struggling with impact, not getting

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.510
a solid contact, perhaps you're getting a
cut shot as well.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.170
Maybe you don't get much divot, just always
feel like you put a lot of energy into your

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.870
swing but you don't get much height.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.110
This might be something that will help you.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.310
The key of the lesson was, doing the drills
first, understanding it, getting a feeling

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.560
before you hit golf balls, don't try to get
your feeling hitting golf balls.
