00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.136
Hello everyone, I'm Idil. Welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.493
Breakfast recipes are very popular.

00:00:06.693 --> 00:00:11.632
Today, we will takes eggs to a whole different level!

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:17.699
We're making fried poached eggs. It's not a dish that I make for every breakfast but if I've got guests at...

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:22.452
...breakfast or brunch, I often make this.

00:00:22.652 --> 00:00:26.922
Because it's pretty different. All my guests like this recipe.

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:30.259
Think of an egg which is soft and juicy inside but crispy outside.

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:35.260
Let's take a look at the ingredients.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.535
3 eggs (at room temperature), 1.5 cups breadcrumbs.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:47.043
2 tbsp flour, leaves of a sprig of rosemary and a sprig of thyme.

00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:51.346
2 tbsp milk. A few drops of vinegar

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:56.006
Some salt and some pepper, lots of olive oil

00:00:56.206 --> 00:01:00.840
Let's start with seasoning the crumbles.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.920
In my mini chopper..

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.190
goes the breadcrumbs. When I have stale bread at home, I usually crumble them and fill them in a...

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.280
...freezer bag and store them in freezer.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.682
So whenever I need, I have breadcrumbs.

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:24.395
I have some rosemary and thyme here.

00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:25.956
Put them inside too.

00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:34.940
You can use this technique in another fryings. Seasoned breadcrumbs are always tastier than the plain ones.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.984
Finally add salt and pepper.

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:42.222
Chop them for 3-4 minutes.

00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:47.845
I want the spices to be chopped well.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.701
And its done.

00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:01.883
Now lets put them in an oven tray.

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:07.731
I'll roast them in my preheated oven at 140 C (284F) for 10 minutes.

00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:12.206
So that they are crispier.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.595
This will be good for us before frying.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.703
While the crumbles are being roasted in oven, letâ€™s prepare the eggs.

00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:34.557
I have a some water on simmer.

00:02:34.757 --> 00:02:37.204
We'll add few drops of vinegar in it.

00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:44.741
Now stir the water with a spatula and create a rotational flow.

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:47.317
Then put the eggs in.

00:02:47.517 --> 00:02:55.241
When I poach the eggs, instead of cracking the eggs directly into pan, I crack them in bowl first.

00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:57.587
Now put the egg slowly into boiling water.

00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:07.300
Because it spins, the egg will be in the shape of a ball. Help the egg with a spatula, to take its shape.

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:12.051
Cook this egg for a minute and then add the other one.

00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.715
Totally they'll cook for 4 minutes.

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:18.804
Now put the other one, I create a rotational flow again.

00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:23.812
Bring the other egg to the corner. So they won't stick together.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.510
Help it with a spatula again.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.588
Take them out of water 4 minutes later.

00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:39.208
The eggs have been boiling for 4 minutes.

00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:48.000
Lets remove from heat and put them on the plate covered with paper towel, with a strainer.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.137
You should be careful while doing this.

00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:58.030
Take the other one. Now, we let them cool a bit.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.459
Meanwhile the breadcrumbs will be out of the over.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.359
Everything is ready!

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:09.208
Now lets prepare the ingredients necessary for frying.

00:04:09.408 --> 00:04:12.323
I have 2 tablespoons of flour.

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:14.675
There is an unused egg.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:17.144
Lets crack it in a bowl.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.954
Add the milk in it.

00:04:22.154 --> 00:04:25.456
and whisk them with a fork.

00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:28.799
We will cover the poached eggs first with flour first.

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.256
And then with the egg-milk mixture.

00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:33.151
Then with breadcrumbs.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:41.670
But we will dip the eggs in the breadcrumbs twice so that they are really crispy!

00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:43.831
We taste this nice flavour two times.

00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.000
Yes, it's done.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.671
Now do this carefully so that your eggs don't fall to pieces.

00:04:56.871 --> 00:05:01.420
At first, cover them with flour, just once.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.582
Gently. Then with egg mixture.

00:05:05.782 --> 00:05:10.446
If you don't want your hands dirty you can use gloves.

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:17.206
And finally with breadcrumbs.

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:24.406
Again with egg.

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:31.662
And again with breadcrumbs.

00:05:31.862 --> 00:05:40.320
This time, let it rest in the breadcrumbs.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.061
Now, do the same thing for the other egg.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.460
The eggs rested in the breadcrumbs for nearly 10 minutes. In the meanwhile I have heated up some oil in the saucepan.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.044
Now it's time to fry the poached eggs.

00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:11.073
With the help of a spoon. Don't do this part with a strainer, it's too hard. Use spoon instead.

00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:15.457
Drop the eggs in the hot oil.

00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:20.379
For 2 minutes or till both sides are fried, continue to fry.

00:06:32.243 --> 00:06:37.744
I fried the eggs. They have a golden brown color.

00:06:37.944 --> 00:06:41.262
Then I put them on a paper towel and let them rest.

00:06:41.462 --> 00:06:50.205
Now they're ready to serve. I think they look perfect. Imagine how they look like on a breakfast table.

00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:54.578
I'm putting it on a serving dish and show you how the inside looks like.

00:06:54.778 --> 00:07:03.621
Now with a knife. As you can see it's very soft inside.

00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:05.645
I think it seems wonderful.

00:07:06.845 --> 00:07:10.309
Let's taste it.

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:27.003
Incredible. The flavour of rosemary,thyme and everything can be tasted.

00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:34.929
All together. I think it may actually be the best form of eggs.
