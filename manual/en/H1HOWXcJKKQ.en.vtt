00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.173
when president mama and houses jobs bill
uh... the press reaction was very

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:04.740
important

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.540
because they didn't set the tone

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.089
for how people think about

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:09.199
and the press

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.289
uh... seem to be doing exactly

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.822
with the r_n_c_ the republican national
committee wanted so first ben feller the

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.905
associated press in the first press
conference asa president this question

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.313
on your jobs bill the american people
are sick and games animation games in

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:24.500
your comments

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.560
they want results

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.893
when they'd be more productive to work
with republicans on a plan that you know

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.630
podcast congress

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.096
as opposed to going around the country
talking about your bill

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:36.610
and calling of republicans by name

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.876
how here you challenge the republicans
eyes you pay playing political games

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.660
here

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.450
is embedded a fall in line value had

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.783
and just do the republicans what they
want

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.500
how dare you go out there and make your
case like george bush did for eight

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.639
years and we revere him

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:55.439
and and we never said that he was
playing bothers me said always tough

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.969
george bush

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.490
figures they like he always does he's a
decided when you do it i don't care you

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.260
get back in line

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.230
so that's associated press lou
bedfellows in me

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.230
getting in the republic fine point
setting the tone well joint a special

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.290
article for the associated press where
she does a case study

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.710
and how you twice at their new story

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.630
in favor of republicans so here are some
quotes from her a story

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.430
the approach postal bombing
administration at risk of appearing to

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.190
use the president's forum forty seven
billion

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.066
dollar jobs bill as a political weapon
rather than as a means of fixing the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.069
nation's economic woes

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.640
and putting americans back to work

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.506
there was a presence not interested in
putting americans back to work

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.860
this is using this is a political weapon
account of political tricks are not the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.119
president is

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.052
regis worked with the republicans then
he would be facing the nation's

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.880
economic woes what that was in clearing
up

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.230
julie continues

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.300
and it relies heavily on the sunshine
let the public award also hold a bomb

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.500
accountable if he can't get congress to
act

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.633
you see how she switches things around

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.300
instead of the republicans being offset

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.633
breaking all records on filibusters not
likely to get through the senate will

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.850
announce

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.720
kisses knows all bombs for

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.053
if he doesn't give the republics with a
one

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.060
then that he should be held accountable
for not being able to work with congress

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.080
well that's a great rick isn't it

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.169
she continues

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:20.569
yet the president's efforts to negotiate
a deal with the opposition on capitol

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.289
hill

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.979
have been at most limited

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:24.409
how dare you

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.875
why did you go hand in hand to the
republicans

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.813
i'm gonna say you're not working and
i'll put them well how much eventually

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:30.569
last year

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.249
how much of the republic the present

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:34.709
profit

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.975
never work with them they never diminish

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.939
and i'm not a big affair the president's
policies

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.072
but it's only fair that the republican

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.152
never work with them

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.860
on a damn thing is that in your article
knows that in your article

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.526
now this is three different abbas is
already too

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.919
why does the president dole would try
hard to please republicans

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.385
but if you're a republican order for the
associated press i guess that's what you

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.110
want to go idon't know when chili paste
thinks years what ben fella thinks

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.920
he is out of the things on the
republican on a ride it

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.120
totally in favor them or do you think
that they're liberals and democrats in

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.106
their own mind but it is all i got i
don't want to do so by if the

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:13.429
republicans alright although most where
we were both at once and i would hope on

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.930
the particular george i beg your good
job

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.959
using those three kosarev i'm not even
dhanya whether this

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.420
uh... but washington's harshly partisan
atmosphere

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.979
makes the prospect of republican support
uncertain

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.469
cleanup do you get that

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.009
so it's not the republic's fault for
being offset that

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.700
it's a washington being partisan

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.249
that is driving a poor republicans

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.659
to be uncertain about their support

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.069
if you want to see if the democrats want
so harshly partisan well then they don't

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.809
want to give them their support but as
it is look for a public obviously didn't

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:49.480
do it on that

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.429
these circumstances

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:54.929
can you write this story anymore for a
republican

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:58.849
new enormous also what kind of political
reporter are you

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.880
million dollars all this time but the
republicans

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.889
haven't got a interest wants president
obama

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.539
that that didn't occur to you

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:09.249
again i'm not sure iago afterall bomber
liking

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.250
no other

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.739
the hosts on television or anywhere else
okay

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.029
but he about it

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:17.290
i can see i can read

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.090
i know what the republicans then

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.033
they blocked at every time you didn't
notice that nine missing all the poor

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.580
republicans because nobody found them in
the e_c_ what is a good support the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.389
president it's the president's for
basically

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.280
he more

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.629
already ready

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.029
given that given that reality sierra
administration officials are working to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.010
lay the groundwork now for alternately
placing the blame for the bills failure

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.169
on the g_o_p_

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.940
so it's not that the g_o_p_ is walking a
bill which is reality right

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.229
julie turns it around so that

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.689
yet while the president's advisors are
now trying to spend it

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.929
as the g_o_p_ is not working with them

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:56.160
before our eyes i just told you it's all
that

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.626
democrats in the president's fall for
the harsh partisanship

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.130
but they're doing here in the politics
of their playing this game and that's

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.309
what i'm going to take a look at the
trip i right the gaba

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:10.479
look this is the stuff that uh...

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.060
progresses have to have to deal with in
washing using the media is liberal

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.330
hope what joke

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.550
totally prowess tab which meant

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.950
and that makes them by nature
conservative

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.993
was establishment say this that was
really satisfies all obama's fault in

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.653
the republican been working with them
for the robot was created partisanship

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.319
he split the country okay let's write it
down okay

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.385
i don't know what goes through julie
cases had or uh... bedfellows had i'd

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.629
know what the results are

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:37.695
and the results are

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.840
i deeply pro south which mean pro-castro
group press

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.573
and then ironically they call it a
liberal media fall just stare the

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.819
bridges that anyone eles white actually
write the truth but there are problems

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.050
have been blocking any baseball you
better not do it maybe liberally biased

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.759
widening saqi how we want you to write
it

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:55.659
and then

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.020
we'll pack join the head job julie pace
good job and feller go attack the

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.286
president and make all the republican
points that's what your job is a system

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.803
as photographers for the republican
national committee job well done
