00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.560
Dad, I am enjoying here. Please don’t give the money to these  people.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.040
I’m happy here, since now I needn’t go to school.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.240
Oh! So you plan to stay here? Ok. You can give us company.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.560
But you’ll have to look after the house and prepare food for us every evening.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.100
Do you know how to switch on the gas?

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.980
No

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:33.360
Hmmm. Come I’ll teach you. Look carefully. Press the knob and turn it to the right. Then ignite it with this device.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.780
Once the stove is lit, boil some water in this pot.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.800
After the water boils, put the rice grains into the pot.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.860
The rice will get cooked in some time. Understood?

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.380
Ok. Please teach me like this every day.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.400
Ok…huh..what!!

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.280
Boss, lets leave, its getting late.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.320
Where are you going?

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.460
We are going to steal.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.760
Oh, in that case, please steal some mangoes for me.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.820
I feel very uneasy ever since our Unni went missing.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.600
Don’t worry. At least we know he’s safe. After all, its only Honai who kidnapped him (chuckles).

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.480
We heard your son went missing. Why haven’t you filed a complaint yet?

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.040
But I have no complaint Sir. You please don’t worry.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.980
Hmm..there goes my chance for a promotion.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.360
Hey, you little…catch him..walk now.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.300
You can’t open the door. I locked it so that no thief enters.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.280
Ha, who can be greater thieves than us?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.940
Awww…Oh my feet!

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.420
Who placed this plank of iron nails here?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.080
Its me.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.700
I kept it so that it would pierce the feet of any thief who dared to enter.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.240
Ahh..My Head

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.880
Hello, is this Unni’s father? This is Honai.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.800
Pay us half the ransom amount and we’ll bring your son to your house at our expense

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.960
I have no money. You keep him with you. Let me please live in peace.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.320
Look kid, you stay inside. We are going to the hospital.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.840
Lets lock the door from outside, so that he doesn’t run away.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.620
Oh, I’m so hungry. Let me make some food.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.500
Hmm. There’s neither gas nor firewood here.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.120
Idea! Let me burn some paper and make a fire.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.460
Great, so much of paper is lying here

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.180
Huh. You kept rice for us?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.280
Yes, I did.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.220
But how? There is neither gas nor firewood here. How did you manage?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.480
I burnt some paper, which I found in that sack over there.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.020
Oh no, that’s the money we earned by stealing.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.080
Boss, we have to return him immediately. He’s becoming a nuisance.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.560
Hello is this Unni’s father?This is Honai. We will release your son upon payment of only Rs 25,000

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.060
I will not pay you a penny.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.960
You took him without my permission right, so don’t call up again asking for money.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.540
Can’t you let us live in peace. Keep the phone down you scoundrel.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.120
See, I found this gun over there

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.080
Put the gun down.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.460
I too had a gun once, but it wouldn’t fire when I pressed its trigger. Can I check if this fires?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.680
Don’t press the trigger. It will fire!

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.280
Shoot..shoot..

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.480
Oh Noo..my head..aah!!

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.560
Let us return him immediately. I don’t want any money

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.220
Jaggu, bring the vehicle.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.700
Boss, there’s something wrong with the vehicle. It isn’t moving forward.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.580
Oh... Then get out and check what the problem is. Fast.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.520
What a beautiful round stone. Let me push this down.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.280
Aahhh!!...What the hell!

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.240
What is happening? That cursed boy. He has destroyed my car as well.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:21.140
Catch him…I’m telling you to stop..stop

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.020
Let me see whether I can catch you or not

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.880
Stop here…wait

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.260
Come here, we’ll drop you home.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.860
I don’t want to go home.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.740
Look, its our Unni. He has returned.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.440
Here is your son. We are going. We don’t want any money.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.600
Please don’t leave me. Take me also along with you.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.020
You don’t worry, we’ll hold onto him. Run as far and as fast as you can.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.320
In the name of God, please don’t let him free! Please!

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.340
Hahahaha

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.300
