[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:05.305
This TELZiLLA Bite is
brought you by the LG G3.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.020
Welcome to TEKZiLLA Bites
feeding your tech hunger fast.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.690
I'm Shannon Morse, and guys,
I'm on my phone way too much.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.860
I need to break my habit of
constantly checking my phone,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.570
or I will become addicted.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.800
Actually, I probably
already am addicted.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.300
Well luckily, there
are three very

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.290
simple and free
Android apps that

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.110
were created to help you
break your phone addiction.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.430
Checky, BreakFree,
and (OFFTIME).

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.530
First off is Checky.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.360
This free app quite
simply just tells you

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.560
exactly how many times
you check your phone each

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.890
and every single day.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.800
It'll give you a number
that will continually

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.380
rise throughout
the day, depending

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.540
on how many times you've
unlocked your phone.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.290
It'll also show you a small
graph of the past seven days

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.310
at the bottom.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.450
Lastly, you can share
your stats with friends

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.170
if that's not too embarrassing,
and you can set up Checky

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.010
to notify you at 12:00 PM with
yesterday's amount as well.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.070
Now second is BreakFree.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.765
BreakFree has a little
Buddha character

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:57.515
that will give you a
little bit of advise,

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:00.470
or words of wisdom, each
time you open the app.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.160
An addiction score will
be front and center,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.519
and a listing of screening
unlocks and phone

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.150
usage in hours and
minutes is at the bottom.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.990
If you click weekly and monthly,
you'll see a graph of each

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.400
with your history shown.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.290
Using the tools allows you to
turn off notifications or send

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.560
an auto text to callers
for a set duration of time.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.700
You can schedule specific times
each week to not be disturbed,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.520
and you can set up notifications
for overuse, unlocks, and more.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.410
You'll win achievements if
you get lower scores each day,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.310
and you can also
exclude apps from being

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.020
counted towards your max.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.420
A pro version is
available for $1.99

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.680
to show you call and app
usage, stats per app,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.250
customized auto text, multiple
do not disturb schedules,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.070
and no ads.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.260
Lastly is (OFFTIME). (OFFTIME)
is slightly more complex

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.570
with a few more options
within the free app.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300
Your main page will
show your unlocks,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.510
time spent on device, your
score-- in this case, higher

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.980
is better-- and how many
interactions that you've had

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.030
and how many apps
you've accessed.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.590
But the cool thing
with (OFFTIME)

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.480
has to be the Offtime Button.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.320
This will let you customize
a set time to take off time.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.180
You can customize it
with a specific name,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.250
by hiding notifications and
blocking calls, allowing

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.680
specific contacts, restricting
specific applications,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.390
and setting your time frame.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.400
So have I seen a difference in
my own smartphone obsession?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.150
Well, if you turn off
notifications in any of these,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.290
you'll forget that the app is
installed in the first place,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.780
and you'll forget to pay
attention to your usage.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.510
I found it was much better to
keep notifications on and deal

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.500
with a little bit of a slight
annoyance with my phone nagging

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.110
me.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.330
Battery usage is very
low for each of these,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.030
and you can turn off
whichever tracking

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.180
you don't feel comfortable
with, such as specific app usage

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.960
stats.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.670
I did end up using
my phone less,

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.370
but only when the apps
made me aware of it.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.342
Now try checking out all
of these apps on the LG G3.

00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:49.050
Have you seen it?

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.200
It's a pretty sweet
phone-- removable battery.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.940
It's got a micro SD card
slot, really good camera

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.720
with laser auto focus so your
pictures are clear and crisp

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.680
every single time, and
the screen is fantastic.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.120
It's 5.5 inches,
538 pixels per inch,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.990
and it has cool LG
features, like a not code,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.110
so I can unlock it any
time without a pin code.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.921
Pretty cool.

00:03:09.921 --> 00:03:11.420
So you can check
this out in person,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.160
and I really think
you'll like it.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.910
I'm Shannon Morse.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.840
Thanks for watching.
