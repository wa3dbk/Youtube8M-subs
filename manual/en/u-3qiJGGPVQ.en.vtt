[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.510
Hey, guys.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.884
My name is Tim
Schmoyer, and this

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:07.154
is Matt Gielen from
Channel Frederator Network.

00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:08.320
Thanks for hanging out, man.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.280
Thanks for having me.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.080
So he's going to talk with us
a little bit about animation

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.800
channels, which is what
you guys specialize in.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.530
But tell us real quick, what
is the Frederator Network,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.530
and what do you guys do?

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.770
So Channel Frederator
Network is the network

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.580
for animators and
artists on YouTube.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.569
We distribute Cartoon
Hangover, and of course,

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:23.360
Channel Frederator.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.318
Historically, we've made
some awesome cartoons,

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:27.940
such as "The Fairly Oddparents,"
and "Adventure Time."

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.800
Cool.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.130
So they know a couple things
about animation channels,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.370
right?

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.869
So he's going to show you guys--
what are some tips that you

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:35.815
have, general advice
for animation channels,

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:37.940
specifically, that are
trying to grow their YouTube

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.385
audience and their careers
on YouTube doing animation?

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:42.885
Animation is really
hard to produce,

00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:44.050
and it takes a long time.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.100
So it's really important,
as an animator,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.800
to have what we call a B content
strategy, which is essentially

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.170
content that doesn't take
you nearly as long or as

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.910
much effort to produce
as a animation.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.320
So certainly vlogs-- you
can do "how to draws."

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.810
You can do livestreams of
while you're animating.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.000
And then behind the
scenes, you can do stuff

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.870
with voice actors, when
you have them voice acting.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.890
Any sort of content
that is going

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.480
to be interesting
to what we refer

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.070
to as fanatics,
the core audience.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.940
It's really great for promoting,
when you're getting there,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.680
as well, right?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.490
When you establish an audience
for some of your B content,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.060
it allows you to message
them there, as well.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.560
And then, of course, you know,
trailers and "next time ons,"

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.260
and those sort of
things, that you're

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.760
able to kind of repurpose some
of the content you've already

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.220
created.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.136
For a lot of you guys
who are normal creators,

00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:33.370
like just kind of--
does it sometimes

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.330
work to hitch your content
onto something else that's

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.280
popular or trending?

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.738
How does that work
with animations?

00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:40.910
Because it takes
so long to do, it's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.400
hard to predict what's going
to be trending next week.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.800
How does that-- how could
that work for you guys?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.700
Sure.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.479
It's definitely
tough when you're

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.770
dealing with characters, right?

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.851
So we have "CatDog"
and "Bee and Puppycat."

00:01:51.851 --> 00:01:53.350
We don't necessarily
know when those

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.160
are going to be completed.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.535
So it's a little
bit tough for us

00:01:55.535 --> 00:01:58.700
to time up some of our
content with a tent-pole event

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.970
or something that's trending.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.710
However, if you're making
shorter pieces of animation--

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.940
or maybe you make a shorter
piece of animation just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.490
to latch onto a tent-pole event,
or a topic that's trending,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.910
or a viral video that's going.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.490
You know, a 10-hour walk
through "Adventure Time" lands

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.575
would probably get a
tremendous amount of views.

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:17.450
Probably going to take
a long time to create,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.430
but you could do a
minute, minute and a half,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.010
with some really
fun stuff going on.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.510
One thing that I've
heard, Matt, you

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.080
talk about a little bit is
also character development

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.270
in cartoons and animation.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.125
New audiences don't
know your characters,

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:33.000
and they haven't been
exposed to them, right?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.640
So they don't necessarily
have an affinity for them,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.140
and they might just drop
in to the middle of a story

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.540
and not know what's going on.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.640
And so making your
characters accessible,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.660
having your characters
in a storyline that

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.920
pertains to a wider audience.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.410
Maybe a gaming audience, right?

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.310
You do an animation for, you
know, "Skyrim," or something.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.260
Or "Minecraft," of
course, is huge, as well,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.160
in the animation community.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.430
As a way for new audiences to
not just discover your content

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.070
but become fans of
your characters.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.631
As creators, we are so
involved in the content.

00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:08.630
Like we love these
characters that we developed.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.838
Even if you're just like a
vlogger, like, same thing.

00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:13.970
Like you develop this character
that people know over time.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.137
And for you guys, it's like,
it makes perfect sense.

00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:18.636
But we have to remember that
some people, when they're first

00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:20.710
introduced to our
channel, they have no idea

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.590
the back story of who
these characters are, of

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.400
why they should care about
them, you know, what's going on.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.337
And so I like it,
I appreciate it,

00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:30.170
the channels I see that
actually bring me up

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.670
to speed real quick
at the beginning

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.826
of every single video.

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.950
Like some examples that
maybe you might be familiar

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.270
with are like on "The Beverly
Hillbillies," that old TV show,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.980
you know?

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.650
Their intro.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.130
Or "The Brady Bunch."

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.440
Like their intro song
was introducing you

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.270
to the characters and
the story of what's

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.440
happening in the story,
when they get into it.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.870
So that when the
episode launches,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.170
you kind of know the back story
of, you know, Judd struck oil.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.660
Now they're rich,
and now they're

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.800
living in Beverly Hills.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.040
Now let's watch the
episode, you know?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.092
So I don't know-- do any of your
channels do anything like that?

00:03:59.092 --> 00:03:59.800
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.470
We definitely do "previously
on" and "next time ons."

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.320
And if you really
look at radio and TV,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.460
they've mastered the art of
communicating with the audience

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.530
as to what's going on.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.620
And so we try to take a lot of
learnings from TV and radio.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.230
We do station identifications.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.649
We use the three-second
branding bumps.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.550
And really are very
active in our community,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.230
in terms of utilizing
social media,

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.570
and even just uploaded
videos to our channels--

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.950
you know, character
descriptions and character

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.380
breakdowns, and profiles,
as a way for people

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.390
to really dive in and
discover who these people are.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.990
Sweet.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.500
And you could utilize the
channel trailer part for that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.611
also, quickly introduce
people to your content.

00:04:40.611 --> 00:04:41.110
Awesome.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.130
So really good ideas.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.620
I hope this helps
some of you guys.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.182
