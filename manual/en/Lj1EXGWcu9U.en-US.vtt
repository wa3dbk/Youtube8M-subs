one part may even be listed for the same tv
model numbers

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.900
if you take a look at all the search results
there is a note under each item containing

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.550
suffix information
you may ask yourself where did this suffix

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.649
come from
although you may not have seen it at first

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.090
glance this suffix information is printed
within a tiny grid on your panasonic a board

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.780
scan over your board until you find a grid
of dots and letters

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.340
while grid location may vary these grids are
commonly found along the edge of the board

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.590
closest to the tuner and componer inputs
not very far from the grid is a printed box

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.570
that reads suffix
next to it is a printed box containing a line

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.780
or lines of open enclosed resistors
a closed resistor means that there is a small

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.140
coded medal piece or jumper connecting two
adjacent silver solder points

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.540
an open resistor means that there is no jumper
connected between two adjacent silver solder

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.940
points
holding the board so that the suffix grip

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.140
is upright and starting from the left identify
the arrangement of open and closed resistors

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.799
each line on the suffix grid has a unique
pattern of dots which represents an arrangement

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.200
