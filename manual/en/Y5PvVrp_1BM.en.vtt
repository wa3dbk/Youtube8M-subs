00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.960
&gt;&gt;Dr. Ketchum: In this lecture video we will
discuss the concept of central venous pressure

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.200
and the factors that affect it. To begin,
let’s define a few terms: venous capacity,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.700
venous return, and central venous pressure.
First let’s discuss venous capacity. Think

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.130
about going to a restaurant, and they always
have the sign that says, “Maximum Capacity

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.079
is ___” and some number. This sign tells
you the maximum number of people you should

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:43.400
have in that establishment. That is similar
to venous capacity. Venous capacity indicates

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:52.500
the volume of blood that the veins can accommodate.
Now let’s focus on venous return. Venous

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.900
return is the volume of blood that returns
to the heart. Finally, you will need to be

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:11.600
familiar with the term central venous pressure,
or what we call CVP. Central venous pressure

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.160
is the pressure in the large veins of the
thoracic cavity. This would include the inferior

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.450
vena cava and the superior vena cava.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.500
All right, so let’s start thinking about
how increasing or decreasing venous capacity

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:38.300
or venous return affects central venous pressure,
and vice versa. For example, if central venous

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:46.700
pressure increases, what will happen to venous
return? Will a patient with an increased central

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:57.100
venous pressure have more blood flowing into
the heart or less? More blood, you’re correct.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.700
So increasing central venous pressure increases
venous return. Okay, so if the patient has

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:13.000
an increased venous return, how is that going
to effect the volume in the ventricles before

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000
contraction? It increases, right? You have
just defined what’s called the end-diastolic

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.489
volume—EDV. The end-diastolic volume is
the maximum amount of blood in the ventricles

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:40.800
before contraction. So let’s continue with
the idea of increasing the venous return.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.900
Again, if you increase venous return, that
will increase the end-diastolic volume. So

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.700
what will that do to the patient’s cardiac
muscle?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:04.400
Is the cardiac muscle going to stretch or
not? A greater volume of blood causes more

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.469
stretch toward the optimal length, which will
increase the number of crossbridges that

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:19.700
can form, and will cause the force of contraction
to increase. As a result, this will cause

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.900
the stroke volume to increase. Okay, let’s
return for a moment to the increased force

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:35.900
of contraction. How did this affect the patient’s
end-systolic volume? Remember, the end-systolic

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.500
volume or the ESV is the maximum amount of
blood in the ventricles after contraction.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.400
The patient just had a huge contraction, so
is there going to be more or less blood in

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:02.900
the ventricles after that contraction? Less, therefore
the end-systolic volume will be lower. Okay,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.620
let’s return to the stroke volume.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.370
Earlier, we said that the patient’s stroke
volume would increase due to the increased

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:21.300
central venous pressure. How does stroke volume
affect cardiac output? Remember that cardiac

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:30.500
output is equal to heart rate times the stroke
volume. So if stroke volume increases, so

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.600
does your cardiac output. And remember that
this will also increase the mean arterial

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:46.700
pressure, which is the pressure in the aorta
during one cardiac cycle. All right, so to recap.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:53.620
If we alter central venous pressure,
that will indirectly influence your mean arterial

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:02.000
pressure. And remember, that mean arterial
pressure influences how much blood is delivered

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.100
to your organs.
