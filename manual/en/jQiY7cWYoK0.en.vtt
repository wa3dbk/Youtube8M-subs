00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.160
Hey there, this is your Pal Pallie and welcome
back to Git Er Raid.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.270
So what do you get the Juggernaut that has
lasers, mortars, and drills already?

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.840
How about a big sawblade and more mortars!

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.599
Sounds like a perfect Christmas gift.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.300
This is Siege of Orgrimmar and heroic Iron
Juggernaut is next up.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.989
Due to all the extra fun things this boss
can throw your way, this fight is likely one

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.530
that is close to requiring 3 healers.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.739
Its probably doable with 2 but its vastly
easier with 3.

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.400
2 tanks, as always, are required.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.840
As I mentioned in my lead-in, we have a few
more pieces of hardware the boss throws your

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.840
way.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.540
But, in general, the fight is mechanically
similar to normal mode.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.760
You still need to avoid borer drills, don't
stand in mortar blasts, and take care of the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.460
mines just like you did on normal.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.460
There is one change for heroic per phase so
lets dive into it.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.960
While in assault mode, the boss will periodically
throw out this big old sawblade that runs

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.710
through your raid and if it hits anyone knocks
them back a little bit and takes quite a bit

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.640
of their health.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.610
Maybe 300k or so.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.820
This blade is called Ricochet and its on about
a 15 second cooldown.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.350
You'll be trying to avoid these a lot so get
used to it.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.930
The only real tips I have are to try to watch
it come out of the boss and quickly move either

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.840
forward or backward.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.240
It seems to target a ranged or healer and
then heads back in towards the boss so you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.420
can see it coming if you are far enough away.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.350
You won't die from getting hit but do your
best to save your healers mana for other things.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.560
The change to siege mode is that he will do
a mortar barrage a few times while all the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.119
other stuff is happening in this phase.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.030
So not only will you have the laser following
you, the explosive tar on the ground, shock

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.370
pulses and seismic activity, but he'll shoot
out a crapton of mortars to avoid.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.010
I'll explain our strategy for dealing with
this in more detail later but the basic premise

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.530
will be to cheese the mechanic a little by
being very far away from him for most of this

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.530
phase.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.209
We'll get more into that in a little bit as
that feels like the hardest section of this

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.769
fight.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.140
But first, lets at least go in order for the
phases and talk about Assault phase.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.569
Really there aren't any major changes to the
execution or strategy for this phase other

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.040
than avoiding ricochet.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.430
We tried to relieve a little bit of pressure
from our tanks and healers by rotating 1 dps

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.750
into every cycle of mines.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.550
So 3 mines came out per set and a dps would
take one out of that set with their major

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.790
damage reduction cooldown.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.390
So first it was me, then our mage, then our
warlock.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.849
The offtank at the time would get the other
2 mines per set but if your tanks are capable

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.569
of getting all 3 in a row quickly then maybe
this isn't something you worry about.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.690
We just liked to have the ranged stay very
far back to avoid ricochet so we might end

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.330
up with a mine or two that was very far away.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.860
Whatever works for your group.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.150
Moving onto the Siege mode phase.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.040
This healing is really rough.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.939
On top of the constant seismic activity aoe,
there are 3 sonic pulses plus the mortar barrage.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.849
There is so much movement and chaos going
on that you'll need a solid plan for handling

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.430
all of this.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.080
We had enough dps to decide to avoid even
attacking the boss throughout much of this

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.670
phase.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.090
So our strategy revolved around outranging
the mortar barrage.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.280
So here's how it flowed for us.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.480
The Siege mode phase would begin.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.231
We wouldn't do anything other than our normal
dps and healing until the first shock pulse

00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:10.200
was about to go out.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.159
We then all ran to this Yellow Star marker
and stacked up.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.810
We threw down a priest barrier and then got
knocked all the way back to this area with

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.829
the 3 raid markers.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.140
We spent the rest of the phase here healing
hard and dealing with the normal mechanics.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.590
You can see the mortar barrage never reaches
us so its just a matter of popping healing

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.310
CDs and getting through the phase.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.779
We generally tried to hang out loosely near
the Blue Square marker.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:43.349
Once the laser came out, we would have the
fixated person run the laser out to these

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:49.630
other raid markers on the side to avoid exploding
any of the tar and then we would group back

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.050
up and keep healing.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.630
Healing CDs should be used for each of the
shock pulses so work out a rotation there.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.380
Tanks, you'll of course be dealing with all
3 of the mines here so don't forget about

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.030
those.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.710
With current gear levels, you are almost guaranteed
to get 2 of these Siege mode phases so plan

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.600
your cooldowns accordingly but 3 minute cooldowns
will be back up for that phase so having a

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.830
similar plan for each siege mode phase works
just fine.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.169
Once you get through a 2nd siege mode with
everyone alive, you are pretty much going

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.770
to win.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.960
So in summary, tanks, do your normal taunt
swapping and eat mines to the face.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.969
Healers, heal your butts off during Siege
mode and avoid all the stuff on the ground.

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.070
Dps, punch the boss in the face and maybe
help the tanks out with mines.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.370
As always, here are dps and healing numbers
for reference.
