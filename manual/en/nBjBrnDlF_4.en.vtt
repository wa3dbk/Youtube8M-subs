00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.400
I love this time of year.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.000
I call it the Quiet Season.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.100
I love riding out to the Great Salt Lake through the farmland,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.900
where there is little or no traffic.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.610
I rarely see other riders, but the ones I do see are serious ones like me.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.160
I never see other women riders, I must be the only crazy one.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.280
It's cold,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.000
but layering almost eliminates the bite of the wind.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.390
During my ride,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.040
I am rewarded with colors, smells and
sounds that few others experience.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There is so much to see.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.870
The Halloween candy is gone,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.690
and so are the showy colors of leaves
on the trees.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.440
They have been replaced with quiet golds and browns

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.400
that whisper in the wind.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.609
As I ride along, the musty smell of
fallen leaves rises up from the ground with a

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.129
pleasant aroma - filling me with memories of
walking through mountains during deer hunts

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.700
long long ago.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.760
All of the trees reach their
dark limbs high in the sky,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.000
gently waving in the late fall breeze.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.330
Their beauty rivals that of their showier
predecessors,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.300
but in a quiet way.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.600
The restful season has come.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.300
Hay bales are waiting in the fields to be gathered-

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.600
sitting patiently-

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.400
like soldiers in rows along the fences.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.450
Corn fields are also at rest now.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.400
Only stubble remains in endless rows that reach out
to the horizon.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.810
Freshly turned earth in other fields reveals
dark brown richness,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.650
waiting for snow to blanket it with quiet
stillness,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.160
and peace.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.900
The furrows will wait for spring to awaken

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.000
from the slumber of freezing winter nights
that will come.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.750
Geese fly above me as I ride,
calling to each other as they fly.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.949
"Hurry," they say. "Hurry, must hurry,

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.670
"to warmer places to rest for the winter."

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.290
I love their graceful wings,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.770
and long curved curved necks that stretch out
in earnest as they fly towards the lake to

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.120
land and rest before resuming their long
journey southward.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.590
I often wish I could join them

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.920
and fly far far away to lands

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.800
unknown and unseen.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.880
I ride by pumpkin fields

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.880
with hundreds of pumpkins that have not yet been harvested.

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.680
Perhaps they will sprout next year and
make another field of

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.469
yellow and orange for children to run through,
and pick the biggest

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.360
and best lantern for their holiday of
mischief.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.139
But for now, it is filled only with
memories -

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:58.139
and quietly passes on.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.449
The sun swiftly moves towards the
horizon

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:17.080
and I finally reached the lake edge.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:24.080
No other time of day can rival the
colors at the evening sun.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.390
The hills on Antelope Island are a rich
chestnut brown

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.060
and beckon me to come and explore their
secrets

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.130
but I cannot.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:43.130
Time is no longer on my side and I must
return before the evening light is gone.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.180
Reluctantly, I turn away from the scene and
gold and orange,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.699
and ride towards home.

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.800
I love this time of year.
