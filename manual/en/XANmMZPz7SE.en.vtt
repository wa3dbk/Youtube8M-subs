("Chanakhati" by STUMARI)

00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:09.676
- Hey guys. So it is finally October,

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.763
which means that we are
fully in Halloween season.

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:14.754
I've been looking
forward to this all year.

00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:16.340
So OK, back up.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.691
The other week I got the
newest issue of HGTV Magazine

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:20.687
in the mail.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.475
And there was an article
where they gave a bunch

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:26.417
of HGTV stars a blank pumpkin to decorate.

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:29.342
So I thought I would try
to recreate a few of these

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:31.150
no-carve pumpkin looks,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.060
and also make a few of my own.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.109
("Chanakhati" by STUMARI)

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.241
So first up was the googly eyed pumpkin

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:41.188
designed by Chip Wade from
the show "Elbow Room."

00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:42.894
Basically just take some googly eyes

00:00:42.894 --> 00:00:44.865
and a hot glue gun, and hot glue the eyes

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:46.430
all over your pumpkin.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.543
And then you get a cool creepy pumpkin

00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:50.066
covered in eyes.

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.134
("Chanakhati" by STUMARI)

00:00:53.134 --> 00:00:54.698
I love the ribbon pumpkins by

00:00:54.698 --> 00:00:57.075
Sarah Richardson from "Sarah 101".

00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:59.493
However, rather than put one single ribbon

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:01.708
around a bunch of different pumpkins,

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:03.496
I used a black and white ribbon set

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.121
that I got from Japan Town,

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:06.909
and glued several strips of ribbon

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.042
all around one single pumpkin.

00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.749
It's so pinteresty.

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:11.582
I love it.

00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:14.425
("Chanakhati" by STUMARI)

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:17.454
The next pumpkin was from
my favorite HGTV star,

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:21.658
David Bromstad, who is
my interior design idol.

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:23.508
For this one I painted the pumpkin black,

00:01:23.508 --> 00:01:26.026
and the cut a moon out
of aluminum foil tape

00:01:26.026 --> 00:01:28.222
to stick to the side of the pumpkin.

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:30.843
For the stars, he used gold star stickers,

00:01:30.843 --> 00:01:32.041
but I didn't have any,

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.475
so instead I drew the stars
on using a gold sharpie.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.935
This button candy inspired
design by Meg Caswell

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.358
is super cute.

00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:44.637
Just paint the pumpkin white

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:47.096
and then use pink, yellow,
and blue puffy paint

00:01:47.096 --> 00:01:50.042
to draw on dots in a grid pattern.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:51.769
It's so cute, you could almost eat it,

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:53.312
but please don't.

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.162
You'd probably get really sick.

00:01:58.473 --> 00:02:00.658
The paper pumpkin by Emily Henderson

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:02.019
from "Secrets of a Stylist"

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:03.807
ended up so cool looking.

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:05.391
She used decorative paper for hers,

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.972
but I decided to instead use a map.

00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:10.511
So just cut the map
into really thin strips,

00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:11.954
and then glue them onto the pumpkin

00:02:11.954 --> 00:02:13.823
until it is completely covered.

00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:15.489
And then you end up with this really cool

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.358
paper patterned pumpkin.

00:02:17.358 --> 00:02:19.654
Try saying that three times fast.

00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:22.173
("Chanakhati" by STUMARI)

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:25.180
And finally, I had to
make one design of my own.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.216
For this one I brought in

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:29.244
the devil of craft supplies, glitter.

00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:31.235
I'm probably still gonna
be finding this stuff

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:33.124
in my room next Halloween,

00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:35.196
but I really wanted to try this design.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.289
So I used the glue to paint every other

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:38.630
section of the pumpkin,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.520
and then sprinkled the glitter on.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.312
Once it all dried,

00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:42.958
I brushed off the excess glitter,

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.457
and then I ended up with
this super cute pumpkin

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:47.265
that is perfect for a centerpiece

00:02:47.265 --> 00:02:49.601
or a decoration anywhere in your house.

00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:52.486
So let me know if you
decide to try any of these

00:02:52.486 --> 00:02:54.721
no-carve pumpkin decorations.

00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:56.346
Since you're not working with knives

00:02:56.346 --> 00:02:57.728
or anything really dangerous,

00:02:57.728 --> 00:02:59.983
this would be a great
project to do with kids.

00:02:59.983 --> 00:03:01.466
And the pumpkins are really cheap.

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:04.372
I paid $6 for all 10 pumpkins

00:03:04.372 --> 00:03:06.180
that I bought for this video.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.313
So, let me know in the comment

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.697
what was your favorite
pumpkin that I made.

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:11.835
Do you have any other ideas

00:03:11.835 --> 00:03:14.050
for no-carve pumpkin decorations?

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.838
Or are you going to take the plunge

00:03:15.838 --> 00:03:18.519
and actually make some
jack-o-laterns this year?

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.998
Personally, I cannot stand
the smell of pumpkin,

00:03:20.998 --> 00:03:22.827
so I will not be doing that.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:26.016
But I would love to see photos
if you decide to do them.

00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:28.251
So if you missed my last video,

00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:30.771
it was a really fun collaboration
with Alex Carpenter,

00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:33.209
where we did a blind
taste test of every single

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.220
flavor of Pocky.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.292
You know, why don't any houses ever give

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.974
trick or treaters Pocky on Halloween?

00:03:39.974 --> 00:03:41.335
I guess it might get expensive,

00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:44.038
but you would easily be the
best house on the block.

00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:46.212
Or if you want to go back to last year's

00:03:46.212 --> 00:03:48.020
Halloween DIY videos,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.559
including a very special
collaboration with

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:52.164
a mister Tyler Oakley,

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:54.806
you can watch all of
those videos right here.

00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:56.370
So, thank you all so much for watching.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.199
I will see you all next time.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:03.199
