00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.169
Hi, I'm Tim Gipson, and I want to show you
how to use a handsaw. Now the first thing

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:12.170
we want to do is, we want to mark the area
that we're going to be sawing, so in this

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:23.790
case I want to cut this board 73 inches long,
so I'm going to use my tape measure and make

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:38.160
a mark,
and then use my speed square

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:50.649
to mark my square line. Okay, now the important
thing, this is an actual toolbox saw, but

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.530
the principles whether it's a toolbox saw
such as this size, or the full size saw, the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.739
principles of using it are the same. Now you
want to make sure you have a nice firm foundation,

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.380
I actually have this board supported on this
work bench and also this saw horse, so it's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.470
very important that you have a good safe platform
to work on. And then to hold the saw, you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.290
actually want to point your finger in the
direction and then grip it with the other

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:31.090
three fingers, now we want to line up the
saw just to the outside, and when you're cutting,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.530
when you cut that dimension, that dimension
is usually to the center of the line, so when

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.590
you're cutting, you want to leave about half
that line visible as you're cutting. Now to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.340
start your saw, you're going to set your blade
about 3/4 of the way towards the handle from

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:58.399
the end, and you want to pull back. Pulling
back allows you to create a notch to actually

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.000
get your cutting. Now the saws are designed
so that your cut is actually on your down

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.049
stroke, okay, so it allows us a little better
control to start that notch with a backstroke.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:21.809
Now as we start this, we want to use nice
smooth firm strokes. Now what you got to be

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.650
careful of when you're using your handsaw,
is, you want to be careful not to rock back

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.909
and forth, and you want to keep your motion
nice and smooth, okay, in other words, you

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.609
don't want to get jerky like this, because
that actually tears at the wood instead of

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:46.919
cutting the wood. So if you keep your motions
nice and smooth, and you want to let the saw

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:52.719
ride along the wood, and let the teeth do
the work of cutting it. So if you follow those

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:58.730
tips, you'll get a nice clean cut every time
you use a handsaw. So I'm Tim Gipson, and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.900
that's how to use a handsaw.
