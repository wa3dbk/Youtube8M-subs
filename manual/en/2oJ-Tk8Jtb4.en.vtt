00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.491
- Seems like if your mom has two jobs

00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:02.768
she just can't pick you up
(laughing)

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:03.627
from school.

00:00:03.627 --> 00:00:05.067
Come home and watch PokÃ©mon

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.058
and eat something like this.

00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:13.329
- I've had veggie burgers before

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:14.328
and some of them are really good

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:15.698
and some of them are really bad.

00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:17.323
- I like the ones where you can see

00:00:17.323 --> 00:00:18.646
the vegetables inside of them

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:20.620
rather than the ones
that pretend to be meat.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.334
- So I don't want something
that tastes like a hamburger.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:25.446
I want something that's like
this delicious, veggie patty.

00:00:25.446 --> 00:00:27.907
- You should do you,
veggie burgers, no meat.

00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:31.407
- Gardenburgers are the first
veggie burgers I ever had.

00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:32.574
- Cheers.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:33.127
- Cheers.

00:00:33.127 --> 00:00:34.027
- Might as well.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.059
- I feel like I taste
some mushroom in there.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.148
- I'm a little bit weirded
out but I don't hate it.

00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:40.704
I think the condiments
would help a little bit.

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:42.422
- I would definitely
want to put, like, cheese

00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:43.699
and lettuce, tomato on it.
- Yeah.

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.301
- A little sriracha pepper on that.

00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:45.975
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:47.554
A little (unintelligible),
a little pepper sauce.

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:50.015
- There are much better
veggie burgers than this.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.267
- Oh, never seen this but it is called

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:54.844
Hilary's Eat Well.
- Aaawww.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:56.795
- The world's best veggie burger.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:58.350
- Looks like a quinoa

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.674
White Castle.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.531
- Gluten free, corn free,
yeast free, dairy free,

00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:03.180
soy free, egg free, nut free.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.712
What, what else is left?

00:01:04.712 --> 00:01:05.938
(lively music)

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:08.540
- Mm-mm.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.237
- Nah.

00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:10.119
- It was really dry.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.489
- It had the texture of quinoa,

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:13.973
but I don't taste quinoa,

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.715
which, I think, is a good thing.

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:18.892
- From one Hillary to another, do better.

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:20.447
- This is a lie.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:21.516
Don't trust 'em.

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:22.877
- [Hillary] Chantel's favorite.

00:01:22.877 --> 00:01:25.988
- MorningStar, MorningStar is great.

00:01:25.988 --> 00:01:27.451
- If you go to, like, any fast food place

00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:28.798
that happens to have veggie burgers

00:01:28.798 --> 00:01:30.028
or anything, MorningStar.

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:31.282
They always (unintelligible) MorningStar.

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:35.143
- I bit straight into a potato.

00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:36.415
(laughing)

00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:38.305
- Mmmm.
- Mmmm.

00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:39.536
- This is like, way better, like,

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:40.534
than McDonald's stuff.

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:42.020
My palette is like, resurrected

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.970
from the last burger.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.589
- I could see buying this.

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:47.609
Especially if it was, like, on sale.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.549
- As its own patty, I would endorse it.

00:01:51.088 --> 00:01:52.528
- [Voiceover] Beast Burger.

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:54.757
- So this is veggie burgers for men.

00:01:54.757 --> 00:01:56.382
- Ooo, 23 grams of protein.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.704
- It smells like barbecue sauce.

00:01:58.704 --> 00:02:00.492
- Got the grill lines
on it and everything.

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:04.657
- Oh!

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:05.933
- It tastes like what I would imagine

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.303
dog food'll taste like.

00:02:07.303 --> 00:02:09.509
- This one definitely isn't
trying to do its own thing,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.645
it's just trying to mimic a beef burger.

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:13.870
- What a weird thing.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.170
- I kinda like it.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.723
- It's hurting, like,
- Yeah.

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:17.037
- my insides.

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:18.622
- I'm eating the whole thing.

00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:19.918
I really like this one.

00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:21.354
- Your teeth, like, sinks into it.

00:02:21.354 --> 00:02:22.910
You're like, "Okay, this can
actually be pretty good,"

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.187
but when your tongue hits it, it's like,

00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:25.511
"Oh, no it's not meat."

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.925
- No, this could be the best one

00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:29.249
if I didn't have a tongue.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:29.799
- [Voiceover] Ooohhh.

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:30.551
- [Voiceover] Oh it's a masala

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:31.021
burger
- [Voiceover] Vegetable

00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:31.641
masala.

00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:33.359
- You can definitely see a
lot of veggies in this one,

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.278
like, whole pieces of corn and potato.

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:37.764
- Mmmm, wooo!

00:02:37.764 --> 00:02:38.942
(laughing)

00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:40.096
This one's killer.

00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:42.234
- Oh, that's good.

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:43.441
- It's flavorful.

00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:44.904
- This is the best one.
- Yep, yeah.

00:02:44.904 --> 00:02:46.924
- And again, you can see what's in it.

00:02:46.924 --> 00:02:48.828
I like being able to see what's in it.

00:02:48.828 --> 00:02:50.082
- Oh, and the other
thing I like about this

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:51.614
is the spices are strong enough

00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:53.356
to get rid of the Beast Burger taste

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:54.447
in my mouth.

00:02:54.447 --> 00:02:56.792
- It just tastes like a potato patty.

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:57.976
- Yeah, this is cool.

00:02:57.976 --> 00:02:59.091
I'm into it.

00:02:59.091 --> 00:02:59.880
It's great.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.065
- You done good Trader Joe's.
(bell dings)

00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:01.900
- Yeah, Trader Joe's killed it.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.713
(bell dings)

00:03:02.713 --> 00:03:04.575
- I think we both liked
the masala burger a lot.

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:05.360
- Yep.
(bell dings)

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.199
Definitely the best one.
(bell dings)

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.391
- I think this is the best.
(bell dings)

00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:08.727
This is my choice.

00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:10.143
You like MorningStar.

00:03:10.143 --> 00:03:11.351
- I like MorningStar.
(bell dings)

00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.465
- You combine the flavor

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:13.533
of the masala
(bell dings)

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:15.112
and the texture of the

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:15.944
MorningStar

00:03:15.944 --> 00:03:16.689
- And the packaging.
(bell dings)

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:17.892
- Yeah, and the packaging.

00:03:17.892 --> 00:03:18.387
- Uh.

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:19.716
- It's a winner.
(bell dinging)

00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:21.233
- Usually it's just like,

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:23.635
what veggie burger option is there?

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:25.446
It's like, "Oh my God,
you have a veggie burger?

00:03:25.446 --> 00:03:26.723
"Thank you so much!

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:28.418
"It's so considerate of you!"
