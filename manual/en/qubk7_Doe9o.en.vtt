00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.930
Now, we're creating a painting. The painting
has got some unity. If the painting is to

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.840
work, the painting should have some color
unity. I was just working on the flowers up

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.529
there. The flowers, we were using the reds.
And, we have some of the same kinds of colors

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:28.439
in this foreground piece of cloth that forms
the table. So, I'm going to use the same red

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.640
that I had in the flowers. And, I'm going
to start putting in some of the flower patterns

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:44.059
that are down here. And, right up here in
the front right at the edge of where the cloth

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:58.480
falls there's a large red rose. So, let's
go ahead and use our red into our rose and

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:11.789
create the rose shape. And, then there's a
couple of more right in here.

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:25.570
And, another one here. And, another one here.
And, one over here. And, another one here.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:37.399
And, another one here.
And, here. A couple over there by the kitty's

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:56.730
foot. And, another here. And, a group of them
in this area. And, another over here. This

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.229
one, just the edge maybe is visible and a
couple of little spots here and there. And,

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.049
there's a red edge around that area right
in there. So, let's just go ahead and add

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:22.700
that red edge and some of the patterning that
we're seeing. Establish that that's a complex

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:32.329
form that's some got interesting shapes, some
scroll work. Some more red in here. More red

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.810
in here. There's more of that same kind of
patterning back in here. So let's just frame

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.140
that up. And we're basically working the whole
painting at the same time.
