00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:12.200
Narration: Fritz Henle had a characteristic style as a photographer. 

00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:15.550
He utilized the classic twin-lens Rolleiflex camera, 

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:19.470
and his near-exclusive use of the camera distinguished him from 

00:00:19.487 --> 00:00:23.670
the other photographers of the time and earned him the nickname of "Mr. Rollei."

00:00:23.693 --> 00:00:25.740
Unrestricted by popular trends, 

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:31.330
Henle's characteristic square format images provided him with the technical proficiency 

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:35.270
which allowed for detailed, sharp, and vivid images. 

00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:38.380
Tina Henle: He just totally believed in the square format for composition, 

00:00:38.396 --> 00:00:42.380
and he just believed aesthetically it was the most beautiful. 

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:45.750
And the size of the negative.

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:50.500
He could print just incredible images from that versus 35.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:56.820
And it was in existence before 35. 

00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:01.290
He often said he'd love to be able see what he was composing in a frame of glass.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.140
He rarely shot like that,

00:01:04.156 --> 00:01:07.740
even when he was doing portraiture he was looking, looking down. 

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:11.790
Narration: Henle's uniqueness as a photographer carried over to his techniques. 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.440
His precision and attention to detail, coupled with his unique artistry and timing, 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.490
allowed him to create his images with just a single shot. 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.680
Tina Henle: His main and only instruction I ever got from him was ‘don't overshoot.' 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.080
And basically what he went on to say was 

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:35.270
to try to see what you want and be in the moment with it.

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:41.070
Martin Henle: If the composition wasn't there visually in his lens, he wouldn't take it. 

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:44.390
Narration: Henle's expertise with the photographic medium also afforded him a 

00:01:44.407 --> 00:01:47.310
tremendous versatility with all parameters of the art. 

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.850
Depending upon the demands of the assignment 

00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:52.170
and the remarkable breadth of his personal vision, 

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.730
Henle would often alternate between the use of both 

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:58.470
black and white and color films in nearly every project.

00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:02.910
Marguerite Henle: He always photographed one camera with color, 

00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:05.860
the other camera with black and white. All of the time.

00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:08.190
All over Europe he did the same thing. 

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:10.280
Roy Flukinger: So he always had two cameras around his neck?

00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:12.340
Marguerite Henle: Always. Sometimes three.

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:13.940
Narration: Henle once said, 

00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:18.190
“One thing an artist can do in this world is to remind people that there is so much

00:02:18.213 --> 00:02:20.620
beauty, that you only have to see it. 

00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:23.700
Ultimately, Henle's simple manner of finding beauty

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:25.900
in even the most unexpected places

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:30.240
is amplified through the artistry in his individual exposures. 

00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:34.830
Tina Henle: He'd look for beauty in destruction and trash,

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:41.160
although it wasn&amp;apos;t like he was just focused on that at all.

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:47.320
I mean beauty was really important to him...

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.220
It's just who he was, as an artist. 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.870
He could have been doing anything and it would have been that theme. 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.140
He wouldn't of had to have been a photographer. 

00:02:57.162 --> 00:03:18.980
It was about just showing the most high parts of life.
