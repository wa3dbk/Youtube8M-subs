00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:09.209
We're minimalists when it comes to growing and caring for tomatoes.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.646
Other than occasionally adding mulch, applying compost tea, and doing a little pruning, 

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:17.417
there's very little effort involved once the plants are in the ground.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:23.590
Our tomatoes haven't been fed with an NPK fertilizer, Epsom salts, or a calcium amendment.  

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.893
Though these products are often helpful, and sometimes necessary,

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:31.197
we do our best to build the soil so that they won't ever be needed.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:35.935
To this end, the tomato beds were filled with homemade compost and fresh worm castings.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.705
The compost was made from a broad diversity of ingredients -

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.976
everything from wood chips and spent brewery grains, to straw and horse manure,

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.512
to autumn leaves and used coffee grounds.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:50.517
This diversity helps ensure that a wide range of nutrients are available to our tomatoes.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.686
Though the compost is very important, 

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:58.240
I'm fairly confident that worm castings have more to do with the success of our garden than anything else.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.561
48 pounds of fresh worm castings were added to the tomato beds.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.398
The worms are fed shredded paper, autumn leaves, spent brewery grains,

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.134
used coffee grounds, and kitchen scraps.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:15.408
The kitchen scraps include egg shells, which provide the tomatoes with the calcium needed to prevent blossom end rot.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:22.480
To further build the soil, we mulch the beds with organic matter and apply actively aerated compost tea.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.618
At the moment, I've intentionally let the mulch get a little thin.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:31.558
We've been having so much rain that I don't want to increase water retention by adding a thick layer of mulch.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.561
The rain has also curbed our compost tea applications -

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:38.498
again, because I don't want to over-saturate the soil.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.768
If it ever dries up around here, I'll resume mulching with leaves, 

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.504
aged wood chips, comfrey, and used coffee grounds. 

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:48.375
I'll also resume weekly compost tea applications.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:53.613
The final component of our soil improvement strategy is the use of nitrogen fixing cover crops, 

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.516
which we plant late in the summer or early in the fall.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:59.652
Not only do cover crops fix the nitrogen our tomatoes need, 

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:04.457
but they also add organic matter to the soil.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.527
To see if rock dust or biochar provide further benefits,

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:11.598
we're currently conducting field trials to test their effectiveness.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:16.169
The bed on the left was amended with rock dust and the bed on the right with biochar. 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:20.400
The center bed is the control and has no additional amendments.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.379
The most notable difference at this point is that the biochar tomatoes are considerably shorter than the control and rock dust tomatoes,

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.548
which are roughly the same height.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:32.318
Whether this height difference has an impact on yield remains to be seen,

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:36.489
as the biochar plants are putting out a good number of tomatoes. 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.591
I don't know what the outcome of the trials will be,

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:42.128
but even if we don't get better results with rock dust and biochar,

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:51.404
we're already more than happy with the results we've achieved with compost, worm castings, mulch, compost tea, and cover crops.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.739
Well, that's all for now

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.507
thank you very much for watching

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.242
and until next time remember

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.778
you can change the world one yard at a time.
