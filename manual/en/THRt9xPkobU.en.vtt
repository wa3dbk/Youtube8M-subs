00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:34.919
Hi and welcome back to FLY TV Squeeze.

00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:37.565
Today, we are on the
beautiful island of Gotland.

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.711
On the east coast of Sweden.
My friends from FishYourDreams are here.

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:46.737
We will see if we can catch
some nice silvery sea trout.

00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:49.723
So Per, what are the conditions today?

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:54.476
We are being disturbed and harassed
by some really nice sun.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.126
Which is not the best
conditions for sea trout.

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:02.264
They are probably searching
for food a bit farther out.

00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:09.025
Because of that, we are trying a place
where there is a spawning stream close by.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:12.823
There are also some larger depths
pretty close by.

00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:17.070
We also have some wind against us.
- There is a wind coming towards us, yes.

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:21.160
We will see what we can do to find
some fish in these conditions.

00:01:21.457 --> 00:01:23.762
They are not close by,
getting tanned at the moment?

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.575
Probably not.
- Okay. Let's hit it.

00:01:32.184 --> 00:01:36.284
My name is Robert Hansson and I work as
a full time guide at FishYourDream.

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:39.505
Today, we are fishing sea trout
and there is a lot of sun.

00:01:39.997 --> 00:01:46.731
We are targeting areas with dark bottom.
I fish with rather heavy flies.

00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:49.385
There is a lot of movement in them.
A lot of jigging.

00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:52.234
It is really effective now when
the water is a little bit warmer.

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:55.829
We are going out here and
see if we can find something.

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.282
When you fish these flies
that are heavily weighted,-

00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:04.776
-it is very important that you make
a loop knot so they can swim freely.

00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:07.758
We will get much better movement.

00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:10.851
You will have a lot more fish on them.

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:21.288
The knot is tied properly if the line has
a 90 degree angle from the tippet material.

00:02:21.714 --> 00:02:25.932
Then you have this loop knot
and they can drop straight down.

00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:34.264
Our guide Robert went out to the cliff
that is a bit deeper on the other side.

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:42.440
I think it was his first cast and
that he is fishing these jiggy flies.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.909
We are going over there to take a look.
Is it a nice one?

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.813
Good job!

00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:57.182
What we have is a Gotland fish,
a local fish that probably spawned here.

00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:03.481
In this river last autumn.
You can see it clearly is a brown fish.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.984
It is in really good condition.

00:03:06.377 --> 00:03:11.283
What we need to do now is to fish the
same spot hard because it is not alone.

00:03:11.938 --> 00:03:13.738
Have Robert take a coffee break now.

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:18.586
What do you say, Per?
- Yes, a coffee break sounds good.

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.426
Is that the fly?
- Yes, that was the fly.

00:03:21.627 --> 00:03:25.892
Jiggy?
- Yes, a jiggy fly tied in an open loop.

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:30.630
It is a lot of movement in it
and it drops fast.

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:34.474
It took it in a really long stop.

00:03:35.017 --> 00:03:38.350
They are here for a few minutes,
let's get them.

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:44.681
I would have been very happy for that
fish because we do not have any clouds.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:49.433
We are fishing weighted flies
to get them down.

00:03:50.495 --> 00:03:56.761
These areas are a bit easier for the fish
to access and to come in to feed.

00:03:57.026 --> 00:03:58.983
Then they can go back to the deeper areas.

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:37.912
Okay, here it comes.
Right here. Beautiful fish.

00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:39.739
It is a really fat one.

00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:04.486
That is a nice one.

00:05:05.197 --> 00:05:06.081
Hello Silver!

00:05:08.627 --> 00:05:11.008
It is a small one.
46 centimetres?

00:05:11.392 --> 00:05:14.681
45-46 centimetres.
A small one, but fat.

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:17.159
A small silvery one.

00:05:20.782 --> 00:05:24.255
What kind of fly did you use?
Okay, one of those.

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:28.819
I never remember the name of it.
I think it is VaskebjÃ¸rn.

00:05:29.247 --> 00:05:32.212
That is right.
- With some UV on the back here.

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:38.396
It was a gift from Mr. Loranga, Marcus.
Kind of a shrimp or something.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.833
Could probably work as
both a fish and a shrimp.

00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:02.338
