00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:07.161
Mrs. Obama:
Right now there are

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:10.428
23. 5 million Americans,
including 6. 5 million

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:14.394
children, who live in
what we call food deserts in the

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:17.361
inner city and in
rural communities.

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:18.861
Secretary Vilsack:
Lots of definitions
of food deserts,

00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:22.294
but most people basically say
it's a place where there is not

00:00:22.294 --> 00:00:25.227
access, easy access,
affordable access,

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:26.795
reasonable access
to fresh fruit,

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:28.861
vegetables from a grocery store.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.761
Ms. Gambrell:
You see a preponderance,
for example,

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.027
of convenience stores and
fast food restaurants,

00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:38.361
but very little healthy food
options for those residents.

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:40.561
Secretary Vilsack:
We are at the Fairhill Elementary School

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.594
in Philadelphia, we're focused
on a tremendous program that

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:46.795
they have here to reduce
childhood obesity in this school

00:00:46.795 --> 00:00:50.994
and also to encourage fresh
food and healthy eating.

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:52.728
Mrs. Obama:
Our goal is ambitious.

00:00:52.728 --> 00:00:55.728
It's to eliminate food deserts
in America completely

00:00:55.728 --> 00:00:58.528
in seven years.

00:00:58.528 --> 00:01:01.594
Tackling the issue of
accessibility and affordability

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.795
is key to achieving the overall
goal of solving childhood

00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:09.528
obesity in this generation, and
we saw this example today during

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:13.494
our visit to the fresh
grocer at Progress Plaza.

00:01:13.494 --> 00:01:17.628
The last supermarket that was in
that community closed more

00:01:17.628 --> 00:01:20.828
than ten years ago.

00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:23.994
There were kids in that
community who couldn't get the

00:01:23.994 --> 00:01:26.461
nutritious food that they
needed during some of the most

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.528
formative years of their lives.

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:32.695
This is happening all
across the country.

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:36.428
We're setting people up for
failure if we don't fix this.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:40.795
With a modest initial
investment of about $400
million dollars a year,

00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:43.461
we're going to use that money to
leverage hundreds of millions

00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:47.428
more from private and nonprofit
sectors to bring grocery stores

00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:51.728
and other healthy food retailers
to underserved communities all

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:53.661
across this country.

00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:56.394
If you can do it here, we
can do it around the country.

00:01:56.394 --> 00:01:59.127
So let's move!

00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:00.961
That's really the point.

00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:01.661
[applause]

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:04.728
Mrs. Obama:
If we know it can
be done, let's move,

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:06.061
let's get it done.

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:09.194
Let's give our kids everything
they need and everything they

00:02:09.194 --> 00:02:12.027
deserve to be the
best that they can be.

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:12.828
[applause]

00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:13.761
Mrs. Obama:
Thank you so much.
