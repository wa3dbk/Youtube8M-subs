00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.784
Calm yourself,
calm yourself
and just listen to me.

00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:08.922
No, no, no.
No, you listen to me, please.

00:00:09.587 --> 00:00:13.461
This so called doctor
paraded me around
my own neighborhood,

00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:16.863
like some kind of a
derelict mother who didn't
even know her own son.

00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:18.930
JONES: And what
was hís fíndíngs?

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:21.266
He found what he
expected to find,

00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:24.937
what you obviously
told him he would find.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.472
Mrs. Collíns.
But that's not...

00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:28.206
That's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:32.780
That l was embarrassed
is not the issue.

00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:37.884
The point is that
you are wasting time

00:00:37.948 --> 00:00:41.120
when you should be
Iooking for my son.

00:00:41.184 --> 00:00:44.256
But the report is final,
Mrs. Collins.

00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:48.428
Well, then l want to
receive the report,
so l can refute it,

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:50.428
before it goes
to anyone else.

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:51.729
Fine.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.900
Yes. Good day.

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.769

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:05.678
l'm finished. Could l
go to my room now?

00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:08.779
Yes.

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:19.991
Good night, Mommy.

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:23.729
Stop saying that!

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:27.266
Stop saying that!

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.433
l'm not your mother!

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.074
l want my son back.

00:01:35.138 --> 00:01:38.778
You're not him.
You're not my son!

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:43.849
l want my son back.

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:47.285
l want my son back!

00:01:47.818 --> 00:01:49.187
Damn you!

00:01:50.253 --> 00:01:52.724
l want my son back!
