00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.440
This?

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.130
Or this?

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.450
For Shep and Ian Murray,
choosing a lifestyle wasn't hard.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.100
We decided this right here is so much
better than sitting on the train.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.160
When they were just 23
and 26 years old, they

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.760
decided to stop commuting from
Connecticut to their jobs in New York

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.860
City, and start to make neck ties.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.700
I have had a review
with my management team.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.470
And they said that I needed
to think more inside the box.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.410
Say that again.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.060
Think more inside the box.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.800
That's not what these two guys do.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.110
That's what your management teams said?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.796
Yes.

00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:48.680
So when they said to you, please
think inside the box, what happened?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.650
I went right up to HR and I quit.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.070
Our idea was to ride on a
boat, and not on the train.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.240
These are two real guys
that went out on their own.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.500
We started from scratch.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.350
We funded this whole thing
on credit card cash advances.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.110
They had some samples made up.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.230
And Ian took them into a Vineyard
retailer on July 3, 1998.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.064
And they bought $2,500 worth
of ties for the first order.

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:11.730
I called Shep, and he said, how'd it go.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.730
I said, we're not going
to have to work anymore.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.422
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.370
I've got a Vineyard Vines style on
with little martini glasses on it.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.030
You like that?

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.400
Vineyard Vines has been
John Kerry's exclusive tie

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.650
provider on the campaign trail.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.060
I don't know if John Kerry
has a custom tie fetish,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.084
but he definitely does like his ties.

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:29.250
What do you-- what do you
have in mind for the cake?

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.464
Well, a flip flop.

00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:33.000
This event is going to be huge.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.565
They've got to feed like 2,000
people, and she wants a flip flop?

00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:39.810
The flip flop cake got done
just in the nick of time,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.200
because [INAUDIBLE] walk in, they
check it out, and they love it.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.300
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.610
I love Vineyard Vines.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.170
It's a wonderful store.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.490
But the USO is partnering with
Vineyard Vines with this tote bag.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.600
All the proceeds-- all of them--
goes to Operation Enduring Care

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.570
which is going to be a
$100 million commitment

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.386
to our wounded fallen soldiers.

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:43.760
And then Vineyard Vines have too.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.770
And you love Vineyard Vines.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.550
With the classic little whales.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.250
Definitely.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.910
And these, $10 from each bag goes
to Support Our Strength, which

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.180
is to end hunger with children.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.700
They say it pays to do
what you love, and believe

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.297
it's more important to have
fun than to be successful.

00:05:01.297 --> 00:05:02.380
We're not selling clothes.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.650
We're selling a lifestyle.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.210
To this day, it's always
been all about the two of us

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.430
trying to make a go of this.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.850
And now we have all these wonderful
employees and customers that

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.530
have helped us live the American dream.
