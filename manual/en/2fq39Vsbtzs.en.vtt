Hey guys, welcome back to my channel!

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.491
I realized that I have not done a classic
fall makeup look yet, so I just wanted to

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:09.491
get one up.

00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:14.810
Today is super exciting because I am doing
a collab with the beautiful Charlion Patrice.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.460
Her videos are off the chain, so definitely
don't forget to check out her channel.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.019
I will leave her link and her channel down
be low, so if you wanna see how I got this

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.140
fall makeup look then definitely please keep
watching!

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.480
We are gonna go in with my LORAC Pro 2 Palette,
and I am using Mocha.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.590
With my Sigma E55 brush, I am just patting
that on the inner two thirds of my lid bringing

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.820
that up to the crease and blending it out.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.270
Then with Cocoa from my LORAC Pro 2 Palette,
I am taking my Sigma E55 again and patting

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.770
that on the outer third of my eye to create
a nice gradient and add more definition and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.960
shape to my lid.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.000
With Rose from the LORAC Pro 2 Palette, I
am taking my tightliner brush from my Sigma

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.749
Performance Eyes Kit and I am just applying
that in the inner corner of my lower lash

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:10.859
line.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.630
Taking Mocha from the same palette, I am doing
that same exact thing I did with Rose on the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
outer corner of my lower lash line.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.632
For winged liner, I am using my NYC Color
liquid liner.

00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:26.439
It is my all time favorite, it is so dark
and matte and it is just gorgeous with shimmer

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.020
eyeshadows.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.110
You are just going to in and make a really
sharp wing.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.920
I am carrying that to the middle of my lid
and making it very thin in the inner corner.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.100
Using my MAKE UP FOR EVER Artist Liner in
matte black, I am lining my waterline and

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.539
bringing the color all the way into the inner
tearduct area.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.439
I then apply mascara to the bottom and top
lashes.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.310
I am using NYX Cinnamon as always, such a
gorgeous fall shade.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.679
Now I am just taking my hair down to see the
look begin to come together.

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.689
To highlight under my brow I am loving loving
loving highlight right now.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.520
I am just gonna use Honey Pot from my Too
Faced Natural Eyes Palette.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.610
As you can see I am using my Sigma E45 for
a nice soft touch, and I am just blending

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.180
the highlight in picking up shadow as I go
and blending it out.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.799
You want to make sure that you are not to
heavy handed for a nice gradient highlight.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.040
I am using Honey Pot from the Too Faced Natural
Eyes Palette as a cheek highlight as well.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.069
I am just taking it on my Sigma F35, tapered
highlighter brush.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.189
For lips I am using MAC Bespoken For which
is from the MAC Matte Lipstick Collection

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.189
2014.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:43.470
I am just using it to line my lips and also
fill them in just a little bit.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.000
Then with MAC Living Legend, this is the lipstick
that I am going to use, I absolutely lovee

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.270
the lip shades from the MAC Matte Lipstick
Collection, and I picked up a few.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.180
I will be doing a haul and swatch video so
stay tuned for that.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.870
This is what the color looks like it is a
gorgeous deep red.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:08.310
It is gorgeous for fall and it is also a gorgeous
rich red for the holiday season as well.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.409
So this is the finished look you guys, don't
