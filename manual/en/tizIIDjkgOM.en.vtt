00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.959
Bees are a critical part of our agricultural
system.

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.890
They help pollinate flowering plants, including
food crops.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.270
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural
Research Service is teaching the public about

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.650
bees at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival
on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Honeybees

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.840
are needed in order to set the fruit on squash,
cucumbers, apples, cherries, blueberries,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.120
almonds, and a host of other crops in the
U.S. ARS studies bees and threats to their

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.260
health, including mysterious bee disappearances.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.829
For the last five or six years, beekeepers
have been losing between twenty and thirty

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.180
percent of their bees each winter.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.580
That is entire colonies die and that’s unsustainable.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.530
It’s a phenomenon called colony collapse
disorder, but we don’t know exactly what

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.280
is causing that.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.480
Probably pesticides are involved; probably
loss of bee forage and habitat is involved.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.009
We know that some pathogens and pests and
parasites are involved.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.280
Smith says while bees are not going extinct,
he adds that trouble for beekeepers can mean

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.679
trouble for farmers.

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:38.600
There’s about two and a half million honeybee
colonies in the U.S., and probably over half

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.080
of them are owned by commercial beekeepers
and they’re rented by growers of close to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.890
a hundred crops all across the U.S. for pollination
of those crops.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.240
Researchers say people can help the bee population
by supporting local beekeepers, decreasing

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.929
pesticide use and planting a diversity of
flowers.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:15.140
In Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, I’m Bob Ellison.
