00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.990
"Hi!

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.690
My name is Robert Royston.I'm a 5-time world
champion of country dance, working with artists

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.650
like Taylor Swift, Carey Underwood, Brad Paisley.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.860
I really hope that you learn how to Hawaiian
dance and experience what its like to move

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.480
to America's music, and that's country music.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.670
So now that you've learned the basic two-step,
were going to teach you the closed turn, or

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.640
a closed basic turn.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.039
So what's gonna happen here, were gonna take
our basic of quick-quick, slow-slow.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.230
Quick-quick, slow-slow.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.630
But as we step our last slow, that's my right
foot, her left foot.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.000
Im gonna start to take the ladies a little
more to my right.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.110
So Imma go quick-quick, slow-slow.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.390
So I kinda moved her out of the way.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.040
Im gonna do that coming right at you so you
see what I'm doing.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.980
I'm gonna go quick-quick, slow-slow.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.080
So I just try to move her to my right 'cause
I'm still heading forward.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.120
As that happens, as I move to the right on
that slow-slow, I'm now going to start coming

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.710
right up alongside of her on quick-quick.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.780
Kind of turn her to face line of dance as
well.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.740
On the slow-slow, I'm going to face her.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.740
Slow-slow.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.740
So now I'm going backwards.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.780
Quick-quick, slow-slow.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.899
Quick-quick, slow-slow.

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.770
Let's think of it like this, I'm gonna take
the ladies and I'm gonna open 'em like I'm

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.770
opening a door.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.159
I'm gonna open the door which is my right
arm.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.659
But I'm gonna be the door that closes in front
of the right arm.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.689
So although I'm opening the ladies, I'm closing
the door.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.130
So from here we're gonna go quick-quick, slow
prepare slow.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.119
Open, quick-quick, guys close, slow-slow.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.509
And going backwards quick-quick, slow-slow.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.549
Quick-quick, slow-slow.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.880
Now turning back around we do the exact opposite.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.609
I'm the first door to open and then she closes
the door.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.679
So as we are going backwards, I go quick-quick
slow, same thing on slow.

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.789
I start to prep myself open on the second
slow.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.329
She passes quick-quick, closes slow-slow.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.780
And now she's going backwards again quick-quick,
slow-slow.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.770
So the first one she opens, and I close.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.220
The second one I open and she closes.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.360
So we can two-step around the floor, opening
up, guys in front, stay here for a little

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.450
while, have a good time.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.230
Guys open up, ladies close, and we are back
to our basic.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.140
So that's the basic couple's closed turn.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.040
Have fun!"
