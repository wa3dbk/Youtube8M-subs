00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.240
 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.599
Alright! Thought I would include a bonus video for Halloween

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.120
this is my outfit I'm gonna be. My theme
is, I'm made from money

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.410
So, I have a pair ratty pants here

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.529
and I started a bunch of bills

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.260
that I made

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.140
this will be my top

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.500
haven't done it yet. So what I did is

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.090
went on the Internet

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.910
and found... a replica

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.950
of a five dollar Canadian Bill

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.219
and then I superimposed my face over top

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.210
the other a character that's on it.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.000
I should know my history. So

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.420
what I came up with

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.579
is a 5, 10,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.159
20, 50 and a 100. Oh! thought I quickly
mention

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.030
when you make your money up, make it a
little bit smaller

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.189
them now I'm normal

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.680
size dollar bill, because when the
photocopy money

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.070
on a photocopier, some photocopiers
will actually

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.509
lock up on you, because they think you're
doing counterfeiting!

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.340
So I put a little dab of hot glue

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.340
and stick your page down and
just kind of do a random pattern.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.630
