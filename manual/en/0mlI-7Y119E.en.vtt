Now that the liquid liner is done, we can
brush the sweat off our foreheads and start

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.660
with the eyelashes. This is the fun part and
this takes a lot of practice. You want to

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.779
buy your eyelashes ahead of time and just
practice putting them on until you get if

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:25.119
perfected. You can really mess up your look
with eyelashes that don't look proper. I like

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.880
to buy for this look a nice full lash. They
look kind of like Bambi eyelashes, little

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.800
flip Bambi eyelashes. We're using a whole
piece this time. Not individuals, the whole

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:45.780
piece. The first thing you want to do is open
your box. You can get these lashes anywhere.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.140
Any drug store, any beauty supply. You want
to pull it off very gently. These lashes are

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.620
natural hair, so they're very soft. You want
to make sure you measure to the eye. Make

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.140
sure it fits properly because you may need
to cut it a little bit. She has nice big eyes

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.110
so I'm not going to cut hers at all. If you
want to cut it, just cut a little bit off

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.390
the end depending on your eye size. Again,
I'm using the duo glue, the water soluble

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:23.230
glue. You want to put the glue on the edge
of the eyelash and very so minimally on the

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.050
edge of the eyelash. Just so it just has a
light coating. You want to wait about 30 seconds

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.050
for the glue to get tacky before you put it
on the eye, so that when it sticks it doesn't

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.890
slide off. It adheres really well. Now, we're
going to put it on top of the eye. Make sure

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:53.180
you look down but don't close. You want to
get it as close to the lashes as possible.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.140
Basically, you want to sit it on top of your
natural lash line. That's where it's going

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:07.160
to look the most natural. When you have fake
lashes on people are going to know, but you

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.170
want them to look as nice as you possibly
can. Just let the glue dry for a minute. Make

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.110
sure it's adhering to skin. Look at me. Now
that it's on, you just want to take a little

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.450
coat of mascara on a brush and you want to
comb the mascara through the lashes so that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.980
your lashes attach to the false lashes. That
gives you that Bambi look.
