Monster Hunter Diary: Felyne Village on the Edge G

00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:30.577
Quest 3: Accompanying a Veteran Hunter!

00:00:35.852 --> 00:00:38.393
What an excellent day for hunting!

00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:41.393
But travelling is hard on my knees...

00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:42.593
So sorry about this.

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:44.393
N-no problem...

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:47.397
Why did I get stuck with such an old hunter?

00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:48.696
Hunters should be more...

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:49.796
Like this!

00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:50.996
Or like this!

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:52.396
Or maybe this!

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:54.440
Here you go! Have some hot tea!

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:55.868
Poogie Poogie Poogie!

00:00:55.888 --> 00:01:01.560
Ah, what wonderful comrades you are!

00:01:02.253 --> 00:01:04.609
No wonder it was so heavy!

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:08.340
Join us as we follow the Felynes' life on the edge

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.265
on Monster Hunter Diary: Felyne Village on the Edge G.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.961
I'm Miss Meow. G!

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:14.229
Today's theme is...

00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:16.927
"Accompanying a Veteran Hunter"!

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:20.123
The population is aging, after all!

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:23.203
For hunters as well, we see more diversificifa...

00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:25.860
Diversi... err... differensifica...

00:01:25.964 --> 00:01:27.875
Well, we see this happening a lot.

00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:30.288
You don't need to be young to have energy and vigor.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.844
People of any age can be hunters!

00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:34.109
Exactly!

00:01:34.354 --> 00:01:38.232
What I want to know is, how old are you, Miss Meow?

00:01:38.268 --> 00:01:39.955
Now back to our story.

00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:44.102
Come on, Miss Meow. Come on...

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:46.810
Now. Back to our story.

00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:49.826
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:51.326
Of course!

00:01:51.388 --> 00:01:56.538
In my day, I was called a legendary hunter.

00:01:56.564 --> 00:01:58.598
A legendary hunter!?

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.911
Those eyes! The sharp gaze of a hunter!

00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:05.303
Poogie!

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:11.257
Uh, wha? Uh, my glasses! My glasses!

00:02:13.106 --> 00:02:14.784
There you are!

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.216
You sneaky little monster!

00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:23.778
Wait... wait... wait... Ahh!

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:27.028
Are you awake?

00:02:27.074 --> 00:02:31.060
Ahh... I must have fallen asleep.

00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:34.041
I'm glad I had some of this Energy Drink.

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.753
Always check your Item Pouch before you go!

00:02:38.835 --> 00:02:41.553
Thank you for that useful advice.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.897
Stop! I'm not the enemy!

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:47.710
Huh? Ah! You're right!

00:02:47.747 --> 00:02:49.833
Took you long enough! That was dangerous!

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.056
Huh?

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.265
What should I do?

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.050
Kittie and Poogie are too weak to fight...
(SIGN: WEAK)

00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:58.145
And we can't count on grandpa either...
(SIGN: USELESS)

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.505
It's a Palico's duty to protect the hunter!

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.201
It's up to me to protect everyone!

00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:07.073
It's okay, everyone! Stay behind me...

00:03:07.078 --> 00:03:08.153
Huh?

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:11.665
Behold! My legendary running speed!

00:03:11.682 --> 00:03:14.848
Thanks, Knyght! See you!

00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:17.008
Poogie Poogie!

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:20.524
Wow, he's so fast...

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.346
He really was a legendary hunter. Amazing!

00:03:23.454 --> 00:03:27.036
Kittie and Poogie are so fast, too. Ha ha ha...

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:29.139
Ah! Wait for me, everyone!

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:33.128
Let's all take care of the elderly.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.208
See you next time!

00:03:34.306 --> 00:03:36.592
Enjoy the hunting life!

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:38.300
G!
