00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.919
A greedy company made a false copyright claim
against my video.

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.530
This is what I did to dispute their false
claim because my use of this content meets

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.639
the legal requirements for fair use.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.150
I created this video.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.439
Included in the video are 4 FAIR USE clips
for purposes of media criticism, analysis

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.289
and political commentary.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.779
The use is also transformative, I add text
of my criticism to the video, many resized

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.099
with text I created or the screen grabs of
articles countering claims made by Bachmann.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.690
The short clips of Bachmann on CNN, ABC &amp; C-SPAN
are Fair Use.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.210
I created the montage from screen captures
of the video and of highlighted sentences

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.620
of news reports about this extremely newsworthy
event.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.059
I’ve successfully backed up my FAIR USE
claims with DMCA counternotices in the past.

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.300
Within my 6m38s video, you claim copyright
apparently to the 63s clip and the 6s clip

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.609
from the Republican National Security Debate
where Bachmann told several falsehoods which

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.170
CNN broadcast without correction.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.710
This is an extremely newsworthy situation
and I have Fair Use rights to play the short

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.720
clips which I have added to with text and
audio commentary and sounds in order to educate

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.340
the public about critical false statements
which are very much in the public's interest.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.290
You claim copyright of audio of a political
debate yet I am using the audio and video

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.010
in a transformative way where it isn't being
presented as the original and neither viewer

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.110
nor listener could view or hear the content
for more than a few seconds without seeing

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.580
my own content added as criticism throughout
the entire segment.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.770
I think it is unethical to have made a copyright
claim against my video when it so clearly

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.670
within my Fair Use rights to use the small
clips of the debate in order to expose the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.820
multiple falsehoods of a political candidate
recklessly broadcast to the public.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.210
I think there should have been a review of
your company's polices because you should

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.460
not be making copyright claims against what
is I believe a very straightforward textbook

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.090
example of Fair Use.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.530
I submitted this on May 22, on May 23 I received
an email from YouTube saying: "IODA has reviewed

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.670
your dispute and released its copyright claim
on your video."

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.689
And that's because they realized their copyright
claim was not valid.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.129
Let's work together, please share these videos
with other people because we don't want to

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:28.079
watch Wolf Blitzer prancing around on TV announcing
that Iran is being bombed — that has to

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.079
be stopped.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.129
Wolf Blitzer is using his position to sell
wars, it's outrageous for him to allow her

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.090
to spread falsehoods like that.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.050
CNN knows the truth because they put it on
their website but they're playing a numbers

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.700
game because they know millions of people
watch TV but they don't check the website

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.510
on an obscure webpage.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.760
Wolf Blitzer is abusing his power, he knows
what he's doing.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.909
He knows millions of people watch TV but not
many people are gonna check the CNN website

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:01.079
to see if Wolf Blitzer and CNN misrepresented
something as extremely important as basic

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.590
facts concerning a possible war.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.439
This guy has to go.
