00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.310
Hi.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.109
I'm Aaron Anastasi and I want to play for
you Whom Shall I Fear by Chris Tomlin

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.570
OK.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.280
Well, let's jump right into it.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.840
You hear me when I call.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.140
You are my morning song.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.140
Though darkness fills the night, it cannot
hide the light.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.140
Whom shall I fear?

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.070
You crush the enemy underneath my feet.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.880
You are my sword and shield though troubles
linger still.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.020
Whom shall I fear?

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.370
I know who goes before me.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.110
I know who stands behind.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.110
The God of angel armies is always by my side.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.020
The one who reigns forever, he is a friend
of mine.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.390
The God of angel armies is always by my side.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.600
My strength is in your name, for you alone
can save.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.130
You will deliver me.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.660
Yours is the victory.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.890
Whom shall I fear?

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:28.750
Whom shall I fear?

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:42.600
I know who goes before me.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:51.250
I know who stands behind.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:03:04.569
The God of angel armies is always by my side.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.770
The one who reigns forever, he is a friend
of mine.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.864
The God of angel armies is always by my side.

00:03:12.864 --> 00:03:13.864
Nothing formed against me shall stand.

00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:17.500
You hold the whole world in your hands.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:30.040
I'm holding on to your promises.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.190
You are faithful.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.190
You are faithful.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.190
You are faithful.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.190
I know who goes before me.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.459
I know who stands behind.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.930
The God of angel armies is always by my side.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.540
The one who reigns forever, he is a friend
of mine.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.010
The God of angel armies is always by my side.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.469
The God of angel armies is always by my side.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:43.469
All right.

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:44.549
So that's Whom Shall I Fear.

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.720
Messed up on one of his chords but whatevs.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.189
