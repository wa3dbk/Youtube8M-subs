00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Summer is over.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.310
The autumn has its good sides. Such as chestnuts. I'll show you a brooch made ​​of polymer clay.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.160
For the chestnut leaves you need five different shades of green.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.200
I mix these colors.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.060
For the first gradient I use these two shades of green.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.780
I roll out 20 times at level 1.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.080
I extend the gradient at level 5.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.260
Right in the gradient I cut out the chestnut leaf.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.820
For the next gradient I cut off the bottom half.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.160
And mix it with the lighter color.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.950
Again roll out 20 times.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.250
Again extend at level 5.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.590
I cut out two chestnut leaves again.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.470
I cut off the lighter half again. So I do the next gradient.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.130
Again roll out 20 times.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.130
Again extend at level 5.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.710
I cut out two chestnut leaves.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.260
With the brightest shades of green, I'm the last gradient.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.650
I roll out at Level 1, 20 times.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.760
I extend the gradient at level 5.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.190
I cut out the last two chestnut leaves.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.510
You should now have these seven chestnut leaves.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.440
I carve a leaf pattern.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.150
Just as this chestnut leaves, all should look like.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.090
With seven different colors of chalk, I paint the chestnut leaves.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.770
I turn the leaves with a Needletool.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.640
I glue together chestnut leaves. After that, I devote myself to to the pin.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.900
The pin is fused with the darkest green.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.190
I put the pin on aluminum foil. On the pin I put the chestnut leaves.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.140
I roll out white at level 7.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.990
I roll out light green at level 2.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.610
I wrap an aluminum ball with white.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.720
I wrap the white ball with green.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.290
I prick the ball with the Needletool.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.770
I shape the spikes of the chestnut.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:13.610
I cut the chestnut. Then the chestnut comes at 120 degrees for five minutes in the oven.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.050
While the shell is baking, I make the chestnut. For this, I use these colors.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.770
On the chestnut I put the beige.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.650
I firmly press all with the Needletool.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.960
After baking, I remove the aluminum.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.150
In the shell comes the brown Fimo.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.520
I glue the stem on the chestnut. For this I use Fimo Liquid.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.460
I glue the chestnut on the leaves.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.310
I glue the small chestnut. For this I use Fimo Liquid again.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.120
The whole thing goes into the oven. After cooling, I Lacquer the brooch.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.560
Then the autumn brooch is ready for use.
