Hi everyone I’m Sarah with RealTruck.com.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.420
I’m sitting down with Shane at the Foss
Shop.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.660
He has spent a lot of time recently on turning
our Storm Truck into a Chevy with suicide

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.660
doors.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.810
This has seriously taken a ton of work, so
I’m going to give Shane the honors of pushing

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:26.720
play on the video and talking us through the
project.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.490
[music]

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.699
So first, we had to, uh, take the box off
so we could get at the back of the cab corners.

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:42.480
We put some braces in it, and then we cut
out the cab corners on both sides.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.559
The extended cab, cab corner is designed for
their hinges and what they do is they made

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.609
strength where the hinge bolts to, so that
can actually hold up the entire weight of

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:54.609
the door.

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.949
And, um, like hold it as it’s like swinging
open and everything.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.290
And the original cab corner for the crew cab
pickups, they have very little strength to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.210
them, um, they wouldn’t be able to hold
the door up.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.112
So that’s a big reason why the extended
cab cab corners were used.

00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:14.112
[grinding sounds]

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:22.460
For the, the backing sleeves, I actually made
those out of chunks of the old cab corner

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.181
that was pretty much the same shape and everything
and those fit up in there.

00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:32.670
They’re there for strength, to help it have
a lot of strength and to get everything to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.450
line up well, or everything to kind of line
up and hold its alignment for welding it.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.380
Here I am, putting the cab corner on the truck,
screwing all the, uh, metal to the sleeves

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.520
that were in there, and leaving just like
a little bit of a gap for the weld.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.950
The very back panel, we were able to just
use that, you know, the original back panel

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.659
of the truck.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.490
And so I drilled out the spot welds that held
it to the cab corners and did the same when

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.700
we took out the cab corners for the extended
cab, and um, were pretty much able to just

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.719
put them right back in where they were suppose
to go.

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:18.129
And then do all the plug welds for the back
and pretty much make it look like it was a,

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.989
you know, a factory piece.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:27.209
We cut out, uh, the back section of the extended
cab doors, where the hinges bolt to.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.950
Uh, we cut them out and then we also cut out
the opening in the crew cab door and we were

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.689
going to put the piece of the extended cab
door into the crew cab door.

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.969
Yeah, there was definitely a lot of welding.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.389
A lot of, uh, a lot of cutting and welding.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.409
[welding sounds]

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.029
And then cleaning up all the welds, and yeah,
there was definitely a lot of time that went

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:51.370
into that, that’s for sure.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.459
[grinding sounds]
So we pretty much took the existing latch

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.060
pocket that was in there and put it on the
front edge of the door and were able to just,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.430
I think, I think I did have to switch from
side to side.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.230
I had to use the, the right side one on the
left door.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.930
Basically the same thing with the striker
for the latch mounts.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.109
We had to test fit it and make sure everything
was going to be in the right place before

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.120
it all got welded solid.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.889
[bolting in hinge sounds]

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.019
Those are bolt in hinges, which will be nice.

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.859
So those you can take out and put in or whatever,
and those will be painted to match and everything.

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:36.750
Well, if you just put suicide hinges in it,
just use like a universal suicide hinge, you

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.080
wouldn’t get that full range of motion all
the way out, and it actually like, you know,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.700
sits in line with the truck.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.160
You know, it opens right up to being, you
know, right in front of the wheel.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.129
With a regular suicide hinge that you would
just buy, uh you wouldn’t get that full

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.129
opening.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.569
Then yeah, when we did a final test fitting
with the latch and the striker on there, everything

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.519
lined up good and the door is fully operational.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.180
You get the room of the crew cab, but then
you get the cool, like, the opening out doors,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.480
and it’s a totally cool look when, uh, the
doors are all the way open to the side and

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.100
you can see through, or see inside the whole
interior and everything.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.910
It actually makes it seem a little bigger.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.230
Yeah, having to do both sides definitely took,
or takes, time.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.160
Especially when you don’t get any, like,
uh, directions on how to do it or anything.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.910
You get to kind of take a second.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.260
You gotta like think of, you know, what would
be the best route to do this.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.260
It’s great.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.260
I like doing it.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.910
Yeah, I was pretty happy that it like works
and it like lines up great and shuts and opens

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.920
really nice.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.420
It actually seems like it, it seems like it
was suppose to be that way.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.420
[music]

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.250
And it’ll be nice too, once it’s all the
same color and it doesn’t have the red,

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.800
hu, the red cab corners and then the inside
of the doors red too.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.571
And it’ll be nice, because, I swear that
everybody that comes in, “So is that the

00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:12.010
original color of it, or?”

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.360
[laughs] They all are just so thrown off by
the red cab corners.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.810
Yeah, so then you get to tell this whole story.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.810
Yeah.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.980
Should’ve just, we should’ve just dug
deeper for white cab corners evidentially,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.640
because the red cab corners throw people off
so bad.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.860
It’ll all be white once its painted.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.860
[laughs]

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.860
Don’t worry.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.860
Yeah.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.460
It’s just; I just didn’t feel like clearing
all the red paint off.
