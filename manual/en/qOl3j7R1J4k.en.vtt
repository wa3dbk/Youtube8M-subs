00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.702
(club music)

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.387
- Ladies and gentlemen, joining me today

00:00:09.387 --> 00:00:11.798
is a wine connoisseur.

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:13.898
So I went out and found brands

00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:15.746
that many of you are familiar with.

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:16.810
(man laughs)

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.280
- [Woman] I'm scared. (laughs)

00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.676
- Real high quality stuff, grade A stuff.

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:26.549
And so she's going to taste it
and tell me what she thinks.

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:27.826
Oh, do you need something to spit in?

00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:29.413
Cause I watch on TV, you all spit.

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:33.143
- I mean, maybe I should spit
some of the, no I'm good.

00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:35.179
- Okay, why do you all spit to begin with?

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:36.502
- Well, so you can taste a lot

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:37.781
without getting totally wasted.

00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:39.630
- Oh, okay, alright, cool, cool.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.163
Have you ever drank
out of the spit bucket?

00:00:41.163 --> 00:00:42.053
- No.

00:00:42.053 --> 00:00:43.071
- Taste! (laughs)

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:48.071
- Okay, so, now, this
looks a lot like pee.

00:00:51.687 --> 00:00:56.339
It smells sweet, kinda
tropical, like pineapple.

00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:06.397
It's definitely kind of
viscous, so like it has...

00:01:06.397 --> 00:01:07.405
- Oily? (laughs)

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:08.688
- A little oily!

00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:12.655
A little oily, the finish is kind of

00:01:13.763 --> 00:01:17.902
like metallic or like iron or
something, like almost bloody.

00:01:17.902 --> 00:01:20.180
Okay, this could probably be some kind of

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:25.762
chardonnay blend, maybe, six bucks?

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:27.666
I don't know, am I supposed
to guess the price too?

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.820
- You can guess the price.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.514
Okay, so check it out.

00:01:31.393 --> 00:01:32.282
- It is chardonnay!

00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:33.117
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:35.734
- Okay, yes, Carlo Rossi!

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:38.805
So, how much is that,
cause I don't even know.

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:39.703
- $5.99

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:42.752
- I said six bucks! Yes!

00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:44.981
Should I even swirl it,
it is kind of pointless.

00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:46.047
- Oh, by the way, you notice that

00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:47.651
we have a wide variety of glasses?

00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:48.464
- Yes.

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:50.933
- The audience might be, "Well
maybe he had those because

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.155
"depending on the type of wine."

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:54.207
No, it's because I'm ratchet, okay?

00:01:54.207 --> 00:01:59.207
That's today's word, ratchet,
Google it, okay! (laughs)

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.500
- It's cool.

00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:08.546
That tastes like a liquefied
strawberry Jolly Rancher.

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:10.795
- (laughs) It's super sweet.

00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:13.451
- It's sweet, it actually
has some acidity,

00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:14.752
like my mouth is watering.

00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:16.850
It's kind of puckering
in the back of my mouth.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.787
- Is that good?

00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:18.561
- Which is good!

00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:22.553
If you told me that you put
a strawberry Jolly Rancher

00:02:22.553 --> 00:02:24.666
in a thing of white wine
and let it sit overnight,

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.823
I'd be like, "Oh, that's
what that tastes like!"

00:02:26.823 --> 00:02:28.099
I have no idea what that is.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.984
- (laughs) white zinfandel.

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:30.760
- Oh it is white zin.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.630
- How many of you made love
after a bottle of this, huh?

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.811
- I should have know
that it was white zin.

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:37.393
- Get ready, this is one
of my favorites right here.

00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:38.336
- Oh it is?

00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:40.342
Oh, I hope I don't hate it...

00:02:40.342 --> 00:02:41.922
- I'm just joking, go ahead.

00:02:42.753 --> 00:02:45.576
- So this looks a little
bit more like actual wine

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:47.901
in this one, as opposed to...

00:02:55.956 --> 00:02:56.943
Oh my god.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:03:00.729
(man laughs)

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.985
- It's like you took a
can of aerosol hairspray

00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:06.367
and just went like this inside of...

00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:11.352
It's so bad, no, it's really bad.

00:03:13.874 --> 00:03:16.082
I feel like it's pure ethanol.

00:03:18.082 --> 00:03:19.739
Are you poisoning me?

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.868
What is it?

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:22.484
- Thunderbird!

00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.893
- I said hooch, right?

00:03:24.893 --> 00:03:26.319
- Thunderbird!

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.862
- Wait, can I see this?

00:03:27.862 --> 00:03:29.750
I don't even know what the hell this is!

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.373
17.5 percent alcohol?

00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:34.185
The American classic citrus wine

00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:37.083
with natural flavors and caramel color.

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.603
Holy shit.

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:45.000
Obviously (laughs)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.128
there's dye in it, there's food coloring.

00:03:51.742 --> 00:03:52.394
- That's kind of a blast.

00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:55.244
- It kind of smells like blue raspberry

00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:01.300
- It's wine-based.
- and like warm grapes

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.530
that are just sitting
out somewhere in the sun.

00:04:07.053 --> 00:04:08.202
Oh shit.

00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:10.711
- (laughs) That's your flavor, "oh shit."

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:12.933
- That's like--
- Oh shit.

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:16.667
- It's kind of like
- like ass

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:21.667
- Like coconut rum with like
blue curacao and wine, I guess.

00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:24.148
This is obviously some kind of

00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:27.187
teenager party drink I don't know about.

00:04:27.187 --> 00:04:28.994
- It's called Buzz Balls.

00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:33.876
- (laughs) Oh my god, "Have
a ball! Overdue Blue."

00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:35.455
Oh, so it's like blue balls.

00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:38.706
- Yeah, so it's vodka and orange wine.

00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:42.861
- Alright, this seems
more straightforward.

00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:45.456
Okay, that actually smells like wine.

00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:55.469
Kinda tastes like two buck chuck, maybe?

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:00.469
It's a little leathery,
a little licorice-y

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:03.456
- You're correct.

00:05:03.456 --> 00:05:05.678
- Barefoot Merlot!

00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:06.939
- [Man] How good is Barefoot?

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.110
- Barefoot sucks.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.110
- (laughs) Cause they got all
this, gold star and all this.

00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:15.437
- These are a trick because

00:05:15.437 --> 00:05:18.223
you could just say that
there was some competition.

00:05:18.223 --> 00:05:19.825
Who were the judges?

00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:22.403
You know, who were the judges?

00:05:22.403 --> 00:05:24.980
Anyway, that whole award
winning thing, just don't--

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.709
- Don't buy into it.

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:28.486
- Don't buy into that,
and there's no reason to,

00:05:28.486 --> 00:05:31.876
how much was that, let me
see, okay, $6.50, alright.

00:05:31.876 --> 00:05:35.488
But if you walk into an
actual, legit wine shop,

00:05:35.488 --> 00:05:37.396
you can get a wine for like nine bucks

00:05:37.396 --> 00:05:39.663
that's maybe like a hundred
times better than this wine.

00:05:39.663 --> 00:05:40.267
- Really?

00:05:40.267 --> 00:05:40.797
- Yeah!

00:05:40.797 --> 00:05:41.663
- Is Barefoot that bad?

00:05:41.663 --> 00:05:42.552
- Yeah!

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:43.821
- But they dominate the
market though, right?

00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:45.106
- It's like the Coca Cola of wine.

00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:47.920
- Ladies and gentlemen, a bonus!

00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:51.631
- It's chilled, right?

00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:54.093
I love a chilled red, a light chilled red.

00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:55.973
- Okay, yeah, this is a light chilled red.

00:05:55.973 --> 00:06:00.973
- But it almost looks like
kids' grape juice or something.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.427
Like cran-grape?

00:06:03.427 --> 00:06:06.165
- You got bad kids it's good
for them, put them to bed.

00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:11.251
- Oh my god is this like Robitussin?

00:06:11.251 --> 00:06:13.962
(man laughs)

00:06:13.962 --> 00:06:18.183
- I feel like it's like chilled NyQuil.

00:06:20.938 --> 00:06:23.233
It does, it smells like what you take

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:27.149
when you have a cold
and you wanna pass out.

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:28.542
- So, what you're saying is
that's not a good date wine.

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:29.649
- It's like sizzurp.

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:30.495
- So if I was coming to take you out

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:32.281
I shouldn't bring a bottle of that.

00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:33.651
- No.

00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:35.872
- Ladies and gentlemen, the Night Train.

00:06:35.872 --> 00:06:40.825
- Oh my god, I have never
ever had that, I swear to god.

00:06:40.825 --> 00:06:41.808
- [Man] But you've heard of it before?

00:06:41.808 --> 00:06:42.521
- [Woman] No!

00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:43.558
- [Man] You've never heard of Night Train?

00:06:43.558 --> 00:06:46.071
- [Woman] No, I don't
know what Night Train is.

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:47.705
- Night Train!

00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:49.717
- So it is, it's like NyQuil.

00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:53.245
- It's citrus wine and natural flavors.

00:06:53.245 --> 00:06:55.836
- Wait, what does citrus wine even mean?

00:06:55.836 --> 00:06:57.036
- Night Train!

00:06:57.036 --> 00:06:59.323
- Wow, this was really...

00:06:59.323 --> 00:07:01.473
- Okay, your channel is The Whitney A.

00:07:01.473 --> 00:07:03.052
- The Whitney A Channel

00:07:03.052 --> 00:07:04.408
- This is a wine expert on board.

00:07:04.408 --> 00:07:07.349
- WhitneyA.com is my website.

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:08.802
I talk about all things wine.

00:07:08.802 --> 00:07:11.240
- Tipsy Bartender! Go check her out!

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.889
- Peace.
