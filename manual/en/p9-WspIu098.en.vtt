00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.770
Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode
of Laura in the Kitchen, I want to show you

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.410
how I make my mini upside down pineapple cakes.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.960
They are really easy, they're really delicious
and I think pineapple upside down cake is

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.490
such an american classic that I'm pretty sure
that everyone you know will know what it is

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.320
and love it if they grew up eating it.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.970
The ingredients you will need are very few
and basic.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.820
You will need some all purpose flour, baking
powder, salt, granulated sugar, some unsalted

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.260
butter that I have melted but you can always
have it at room temperature as well. An egg,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.860
I have got some pineapple juice, I have some
Maraschino cherries, and I have got some canned

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.860
pineapple rings along with some brown sugar,
some unsalted butter and some vanilla extract.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:58.859
Okay, let's get started!

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.780
I'm actually just going to grab a little spoon
because we're going to make the little caramel

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.300
at the bottom of the pineapple cakes right
in here.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.039
I have my oven pre-heated at 350F and what
I am going to do is I am going to take my

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:17.479
little mini cake pan here, now this is a little
pan that makes little cakes, you can find

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.649
it online, that's where I get mine.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.179
And I'm just dividing my butter evenly in
the bottom of each one.

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.679
And then I'm just going to take some of the
brown sugar and divide the mixture evenly.

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.729
And then what I'm going to do, so instead
of starting this on the stove top, I'm just

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.520
going to pop this into the oven and it's going
to melt the two together and it's going to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.489
do the job for me so, I can save on washing
up an extra pot which is nice. And, gets things

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:46.509
done a little bit faster!

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.619
Okay, into the oven this goes for just a few
minutes or until everything is melted, in

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.890
the meantime we'll get going on making the
batter.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.789
In my measuring jug here, I'm going to add
in my butter, now you could do butter at room

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.720
temperature and just kind of cream it together
with the sugar. I happen to just melt it because

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.179
it's easy, so I did that. And I'm just going
to mix those two together really quickly,

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.849
doesn't take very long at all.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.640
I'm going to add in the egg, along with the
vanilla extract.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.430
These are so easy, it's insane.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.280
I mean, but they're so good!

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.269
They're so retro!

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.650
Like pineapple upside down cake is such a
classic, I feel like everyone I know, knows

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.909
what it is and they love it! It's easy, easy,
easy. They're pretty.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.109
Just like it!

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.900
This is the juice that the canned pineapple
rings came from, I didn't buy mine in syrup,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.019
mine are in juice, so I'm going to use some
of this juice - I'm going to use half of it

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.909
now and see if I'm going to need the remaining
half.

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.489
Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't.

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.290
I'm going to take my dry ingredients here,
with my baking powder and salt.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.560
I'm going to pour in my wet mixture.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.310
And then mix these together. If I feel like
my batter is a little on the thick side, then

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.439
I'll add the remaining quarter cup - which
I'm going to for sure.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.049
Might as well add that all in - the pineapple
juice.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:21.049
Just going to carefully put a pineapple slice
in the bottom of each one, fits perfectly,

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.749
and also just mush it around to fit.

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.599
Careful not to burn yourself!

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.930
Safety first, as always.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.109
You can see that the butter has melted, the
sugar melted a bit, but not totally, cause

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.900
this is going to take more time in the oven
so it'll get the job done.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.310
And then, traditionally, like regular pineapple
upside down cake, a Maraschino cherry in the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.579
center of each one.

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:56.579
And, I just an ice cream scoop to dollop my
batter on top of each little cake.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.279
Okay, that might come out a little bit smaller
than the rest, but that's okay.

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:09.040
Popping this into the oven at 350F for about
I'd say maybe 20-25 minutes. Could take a

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.180
little longer, could take a little less, keep
an eye on them and I'll show you what to do

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.569
as soon as they come out.

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.940
My cakes baked for exactly 25 minutes. I just
took them out of the oven and they've been

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.500
out of the oven for about five minutes, and
you don't want to wait any longer than this,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.250
and you want to make sure you run your knife
around them to loosen them up a bit. You want

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.920
them to sit for 5 minutes and five minutes
only. And then I'm just going to take a baking

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.470
pan, or a baking sheet that I've lined with
parchment, otherwise the caramel can stick

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.000
to the baking dish and it just becomes hard
to take off.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And then all you do - careful this is hot.
Let's see. All but this one came out.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.680
[tapping[

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.890
[Laughing]

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.580
Okay, that should be good.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.270
Yep!

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.050
They're beautiful little cakes!

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:18.050
Beautiful little cakes. How lovely are those.
Now you do need to let them cool completely.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.290
And now because I didn't want to make a mess
on my platter, I invert them onto a baking

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.060
sheet that's been lined with parchment, because
all have to do is throw it out.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.450
And our little cakes are going to need to
cool completely. But that's really about it.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.870
They're very simple, but they're very easy
and they're really beautiful, perfect for

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.810
a dinner party.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.860
I just love them.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.390
I don't know, I'm so geeky. That one came
out a little bit smaller and that one is really

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.930
big!

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.470
[Laughing]

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.940
I know, listen, we all know I don't like to
decorate because I don't know how, we all

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.150
know I have no patience.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.810
And we all know, I just go right in for the
kill which is - I just like the food.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.780
I like to eat.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.300
But these look absolutely beautiful, look
at that! Look at the caramel all around.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.530
Now, you do need to let these cool completely
before you cut into them, but I'm not going

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.240
to make you waste your time. I'm just going
to cut a piece right there.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:24.240
I'm going to get that caramel.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.640
Perfectly pineapple-y.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.600
Mmm.. I love those!

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.270
That's really about it - Laur - that is really
yummy, I'm going to go back for more when

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.920
it's cold - Laurainthekitchen.com will have
the recipe for you. I hope you have enjoyed

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.000
spending time with me guys. Let me know what
other American classics you want to see next,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.880
and I will see you next time!

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.419
Bye bye!
