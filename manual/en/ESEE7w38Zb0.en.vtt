I respect every religion ...

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:09.600

with your the spinal cord.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:17.600

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.500
... And you are not stupid ...

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:29.600
Unique, modern, innovative religion is ...

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:31.601

Literally money as your god.

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:47.204
We all believe in them, they are the source of everything
and may occasionally perform miracles.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.000

.. Which you so enthusiastically studying.

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:58.500
Here also you do systematic rituals of divine society
getting the envelope with piece of the sacred body

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.100
And ask anyone, just for fun ..

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:05.300
"How much money you get?"

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:08.250
They gonna shit their pants
as if you ask for confession

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.050
And what's the story with this banknotes?

They are the holy icons. You are looking at them and
for you they are not just paper and ink, no ...

00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:21.800
For you are the body of your god

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:25.900
Which arise in a sacred place,
which can't access any common mortal.

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:30.600
And these sacred scraps of paper fall into the hands of people
and then tired, wrinkled and dirty ..

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:35.900
... Burn in the incinerator to be reborn
again, like the phoenix

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.300
To do their earth's path.

00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:41.001

each banknote have done?

00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:47.120

The fact is, that money is the result of
working printing machine.

.. Because you do not have value ...

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:44.801

from any tale ...

00:02:45.102 --> 00:02:47.002
... And you're ...
