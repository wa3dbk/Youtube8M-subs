00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.160
In April 2015, the United Nations hosted a
meeting to discuss the use of armed robots

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.629
in combat.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.179
Many experts argued that military robots can’t
tell the difference between civilians and

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.969
soldiers, and therefore may violate a fundamental
law of war.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.880
So, what are the laws of war?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.840
Historians have observed that as long as there
has been war, there’s been an effort to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.050
protect non-combatants, like women and children.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.170
This custom forms part of the basis for our
rules of war today.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.710
The majority of these rules were internationally
codified in the 19th and 20th Centuries during

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.469
The Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.920
Nearly every country in the world has pledged
to abide by these guidelines.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.170
As the nature of war has changed, these rules
have regularly been updated.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.019
In general, the laws of war are meant to protect:
civilians, prisoners of war, the sick, and

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.100
the wounded.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.559
For example, soldiers cannot target civilians
at all - only other combatants.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.309
And they can’t destroy civilian crops or
poison their drinking water.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.480
Soldiers also may not torture prisoners of
war, and must keep them alive, giving them

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.500
food, water, and access to communication with
their families.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.970
For the sick and wounded on the battlefield,
soldiers must allow doctors to rescue and

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.690
treat people from both sides.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.410
Additionally, the rules of war prohibit the
use of indiscriminate weapons, like landmines,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.190
cluster bombs, or chemical weapons, which
cause suffering to civilians and soldiers

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.190
alike.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.460
But, there are many complexities to modern
warfare that make the basic rules of war hard

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.460
to follow.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.470
For instance, terrorists often disguise themselves
as civilians, or use civilians as human shields.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.200
Yet, any opposing forces must still fight
legally, and avoid harming civilians.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.730
Experts have suggested that the rules of war
should change to cope with modern terrorism.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.480
Hypocrisy over the laws of war is also common.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.960
The United States was one of the major contributors
to The Hague and Geneva Conventions, yet they

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.060
have commonly ignored these rules.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.230
In Abu Ghraib Prison, suspected terrorists
were tortured by American officials, which

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.060
is a violation of the detainees’ rights.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.920
And the US also still uses landmines in the
Korean Demilitarized Zone.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.599
As new methods of warfare are being developed
- the international laws of warfare must also

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.599
develop.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.680
It’s likely that no war has been fought
fairly, but at least with some basic rules,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.599
innocent casualties may be minimized.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.069
Our friend Laura Ling has an amazing first-hand
story about what it was like to be a prisoner

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.370
in North Korea.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:38.099
Her story is both amazing 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.639
and inspiring.
