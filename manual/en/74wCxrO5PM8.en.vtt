00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.660
Hi my name is Puja. And my mom is here today
to help me make khandvi.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.660
Khandvi is one of my favorite, absolute favorite
Gujarati snacks. I've been helping my mom

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.430
make it ever since I was a little kid. Probably
the first time I made it with my mom was when

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.070
I was six. I used to really enjoy making them
because I got to make a big mess and spread

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.700
the batter everywhere and it was really fun.
I've actually never made it on my own before

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.420
so my mom's going to help me, she's going
to teach me how to do it.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.370
Chandra: Shall we start?
Puja: Yeah. The ingredients are really simple

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.950
for this, it's just a handful of things. You
need garbanzo bean flour, also known as besan,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.950
that's the main ingredient. Then you need
green chilis, cilantro, black mustard seed,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.440
sesame seed, lemon juice, salt, some oil and
some dried coconut.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.180
Chandra: Shall we start, Puja?
Puja: Yeah.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.180
Chandra: Here is our garbanzo flour.We'll
put some salt in. One and half cups of water.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:22.490
Lemon juice. And then we'll stir until the
lumps of this garbanzo flour goes away.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.299
Puja: So you take out all the lumps from the
batter?

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.270
Chandra: Yes,
Puja: Okay, it just has to be really smooth?

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:40.200
Chandra: Really smooth. See now Puja, those
lumps are gone. So you can put some oil in

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.900
the pan, Puja and we can start our khandvi.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.740
So a teaspoon? We just kind of spread it around everywhere.
Yeah, just start the gas now.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.380
To medium-high?
Medium.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.130
Medium?
Yes, medium.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.560
K.
And then pour that batter here.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.830
Just pour it all in?
Yes. Just pour it all in.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.959
Okay.
And now make our gas high.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.959
Make it high, all the way?
Yes.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.700
Okay.
So we'll wait till it gets thicker.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.950
Puja: So you just keep stirring the whole
time?

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.200
Chandra: Yes, we have to stir the whole time
because otherwise it will stick or it will burn in the corner.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:39.200
This is sticking to our
Puja: Yeah, so it sticks to our spatula. And

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.909
then you get it really thick, you have to
make sure that all the liquid is gone, right?

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.769
Chandra: Right. Now Puja, put our gas on medium
now.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.769
Puja: So back on to medium?
Chandra: Yes.And put one teaspoon of oil in.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:04.139
Puja: Okay, just a teaspoon.
Chandra: Sometimes if you want to put some

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:11.529
spices you can put in
Puja: Like turmeric or chili powder.

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:18.529
Chandra: Yes, like turmeric or chili powder
but we aren't putting any spices in this batter.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.829
Okay, as it gets thicker we'll make a test
of this. We will spread a little bit of this

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.279
on the counter like this. And leave it for
a few seconds.

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.819
Puja: Okay, and you keep stirring the whole
time while you're doing that, right?

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.379
Chandra: Yes. You have to stir it otherwise
it will stick.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.469
Puja: And it'll burn, right?
Chandra: It will burn and from the top it

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:57.489
will get dry too.
So now, just with your finger, roll it. It

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.469
is not ready, we cannot roll it.
Puja: So you keep testing it until it will

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.889
lift from the counter and start to roll on
its own.
Chandra: Right.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.800
Yes, Puja, it is done.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.060
Puja: Nice!
Chandra: Good job.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.060
So we've got our khandvi batter here and I'm
just going to plop some here for mom, plop

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.120
some here for myself. And you just spread.
Spread like crazy.And as fast as you can.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.830
So we spread out our khandvi which is the
fun part. And now we're just gonna score it

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.690
really quick. Just about 1 inch little scores.
And you can just use the back of your knife

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.290
if you're worried about scratching your counter.
So now that we've scored them, the khandvi

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.910
cools really fast so you can pretty much just
score and you can roll right away.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.910
And just do like a loose roll because a tight
roll won't taste as good. A loose roll tastes

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.200
much better. So loosely roll it out and if
it breaks that's okay. Just kind of keep going

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.120
with it.
Now we'll start vaghar, we'll put our, what

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.620
you say 'vagharyu'?
Yeah, that's just my cast iron skillet, it's

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.670
my smallest one I think it's like a 5 inch
or a 4 inch. It's what I always use, it's

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.700
different from what you use, but it's what
I've got.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:05.700
Okay, we'll put some oil. After a while we'll
put one seed of our black mustard and if it

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.560
pops then it's ready.
We'll put our black mustard seed. Let all

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:36.350
the seeds pop. We'll put our green chillies.
And then our sesame seeds. Let our seeds pop.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:45.300
And then we'll put our cilantro. And we'll
shut off the gas.And mix all the vaghar together.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.800
And you can pour this vaghar on our khandvi.
Puja: Okay.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:09.370
Okay, and then we just sprinkle some coconut on top. I use dried coconut and I use 1 tablespoon

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:18.000
of dried coconut and I soaked it in 1 tablespoon
of water to get it nice and moist.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So there's our khandvi. Thanks mom.
Most welcome.
