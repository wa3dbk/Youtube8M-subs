Hi everyone. It's raintogreen, Jennifer.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.359
I'm going to show you my recipe for 
gluten free coffee cake today.

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.850
First off, we're going to make the topping,
the cinnamon sugar topping.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.789
So we're going want to start with

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.119
one

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.640
tablespoon of butter.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.180
and this needs to be melted

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.720
You can do that in the microwave.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.140
I don't have one so I'm going to 
stick it in the oven.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.550
Alright, coming out of the oven.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.670
and it's melted.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.020
add your brown sugar.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.530
and cinnamon and one tablespoon of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.980
flour. This is gluten free flour.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.740
I'll have all of the measurements in
the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.740
description below.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.400
The original recipe called for one
tablespoon of flour. But I find 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.200
gluten free recipes

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.040
have to be tweaked

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.900
quite a lot.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.380
Crumbly.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.710
It holds together a little bit but

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.630
that's good

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.420
I'm going to set that aside.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.190
We'll check it again

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.470
just before we put it on the top.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380
Now the actual body of the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.640
coffee cake.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.200
We're going to start with

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.530
one tablespoon of butter again and that
also needs to be melted. So into

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.990
the oven it goes.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.100
Alrigt, it's melted and just came out of the oven.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.439
So now I'm going to add

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.530
my egg

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.590
and my brown sugar

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.399
and my milk.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.380
and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.610
today

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.530
I'm using soy milk but I have used

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.210
cow milk. I've used goat, almond.
Any milk

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:12.210
pretty much works. 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.919
Alright, so it's kind of a 
sloppy, gloppy mess.

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.219
Add my flours to it.

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.560
This is two different types of flours
and I'll link

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.629
to those description below.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.899
xanthan gum and baking powder.

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:34.899
and a tiny pinch of salt.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:44.519
There we go, a nice good batter.

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.439
Take your pan

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.369
which just has a little olive oil in the
bottom of it.

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:53.659
Spread it around to help it not stick.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.540
You can flour your pan too if you want.
This is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.169
a 8.5 inch

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:05.169
pan and sometimes I use my cast iron
pans. It just depends.

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.789
Wiggle it to flatten it out.

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:28.789
And grab your little crumbly topping.

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.549
I've added fruit to the top of this, fresh 
or canned. Make sure it's well drained.

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.189
I know it looks like a lot. But it
bakes in and

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.169
it's really yummy!

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:48.339
Into the oven it goes.

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:55.339
Okay, it's ready to come out of the oven.

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.629
Gluten free coffee cake.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.879
Enjoy!
