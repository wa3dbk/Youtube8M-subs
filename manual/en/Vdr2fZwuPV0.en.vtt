00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:00.922
- Hey guys.

00:00:00.922 --> 00:00:01.927
It's me, Anne.

00:00:01.932 --> 00:00:02.538
How is it going?

00:00:02.608 --> 00:00:05.330
So, a lot of you guys have
been requesting for me

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.377
to do a home office/hobby room tour.

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:12.330
This is actually my hobby room right here

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.054
and I also work in here as my office.

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:18.043
And it's just been a
great, great place for me

00:00:18.043 --> 00:00:20.881
to kick back, relax,
and have my "me" time.

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:24.382
So, yeah, it's kind of
like a personal space

00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:25.589
but at the same time,

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.035
you guys have been watching
me work in this room.

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:32.465
So, you guys will get to see
this personal room of mine.

00:00:32.528 --> 00:00:35.117
This room has just been always like filled

00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:37.172
with tons of projects going on.

00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:39.296
So, it's always cluttered and I never

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:40.904
get a chance to film it.

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:43.394
This time around, it's finally organized

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:45.728
and there's space to kind of like

00:00:45.728 --> 00:00:48.104
show you guys how this
place is supposed to look.

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:49.822
We are actually, well,

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:51.064
Eric, Vincent, and myself,

00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:53.665
we're actually packing
our things up this week

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:56.492
and moving everything to California.

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.504
We will be moving in the OC area,

00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:02.082
so I cannot wait to get some sunshine

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:04.816
and start that new chapter in my life.

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:06.586
It's going to be interesting.

00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:08.339
I don't know what to expect yet,

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:10.278
but we're ready for a change.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.020
And we still have our business here,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.986
so we will be traveling
back and forth a lot.

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:17.859
But, yeah, we're excited

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.923
and I cannot wait to show you guys

00:01:20.923 --> 00:01:22.730
my new office after the tour.

00:01:22.862 --> 00:01:25.257
My new office is going to be smaller.

00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:27.968
So, the room, the space,

00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:30.121
I'm going to miss the space, definitely.

00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:31.237
But, you know what?

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:32.839
I'm just going to be grateful

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:34.587
and work with what I have.

00:01:34.732 --> 00:01:37.165
And, yeah, let's get started with this.

00:01:37.328 --> 00:01:41.794
