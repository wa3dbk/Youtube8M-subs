00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Fifteen years of Diablo.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.100
I've been there since the beginning as a member of the community.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.400
The last six years as a developer.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.800
And I have to say, one of the greatest things I found in making the transition

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
was the incredible support and passion that we get from our community.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.800
We've really worked hard to make a game worthy of all of you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.800
You've given us such great feedback; such great support

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.800
and really made us feel like you will always help us find the right path,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.800
the right choices to make sure it's the best game it can be.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.300
My relationship with Diablo started, I was playing Warcraft II,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
and I remember looking on the back of the C.D. case

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.300
and there was this advertisement for this game called Diablo.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.800
And I remember leading up to just the release of the original Diablo.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.800
In my house, my wife was not allowed to say it at normal volume.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.500
It was always spoken of in hushed tones.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.800
And then the day that it arrived, and we all took several days off

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.800
and gonna burn through the game.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.150
It was really getting it that first time and seeing it.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.500
That was one of the most memorable moments for me,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.800
is with the original Diablo.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.200
One of  the great things about all the Diablo games,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.800
Is how they've kind of moved forward with the original Diablo.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.800
It was a very simple, straight forward game.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.800
And the second game really managed to maintain that, keep the simplicity.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.800
A lot of games when you make sequels they tend to make the game more complex.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.800
But Diablo II kept that simplicity but added things like the skill trees.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.800
Which really changed how you built characters in pretty much all action RPGs to follow.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.800
Working on Diablo III, one of the things we tried to focus on was,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.800
We wanted to keep the game really simple but add a lot more depth to all the mechanics.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.800
We didn't add anymore controls, we didn't make the game anymore complex,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.800
but we made the controls and the elements that were already there

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.800
Have a lot more depth to them.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.800
So it's one of the things we've tried to hold onto with Diablo III.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.800
Is to make sure that it's got that really simple faÃ§ade

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.200
the hides that really rich deep game underneath.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.800
We're almost done with Diablo III,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.500
and that's a fitting celebration of the fifteen year Anniversary for Diablo.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.800
So we'll get it to you as soon as we can.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Thank you so much for how much raw energy and passion that all of you have brought

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.800
To the Diablo games, and we hope that Diablo III really lives up to all your expectations.
