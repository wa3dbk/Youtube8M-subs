one or both

but everywhere I went,
perfectly decent people

I had not considered,

how much it hurts me
to punch somebody.

Having been shot three times
with a gun,

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:28.521
I underwent emergency surgery
to save my life.

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:31.457
The extreme blood loss
caused me to slip into a coma,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.627

as restful.

smothering him,

My intern, Josh, stopped by
with his new girlfriend, Tina.

They behaved regrettably
during their visit.

I was touched to see that even
my estranged ex-wife stopped by,

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:08.127
and despite the presence
of this show's cameras,

almost entered my room.

But most frequently by my side
were my father

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:17.236
and my nurse, Marisa,
who was holding my hand

from two months in a coma.

Learning to walk again was

one of the greatest challenges

Over time, we shared
our fears and struggles,

as she now held me,
