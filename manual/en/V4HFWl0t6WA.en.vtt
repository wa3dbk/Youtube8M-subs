00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.790
Hi, I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now we're
going to separate our eggs for our 14 egg

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.800
whites. It's very important to have very,
very clean and grease free bowels to put the

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.760
egg whites into. We're going to be whipping
our egg whites to a meringue and it has to

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.800
be cleaned, it will not whip up to their full
volume if there is even a drop of grease in

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.360
the bowels. So you must make sure just even
if you have taken your bowels out of the cabinet,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.980
wash them with soap and water and dry them
out before we start. Okay, now I'll show you

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.800
how to separate eggs. We need 14 egg whites.
So I like to separate into a separate bowel

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.290
and you just crack the egg and try to hold
onto the egg yoke in the shell and you can

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.020
drop the egg yoke back and forth into the
shell and without getting the egg yoke in

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.250
there. Now, if the egg yoke breaks and it
ends up in your white, then you can discard

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.939
that without ruining the whole 14 egg whites.
This one is clean. Another way to separate

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.842
an egg is to crack the egg into your hand,
just drop the yoke and the egg into your hand

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:36.659
and let the white run out between your fingers
and then discard the yoke. Okay, we'll need

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:45.270
to do several of these. If you're doing it
this way through your hand, it's easier if

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:54.359
you can crack the egg with one hand and I'll
show you how to do that. If you grasp the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:00.750
egg like this so that these two fingers are
going to pull the shell that way and these

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:09.740
two fingers are going to pull the shell that
way, then crack the egg and just drop it.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.319
You usually drop it into your hand but I just
dropped it into the bowel. You can just pick

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:23.830
up the yoke, if the yoke ends up in there
whole and you separate the egg. Let me do

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:34.330
that one more time.
And just loosely giggle that yoke back and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:44.540
forth to remove all the egg white. Continue
and separate all your 14 eggs, reserving the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.579
egg white and we will not need the egg yokes
for this recipe.
