00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.271
Let’s talk about planes, trains, busses
and cruises. I’ll start with air travel

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:24.550
first. First both the Humane Society of America
and the ASPCA which is the American Society

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.289
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
both recommend that you don’t ship your

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:36.710
pets in cargo areas of planes. I’ll talk
more about this in a few moments. If your

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.640
dog is small, you may be able to keep her
in the cabin with you. Check with the airlines

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.830
you are interested in as they all have different
rules. Some won’t even let you bring small

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.590
dogs in the cabin. Generally your dog can
travel in the cabin considered as a carry

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.750
on if it is small enough to fit in a kennel
under the seat and if there are at least 8

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.379
weeks or older. You will probably also need
a form filled out by a vet stating that your

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.830
dog is in good health and has had certain
vaccinations. Also there will be an extra

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.380
fee to fly with you. Try to get him used to
his carrier a little bit each day well in

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.340
advance of your flight. To keep your dog’s
need to toilet in flight to a minimum, don’t

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.710
feed him 4 to 6 hours of your flight. If you
are thinking of having your dog fly in a cargo

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.259
area of a plane, please reconsider. Pets are
treated like objects and are placed in an

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.499
area not designed for living things. It is
a sad fact that pets are killed, injured and

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:50.549
lost on commercial flights. Other unpleasant
things often happen in your carriers too.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.560
When later you pick up your pet, you may find
that they are covered in drinking water, food,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:05.580
urine and worse. They might also be understandably
frightened. If you would like more information

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.649
regarding both reasons to avoid air travel
and how to make it safe as possible if you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.760
must ship Fluffy. Check out the website of
the Humane Society of the United States for

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.530
their article titled tips for safe pet air
travel. The last time I checked they had about

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.580
15 things to make flying safer and more comfortable.
There is also good information on the ASPCA

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:41.220
website. Regarding trains and busses at this
time, both Amtrak and Greyhound do not allow

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:50.430
pets. As for cruises, I’ve seen harbor cruises
for 2 hours or less that do allow dogs. You

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.120
may want to ask a travel agent if there are
any ocean cruises available for dogs. Lastly

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.080
if you can’t travel by car with your dog,
with some research you may find a non-commercial

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.710
airline or ground service that specializes
in safe pet transport.
