Greg Williams from Bowers and Wilkins visited
us here at Crutchfield today to tell us about

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.160
the Zeppelin Air.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.350
Greg: The big aspect of it I believe is the
AirPlay, because the AirPlay allows you to

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.160
be able to stream music throughout your house
from either iTunes or from your iPhone, iPod,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.840
iPad — any of those devices. So it allows
us to be able to effortlessly have our music

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.619
in our pocket and play it in the room that
we're in.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.170
So what we have in Zeppelin, it has sort of
a funny shape as you can see, but the reason

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.350
why it's shaped this way is very much from
a sonic as opposed to just an aesthetic reason.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.969
There are tweeters, little tweeters, on both
ends and pushed up next to the tweeters are

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.129
mid-bass drivers so you get a nice stereo
separation in the room and then the center

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.449
of the speaker is really a 5-½ inch subwoofer.
So those drive units are all brand new, and

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.680
we made the woofer so that it made deeper
bass and a lot more bass than the prior Zeppelin.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.250
The mid-bass driver we have now re-engineered
it so it has much wider dispersion and of

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.380
course the tweeter's redesigned to compliment
the mid-bass driver to give you that great

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.770
dispersion-a little extra sizzle on the cymbals.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.182
When you operate your iPod you know you mostly
are sitting there and you've got it in one

00:01:11.182 --> 00:01:15.152
hand and you're operating it with your thumb.
So we didn't think it would be fair to the

00:01:15.152 --> 00:01:20.360
consumer to have to then to go to their dock
and stab at their iPod. So we made the arm

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.890
so you can get your hand behind it and operate
your iPod, just like you would if you were

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:32.610
walking along. We've also added a new digital-to-analog
converter so it's got a new 24-bit 96K d-to-a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.840
converter built into it so we can really take
advantage of high resolution as we send the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.180
signal through the now audiophile grade digital
signal processing.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.310
Other things to notice about the Zeppelin
— I'm gonna turn it around here so you can

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.130
see — but the Zeppelin has some special
features on the back as well. We have a technology

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.270
that we call, we have trademarked Flowport,
and we have dimples in our port and we have

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.280
these two small ports which help to enhance
the bass and extend the bass frequencies.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.410
We included Ethernet cable in the box so that
people can easily set up their Zeppelin and

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.851
all they do is they plug their computer into
the Zeppelin and Zeppelin then serves up a

00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:16.140
web page which asks three questions. What
do you want to name it? I'd like mine to be

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.860
bedroom speaker. What network do we want to
have it attach to? Greg's house. And what's

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.310
the network password? And once you answer
those three questions you hit the "join" button

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.310
and within a few seconds you're able to get
on your phone, log onto the Zeppelin, and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.590
then play music. The last port is a composite
video out and if I've downloaded a movie to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.630
my iPhone or whatever and I've watched half
of it on the plane I can come home, dock my

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.070
IOS device, and watch the rest of the movie
through my big screen TV.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.000
And if you have any questions about the Zeppelin
Air give us a call.
