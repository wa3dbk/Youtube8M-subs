00:00:13.332 --> 00:00:20.044
I started as a DJ in 2002 and 
 I've taught everything myself in this field.

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:27.658
My first appearance was in 2003, when I 
 played music in a pub in Hanover/Germany.

00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:32.098
It was a very exciting experince for me.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.375
There were around 2500 people in the pub.

00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:38.756
I was very nervous.

00:00:39.963 --> 00:00:44.626
Prior to the concert, I told the organizers that I'm pro 
 and that I had three years experience as a DJ.

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:48.189
Otherwise I wouldn't have been allowed to perform.

00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:55.157
So, I acted as if I was a professional DJ and everything went well.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:01:01.683
In the first 15 minutes, I was a little bit shaky, 
 but after a while I got used to it.

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:04.581
I played two hours in total.

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:10.206
One of my favourite artists is "Richie Hawtin".

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.500
He has been in the industry for many years and I like his work.

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:17.833
We performed together at the Mad Club in Switzerland.

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:20.818
It was very exciting to meet my idol for the first time.

00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:31.074
My other favourite is a famous producer, who has 
 worked with many artists, such as "Loco Dice".

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:33.259
His name is Martin Butic (?).

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.033
The quality of his work is very high.

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:41.230
His production method is detailed and creates emotions.

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:43.450
It's simply amazing!

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:48.600
I like "Deep House", "Tech House", "House" and "Techno".

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.270
What kind of music I play, depends on the location.

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:57.450
Which pub, which city and which country.

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:11.250
Here in Thailand, for example in the pub "Glow", I like to warm 
 up with 4 hours of "Deep House" first until I play "Techno".

00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:23.440
I advise people interested in becoming a DJ to think for a moment and 
 ask yourself whether djing is something that you really want to do,

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:25.260
so that you don't waste your time.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.100
You need to love to listen to music.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:32.440
Pratice a while for yourself and when you think you are ready.

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:34.640
Go for it!

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.260
Don't think about becoming famous and that you'll 
 travel to a lot of different places.

00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:49.090
Have fun with what you do first and good things will follow.

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:59.829
From my experience in playing in many foreign 
 locations, I think each crowd is different.

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.600
People, who come to my concerts have only one purpose,

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:09.570
which is to enjoy my music and have fun.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:18.060
There are no commercials in this kind of music 
 like "Deep House", "Tech House" and "Techno".

00:03:18.682 --> 00:03:23.520
The audience expects to be surpised by my music.

00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:27.530
It wants to listen to music that it hasn't heard before elsewhere.

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.890
The same thing applies to me.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.540
When I buy new music, I want to be surprised as well.

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:39.360
Sometimes, I don't even remember the titles, but I 
 like to mix fresh tunes that suprise me.

00:03:42.562 --> 00:03:48.270
In 2012, I will regularly release tracks each month.

00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:55.790
When I travel, I use Ableton Live to collect music ideas.

00:03:56.564 --> 00:04:06.070
Back at the studio in Berlin, I use Logic 
 Pro to work further on these ideas.

00:04:11.455 --> 00:04:14.720
One of my planned projects is to make an album.

00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:18.430
Personally, I like "Funk", "Jazz" and "Soul".

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:30.430
I want to combine this music styles with electronic 
 beats at the speed of 110 bpm.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:33.180
Not too underground.

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:36.610
And there are many more projects planned.

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:48.130
In the past, I thought Thailand needs a 
 change the way electronic music is perceived.

00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:53.680
Today though, I think there has been a growing up process in this field.

00:04:54.253 --> 00:05:06.640
Many famous artists now come to Thailand and I'm proud that I can 
 play my music style everywhere in the country and entertain people.

00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:17.840
One crazy thing happened to me recently after I played in music Ibiza.

00:05:18.391 --> 00:05:33.160
My flight got cancelled and I had no to place to 
 stay, cause I already checked out of the hotel.

00:05:33.993 --> 00:05:38.270
Fortunately, a friend, who had a surgery and had to stay at a hospital,

00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:42.220
told me that there is a free bed in the 
 same hospital room and that I could sleep there.

00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:52.450
The next morning while my friend was out of the room, 
 a doctor came by and wanted to check my blood.

00:05:53.492 --> 00:05:58.600
I said, "NO, NO, it's not me. The patient 
 you are looking for will be back soon."

00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:11.030
You can follow my work on Facebook and Youtube.

00:06:16.327 --> 00:06:21.810
I'd like to invite all of you to come to 
 my concerts, enjoy music, dance and have fun,

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.350
when I come back to Thailand in January/Febuary 2013, provided the world still exist.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.890
Right?! See you then!
