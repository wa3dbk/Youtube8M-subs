00:00:01.844 --> 00:00:06.118
This power wheelchair is fitted 
 with a Genie Joystick.

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:10.188
The Genie Joystick enables integrated 
 control over a wheelchair, computer,

00:00:10.188 --> 00:00:11.318
mobile phone and environmental 
 or communication device.

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:20.299
It can replace the standard joystick  on a
power wheelchair that has  Dynamic DX controls.

00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:22.630
Pressing a switch allows the joystick to go from

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.192
driving the chair to controlling other features of the chair

00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:30.032
such as the lights, chair actuators 
 mouse control or control of an external device.

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:44.177
Computer control is selected with the joystick. 
 This is represented by the symbol C on the seven segment display.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:45.766
A mouse emulator on the table is connected to the PC

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:46.988
and once the chair is within range

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.957
the joystick will control the mouse cursor.

00:00:49.957 --> 00:00:52.026
For this demonstration an onscreen keyboard 
 has been set up with a word processor.

00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:57.127
 so that typing can be accomplished.

00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:00.606
The cursor is moved by the joystick over the desired letter.

00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:03.276
Pressing the switch will emulate a left click

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:06.109
which sends the character to the word processor.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.599
If necessary the right click can be emulated with another switch.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:15.099
The switch is pressed again and external access is selected.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:18.559
A Gewa Prog has been connected up to the Genie plus.

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:23.540
Selecting external access on the Genie 
 allows the joystick to control the Gewa Prog.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.491
This has been setup with infra red signals 
 to control the CD player.

00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:31.986
Here track 4 has been selected

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:35.535
and then the CD is stopped.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:47.375
Other devices can be controlled 
 such as a communication device.

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:51.685
The mobile phone option is selected on the Genie joystick display.

00:01:51.685 --> 00:01:54.675
Represented by the letter t on the display.

00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:58.964
The joystick now will now control the mobile phone.

00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:04.565
The mobile phone is a smart phone with Click2phone software installed.

00:02:05.347 --> 00:02:13.145
Here I have selecting a contact on the 
 phone and sending a simple message.

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:54.388
Next the chair actuators are selected on the Joystick.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:05.949
The joystick now controls the selected actuator 
 on the chair which tilts the seat.

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:13.611
Finally if lights are installed on the chair 
 they can also be selected and controlled by the Joystick.

00:03:14.023 --> 00:03:17.705
Here the harzard lights and indicators are switched on and off.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
These are the main features of the joystick.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
These are the main features of the joystick.
