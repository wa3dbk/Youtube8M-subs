00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:19.142
We are in Cambridge, England, 1920.

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:21.025
The weather could not have
been more perfect

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:23.559
for high tea on the terrace.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.930
We gathered at the table as
a friendly group of colleagues.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.095
The gathering had been
progressing in a lively fashion

00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:33.039
and the teacups were 
being refreshed,

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.046
when Lady Ottoline abruptly
stopped the server

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:40.673
and pointed out with disdain
that he had poured milk first

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:44.980
and then tea, rather than abiding
by her widely known preference

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.713
for tea first, and then milk.

00:00:48.713 --> 00:00:52.113
Sidelong glances were exchanged
by numerous members

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:55.492
of our assembled group
as they questioned

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:58.055
what difference could it 
possibly make whether

00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:02.243
milk or tea were poured
first in the cup.

00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:06.057
It made, according to
Lady Ottoline, all the difference.

00:01:06.057 --> 00:01:09.596
A difference she could easily taste.

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:13.755
It was at this point that 
I as a scientist

00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:17.395
(and amateur detective)
decided to step in,

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:20.403
and proposed 
a little experiment.

00:01:20.403 --> 00:01:24.005
Safely away from Lady
Ottoline's line of vision,

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.060
eight cups of tea 
were prepared:

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.058
4 cups with tea poured first
and 4 with milk poured first,

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.346
always in equal proportions.

00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:37.947
Happily, Lady Ottoline
sampled each of the 8 cups

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:41.048
and provided the crowd 
with her judgement

00:01:41.048 --> 00:01:44.009
of "tea or milk first".

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.746
Remarkably, Lady Ottoline
identified 8 out of 8 correctly.

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:51.451
Could such a feat
be accomplished

00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:53.060
by sheer guess work??

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.731
Now, as I mentioned, 
I am a scientist above all.

00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:01.140
As such, I left this little party
with more than just some favours.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.947
Indeed, I took with me
much food for thought...

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:09.480
Try my experiment yourself. 
Consider all the possible results.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.045
In what order should
your cups be presented?

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:16.715
How many cups must be
correctly identified to conclude

00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:20.424
that your subject can 
truly tell the difference?

00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:23.696
You will undoubtedly come away
with a greater understanding

00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:26.296
of inferential statistics.
