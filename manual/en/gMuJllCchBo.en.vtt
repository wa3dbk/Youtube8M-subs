00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:15.017
So you've decided that you like your Cyberlox Falls and you want 
 to make a little bit more of an advanced version.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.512
I'm going to show you how to do that using elastic,

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:20.017
your comb clip,

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:21.535
needle and thread,

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.885
scissors and of course your crin.

00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:29.260
You're going to need about two to three bags of 10 yard, large crin,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.017
or if you're using the mini-crin, you'll need a few more bags than that.

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:35.082
The first thing that you're going to do

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:37.886
is you're going to determine the length of your falls.

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:39.341
And in order to do that,

00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:41.092
you just simply hold

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:43.266
a piece of crin, very loosely

00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:44.540
up to the top of your head.

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:45.703
Look in a mirror

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:48.968
and determine where you would like these to be cut.

00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:54.623
So, make sure you also add about an inch and 
 a half to two inches on either side

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.393
so that we can clean up the ends.

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.585
So, I'm going to say about there.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.963
And from there, I'm going to use this piece as my guide

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:08.337
to cut the remainder of my crin.

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:12.862
So let's go ahead and do that.  
 Now when you do that make sure

00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:14.582
that you take up the weight

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:15.704
on your crin

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:20.210
so that you actually get them to be the same size. 
  Crin is very stretchy, so just be careful.

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:35.058
Ok, once you have all of them cut, the 
 next step is to do your sewing.

00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:40.600
The next step is to cut your elastic strip

00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:42.580
and begin sewing on your crin.

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:49.900
For this, I'm just going to simply put a 
 tack stitch into my elastic to anchor it.

00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:59.550
And this will make it easier when I 
 put my first piece of crin on.

00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:01.630
Ok.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.850
If you'd like to have layers in this piece, just simply offset

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:12.070
your crin so that it falls longer on one 
 side of your elastic than the other.

00:02:14.052 --> 00:02:15.840
Ok, I'm just simply going to flatten it out

00:02:22.772 --> 00:02:23.760
and just stitch it

00:02:24.505 --> 00:02:25.480
into place.

00:02:34.703 --> 00:02:35.110
Ok.

00:02:35.898 --> 00:02:37.050
I'm just going to keep going

00:02:37.544 --> 00:02:39.430
by adding our next strip.

00:02:42.634 --> 00:02:44.220
Just flatten that out

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.210
and continue your stitches.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.680
Continue sewing crinoline onto your elastic until your piece is 
 about four to five inches wide in the center.

00:02:54.297 --> 00:02:56.380
In order to create more bulk and depth,

00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:02.080
stitch a second layer right across the center, where 
 you already stitched your first pieces on.

00:03:02.962 --> 00:03:05.660
Now that we have all of our pieces sewn into place,

00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:08.400
and we've established that this is the top and this is the bottom,

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.130
we're ready to sew on our comb clip.

00:03:12.747 --> 00:03:13.920
So, I'm going to do

00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:15.650
a stitch into my elastic

00:03:16.414 --> 00:03:17.480
to get it started.

00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:23.060
Next we're just going to position our comb clip into place.

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:24.990
And then,

00:03:28.764 --> 00:03:33.110
just go around with our stitches.  I know this is a 
 little bit hard to see because it's black on black

00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:39.470
but, we're just going around the top of the clip and through the elastic.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.850
And when we get to the end, we're just going to

00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:51.490
knot our thread

00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:53.900
and cut away the excess.

00:03:54.872 --> 00:04:00.610
The final step is to make sure that all of our layers are in place 
 and cut the way we want, and then simply push in the ends.

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:04.290
So we need to take all of the ends that have these rough cuts

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:07.080
and simply fold them back in on themselves.

00:04:07.828 --> 00:04:09.060
Like so.

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:11.360
If you are using mini crin,

00:04:11.624 --> 00:04:15.280
often times it's helpful to use the end of a pencil

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:18.980
or an eraser to help push those ends in.

00:04:19.712 --> 00:04:23.000
Attaching these cyberlox pieces to your natural hair is very simple.

00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:25.100
You're simply going to put your hair into a bun.

00:04:25.654 --> 00:04:28.870
Use the comb clip and push it underneath that bun.

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:34.010
Then you're going to take the two elastic straps, 
 pull it down, and tie it underneath.

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:38.520
If you don't have enough hair to wrap 
 it around your ponytail or your bun,

00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:42.760
then all you're going to do is simply 
 take those legs and pin them around.

00:04:43.727 --> 00:04:49.230
From here, you're ready to add a crin top piece 
 or use a wrap to cover your natural hair.

00:04:49.752 --> 00:04:52.130
This completes your finished cyberlox style.
