device that's glued to your ear half the day

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.630
but either way you need to protect it
whether it's to increase the longevity of your

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.650
device or to preserve the resell value

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.740
investment and FonZap's state of the
art screen protection technology is what

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.810
you need it's easy to install with no
bubbles and no fingerprints let me show

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.910
you

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.820
with FonZap

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.449
you not just slapping a piece of plastic on
your phone and calling it a screen

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.349
protector this advanced film technology
protects against fingerprints or even

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.470
ninety-nine point nine percent of all
bacteria so let's take a closer look at what you get

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.110
in the kit: a simple set of instructions,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.640
an alcohol swab for cleaning off all those
oily fingerprints from your screen,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.600
a microfiber cloth to polish any remaining
dust or marks before applying the screen

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.330
protector

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.870
a couple pieces of dust removal tape for
those especially hard to get particles

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.250
and a squeegee plate for getting a nice
and smooth finish on that screen with no

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.550
bubbles

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.890
and that's all in addition to a pair of FonZap's
state of the art HD LCD screen

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.380
protection film

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.980
now, let me walk you through the steps:

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.510
start with a quick wipe-down using the
alcohol swab and then dry it and clean off

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.890
the remaining dust particles with the
micro fiber cloth

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.150
next, separate about half the length of the
film from the back cover

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.030
the one marked with the red label and
a "b" for back.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.230
This will allow you to line up the
exposed film with the top border of the

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.100
screen

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.600
and slowly run the rest of the film
down the side

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.730
making sure to line up the sides and the
home button.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.270
Just be sure to take your time.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.700
If you run off track

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.900
gently remove and start over without
touching the underside of the film

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.930
and don't worry about getting air
trapped underneath the screen that's

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.500
what the squeegee is there for

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.030
but once it's on just pull the blue tab and
remove the film covering the screen

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.100
protector.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.420
See take a look at that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.550
no bubbles.  It's that easy.  The right tools
can really go a long way.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.130
