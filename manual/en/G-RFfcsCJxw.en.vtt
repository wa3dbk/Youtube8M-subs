The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene | Law Number 14... Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.180
Knowing about your rival is critical. Use
spies to gather valuable information that

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.720
will keep you a step ahead. Better still:
Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.050
learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to
get people to reveal their weaknesses and

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.160
intentions. There is no occasion that is not
an opportunity for artful spying.

5 Reasons to Secretly Put the Clients’ Staff
on Your Payroll

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.190
1. You will gain some valuable information.
2. You will know their comings and goings,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.370
changes in taste, and other such tidbits of
information that will be priceless.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.010
3. You will appear to be all knowing because
you will be one step ahead of your competition.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.460
4. Your knowledge of your mark can also make
you seem charming, so well can you anticipate

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.390
his desires.
5. No one sees the source of your power, and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.800
what they cannot see they cannot fight.
The Risks of Hiring Spies

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.370
· You have little control over the people
who are doing the work.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.000
· Perhaps they will ineptly expose your spying.
· They may secretly turn against you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.360
6 Tips on the Art of SPYING
1. Pose as a friend while secretly gathering

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.820
information.
People will think that you genuinely like

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.530
them and mistake your interest as friendship.
2. Learn to possess the ability to suppress

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.100
your thoughts in the conversation, speak when
only necessary.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.030
3. Learn to make others talk endlessly about
themselves.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:46.039
They will inadvertently reveal their intentions
and plans.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:53.380
4. Organize social gathering with people whom
you are interested in knowing.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:09.350
This is when most people’s guards are down.
5. Stir up people’s emotions by contradicting

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.860
them.
In their emotional state they will reveal

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.209
all kinds of truths about themselves, truths
you can later use against them.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.390
6. Give them a false confession.
By pretending to bare your heart to another

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.129
person, you make them more likely to reveal
their own secrets.

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.209
This can also be a test to see if you can
trust the person with your secret and reveal

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.340
their true character, loyalty and honesty.
This kind of knowledge is often the most valuable

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.050
to predict future actions.
The Risks of Spying Directly

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.630
· People may begin to suspect you are worming
secrets out of them under the guise of conversation.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.340
· Your search for gems of information cannot
be too obvious.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.959
· Your probing questions will reveal more
about yourself and your intentions than about

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.069
the information you hope to find about them.
Information is critical to power, but just

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.090
as you spy on other people, you must be prepared
for them to spy on you. One of the most potent

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.890
weapons in the battle for information, then,
is giving out false information. By feeding

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.209
people wrong information, then, you gain a
potent advantage. While spying gives you a

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.510
third eye, disinformation puts out one of
your enemy's eyes. A Cyclops, he always misses

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:46.239
his target.
