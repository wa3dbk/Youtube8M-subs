00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.420
Hey Guys!

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.730
My name is Caitlin and welcome back to Cait
Straight Up!

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.080
This weekend on the beach I found myself very
involved in July's issue Southern Living's

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.140
Country Music's Greatest Eats that's when
I got to Miranda Lambert's section on her

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.529
Momma's Meatloaf and ever since then that's
all I've been thinking about.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.280
So I thought what cooler way than showing
some love for Miranda, we love her, she's

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.510
talented, she rocks it, she's an amazing woman,
than to make her a meatloaf here on Cait Straight

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.510
Up!

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.970
So Miranda Lambert in honor of you we're making
a meatloaf today.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.300
Let's get right into it.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.210
We're going to start mixing all of our ingredients
into this bowl for our actual loaf, then we

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.650
are going to move on to our awesome sauce
to smother on top.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.670
In this bowl we have a mixture of ground veal,
ground pork and ground beef the three of them

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.100
together is delicious and makes the best meatloaf.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.479
We're then going to add one whole egg to our
beef, veal and pork mixture.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:18.380
Then we're going to add one whole chopped
Vidalia Onion.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.701
Right on top there cause we're going to have
to get down and dirty and mix this all up.

00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:24.840
Half a cup of butter milk.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.720
Right over the top.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.700
A salt and pepper mix to your liking.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.810
And one cup of Panko bread crumbs with garlic
powder and parsley.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.130
I already mixed that all together in this
mix so we're just going to sprinkle it over

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.950
the top here.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.789
The last and final ingredient is about two
tablespoons of a Marsala.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.799
Now I'm going to just eye it here but it's
about two tablespoons depending on how much

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.759
meat you have so we're just going to add a
little bit over the top.

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.319
I'm going to start to mix this all together
with a wooden spoon but I find with a meatloaf

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.360
the best way to get all of your ingredients
combined is to get right in there, roll up

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.860
your sleeves and mix it together with your
hands.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.569
So we got started on our mixing with our spoon
and it's about that time.

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.090
We got to roll up our sleeves and dig in with
our hands.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.530
So here we go.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.270
Alright so you're just going to kneed it in
like this, all of your ingredients.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.620
Don't think about it too much it's not that
bad, just get everything in here.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.830
If you start to notice that you need to add
another egg, or some more breadcrumbs, any

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.000
of your ingredients that's fine.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720
Sometimes you have more meat, or less meat.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.420
Anything you need to form it into a nice solid
bread loaf, just feel free to add as you're

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.420
going.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.890
It should start taking shape and that's when
you know it's ready to go.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.240
Another important thing to keep in mind is
that you're touching raw meat.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.940
So if you have to touch anything else in your
kitchen, make sure to wash your hands really

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.409
really good before you do so, you don't want
to spread bacteria.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.099
Thankfully I had a helper lay out my pan right
in front of me.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:16.730
We're going to go ahead and spread out our
loaf right a long the pan here.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:26.209
You definitely can use a different type of
pan but I find the best meatloaf's are just

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.540
flat out on a tray.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.700
So we're nice and mixed here, we're looking
good.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.120
We're just going to plop this big hunk of
meat right down here and start to form a loaf.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.810
You can do it right with your hands.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.689
If we have the perfect amount of egg, bread
crumbs, and ingredients, it should form nicely.

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.260
You don't want it to be too fat cause then
it will take way too long to cook.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.640
So keep that in mind you do want it to be
more close to the pan, you don't need a loaf

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.640
way up here.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.689
So go ahead flatten it out and start to build
it's shape.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:11.409
So I went ahead and set my loaf off to the
side and am going to start whisking together

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:18.680
my sauce to smother all on top here, we're
going to do that about one to three times

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.680
during cooking.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.740
A light layer initially, maybe once again
half way through and then right before we

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.250
take it out of the oven.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.690
We're going to start with about a cup and
a half of ketchup, regular Heinz Ketchup is

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.070
fine, and we're going to pour in about maybe
a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.050
we're then going to add a fourth of a cup
of brown sugar, and this is some chipotle

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.150
chili powder.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.260
We're just going to sprinkle a little bit
of this across the top.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.340
Just to give it an extra kick.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.060
You'll love it I promise.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:02.830
So then we're going to just whisk this all
together, don't be afraid to really dig in

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.290
there.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.890
In In In woo!

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.670
That actually smells good already.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.490
Gotta get my some muscle in it.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.910
Alright I think we're ready.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.870
This is the coloring that we're looking for
here.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.080
A nice deep rusty brown, you don't want it
too red that means we didn't add enough of

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.110
our brown sugar and chipotle.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.670
All you're going to do after that is spread
a nice thin layer right over top and pop it

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.970
in your oven.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.310
So we're going to go nice and quickly across
the top like this.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.700
Get the middle a little bit there we go.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.060
And then we're going to spread it out just
like that.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.060
So we're spreading it all good here.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.340
We're making sure it's nice and even, everything's
covered.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.770
Miranda I know it's not your Momma's but I
think it's going to be pretty tasty.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.720
I know it's going to be tasty.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.280
And once you have a nice even layer you're
going to pop it into a 350 degree oven, for

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.060
anywhere between forty minutes to an hour
depending on how thick you made your loaf.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.560
The important thing is that it has to reach
an internal temperature of 160 degrees.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.030
Remember guys we're going to go ahead and
re-sauce twice through out cooking and I'm

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.270
going to go ahead and pop this in the over
and I'll see you when it's done.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.540
It's been about an hour and this meatloaf
looks fantastic and it smells even better.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.340
Ever since I read that article in Southern
Living Magazine about Miranda's Momma's Meatloaf,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.160
