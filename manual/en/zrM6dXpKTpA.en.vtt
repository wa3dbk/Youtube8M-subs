00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.000
The 8th MMD CUP entry

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's hot.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.000
Then buy an air-conditioner.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I bought ice cream.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.000
Oh!?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.500
Yay!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'll eat an adzuki.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.000
I'll eat a choco monaka.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.000
The ice cream is delicious.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.700
Yeah.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.700
There's no delicious food like ice cream.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.300
No. There's a lot of food.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.700
What food is better than ice cream?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There's a lot.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Bananas,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
sushi,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
bananas,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
yakiniku,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
curry,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500
and bananas!

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.700
I'll treat your banana addiction!

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.000
You crack me up.
Give it a shot with your ice cream-addicted brain.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.700
Eh?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.800
(Isn't it hot?)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.700
Quit Faking it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A ha ha.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Because it's too hot.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.200
Hey. Calm down, calm down.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.700
Decide it by playing janken.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.000
Well, in this chance, I eat it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.300
You're terrible!

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.000
You damn coward. Fight us!

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.500
I'm telling you that you should decide it with a game of janken.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.700
E-Excuse me.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Master.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What did you come here for?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.500
It's the deadline for MMD CUP 8. So I have to submit the video as is.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.000
I didn't make the deadline for uploading.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700
The deadline...

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.000
Whoa!?

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.000
I didn't make the deadline at all.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300
(Oh well. He's hopeless.)

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.200
I'm disappointed.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.500
Hey. Why is the Video called Fruit?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.000
This video is "unfinished". Therefore the title is "A fruit".
(Reuploader: In Japanese, "unfinished" and "mandarin orange" use the same characters, Mi and Kan.)

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.300
And you decided to think about it just now?

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.000
