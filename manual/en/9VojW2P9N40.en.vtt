Hi there and welcome back.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.180
I hope that you have been enjoying and exploring
some of the digital materials that we have

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.650
got for you here, and also the physical materials
that you can view and download from the European

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.840
Schoolnet Academy pages on the Games based
learning course.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.890
This is module 1 as you already know and we
are on the third unit of module 1 now: How

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.070
do we learn with games?

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.460
I guess the important thing to say here is
that one of the great things about games is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.460
that they are competitive.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.879
There is nothing wrong with a bit of competition
in the schools.

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.260
The problem with it of course is the good
thing about computer games is that they are

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.070
competitive, but also in a non-threatening
way, and there is something about that actually

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.620
encourages people to learn rather than scares
them off the learning experience.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.769
Perhaps it would be better if I gave you an
example.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.980
One oft he games that I will mention later
on, it is a project that was run by The Consolarium,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.270
the former Scottish Centre for Games based
learning, and they were looking at the impact

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.229
of brain training on mental maths.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.270
One of the videos in the case study, which
you can go away and you can view online, shows

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.290
a little boy being able to do 20 mass sums
in under 10 seconds.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.560
It really was quite remarkable.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.880
But the interesting thing about this is that
the little boy normally would not have been

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.080
very keen to do these maths sums on a piece
of paper because he might be embarrassed if

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.380
he got them wrong.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.369
And there is something about that kind of
competitive non-threatening nature of the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.939
video game which made him want to come back
and to improve, but at the same time he was

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:39.939
not embarrassed by it.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.250
I think we have a lot to learn from games,
from this and for the classroom.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.539
Why did he do this?

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.021
One of the reasons he did it was he wanted
to please his classroom teacher, but not being

00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:53.590
embarrassed amongst his friends, but also,
we think as well that this little boy started

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.140
to build up a relationship between himself
and a game character, in this case Professor

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.040
Kawashima.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.460
We know again from early years education that
it is not unusual for young children to build

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.509
up relationships with objects, for example
a teddy bear.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.530
And of course all that was happening in this
case was taken into the domain of a child,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.010
and he was building up a relationship with
his electronic character.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.220
It really is interesting and fascinating stuff.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.780
The other interesting thing about games is
the highly culturally relevance.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.790
I don�t think that you will find many young
children across Europe that are not interested

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.879
in computer games.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.730
There might not be games for an Xbox or a
PlayStation, but there might just be social

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.760
games or games that are linked to apps on
their mobile phones.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.400
Many of these of course are freemium and we
will come back to that in module 6.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.680
So technology and in particular games is highly
culturally relevant at the moment.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.069
And if we can position the games in the classroom,
so children buy into it, they can be used

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.390
as very powerful agents for learning and teaching.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.800
The other great thing about games is that
they speak a common language.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.299
I am pretty sure that if you are watching
this video and English is not your first language,

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.750
you will have seen a lot of very badly dubbed
English films.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.920
The thing about a computer game is that I
have never seen a badly dubbed one.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.530
In fact, computer games are produced professionally
and in just about every single country of

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.110
the world and they are easily animated to
avoid those language barriers.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.670
The something about computer games which are
a common language across children in Europe

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.489
and indeed further across the world.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.580
And I can think of a real-life example of
this that impacted on me back in 2010, when

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.750
I took a group of young people from my school
in Edinburgh over to the Alaska and we canoed

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.680
a river called the Noatak.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.220
At the end of this 14-day canoe journey, we
landed our canoes on the beach, ready to be

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.520
flown out, and the young people that I was
with also were speaking to the young people

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.480
that were in the Inuit village, and they were
chatting away, and they were talking about

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.230
different experiences and within about 30
minutes they swapped their Xbox and Facebook

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.260
IDs, and I know for a fact that they still
keep in contact electronically, because of

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.730
that powerful experience they went through,
but at the same time the reason they were

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.819
able to do that is because of the power of
the video game and the power of other social

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.219
networks, for example Facebook.

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.790
Of course everything that I am saying here
is a little bit common sense, isn�t it?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.159
Because we know that games do unite people.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.180
It�s why the Commonwealth Games that we
have just had here in Scotland in 2014 were

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.180
so important.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.890
It�s why the Olympic Games, that were in
Russia last year and in London before, were

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.770
so important, and then of course events like
the World Cup.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.970
Big sporting events, big game events bring
people together.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.491
And I think that there is absolutely no reason
at all why computer games could not start

00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:34.070
to bring young people together in the third
millennium.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.770
And let�s face it, if we start to use games
as a context for discussion, hopefully good

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.729
discussion will help us all become a little
bit better neighbours and hopefully reduce

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:43.930
conflict in the future as well.
