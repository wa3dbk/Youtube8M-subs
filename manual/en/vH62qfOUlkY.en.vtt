00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.640
I keep trying to take Lyndsey to the opera, but she won't go.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.540
I'm sorry, I'm just not a fan of fat people singing in a foreign language for two and a half hours.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.960
Well, opera is not for everyone.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.280
To appreciate it requires a refined taste and a certain amount of education.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.780
Whoa.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.540
You did not just say that.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.480
Say what?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.680
I am plenty refined and I happen to have an Associate of Arts degree from Santa Monica Community College.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.220
I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to be pejorative.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.760
What's that supposed to mean?

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.840
I also took a semester off to study opera in Florence. That's in Italy.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.900
Wow.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.340
That is one talented lady.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.440
And by "talented" I mean annoying, and by "lady" I mean bitch.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.140
Ooh!

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.640
Ooh.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.840
Ooh.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.040
What are you doing?

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.400
Making love to you.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.500
Ooh.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.860
Ooh.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.860
Want me to help?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.200
No, I got this.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.840
Ooh.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.200
Ooh.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.280
Ooh.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.200
Ooh.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.840
Ooh

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.920
Ooh.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.420
Ooh.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.880
Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.840
Sleep well?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.140
Terrific.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.860
Good. I was afraid we might have kept you awake.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.200
Really?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.120
I was worried we might have kept you awake.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.340
No, no. I slept like a baby.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.320
Hope you didn't wet the bed.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.820
Shame it has to be raining on Valentine's Day.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.820
Yeah. Well, fortunately, the sun is shining in Cabo San Lucas.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.320
Thanks for the weather report. Now here's Alan with the sports.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.740
Roses are red,
violets are blue

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.560
I'm a nice person
and you can bite my pale, unrefined ass.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.140
I'm just saying, I never lie to my daughter.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.760
Really? And how old is she?

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.360
She's six.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.060
Ah, they're so precious at that age, aren't they?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.120
They are.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.060
Call me in a few years when she's pierced and pregnant with a pocket full of 30-day chips.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.340
Get ready for an old-fashioned trade school beat-down.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.360
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.400
Slow down!

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.240
No! No! Little Miss Muffet's going to get knocked on her tuffet!

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.220
Oh, bring it on, Snooki!

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.660
Baby, baby. No.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.860
We're in a tough situation here.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.880
But this is a big house, and we're all adults.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.440
Yeah, some of us older than others.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.720
Do you happen to know where Walden is?

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.500
I happen to not.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.320
Alright.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.520
Where's Alan?

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.900
He went for a walk.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.520
A walk?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.120
Yeah, a walk.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.940
That's how poor people get from one place to another.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.920
Alright.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.120
Mind if I share your wine?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.860
I don't know if you'll like it. It's domestic.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.220
Alan bought it.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.080
Actually, I quite like California wine.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.600
It's from Wisconsin.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.820
Educated girl like you? You've got to have a plan to nail him down.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.680
I don't.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.460
My feelings for Walden are genuine.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.040
I have no desire to manipulate him into some sort of commitment.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.700
Huh.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.720
But if I did, what sort of plan do you think might work?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.080
First thing I'd do is throw out my diaphragm.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.260
I'm on the pill.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.500
Alright. Swap out those puppies for Tic Tacs.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.880
Looks like we both traded up, huh?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.760
Yes, absolutely.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.860
Cheers to us!

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.720
This is turning out to be a pretty nice Valentine's Day.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.940
It is, isn't it?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.960
Thanks for the tampon, by the way.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.120
Oh, pleasure.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.440
Appears our cycles have synced up.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.820
Probably why we haven't seen the boys for a while.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.520
We have been a bit out of sorts.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.400
Edgy.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400
Moody.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.440
Bitchy.
