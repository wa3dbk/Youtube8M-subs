00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.600
So the next thing that we want to do in our
garden when we are ready to plant is we want

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.490
to lay our plants out with their proper spacing.
These snap dragons happen to look best when

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.380
they are planted about eight to ten inches
apart so before I plant them I'm just going

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:38.390
to set them in the ground so I can decide
where they are going to go. So even though

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.489
these are falling over I will still be able
to figure out where I want them to be when

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:51.500
I plant them. This way I ensure as I go that
I will have the proper spacing so when you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.500
are ready to plant the first plant of course
you want to gently remove it from the pot.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:09.080
I like to gently tease the roots apart and
I do this just by taking the root ball and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.979
squeezing it gently between my thumbs. As
you can see I haven't really broken up the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.440
root ball I've just sort of gently loosened
up those roots a little bit. The next thing

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:29.670
I want to do is take my trowel and dig a hole
that is about the same size as the plant.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.600
When I plant this I want to make sure that
the top of the root ball is at the same level

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.350
as the surrounding soil.
