00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.000
Millions of years ago, Australia separated from Gondwana, 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.840
and millions of years later, Tasmania separated from Australia. 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.920
They remained isolated from the rest of the continents, 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.360
so everything here seems different, unique and somehow extravagant.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.440
There are lots of kangaroos in Tasmania. 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.200
They’ve been here for centuries and they come in all sizes and colours.  

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.080
When I see them I wish I could jump like the Samburu.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.640
The dingo arrived three thousand years ago.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520
Some animals arrive and others disappear. 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.280
The arrival of the dingo led to the extinction of the marsupial wolf known as the thylacine.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Although the origins of the dingoes are not entirely clear, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.920
it’s believed that these dogs descended from the Asian wolf.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.240
 Like their wolf ancestors, dingoes hunt in packs. 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.360
Still, people blamed the wolves for their lost animals. 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.360
If we found a dead sheep, they would say, we would blame a thylacine

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.120
In a country full of sheep, settlers vented their anger on the marsupial wolves 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.520
while the actual culprits got off scot-free. 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.480
Though dingoes usually hunt in groups,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.320
 there are also solitary individuals like this one.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.840
He seems to have picked up a trail. 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.920
These canines aren't picky. 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.280
They’ll go after sheep, kangaroos, wombats or lizards. 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.400
With the marsupial wolf out of the way, 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.160
the dingo is now the most feared carnivore in Tasmania, 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.360
able to attack even large kangaroos. 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.600
They don't bark very much, but they wag their tails when they’re happy. 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.320
This animal is in high spirits. 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.040
Dingoes don't really need to hunt they're perfectly happy eating carrion.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.680
Now the thylacines are extinct

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.840
and the dingoes are a problem for the sheep.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.760
The last wolf died here in 1936. 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.280
The settlers and the dingoes were too much for them. 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.120
The government declared the thylacine a protected species on that very same day, but it was too late. 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.680
There wasn't a single marsupial wolf left alive.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.400
 Once in a while someone claims to have seen one, but they never say exactly where.
