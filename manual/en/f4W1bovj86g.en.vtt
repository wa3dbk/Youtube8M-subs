hi

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.559
this is Luke from GuideMyJailbreak.com
and today, I'm gonna be showing you how to

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.869
jailbreak your phone

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.440
iPad or iPod touch with Redsn0w. 
So if you're not already on our website

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.490
go ahead and go to GuideMyJailbreak.com
for a complete guide to jailbreaking

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.400
once you get there and you're watching
this video you're ready to start jailbreaking

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.360
your first step is to download Redsn0w for your Mac.
So click on the link below and download Redsn0w

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.210
Okay great. so you download the Redsn0w. 
now it's time to open it

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.400
so go ahead and click on it

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.600
and then open the file that you downloaded to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.710
in my case I went to my downloads folder

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.730
go ahead and double click on it

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.730
and then double click on the Redsn0w

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.400
okay so on Windows your first step is to download Redsnow. 
so go ahead and click on

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.800
Redsn0w for Windows
Click on open

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.910
double click on the folder
and then double click on Redsn0w

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.409
click run

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.890
click run again

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.110
and now you're there

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.299
so now you'll see this window
and then click on jailbreak

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.430
okay so this next part is where it gets a little bit tricky. 
your next  step is to plug in your device

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.300
turn it off completely

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.850
so to do that go ahead and just click
and hold this sleep button

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.369
for about five seconds

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.060
slide to power off

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.010
if you can't turn off your device for some
reason then just skip the next step

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.150
okay for this next part you may wanna
watch before you actually do it

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.650
what you'll need to do is immediately hold on
the sleep button for three seconds

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.619
then while you're holding onto the sleep button
hold on to the home button for 10 seconds

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.280
then let go of the sleep button
after you do this, you're done

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.780
so go ahead and watch this before you do it
and don't worry if you mess up the first time

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.220
 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.829
you can always try again

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.600
so sleep button for three seconds then
both for 10 seconds

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.440
and then after 10 seconds you let go of the
sleep button

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.600
and just continue holding on to the home
button. hold on to the home button

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.680
for about eight seconds

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.680
and then you're done

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.830
okay so while that jailbreaks, i'm just gonna speed it up.. 
so this is just jailbreaking your phone

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.600
movie applications, things like that

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.790
so just wait for that to finish. 
that could take up to five minutes and when that's done

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.790
watch the rest

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.240
okay so now that's finished. 
your device

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.680
should restart. you should see the
Apple logo so wait for your device to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.190
boot up

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.340
and you'll be ready to go. 
okay so once your device finishes rebooting

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.860
just slide to unlock and then you should try to find an
app called "Cydia"

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.130
that's been added to your device.
as you can see nothing's changed

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.600
just the new app called Cydia.
if you have any issues at all, make sure you should ask for

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.100
help

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.150
so at the top of this website 
there is a button that says "ask for help"

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.790
you click on that and go write in and ask a
question and someone will answer very quickly

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.330
so congratulations on successfully
jailbreaking your device

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.900
if you're ready to embark on making your
device so much better, go ahead

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.090
and click on the "learn Cydia" button below
Thanks for watching!
