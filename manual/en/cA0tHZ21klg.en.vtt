00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.759
Okay now I am going to demonstrate a little
bit of nail art and some different techniques.

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:12.470
I am going to be teaching you how to paint
a flower and how to put a decal on a polished

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.390
nail. Okay, so lets get started. Okay, the
first thing, I am going to take one of my

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.109
fingers that we have already got polished
and you want to take your nail art brush and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:37.000
dip it in a little bit of water. And I just
use, just like normal water based paint, you

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.890
can get at any type of arts and crafts store,
very inexpensive. Okay, what I am going to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.790
paint today is I am going to paint a daisy.
So you just dip your brush into the white,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:58.140
get a little bit of white on the end of that
brush and then with a steady hand you just

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:07.340
take that and you do a little dot and we are
going to do five little dots right side by

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:20.130
side on that nail, making them look like petals.
One more dot there, okay. Go ahead and just

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:30.930
rinse your brush out to get the white out,
dry it out on your little towel. Next color

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.271
we are going to do to, we are going to use
the yellow. We are going to make a yellow

00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:47.110
center. Take a little bit of yellow and we
are just going to dab that right in the very

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:56.200
center of that flower, just like that. Go
ahead and just get all that out and this is

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:04.890
just some really quick and easy nail art that
you can do on your nails. I know whenever

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.950
you do go to the salon there is lots of different
techniques. This is just a really fun, and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.560
I know kids really enjoy the nail art. And
we are just going to just paint a little leaf

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.230
over here, just kind of just drag your brush
a little bit, get a little extra color in

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:36.050
there. One more leaf right there and that
is a sample of a daisy.
