00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.727
Welcome to part 6 of our Frankfurth motorshow report.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.614
Finally, we visit Ferrari.

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:30.653
The 458 Speciale. What a great way to start thre day!

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:34.218
More than 600 hp, but less than 1300 kilo's.

00:00:36.574 --> 00:00:39.514
That's just a bit more than two kilo's for each HP!

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:46.486
The successor to the 430 Scuderia. Very exciting!

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:10.839
Detroit is on the way up again. Just look at this Cadillac El Miraj.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.183
Think this is huge? It's designers were inspired by the even larger '67 Eldorado.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:26.916
A potential competitor to the Mercedes S-Class. But only the Mercedes will enter production.

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:34.592
What a shame, it's really a great statement.

00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:51.099
This is Suzuki's Iv4 concept.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:59.840
Suzuzki doesn't say much about the technology. This is all about design.

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:04.685
This could be the successor to the Grand Vitara. But don't expect to see it on the road before 2015.

00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:16.082
We're back at Renault.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:21.625
Because the Initiale Paris Concept has been presented.

00:02:24.168 --> 00:02:26.052
It tries to be a lot of things, one of them is a study for a new Espace.

00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:35.280
Initiale is to become an exclusive brand within Renault, like Citroen's DS-line.

00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:41.938
Dutchman Van den Acker designed it, you can see the link to the Dezir concept.

00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:46.600
Do I like it? Guess it's a matter of taste ...

00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:02.036
The biggest Lexus-news is this LF-NX.

00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:10.179
Its looks are very stealthy!

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:16.826
Is this an Audi Q5 competitor? Lexus already has one!

00:03:19.281 --> 00:03:23.387
And for a Q3 competitor it's quite large.

00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:26.415
It gets the latest hybrid technology.

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:37.770
The rear lights are special: the light is projected on the road surface. If you brake harder, the light travels further!

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:46.251
This is the Toyota Yaris Hybrid R. Quite a pocket-rocket.

00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:53.921
1.6 turbo with 300 hp and you can have an additional 120 hp from the electric powerplant.

00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:58.874
The 1.6 is a racing engine so don't expect it in production cars anytime soon.

00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:05.892
The electric boost function  is what's important.

00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:14.055
It's a Knight Rider-like boost function, to make a hybrid more fun. I'm curious if it will reach production stage.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.844
In 2007 Ciroen showed the C cactus, as a potential 2 cv-replacement

00:04:35.198 --> 00:04:37.773
This is its successor ...

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:43.312
... but I don't see any 2 cv-genes anymore.

00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:48.818
This is a concept, but Citroen promises a production version for the Geneva show in feb. 2014.

00:04:52.574 --> 00:04:56.230
It's the first car in Citroen's new C-line.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:06.183
C is the oppposite to the luxury DS-line. Now practicality will rule.

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:17.403
Skoda is no nonsense, but the Yeti is an exception. It's been facelifted.

00:05:22.247 --> 00:05:28.328
New headlights and fenders.

00:05:30.823 --> 00:05:41.860
A new steering wheel and a variety of new (safety) systems such as automated parking.

00:05:45.793 --> 00:05:51.752
The rear design has to fit in more with the rest of the range.

00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:06.302
Rubber or cloth ... whatever you prefer.

00:06:10.438 --> 00:06:15.667
And a detachable torchlight in the rear, this car was designed by practical minds.

00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:26.780
This was part six of our IAA video report. And we're not done yet. See you later for part 7.
