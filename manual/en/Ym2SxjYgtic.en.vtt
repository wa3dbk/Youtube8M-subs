00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.850
This is where I'm happy.
At the ocean in South Africa.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.220
This is like nowhere else.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.940
In my job, I smile for ten hours a day.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.620
So I have to make sure
that my batteries are charged.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.240
Most of my energy I get from working
with people from different cultures in my job.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.420
African Perfection.
How can I help you?

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.860
I manage a guesthouse.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.309
When there is good surf weather,
the surfers are positive.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.140
If the weather is bad,
they are not so happy.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.860
Neither am I, when we have
power blackouts every now and then.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.020
I used to work on a cruise ship -

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.729
- but I always knew
would go back to South Africa.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.030
I saw the midnight sun
and I adored The Caribbean - 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.570
- but I love South Africa's mix
of cultures and the energy here.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.360
South Africa is huge. It is rough.
It's 2/3 coastline.

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.240
Every time you look
you see something new.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.060
It goes from desert to forest
to ocean.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.569
I love the people,
the food, the beauty.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.889
There is so much vitality
and resources here.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.000
Supertubes Beach in Jeffreys Bay is
one of the world's best places to surf.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.049
I would love to be good at it.

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.889
And then you're turning to the right.
If you're turning, you can't see the wave.

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.250
I have access to all kinds of resources.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.510
Water, seafood, and electrical power.
Most of the time.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.100
I appreciate my good fortune.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.040
When I can,
I help in a recycling-project,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.260
where children in the community
collect recyclables -

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.230
and earn what we call "mulla"
to pay for things that they need.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.299
Good. How many mullas did you get?
Five mullas.

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.999
I find that it actually gives me energy
to offer my services to people.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.489
It gives me hope to make my modest
contributions to a better world every day.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.680
To make things a little better
for other people.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.400
Even the people I have not met - yet.
