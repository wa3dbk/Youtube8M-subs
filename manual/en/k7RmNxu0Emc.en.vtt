00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.850
Happy Easter everyone, my name is Teeny.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.580
It's that time of year again where a lot of
people go to the local pet stores

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.960
two buy little rabbits just like Blackie over here

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.890
as gifts for their friends. It's also
been observed that pet stores stock up

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.000
during this period due to the increased
demand.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.779
Legend has it that the easter bunny goes
to the homes of little children at night

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.559
with baskets full of coloured eggs, candy
and sometimes even toys and hides them

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.920
in the garden for the little kids to
find when they wake up in the morning.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.150
foresees rabbits gonna represent the fun
part of the Easter and kids go crazy for

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.090
them but can you blame them?
These rabbits are so cute.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.690
However, contrary to popular belief

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.090
rabbits and small children are not a
good match at all. The exuberances and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.290
easily excitable nature of a toddler
is way too stressful for the sensitive

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.900
rabbit.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.590
Children like a companion that they can
hold, carry and cuddle.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.540
Rabbits are not passive and cuddly and
small rabbits do grow up to be big

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.770
adult rabbits.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.260
Rabbits are ground loving creatures and
feel frightened when they're held.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.950
This is because they liken it to being
caught by a predator

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.650
and they can and they will scratch and
bite it their defence. The result?

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.090
The child loses interest and the rabbit gets
neglected an abandoned.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.310
So these easter gifts contribute to
the more than one thousand rabbits that

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.020
are being abandoned in Singapore every
single year.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.260
This works out to more than three rabbits
being abandoned every single day.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.820
So as you're watching this video, somebody
out there it is probably abandoning their

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.880
rabbit

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.430
and the abandoned rabbits that we rescue
come to us in terrible conditions.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.620
They're weak, diseased, injured,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.439
starving

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.790
and most of the time on the brink of
death.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.220
Pet owners need to know that releasing
their rabbits into the wild like into parks

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.170
and reservoirs is not doing them a
service.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.030
You're not setting them free.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.149
You're sending them to die a slow and
painful death.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.879
Rabbits are not low maintenance pets. 
They require as much work as a dog or a cat.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.929
They need to be brought to the vet to be
sterilised. Fed daily with unlimited

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:23.629
hay, fresh green vegetables, good quality
pallets and unlimited drinking water.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.429
Their litter needs to be change once every
three days.

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.479
Their nails need to be cut once every two
months

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.699
and then there's questions like what happens
when you go on holiday? Who will take care

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.319
of the rabbit?

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.019
A rabbit is a ten year commitment.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.009
Please think twice before getting a rabbit

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.839
and definitely do not get a rabbit just
because it's Easter or any holiday for

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:43.899
that matter.

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:47.239
Or worse, as a present for your friends.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.929
From all of us at HRSS, here's
wishing you a Happy Easter and thanks

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:56.010
for making Easter an enjoyable time
for all our long-eared friends as well.
