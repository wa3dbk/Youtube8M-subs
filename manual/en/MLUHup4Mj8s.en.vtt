00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.090
hi

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.340
in my

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.659
kindle book on how to make

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.179
videos for dslr

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.159
i talk about some useful accessories..
one of them for video is the

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:20.469
the tripod which you can't really do without for
video, the next accessory  that i find

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:22.029
most useful is the loupe

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.329
and i thought as well as talking about it in the kindle guide book, I'd show people

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.609
 exactly how useful it is

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.650
now the worst thing about using the
screen

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.659
on a dslr

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.320
and this is the canon 600d
the worst thing about it is when you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.020
make video do you have to use the back
screen

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.180
uh... and you have to hold it on a tripod  and it's very very

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.390
difficult to focus clearly and i find it
very difficult to the autofocus 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.630
and using it  on manual focus is an
absolute nightmare because you can see

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.160
the picture he what he thinks shadows

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.290
but horny now i'm looking at i can see
reflection of the trees behind me you

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.300
know what kind of thing

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.750
so this liposome was uh... about twenty
pounds on allison literally he put it on

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.720
their holds on magnetically

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.560
when you go to

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.860
make a video you can actually put it on
the manual focus which is where the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.520
revelation because it means manual focus

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.310
isn't much macy put to good clip picture

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.400
and you can actually learn your focus

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.340
which is pertinent

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.810
plus you have any of the hassle of from
daylight that will the time to make it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.200
see concede screen

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.760
and the other great thing about it

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.030
really is send you've gotten the manual
focus on keeps like talc

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.300
you gonna be using it on a tripod anyway

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.259
pot the over from testifying

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.499
is if you do see something and you need
a handheld shot which occasion the you

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:42.360
do

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.620
uh... if you pretty self and hold it
against the raleigh

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.280
you've got a nice steady position this
holds an agency head and you can

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.190
actually get pretty reasonable hand-held
shots
