"Preventing Prediabetes 
By Eating More"

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:11.337
Studies like this show that 
those who eat the most legumes

00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:13.816
appear to only have a 
fraction of the risk

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:17.698
for a form of prediabetes 
known as metabolic syndrome.

00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:20.228
Those that ate three or more 
servings of beans a week

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.832
only had about a quarter of 
the odds of the disease,

00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:25.719
compared to those who had 
one serving or less.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.681
Yes, bean consumption is associated with 
lower body weight, a slimmer waist,

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:33.332
less obesity and blood pressure 
in population studies,

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:37.332
but whether the association of bean 
consumption with healthier body weight

00:00:37.332 --> 00:00:38.668
and risk factors from 
metabolic syndrome

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:41.505
is due to physiological effects 
of the beans themselves

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:45.865
or simply an indicator of a 
healthy lifestyle was uncertain.

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:50.664
Anyone smart enough to eat beans may be smart 
enough to eat all sorts of other healthy foods,

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:55.384
so maybe bean consumption is 
just a marker for a healthy diet.

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:59.131
So researchers put 
it to the test.

00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.886
Reducing belly fat may be the best
way to treat metabolic syndrome

00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:06.791
and reduce the risk of prediabetes 
turning into full-blown diabetes.

00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:12.099
Energy restriction has been the cornerstone 
of most weight-loss strategies,

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:17.465
however, evidence suggests that the 
majority of individuals who lose weight 
by calorie-cutting,

00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:22.251
regain it during the 
subsequent months or years.

00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:25.333
Starving ourselves almost 
never works long-term.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:30.066
Thus, it is important to identify foods that 
can be easily incorporated into the diet

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.182
and spontaneously lead to 
the attainment and maintenance

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:36.799
of a healthy body weight and 
improved metabolic control.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.665
So for the first time ever, 
they did a head-to-head test.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.730
Beans versus 
caloric restriction.

00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:49.710
The bean group was asked to eat five cups 
a week of lentils, split peas, 
chickpeas, or navy beans.

00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:53.270
So the bean group was 
asked to eat MORE food,

00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:57.600
and the cutting-calories group 
was asked to eat LESS food.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.000
And the MORE FOOD group won!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.070
Not only was regular bean 
consumption as effective

00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:07.130
as portion control in reducing 
prediabetes risk factors,

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:10.700
like slimming waistlines and 
better blood sugar control,

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:15.160
but the bean diet led to additional 
benefits beyond just calorie reduction,

00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:18.330
perhaps due to some functional 
properties of pulses,

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.380
which are 
beans and peas.

00:02:20.387 --> 00:02:27.010
In conclusion, five cups a week of beans, 
chickpeas, split peas, and lentils 
in an ad libitum diet,

00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:30.020
meaning they weren't told to change 
their diet in any other way,

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:32.520
reduced risk factors 
of metabolic syndrome.

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.650
And these effects were equivalent, 
and in some instances stronger,

00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:40.850
than telling people to cut 
500 calories from their daily diet.

00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:47.080
These results are encouraging news for 
individuals with or at risk for type 2 diabetes

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.220
since they indicate that simple diet 
changes, such as the inclusion of beans,

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:58.880
can have a positive impact 
on blood sugar control.
