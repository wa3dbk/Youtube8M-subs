hi friends welcome to quick and easy
cooking i'm mrs. vahchef ragini thumma I

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.169
too love cooking and at home I tried
different different varieties of dishes

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.090
we usually make chapathis every
alternate day or even in the night or

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.450
anytime so when the chapathis are
leftover what to do I have an

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.430
interesting dessert

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.030
it's called malidalu either you can
make it with fresh chapatis using little

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.350
bit ghee or you can make it with
leftover chapathis and make this

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.720
awesome dessert so today I'm going to
show you one chapathi rolled freshly

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.960
so just like how we make chapatis same
way but instead of oil

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.070
i'm going to use ghee so just apply a
little bit ghee and dust little bit

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.409
flour and now we are going to make a nice
chapathi you can make the regular know how

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.889
you make the chapati dough so here the
chapathi is all ready I rolled it

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:27.429
the pan is getting hot this is very
simple dessert see when your chapathis are

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:34.869
ready we need some ingredients like
jaggery and we need some dry fruits and

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.689
main ingredient is the fennel powder and
the cardamom powder to give nice

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.249
flavoring for this

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:49.959
so here i have the dry fruits I have
badam i have pista and I have a little

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:56.799
bit cashew nut i'm going to make this
into a coarse powder so here the pan is

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:06.490
hot now just chapathi is getting ready
just apply instead of oil ghee both the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
sides

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.870
let it get slight color this is my
favorite i love this malidalu so much

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.510
whenever I like to eat this I make the
chapathis and if you have the Jaggery

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.819
ready just mix together and your sweet 
is all ready so here the chapathi is also

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:39.230
all ready just switch off the flame see
now take a bowl

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:46.549
add the chapati when this is hot itself
you need to be careful

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.780
you need to tear it I have made some
chapathis and I have chopped it into small

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.440
pieces when it is hot itself you just
add it into four or five pieces and then

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.750
you add it in the blender this i have
chopped it but you can just directly

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.090
once you have removed a couple of
chapathis are ready you can just put it in

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:19.190
a blender by making into little bit of
pieces like this much of pieces and you

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.100
can just put it in a blender and we are
going to just make it into a coarse now

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.880
here the chapathi mixture is ready see
this is hot you need this needs to be

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.269
hot because we are going to put the
jaggery in this here is the dry fruit

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:46.040
powder or this is coarsely made dry fruit
mixture add it to this to give it a

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.459
little bit richness so that vahchef likes
if i give me a little bit of nutty

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:01.940
flavor in this and here i have chopped
little bit of dates you can feed this to

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.769
your children also instead of giving it
as a chapathi you can just give one laddu

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.700
to them and here is the fennel powder
you can just grind it

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:19.100
cardamom powder to give nice awesome
flavor and at last the jaggery

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:28.610
this jaggery i have grated it and
lastly add little bit of ghee just two

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:38.240
small teaspoons is good enough now just
mix it as how we make sweet any laddu

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.820
if you make the mixture should be
hot

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.650
the same way this mixture should be hot
it's really really hot if you want to

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:58.760
enjoy a nice dessert obviously you need
to bear the heat so this is just to

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.560
check the sweetness small piece to go in

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:15.110
yes sweetness is perfect how you make
regular laddus just make it make it

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.810

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:25.520
I wanted little bit bigger size so i
made it bigger one I love this so much you

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.310
