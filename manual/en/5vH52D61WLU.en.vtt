00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.700
I'm

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.009
here with Nigel of the Triumph Sports Six club

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.570
behind us is a Triumph Herald with too many doors

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.640
Nigel could you tell us what's going on here?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.630
Thanks you Sam

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.460
yes this car is a unique prototype 
that was built by the factory in Coventry

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.250
in the nineteen sixties

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.430
to develop the four door design for the otherwise two-door Triumph Herald

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.309
It's unique because it never went into production in this country in fact Triumph didn't need to

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.220
produce it in the UK

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.790
because they already had

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.040
small saloons on the drawing board like the thirteen hundred front-wheel drive

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.679
it did however fit the

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.470
Indian market perfectly where there was the need for a small four-door saloon

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.670
and so went into production in india in slightly modified form as the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.040
Standard Gazel

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.130
Are there any others in the country?

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.390
No, this is literally the only four-door Herald that you'd find

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.820
apart from possibly one or two people may have imported indian cars

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.470
but it's the only UK produced one you'll ever find

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.980
right, and I notice it's in a fantastic patinated state.  What are your plans for it?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.810
It is the archetypal

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.740
barn-find as it was dragged out of a barn

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.380
there's quite a debate going on within the club as to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.020
what we should do with the car

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.100
should we

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.569
restorer it and produce something that's pristine and shiny and could be displayed in a museum?

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.910
and taken around to events.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.310
or should we simply preserve it in
the as found state and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.330
the argument really is around

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.750
would it be nice to have a display car that's all bright an new

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.100
or would it be better to simply preserve the prototype?

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.229
If we were to restore it

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.990
 a lot of the original prototyping work is going to be cut up, re-done, thrown away

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.490
and the car risks becoming a replica of itself rather than a true prototype

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.220
For that reason there is a number of people who feel it would be better to preserve the car

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.380
than simply to restore it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.819
And a lot of this car would have been handmade in the prototyping department wouldn't it?

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.090
Absolutely, yes absolutely

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.580
and that's a lot of the history of the car

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.059
So it really could be a shame to undo that work

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.839
That's a point of view that quite a few people hold.

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.269
What are your thoughts?

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.129
I can see pro's and con's for both camps

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.400
at the moment the funds are simply not available to carry out a full restoration so

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.259
for the moment the car's simply going to be preserved as it stands
sad

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.919
Good stuff!  So it has a stay of restoration for the time being?

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.259
That's right yes.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.779
I think it would be nice if it stays that way

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:36.029
Thankyou
