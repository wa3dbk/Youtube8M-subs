Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to take a

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.080
few minutes and show you how to make pot roast.
Alright so, here's our garlic cloves. I'm

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.490
going to show you a really neat way to peel
these, very very quickly, and very very efficiently

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.490
than if I actually sit there and actually
peel them apart like this. We're going to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.320
take our garlic clove, we're going to put
it on our cutting board. We're going to take

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.931
the large part of our knife, right here, put
it on top of said garlic clove. Take our hand,

00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:29.390
put it on top, making sure you're aware of
the fact that there's a very very sharp blade

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.090
underneath your hand. Taking both hands, push
straight down, and you've now smashed your

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:43.829
garlic. But if you do this you'll see you've
just very easily peeled your garlic as well.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.960
Make sure we nip that little end piece off
because that piece is nasty and doesn't cook.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:58.690
And there you have it. That's our peeled garlic,
the easy way. The stuff that you can get at

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.970
the grocery store in the jar, that stuff is
terrible. Don't use that stuff. Peeling and

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.280
working with garlic is so easy and it smells
so good. And fresh garlic is so incredible

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.750
compared to that horrible horrible stuff.
Now the stuff I will be a little bit okay

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.170
with, you don't see it all the time in the
grocery store, but it's the stuff that's already

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.000
peeled. It's just like this at the grocery
store. That stuff is good. It's lost a little

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.530
bit of its bite but it's not completely terrible
like the other stuff, the stuff that's in

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.950
the little jars. Alright so we're going to
cut this end off, because that part, like

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:46.250
I said earlier is no good. Alright, and this
garlic's got a couple of bruises on it. I

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.939
don't think it's going to affect the way it
comes out though. It doesn't look, it doesn't

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.590
look that bad, it's just bruises. Now if there
were something else wrong with it I would

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.420
say definitely, you know, get rid of it. So
I'm just going to do a nice, simple, just

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.700
basically a cross cut slice. I like my garlic
chunks nice and big so you can see them, so

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.040
you see them coming. So if you're going to
bite into them you can kind of brace yourself.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.120
So, something like that is all I'm going to
do for my garlic. I don't feel the need to

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.810
mince it up until it's garlic paste because
that's pointless because that way you're hiding

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.490
it from somebody or you know, you're hiding
the ingredient which I don't agree with. So

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.210
let's go ahead and working on getting our
pot roast ready to go, steaming off all of

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.889
our vegetables.
