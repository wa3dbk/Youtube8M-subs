00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.130
Grossing half of its 13-million-dollar budget
during its first week, this Paul Weitz comedy-drama

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.420
film was released on March 22, 2013: and stars
Tina Fey and Paul Rudd in the lead roles.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.820
In a story of redemption, adoption, and second-chances
at life, SNL-alumni Fey stars as a Princeton

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.859
University admissions officer: who finds herself
bending the roles for a gifted student, Nat

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.109
Wolff, from an alternative high-school in
New Hampshire.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.679
All the while, she's forced to deal with her
ex-boyfriend Michael Sheen, a budding, but

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.280
woefully undeveloped romance with Rudd, a
ruthless competition within her workplace

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.059
rival Gloria Reuben, and her unpredictable
mother, played by Lily Tomlin.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.309
This cast of characters, which also includes
the amusingly adorable Wallace Shawn, is definitely

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.190
the 117-minute picture's strong suit: the
delivery of the well-written dialogue will

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.650
keep you interested and invested.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.160
The situations, and plot twists however seem
contrived, unbelievable, and built on coincidence

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.160
more than necessity.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.140
A number of extraneous character, threads,
and red-herrings make this film far more bloated

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.739
and complicated than it needed to be, with
a number of setups resulting in empty, or

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.250
non-existent payoffs.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.210
When Fey, and her cold-hard bitch exterior
begins to venture outside her comfort zone,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.970
we see some truly natural, slice of life moments
that work extremely well.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.690
Like when she unexpectedly begins to fall
for Rudd, remarking on her previous hesitation:

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:25.440
"let's just not think for 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:50.360
a while".

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.720
A lengthy scene where the Princeton team ruthlessly
accepts and rejects hopeful applicants serves

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.400
as pointed criticism towards the harsh realities
of the college admissions process, but curiously,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.140
picture still maintains Wolff's acceptance
into Princeton as a major plot goal.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.560
The PG-13 dramedy focuses more heavily on
child prodigies and needlessly involved adoption

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.920
problems then it ever does on romance or comedy:
only occasionally fleeting with either.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.250
Sprinkled with some indie-rock background
music, the score from Stephen Trask keeps

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.970
the mood from getting too serious, whether
Rudd is helping to birth a cow, or Fey is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.130
having a long-overdue mother-daughter talk.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.780
With so many different characters and developments,
it's hard to get bored in this picture, but

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.380
doesn't necessarily mean it was well-paced
or directed: a great deal of this film could

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.630
have been slimmed down.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.980
Not romantic enough for a good date night,
or really funny enough to be called a true

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.810
comedy; it's unlikely I'll be watching this
again soon.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.950
"Admission", "Unfocused stories, but charming
characters."

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.440
Now, straight to the rate-o-matic, as apparently
none of you saw this one!

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.760
A SEVEN for "Admission".

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.069
Some poignant, emotional and touching moments
scattered throughout a haphazard and messily

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.079
directed film, I thought it was COOL.
