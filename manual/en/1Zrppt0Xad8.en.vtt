Here's another nice little clip that'll   
really help you connect your your upper

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.700
body, your arms, to the rest of your body
and help you really

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.160
stay compact and balance when you run.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.669
Even on a day like today where it's
starting to snow it's late

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.099
March in a, in a Boulder.

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.589
It's normally a beautiful sunny time. Now
it's is starting to snow a little bit

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.430
but we'll get this drill in the can for you guys.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.420
Alright. So what happens with the Velcro Drill is  you

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.639
stick your arms to your sides, alright?

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:39.970
As if you have a strip of Velcro

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.870
on your forearm and a strip of Velcro in the middle of your chest , you

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.860
stick them there. Notice my elbows are sticking out a little bit at the back, my hands are

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.910
sticking out a little bit at the front.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.280
and we do the Velcro Drill to attach
the arms to the body

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.700
so that we can isolate the torso.
So that the torso can move in unison

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.869
with what the pelvis tells it to do.

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.100
Because the pelvis is reacting to what it feels to do. So let me give you an

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.150
idea of what this looks like.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.650
Alright. So I'm sticking my arms to my side, 
my shoulders are down and nice relaxed. I got

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.450
that, that nice little forward lean

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.220
Alright, the chest is down hold them there and I'm just moving forward nice and easily.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.670
And so what you'll notice will happen is
is that my shoulders turn naturally with

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.030
my hip motion, creating this talk that I
need.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.050
And so once I've got that feeling

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.970
with my arms nice and compact, with those arms above my waistline keeping them

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.680
bent around about ninety degrees

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.600
at the back

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.340
and a little closer in the front.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.320
Then I can let those arms go, I can  
loosen the Velcro and in that way

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.130
have that compact loop at that smooth fluid run.
so let me show you how that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.330
looks.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.220
Alright. So I attach those arms to my side

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.600
get them stuck.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.790
Alright., as soon as i feel that movement I
loosen them, and then they come nicely

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.170
loose from the side and that's what I
got

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.950
Alright.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.240
So once again

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.159
shoulders stay down

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.380
arms stuck to the sides.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.580
Alright, keep them stuck until you feel that  natural connection between

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.930
shoulders and hips.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.450
And then loosen them up, so...

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.329
This is where we're going stuck, stuck, stuck
Loosen them and it just moves nicely up to

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:16.620
that position.
