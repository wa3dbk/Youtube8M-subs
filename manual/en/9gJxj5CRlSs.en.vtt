How to keep cats in cages

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:16.078
I have always wanted a cat. But they 
 are loud, dirty and damage your furniture.

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:21.540
A few years ago a friend showed me how 
 they kept their cat in a cage.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.931
I found that weird at first, but slightly got used to the idea.

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:34.284
I got him 3 years ago from a breeder and 
 put him as a baby into the cage.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:39.514
He doesn't know life any other way.

00:00:39.514 --> 00:00:44.831
This way he is happy and I am happy.

00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:50.086
I take him out, whenever I want to cuddle him.

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:54.434
Sometimes I even let him run for an hour or so.

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:59.506
But last time he went a scratched my 
 couch. I locked him up right away.

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:05.416
Let me show you his room :)

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:10.607
I bought the big cage, there are smaller 
 ones but that would be really cruel.

00:01:10.607 --> 00:01:15.452
Anyways, this is the litter box, really easy to clean.

00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:24.444
He has a blanket to cuddle with, enough room to stretch

00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:32.898
and here's food and water of course.

00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:38.465
Sometimes I find it very annoying when he cries and chews on the bars.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.860
I then put him in another room and it doesn't bother me anymore.

00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:45.780
Eventually he stops.

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:53.800
Shocked?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.520
What about now?

00:02:00.517 --> 00:02:05.730
Rabbits don't belong in cages.

00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:10.760
Give your pets a life.
