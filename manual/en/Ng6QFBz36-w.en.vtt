of pirates toward

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.619
anybody that wants with having

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.519
was on the radio host but i think it's
amazing that they have used little

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.269
pirates took over the of world they

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.500
largest super tanker in the world as big
as you get

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.140
for more on just a bit over services
eyes now you know hispanic couple

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.550
questions about that you tell me the
you've read up on it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.330
one will use someone else's

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.649
a guesstimate identifying the
back-channel weight is obligated you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.630
know parker tanker somewhere

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.200
and the like

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.510
okay i would write about it so there are
lots of clothes why it's i guess this is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.210
going to siphon in albany but that would
go through the back today to offer the

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.180
ransom

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.459
but only recently they survive ended

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:53.449
the i didn't understand from my reading
a story maybe you did because you're

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.540
right this is a fascinating story

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.490
why don't we don't take it back and we
came back early

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.650
and i don't know first off how

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.600
gender that difficult to prevent that
from happening in the first place yes i

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.530
still can't take it back to have it ll

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.689
what why they hire liberating

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.509
tanker tuchman i did they go on this
somehow board the ship and they got more

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.530
guts it's possible esto impossible

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.930
but understand is how we can find a
tanker dated back

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.300
so on the way i have to do some we have
to do some research maybe uh... atticus

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.590
penalty as opposed to some video

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.750
and will work on this but i'll let my
parents are back

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.240

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.160
