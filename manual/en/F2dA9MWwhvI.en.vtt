00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.660
The night before last

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.160
my sleep is broken when I find that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.000
my Fluffy has eloped out the door.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.089
Trodden, downcast,

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.960
I turn my gaze to the window

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.240
and the sight makes me fall to the floor!

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.850
2, 4, 6, 8, 10 in a line

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.750
Hard to tell which feline is mine

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.199
Into pairs the cats divide

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.340
I can't believe my eyes!

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.880
It has to be said, 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.100
the cat I know is so lazy

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.800
I can't ever convince her to move

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.890
Now, like Ginger and Fred,

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.150
my Fluffy's paws graze the pavement

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
dancing steps oh so graceful 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.230
and smooth

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.400
3, 6, 9, 12 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.140
they spin 'round and 'round

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.060
The Tango del Gato spreads all over town

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.580
How can all the neighbors just sleep through the sound?

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.960
I'll be up all night!

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.080
A few years have passed

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.220
I've gotten older and wiser 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.040
and my Fluffy still just lays there and stares.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.960
My family just laughs,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.160
They think I'm telling a story

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.080
But it happened even though no one cares!

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.320
9, 10, 11, 12 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.060
the hours roll on

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.540
I pretend that I'm sleeping 'till Fluffy is gone

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.720
I sneak to the window when I hear the song

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.530
and I dance along!
