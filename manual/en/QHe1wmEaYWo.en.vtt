00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.930
it's true that there are animals today
notably the blue whale is the largest

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.549
creature ever to inhabit the earth that
are bigger

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.141
then dinosaurs but, no creature that
currently walks

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.830
on land gets anywhere close to the size
the Super Dino's.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.540
The largest recorded species of dinosaur
probably is Amphicoelias Fragillimus,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.500
which measured up to 60 meters and weighed 122 metric tons!

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.399
By comparison, the African savanna
elephant, the largest modern land animal

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.180
clocks in at just three to four meters
tall and five and a half tonnes - both herbivores!

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.239
So why aren't there land mammals today that are as big as the dinosaurs?

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.280
Well, the fossil record gives us some clues as
to when and how if not exactly why

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.649
mammals hit their limit. After the last
of the dinos disappeared around 65 million

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.489
years ago the size and diversity of
mammals went

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.539
totally nuts... Until it didn't.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.760
Around 30 million years ago, a kind of giant
Rhino-Giraffe beast

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.999
topped out at five meters tall and seven
and a half meters long

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.839
grabbing the record for the biggest
mammal to ever walk the earth.

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.460
Scientists think that there are several
limiting factors that have kept modern

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.159
land animals from approaching super-saurus
sizes.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.229
First mammals give birth to live young, a
mama dinosaur could just lay a bunch of eggs and walk

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.560
away but a mammal has to gestate and nurse and rear babies at a great

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.409
energetic cost. Large mammals also have
long periods of gestation. Giraffes and

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.159
rhinos gestate for about fifteen
months

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.630
and elephants are pregnant for nearly
two years!

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.340
And the longer a pregnancy is, the more
dangerous they are for both the mother

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.759
and the young so on mega-herbivore would
probably experience and unfeasibly long

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.100
and dangerous pregnancy.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.659
Another theory suggests the dinosaurs grew
so large because of Earth's climate

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.130
and ecology at the time.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.320
A warmer, muggy climate with a higher
carbon content in the air made the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.740
vegetation grow off the hook. Sauropods

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.750
basically lived in a massive smorgasbord, and they 
may may have gotten so Titanic simply

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.210
because they could. But the environment
changed over time

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.380
and herbivores worse today don't live in such
prime conditions. Reason number three today's

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.539
land mammals are further limited by
their skeletal systems. Sauropod fossils

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:05.399
show evidence of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.580
avian in like air sacs that made for a much
lighter skeletons than you'd expect in

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.720
animals so large.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.040
Some of  these dudes were 30 meters long but
only weighed an estimated forty tonnes.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.230
A modern land mammal that size would likely
weigh nearly twice that and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.230
basically it be too heavy to get around.
Finally the fourth

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.230
and maybe coolest reason a mega-mammal

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.570
would probably cook its own tissues.
Mammals as you probably know are

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.420
endothermic or warm-blooded. Our bodies
generate and maintain their own

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.090
temperature internally.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.140
Reptiles meanwhile are ectothermic
or cold-blooded

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.550
absorbing heat from their environment - 
like a snake sunning on a rock. There is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.240
actually debate as to whether some dinosaurs were
warm-blooded like birds or if they had

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.350
some sort of an immediate system that
was neither all cold-blooded nor all

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.740
warm, but regardless we know a mammal
uses way more energy than a

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.170
similar-sized reptile.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.790
So it's probable that modern land
mammals couldn't get much bigger than

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.510
elephants without actually cooking
themselves from within.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.980
That's enough to make me perfectly happy
being this size.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.570
