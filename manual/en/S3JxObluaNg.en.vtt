00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.250
He's been in there for 20 years

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.589
We all knew this day was coming

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:16.410
Sending him to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.510
jail was a mistake. We should have killed him.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.760
Do you think he knows?

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.380
Does he know it was us?

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.380
Of course he knows! He knows everything!

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.280
We're outside Los Santos Penitentiary on the release date

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.530
of the city's most notorious and violent criminal, El Bastardo

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.009
It was 20 years ago this week that El Bastardo was jailed

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.600
after a string of anonymous testimonies

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.280
Two decades

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.660
of plotting, scheming...

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.250
...you better believe someone's gonna pay

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.890
He's coming!

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.390
He's coming for us!

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.080
GET ON THE GROUND!

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.890
Is he here?

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.820
What do we do?

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.220
(Maniacal laughter)

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.880
EL BASTARDO
