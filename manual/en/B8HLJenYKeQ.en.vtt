00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:19.019
Side Kick, Today I am going to talk about the side kick 
And the basics behind the side kick. 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.119
Very Often

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.039
People show up to the kicking seminars

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.199
They want to increase speed, power

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.349
Side Kick Flexibility, Height

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.650
Side kick, endurance and focus

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.480
And they do not have the correct side kick kicking technique

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.010
I would like to go over the side kick technique
And the misconceptions about the side kick

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.410
And stuff like that

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.090
so that people who

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.830
So that people who have been throwing incorrect SIDE KICK
For years, can adjust their side kick a little bit. 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.580
First of all there are two common ways to throw a side kick. 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.030
I am talking about

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.520
A front leg side kick

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.060
First way to throw a side kick

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.550
Is to raise

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.190
The side kick chamber forward

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.440
Having the non kicking leg

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.249
Or the supporting foot

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.410
in the same direction

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.500
And twist or turn as you throw the side kick

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.140
As you bring the kicking leg back

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.730
Switch the kicking leg back 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.650
That the first option

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.170
Some martial arts styles employ that kicking option

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.979
The way I throw the side kick, the way ElasticSteel
Practitioners throw the SIDE KICK

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.860
We do not

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.440
Bring the kicking leg up here

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.330
As if we are about to do a front kick

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.080
Once the chamber comes up, the supporting leg
Already turns in preparation for the kick

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.920
The chamber of the kick is 45 degrees to the floor

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.880
It’s not parallel to the floor

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.960
It’s not perpendicular to the floor

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.970
The side kick chamber is 45 degrees

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.880
and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.299
Than a side kick comes out

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.010
One more time, I will demonstrate the side kick 
The other way or with the other leg

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.030
first option

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.620
Bring the kicking leg up here

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.100
Kick and pivot

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.810
Bring the side kick back

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.230
And Pivot the non kicking leg

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.749
And of course the other side kick option

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.269
Kicking leg comes up

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.019
Once the chamber comes up

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.510
“SIDE KICK” The supporting leg toes are already facing away
From the kicking target and the heel is facing
The target

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.379
And the side kick comes out

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.949
Those are the two side kick options

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.469
Two basic problems

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.019
first problem

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.790
{Side Kick} Is that the heel of the kicking leg is too
Far forward

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.329
if this is the case

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.789
The line of the kick will not travel

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.699
This way 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:45.879
It will travel this way

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.659
The target is here

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.059
Not utilizing enough quadriceps muscles in the side kick

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.919
Mainly extensors of the hip

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.379
What other people do is

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.540
The bring the kick leg, like so

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.489
And deliver their side kick as if it was a funny round house kick

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.549
Still Trying kick with the heel

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.389
the goal here is

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:14.379
To pull the heel back enough that it would
Come out in the straight line

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.839
The way to do this is not to start with a chamber 
Of a side kick

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:21.509
I have never seen anyone practice the SIDE KICK,
They way I am going to show it to you

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:26.519
But in my opinion it’s a correct way to learn a side kick

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.019
What most people would do is bring up side kick chamber

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.309
And they would hope, I am talking about
Most martial arts instructors

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.839
And they would hope that the Side Kick
Would come out

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:41.409
In a straight line

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.449
The other way to do it, is to use a little
Device I have here. 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.799
Start with a straight leg, with extended side kick

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.069
And than pull the side kick in

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.709
What I have here 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.969
Is a vertical line

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.299
That can be drawn on the wall

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.459
It’s 90 degrees, it’s perfectly vertical

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.689
It can be a strap

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:03.600
It can be rope

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.629
It can be anything to help with the side kick

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.309
Another line on the floor

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:10.029
What you would do

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:12.789
Is put a non side kicking leg

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:17.339
My left leg right now is my non-kicking leg

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.389
On this line it’s facing away

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.550
With my other leg

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.699
Side kick heel in line with the heel

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.099
I would bring it up

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.660
and from here

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.069
Pull the side kick straight back

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.839
And extend it

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:41.050
Than bring it back

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.150
And extend the side kick straight out

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.060
A lot of people who are not used to practicing the side
Kick this way

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.419
Are probably going to get pain

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.060
In the abductors

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.319
In hip flexors

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.509
Side Kick Supporting Leg

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:54.770
Midsection

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.039
These are the things, because the
Body is not used to doing the [SIDE KICK] this way

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.970
You may have to hold on the chair or partner

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.909
To perform the kicks this way

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.409
In my opinion “side Kick” is best to start with
A straight leg,

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.930
Pull it straight back

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.889
Let the Side Kick come out straight forward

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.139
Starting slowly

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.319
And picking up the speed

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.219
What a lot of people do

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.319
Knowing that the side kick needs to come out straight

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:33.219
Talking about the heel now, the heel of the side kick
Needs to come out straight, not the edge of the foot

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.539
not the knife foot

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.770
But the heel of the kicking leg

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.779
What some people do is bring up the side kick chamber

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.949
And they believe that

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.270
To make a straight line with a SIDE KICK

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.340
The heel

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.300
Must be back here

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.729
By the glutes

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.279
because in their mind

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.409
The kicking heel is right over the supporting leg

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.599
And they would throw the side kick like that

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.099
That not it. 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.449
That’s not the case. 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.289
Once the kicking heel comes up

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.819
The center of gravity

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.719
Moves back

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.259
So the supporting foot of the side kick

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.519
Is not directly

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:17.229
Under the hip

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.569
The supporting leg is a little forward of the hip

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.300
Because the weight shifts back

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.159
The kicking heal is not here

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.839
It here

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.039
It’s not

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.449
directly

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.180
Behind the hip 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.099
It’s forward for the side kick

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:35.960
That’s where the heel for the side kick is

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.669
And than comes straight out

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.610
There is nothing wrong with doing side kick chamber stretches

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.710
For a lot of people who can’t hold a prper chamber before the kick

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.789
properly

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:51.659
There is

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:53.529
there's nothing wrong with 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:56.020
Doing side kick chamber stretches

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.939
some people

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:00.529
This is a far as they can go with their side kick

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:02.590
Some times, it’s the strength

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.549
Sometimes it’s the flexibility

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:07.159
there's nothing wrong

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.499
with

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:13.039
Doing this stretch

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.610
In ElasticSTeel, it’s 45 degrees. 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.419
Supporting leg is facing away from the target

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.709
and after a while

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:25.829
Bring the kick out

00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:26.940
and stretch

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.550
This is not the actual kick, but you can use it
As the warm up

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.009
Second device I have here 
(Watch Part Two)
