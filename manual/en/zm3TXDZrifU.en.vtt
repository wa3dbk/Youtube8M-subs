00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
- [Voiceover] Let's get some practice

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.775
subtracting mixed numbers.

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:06.791
So let's say that I had 2 5/8

00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:11.791
minus 1 2/8.

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:15.788
What is this going to be?

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:16.984
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.167
and try to work it out.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.502
Well, we can rewrite this, we could write

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:21.663
the numbers on top of each other,

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:24.797
we could say this is two,
in that magenta color,

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:27.955
say this is 2 5/8,

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:30.612
actually let me write it a
little bit further spaced apart,

00:00:30.612 --> 00:00:33.976
2 5/8,

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:38.492
minus 1 2/8.

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:41.816
And then, we can subtract.

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:43.531
We could say, okay look, in this column

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:45.704
right over here, we are
subtracting eighths.

00:00:45.704 --> 00:00:47.887
We have five eighths, and we're gonna

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:49.047
subtract two eighths.

00:00:49.047 --> 00:00:50.208
If I have five of something
and I'm gonna subtract

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.943
two of them, I'm gonna have
three of that something,

00:00:52.943 --> 00:00:54.144
and in this case we're
talking about eighths.

00:00:54.144 --> 00:00:55.583
So five eighths minus two eighths

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:57.500
is going to be three eighths,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.137
and then you have two ones minus one one,

00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:02.875
or two minus one, is going to be one.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:07.875
So this is going to be equal
to one and three eighths.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.216
Now let's do something more interesting.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.933
Let's say that we had 3, I'm just going

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:17.933
to make up a number here, 3 2/5

00:01:18.993 --> 00:01:23.993
minus 2 3/5,

00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:28.202
and like always, pause the
video and try to work it out.

00:01:28.202 --> 00:01:31.186
Let's try to work it
out this exact same way.

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:33.657
So I'm going to rewrite it as 3,

00:01:33.657 --> 00:01:37.341
let me do that same magenta
color, changing colors,

00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:41.879
we have three and two over five

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:46.879
minus two and three over five.

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:50.262
Two and three over five.

00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:51.979
And when you first try to do it,

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.734
over here you had 5/8 minus 2/8,

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.384
that was easy to figure out, that's 3/8.

00:01:56.384 --> 00:02:00.209
But then over here,
you have 2/5 minus 3/5.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.346
Well, that's hard!

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:03.413
3/5 is larger than 2/5.

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:05.410
So what can you do here?

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.964
Well one option is to regroup.

00:02:07.964 --> 00:02:10.343
Let's take one, from I guess you could say

00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:13.651
the ones place, here, so
let's take one from this,

00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:15.811
and then that's going to turn into two.

00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:18.795
And then one is the same thing as 5/5.

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:23.694
So two plus 5/5 is equal to 7/5.

00:02:23.694 --> 00:02:25.436
So another way of thinking about it,

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:28.861
I'll do it over here, we could write,

00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:32.932
3 2/5 is the same thing as 2 7/5.

00:02:32.932 --> 00:02:37.932
2 7/5. These two things are equivalent.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.753
Why? Well I took one away
from here to get to two,

00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:43.913
and then I added that one over here.

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.236
One is same thing as 5/5.

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:48.337
2/5 plus 5/5 is 7/5.

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:53.050
So now if we consider
this thing to be 2 7/5,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.035
we're ready to subtract.

00:02:55.035 --> 00:03:00.035
If you say 7/5 minus 3/5,

00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:04.033
that's going to be 4/5.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.120
And then you have two
minus two is zero ones,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.581
so you're just going to be left with 4/5.

00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:11.321
So this is just going to be 4/5.

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.923
Let's do that again.

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:14.816
Let's do one where we
have to regroup again.

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:16.742
And I'll just write it out in a column,

00:03:16.742 --> 00:03:18.472
up down, to begin with.

00:03:18.472 --> 00:03:21.049
Let's say that we have

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.049
7 1/6, minus

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:32.117
4 5/6.

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:37.714
What is this going to be equal to?

00:03:37.714 --> 00:03:40.616
Well, when we try to
subtract 5/6 from 1/6,

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:43.158
well that's hard, 5/6 is larger than 1/6.

00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:44.656
But we can regroup.

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:46.455
We could take one from here, so the seven

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:48.974
becomes a six.

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:51.238
And then we take that one, which is

00:03:51.238 --> 00:03:54.292
the same thing as 6/6, and add it to 1/6.

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:59.292
So 1/6 plus 6/6, is going to be 7/6.

00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:03.793
Let me be clear what I did.

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:06.370
I took one from the
seven, and it became six,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.025
and one is equal to 6/6, and so I added

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:13.963
6/6 to that 1/6, and I got 7/6.

00:04:13.963 --> 00:04:16.586
So I took the one from here,
and I added it over here,

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:21.113
and the whole purpose is,
now 7/6 is greater than 5/6.

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:26.733
So 7/6 minus 5/6 is, I'll
do that orange color,

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.956
is 2/6,

00:04:29.956 --> 00:04:34.246
and six minus four is two.

00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:36.342
So it's gonna be 2 2/6, or, if we wanted

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:39.988
to rewrite 2/6, you see
they're both divisible by two,

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:44.545
this is the same thing as 2
and 1/3 is equivalent to 2/6.

00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:47.743
So you could also write it like that.
