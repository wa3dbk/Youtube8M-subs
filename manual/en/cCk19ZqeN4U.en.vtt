00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.700
Have you ever wanted to know how to make Olive
Garden salad dressing? I can

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.900
show you how to make Olive Garden salad dressing
at home and in your own

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.380
kitchen. My name is Stephanie Manley and I've
been making copycat recipes

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.000
on the internet for over 15 years.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.210
I'm going to show you how to make a copycat
recipe for the Olive Garden

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.509
salad dressing and when you're done with this
recipe, it's going to taste

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.930
just like it does at the Olive Garden. You
can purchase the Olive Garden

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.739
salad dressing at the restaurant. It's about
$7.00 to $8.00 a bottle. But

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.249
you know what? You can make it at home for
a whole lot less, so let me show

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:44.440
you how.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.129
One-third cup of vinegar, this is ½ cup of
mayonnaise. Use one teaspoon of

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.570
vegetable oil, two tablespoons of corn syrup;
two teaspoons of Romano

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.530
cheese, along with two teaspoons of Parmesan
cheese. Here's a ¼ teaspoon of

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.979
garlic salt. Here's a ½ teaspoon of Italian
seasoning. This is a spiced

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.130
blend you buy in your grocery store. A ½
teaspoon of parsley flakes. You

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.980
could use fresh if you like. One-tablespoon
of lemon juice and you can also

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.409
use fresh-squeezed.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.500
We're going to start with a ½ of mayonnaise,
added to the one-third cup of

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.790
vinegar that's in my bowl. You can do this
all in your blender, as well.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.540
And now we're going to add two tablespoons
of corn syrup, just blending in

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.700
our corn syrup. Now we're going to add in
our one tablespoon of lemon

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.650
juice. Again, if you have fresh-squeezed,
that would be great.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.420
That would be the juice of about one lemon.
Next we're going to add our

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.650
vegetable oil. You can use just regular vegetable
oil, canola oil. We're

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.840
going to pour that right in and whisk it in.
Next we're going to add our

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.490
cheeses. We're going to add in our garlic
salt. We're going to add in our

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:16.320
Italian seasonings, and we're going to add
in our parsley, and now let's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.060
taste that Olive Garden salad dressing.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.590
