Hi, I'm Brigitte

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.120
This is Slope Style. I'm where with Jill from Burton. We're going to talk

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.130
about the Cargo Pant. We sell a lot of this Cargo Pant

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.150
online, Jill, it's been in the line for a while and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.250
just tell me about this pant. Why is it such a great pant?

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.290
Well this pant is one of our, I guess you could call it, classic

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.320
pants. It's our tried-and-true, do everything pant.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.420
Good for all types of riders in all types of conditions.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.440
This pant features...it's a signature fit we call Sig Fit

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.470
which is a classic fit still allows room for some

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.480
layering, a little bit of sag but not overly baggy.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.510
Okay. I noticed that this pant comes

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.560
in lengths.
It does. It comes in just a regular length. It also comes in

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.620
short and tall.
Does it comes in lengths in all colors?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.640
It does not. It only comes in, short and tall lengths

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.650
in the true black color way, the burlap as well as stout white are the three options.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.670
And what about the fabric? It's hard to see the fabric

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.690
online. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
Yeah, the fabric is a two-layer

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.710
we call DryRide fabrication. Actually on this pant

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.730
it has a really soft hand yet the fabric is still really

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.750
burly, really durable. This pant also comes in quite a few

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.790
colors and quite a few prints as well. The prints are going to have

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.860
a little bit different fabrication compared to these solid pants but are still going to have

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.870
a really burly feel to them.
It does have a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.890
pretty soft hand-feel to it.
Yep, absolutely.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.930
And what's the waterproof rating on these?
These have a 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.010
10,000mm waterproofing so they're going to be really good in all

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.030
types of conditions.
That's good. And is there any more features

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.070
that we can't really see that you can point out?
Yeah, on the inner waist of these

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.120
you'll see it's lined with microfleece which is nice. A little bit more cushion

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.160
or comfort. Also has an internal waist adjustment

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.240
with Velcro closure here. Inner thigh vents

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.260
down, mesh-lined on the bottom. So a little bit of extra

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.280
venting there. And then when you turn the pant over you'll find this on quite a few of our

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.300
pants. You see this little tab here with a button and if you reach 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.330
underneath you'll find a little snap. And if you snap this

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.340
under here, we use this for what we call our parking lot sludge so it

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.390
prevents the bottom of your pants from getting trashed in the parking lot after a long day of riding.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.420
Okay. And did you say that these were fully taped or not?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.460
Yes. These are fully taped pant actually. Every pant in the Burton line is

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.470
fully taped.
Great. All right, well thanks for coming,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.490
Jill. That's the Cargo Pant from Burton and this was Slope Style.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.500
Thanks for watching.
