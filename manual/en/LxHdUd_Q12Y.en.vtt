00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.440
Hi. It's Paul Andersen and this
is disciplinary core idea ESS3A. It's on natural

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.289
resources. Resources are what we require to
live. And since we live on the earth we get

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.839
our resources from the earth. We call those
natural resources. And there's a lot of different

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.210
types of natural resources. It could be the
air you breathe. The water you drink. The

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.210
soil you grow your crops in. Minerals. Metals.
Energy. Plants. Animals. And all of this we're

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.830
getting from our environment. And we could
break all of those natural resources into

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.920
two types. We have what are called renewable
resources. Wind is an example of energy that's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.710
renewable. As the sun shines on the earth
the air starts to move around and we're going

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.460
to be able to generate energy from that. Nonrenewable
resources are resources that don't come back

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.220
within our life time. And so oil is an example
of that. Oil contains energy that was stored

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.300
millions of years ago from ancient rain forests.
And if we use that up, it's gone. It's not

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.210
going to come back at least within our life
time. Another thing you should understand

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.640
about natural resources is that they're not
uniformly distributed on our planet. They're

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.090
going to be mixed up. And so where do humans
live? We're living where we can get as many

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.700
of the resources as we can possibly find.
But we're not going to have all of the resources

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.690
there. And so if you look at the distribution
of humans on our planet we're going to find

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.330
that we're finding that we're living in areas
where you can get enough food. Enough water.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.900
But we don't get all of our resources. So
we have to kind of trade and ship those around

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.450
on our planet. This map right here shows the
population. In other words the cities that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.000
have high population. Each of the red dots
on this map represents a city with at least

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.920
a million people. We call those mega cities.
And what we're finding is that as you get

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.369
more and more people on our planet they're
requiring more and more resources. And so

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.950
we have to really balance our use of nonrenewable
resources. Especially if they have some detrimental

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.399
cause. And thinking of that fossil fuels are
really driving the economies right now. Coal

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.799
and oil. And what's the benefit of coal and
oil? They're relatively cheap. We stored energy

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.739
along time ago. And now we can kind of cash
in on that. The problem is that we have costs

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.450
associated with nonrenewable resources. Number
one, they're not going to last forever. And

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.489
number two, a lot of them have unintended
consequences. As we burn fossil fuels we're

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.099
putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
And that over time is going to increase the

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.709
temperature. And then we're going to have
costs associated with that. And so what we're

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.639
seeing is a switch from nonrenewable to renewable
resources. And that being driven by two things.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:53.790
Number one is technology. Solar energy wasn't
very effective. And it was really expensive

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.790
you know decades ago. But that's changing
really really quickly. And things like geothermal,

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:07.819
hydroelectric, wind generation is generating
more energy. And it's a more valuable resource.

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.609
And it will be over time. We'll also have
to use regulations. In other words when you

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.090
put things into the atmosphere you're not
really being penalized for that. You're putting

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.219
carbon into the atmosphere, it's going to
have some unintended consequences in the future.

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:27.019
And so we'll have to use wise regulations
and increasing technology to shift from nonrenewable

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.889
to renewable resources. And so how do you
teach this? What's the teaching progression?

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.829
Well in the lower elementary grades you want
students to understand that humans require

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.590
resources. And they require it from the land,
the air and the water. And so let's use a

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.379
real simple example of that. What do we need
from the land? Well we need food. And so when

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:52.049
we grow corn, for example, we need nutrients
from the land or the soil. We nutrients from

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.230
the air. And we also need water for that.
If we get energy from our environment, burning

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.269
wood is going to require energy and that's
coming from the land as well. And if we want

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.849
to fry up some eggs we're going to require
minerals and we're going to have to get that

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.339
from the land as well. And so everything we
require for resources we're getting from the

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:16.400
land itself. As we move into the upper elementary
grades you want to start talking about this

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.650
idea of natural resources. And that all of
the resources we require to live have to come

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.220
from our planet. Another thing you should
talk about at this point is make sure you're

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.069
delineating the difference between a renewable
resource, one that we can just, it comes back

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:36.729
over our lifetime. And nonrenewable resources.
So as we dig up metal, if we aren't recycling

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.900
those, if we're just disposing of it, it's
going to be a nonrenewable resource. As you

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.150
move into middle school we want to talk about
resources and where they're found. And that

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.400
they're limited. And that they're not evenly
distributed on our planet. And so we have

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.810
to be wise in the way that we're using those
resources. And then we want to talk about

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.030
how there's going to be increases in technology
which are going to allow us to shift from

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.150
nonrenewable to renewable resources. But we're
going to have to use regulations to make sure

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.539
that we're doing this fairly and effectively
across the globe. As you move into high school

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:15.150
you want to address this idea that our population
is increasing. And as we get more and more

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.460
people, they're going to require more and
more resources. And so we have to look at

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.400
all of the resources on our planet. Where
are they found? How can we share them equally?

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.849
And how can we make sure that as people in
developing countries start to get what people

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.009
in developed countries have had for a long
time, how do we do that effectively without

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.759
damaging the planet? So those are natural
resources. They're incredibly important. And

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:37.119
I hope that was helpful.
