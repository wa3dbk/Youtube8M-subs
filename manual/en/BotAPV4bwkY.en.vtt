00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.300
In this episode of the Big Vision Show,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm taking you inside my home.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.490
Hey there, I'm Max Simon

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.510
and welcome to the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.910
Big Vision Show.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.429
This is all about how you can reach

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.009
more people and thrive financially.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.370
Now, in today's episode we're going

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.550
to do something a little different.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.719
You see, people always ask me

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.260
what are my personal routines.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.559
What are the extra unique things

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.910
that I do in order to keep myself

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.570
really healthy and vibrant

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.699
and alive so that I can show up

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.129
fully in my business?

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.930
You see so many people don't realize

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.809
that one of the greatest strengths

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.430
that they have in their business is them

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.190
and so if you don't have the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.440
necessary levels of vibrancy of energy

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.660
of clarity of ability to really

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.000
show up powerfully,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.580
doesn't really matter how smart

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.820
or strategic you are,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.470
none of it is really going to land

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.880
impactfully in the people

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.610
you are trying to serve.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.050
Now, if you're new to my world,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.410
you'll know that one of my most

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.960
famous secrets is my morning green drink,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.580
my morning smoothie.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.530
And today, I figured I would actually

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.710
take you in my kitchen

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.640
and we would make one together.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.040
You ready?

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.200
They're quite delicious and interesting.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.900
So here we go.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.740
First thing that you need is,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.220
you know I like to use nut milks

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.720
which are non-dairy forms of milks.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.130
This is an organic almond milk.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.560
You can use a rice milk,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.900
you can use a, it's called hemp milk,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.250
even a soy milk can work for you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.440
so add about half of your cup

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.830
of almond milk and I like to use the vanilla

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.890
one just because it gives it nice little flavour

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.960
and by the way this little

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.110
contraption is called a NutriBullet

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.740
so it's like a blender but a little bit smaller

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.810
and it gives you individual cup sizes

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.340
and this little thing just kind of pops off

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.200
and screws on here, right?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.140
So fill it half with almond milk

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.030
then I put in a half of frozen bananas.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.810
These are fresh bananas that I just froze

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.520
in the freezer so that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.030
you don't have to use ice cubes.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.750
So they're still kind of pretty much

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.960
fresh because they're really just

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.000
from this week but they're frozen

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.690
so that we don't have to use any ice cubes

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.720
in that way you can just

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.390
use this frozen banana.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.730
It gives a little bit of a sweeter texture.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.350
It has a little bit of sugar

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.290
but you know, natural sugar.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.140
Then we use hemp seeds

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.760
which are from Nutiva,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.240
we like that brand the most.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.380
They're organic and it's a good company.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.880
We do about a maybe

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.500
a half a tablespoon of hemp seeds,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.170
these are great source of protein

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.440
and also good flavour.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.910
It gives kind of a nutty,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.190
rich flavour to it.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.990
The protein that I use and I've tested

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.620
a lot of different proteins is this

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.980
Lifetime Life's Basic Plant Protein

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.450
and the reason I use the plant protein

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.610
is because I know it's easy to digest

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.640
and it also doesn't have a really weird

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.200
grainy flavour like a lot of the rice protein

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.050
but also it's very easy for your body

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.030
to absorb so do a good full scoop

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.170
of this plant protein and of course

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.410
since it's a green drink,

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.600
it helps that it actually is green.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.459
And then we move into some

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.069
of the more specialty ingredients.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.650
So this is a Vitamin-mineral Green

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.600
by Healthforce Superfoods

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.040
and this is just all sorts of different

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.770
green supplements and powders

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.819
and live foods blended together

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.350
so I think there's Sperilina and Kelp

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.540
and Chlorella and gosh there's so much

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.340
stuff in this and this is probably

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.180
the greatest source of energy.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.560
Meaning, this will help you feel just

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.849
more clear-minded, more focused,

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.260
more alive and it really does feel like

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.440
you just have like a shot of an energy drink.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.620
And then my favourite parts

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.860
which is some cacao nibs,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.290
these are raw cacao nibs

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.880
so you know what they

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.050
make chocolate out of.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.400
This is the raw bean that they take

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.370
and then they basically dry it

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.950
and then chop it up

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.730
into these little nibs.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.430
It gives a good texture and also,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.240
cacao is a great source of energy.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.240
And then I use some raw cacao powder.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.900
Let's see, I use Navitas as a company.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.340
We just buy this on Amazon

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.270
and then ship it right through our door

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.770
and I'll do like a, you know,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.280
maybe a half a tablespoon

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.560
of cacao powder as well.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.950
Then you just fill it up the rest with water

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.680
and if you want to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.740
make it extra special,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.180
I didn't put it out here so I guess

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.460
I'll leave it out of this recipe

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.060
but do like a little half a tablespoon

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.300
of sunflower butter or almond butter

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.340
or something like that.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.470
It gives it a little bit of

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.720
a kind of a heavier, meatier texture to it.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.860
So let's blend this baby up, huh?

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.370
This is about all you need.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.230
Now you've got a morning

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.250
green drink and it actually taste amazing.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.870
I have one of this every morning.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.370
It's the perfect way to start

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.570
your day giving you tremendous energy,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.020
a clear mind and an ability to really

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.740
go forward and playful out in your days.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.680
Ah, so good.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.210
So I hope you enjoyed this episode

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.990
