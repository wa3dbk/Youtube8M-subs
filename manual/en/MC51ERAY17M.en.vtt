Hi everybody it's Matt here with the eastwood company
today i wanted to show you one of our

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.119
test vehicles

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.679
like many of you you're probably
searching craigslist, ebay, local forums and

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.310
classifieds for a great deal one your
favorite cars

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.840
one of our guys here was doing just that and
he found this great deal on a really

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.210
popular car, an '89 mustang LX
with a 5.0 engine

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.829
we saw potential in this vehicle many
things that you would have turned away

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.349
not one of the best vehicles

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.090
we wanted to get it just so we could
test new products and it's got some body

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.180
damage its got some rust it's got faded parts

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.330
but the biggest thing overall for us was

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.890
unmolested, so it doesn't have any bad
modifications that we have to undo to

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.760
get this thing going. Just the fact that it's inspected and
runs great

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.460
and uh... it's really great passport
toward what we wanted to do with it

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.960
so let me show you around the vehicle and
I'll show you what we're working with

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.090
as you guys can see we're going to be
working within the inferior

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.930
something that most of you probably come up
against with any car of this era

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.070
that's been used as a daily driver
as this one has

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.840
it has bad repairs

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.010
done just to keep the car going
you know there's duck tape on the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.930
upholster of the seat

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.820
ever so common with these cars when the foam and the
the fabric starts wearing through the surface

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.260
and starts stabbing you in the leg

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.460
I'm sure you've all had this happen. The carpets, the door 
handles everything is just really dirty and grimy

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.380
just because this as used as a car, this thing wasn't babied
it was used as a daily driver so we gotta figure out

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.060
how we can make this all look new again

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.940
and that's what we're going to try really hard
to come up with new products to do

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.100
so let's take a look under the hood and see what we're
working with there

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.760
So here's under the hood this is the engine
that everyone would have lusted over in

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.670
1989, the 5.0
the 302 we all know it, some of you hate it

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.330
but

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.590
we're going to see what we can do with this engine bay
to clean everything up, make it look a lot better

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.049
under hood with all
of our detaile paints

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.970
and underhood coatings that you guys know
really well

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.940
uh... one of the things on this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.440
to mention is that it has some

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.150
light

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.270
body damage here at some point
this thing had a light hit

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.500
um... and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.310
it was cobbled cobbled together with some parts
from the junk yard. We're going to 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.110
show you how to properly pull out that area 
fix the rust and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.779
make it a seamless repair so you can never
tell

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.359
that there was any work done to that area

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.459
so keep watching over the next year, look at our

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.539
blog posts

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:24.860
youtube videos

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.880
tech articles and everything in between
as we slowly restore this vehicle and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.130
test and develop new products on it.
