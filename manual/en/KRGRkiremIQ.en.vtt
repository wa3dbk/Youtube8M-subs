Hey guys!

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.679
This is Game On, I'm Grace and I'm going to
be bringing you the gaming news of the day.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.730
Final Fantasy producer Yoshinori has confirmed
that Square Enix are definitely interested

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.039
in bringing future releases of the huge franchise
to PC.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.769
Although Final Fantasy 11 and 14 are available
on PC, none of the Final Fantasy 13 games

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.910
are and Final Fantasy 15 is set for a next-gen
console release only.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.090
BUT according to Yoshinori, this is all about
to change.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.650
The games were initially developed on PC and
although they opted not to release a PC version,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.570
they see potential for it in the future.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.570

to play as a female character on Capcom's

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.270

hit the net and producer Sugiura has responded.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.720
He has let players know via Facebook sthat
the article claiming all 12 main characters

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.810
were male was a big misconception.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.869
Theres only one main character and he's male...
and then he has allies the Ravens.

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.110

of Japan are yet to be decided.
