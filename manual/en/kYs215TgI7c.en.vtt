00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.332
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.880
Micro air vehicles
capable of operating

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.070
in constrained environments
without the use

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.020
of an external
motion capture system

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.470
are typically limited to
slow and conservative flight.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.990
As a consequence, almost
all of this research

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.690
is done with rotorcraft
in the hover regime.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.950
In the robust robotics
group in CSAIL at MIT,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.900
we've developed a
fixed-wing vehicle

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.050
capable of flying at high
speeds through obstacles

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.240
using only onboard sensors.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.430
The vehicle is equipped
with an inertial measurement

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.010
unit and a laser range scanner.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.950
All the computation for
state estimation and control

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.320
is done onboard
using an Intel Atom

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.230
processor, similar to what
is found in a commercially

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.930
available netbook.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.330
We designed a custom
airplane to carry the sensing

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.210
and computation payload while
still being able to maneuver

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.190
in confined spaces.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.200
Our platform has
a 2-meter wingspan

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.040
and weighs approximately
2 kilograms.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.810
At any given time
the laser can only

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.690
see a two-dimensional
picture of the environment.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.850
Laser scans are depicted
with yellow points

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.390
representing obstacles, and
blue representing free space.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.020
Even with a pre-computed
map, individual 2D scans

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.810
don't contain enough information
to uniquely determine

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.980
the 3D position, velocity, and
orientation of the vehicle.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.982
To overcome this difficulty,
we aggregate successive scans

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:27.440
and combine laser information
with the inertial measurement

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.740
unit to perform
state estimation.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.960
Another technical
challenge is efficiently

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.080
generating trajectories
for the vehicle to follow.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.060
The complicated
vehicle dynamics create

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.220
substantial computational
difficulties

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.500
in determining a path
to fly from point A

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.860
to point B. To overcome
this difficulty,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.840
we use an approximate
dynamics model

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.170
that makes it easy to map the
control inputs-- elevator,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.980
rudder, aileron, and
throttle-- to corresponding XYZ

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.540
trajectories.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.880
We start by connecting a
set of high-level waypoints

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.100
with line and arc segments.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.780
We then use our
approximate model

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.540
to construct dynamically
feasible paths

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.889
by parameterizing an offset
from this underlying trajectory.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.410
Here we demonstrate the
accuracy and reliability

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.260
of this system flying
through a parking garage.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.560
In places, the parking garage
is less than 2.5 meters

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.100
from floor to ceiling, creating
extremely tight tolerances

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.600
for our 2-meter vehicle.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.190
Our algorithms
allowed the vehicle

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.910
to complete a 7-minute flight
through the environment

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.970
traveling at over 10 meters per
second, or 22 miles per hour,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.770
covering almost 3
miles of distance

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.960
and repeatedly coming within a
few centimeters of obstacles.
