00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:01.933
(squeaking)

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:03.000
(pop)

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:09.233
(♪♪♪)

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:12.067
Have you ever wanted to
try silk screening

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:13.633
but were hesitant to start

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:15.633
because of the number
of materials needed,

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.633
and the
complicated setup?

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.033
Well in this lesson plan
silk screening is made easy.

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.200
Andy Warhol was the artist

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.267
who elevated the process
of silk screening

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:26.933
to a high art in
the '60s and '70s,

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.167
with his images such as
the Campbell's Soup Can,

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:31.567
and the portrait
of Marilyn Monroe.

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:33.767
But many fine artists have
used the silk screen

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.467
as a tool for
communicating their imagery.

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:38.900
Roy Lichtenstein
and Robert Rauschenberg

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.400
chose this medium because
they wanted to use bold,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.233
bright colours when
reproducing their works.

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:47.400
All you need to make your own
silk screen and frame is

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.700
an embroidery hoop,
polyester screen fabric,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.967
and Mod Podge.

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:54.733
This process is fun and easy,
and the hoops and screens

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.433
can be used numerous times.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.367
Start by opening
the embroidery hoop,

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:01.633
and inserting
the fabric into it.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.100
You want to get this
as tight as you can.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.800
After this, you can draw
a simple image

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.833
right onto the fabric,

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:21.033
or you could place
an image beneath it

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.933
that you might
want to trace from.

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:30.867
You can see that image
come right through there.

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:39.000
You can use a pencil, a pen.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.133
Whatever media you would like.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.800
If you have trouble seeing it,
a light box or window

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.633
helps with visibility.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:51.200
We're going to make
a single colour screen print,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.967
so we just need one screen.

00:01:53.967 --> 00:01:57.033
Once the image is in place,
we'll add Mod Podge

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.467
to the screen.

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.233
It's helpful to elevate
the screen slightly

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:02.333
from the table

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.567
on a couple of rulers
or stretcher bars.

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:07.467
We'll apply the Mod Podge
to the screen

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:11.700
around the image
that's going to be printed.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.433
So I'm going to use
a smaller brush

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:18.700
on any areas
that require detail.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.600
Remember any ink will
pass through the screen

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.533
wherever there is no Mod Podge.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.967
The Mod Podge is
working as our resist,

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:39.633
so apply it all the way out,

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:43.833
close to the inside edges
of the hoop.

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:47.967
Hold it up to a window to
check for any areas

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.133
that need a touch up
of the Mod Podge

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.933
because if there are any holes,

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:54.167
the ink will go
right through them.

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:57.267
You can print on any
tight weave fabric,

00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:00.567
a t-shirt, an apron,
or a canvas bag.

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:03.200
I'm going to print
on this bag today,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.833
and I've inserted
a piece of cardboard

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.267
to protect it from any ink

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:08.367
that could go through
to the other side.

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:14.633
I'm using Speedball Water
Based Fabric Printing Inks

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:16.167
for this process.

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:21.200
So I'm just going to apply
a thick line of ink

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.700
to the screen,
right at the top of the image,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.700
and you don't need as much of
the ink as you might think,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.233
and then I'm just going to
hold this rubber squeegee

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:40.667
at a 45 degree angle
to the screen,

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:45.000
and pull that ink
straight down over the image.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.367
As long as you don't
move your screen,

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:50.167
you can make
a couple passes.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.600
These inks can be mixed
to create a custom colour,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.133
or more than one colour can
be placed on the screen

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:12.367
at a time,

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:14.900
such as was done
for the owl print.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.167
A second colour could be
painted on by hand

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:19.600
with a brush if you want.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.433
I hope you'll try making
a simple silk screen

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:22.467
in the round.

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:25.333
