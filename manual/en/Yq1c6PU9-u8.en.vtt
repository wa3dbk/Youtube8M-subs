00:00:07.683 --> 00:00:09.916
Hey everyone! Welcome back to Anthesy, Celina here.

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:11.916
First of all, I would like to thank you so much for following

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:14.762
For the past few weeks, we've had a lot of fun here!

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:16.762
And today's video, we're going to be focusing on 

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.371
some lipstick swatches by a wonderful company

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.820
based in Toronto, called Bite Beauty.

00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:24.107
You might have heard of these, they are wonderfully pigmented

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.110
lipsticks, that are creamy, soft and so moisturizing 

00:00:28.374 --> 00:00:30.618
and it really helps to keep dry chapped lips away for the

00:00:30.618 --> 00:00:33.618
winter time. So without further a due, let's get into the

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:35.826
lipstick swatches!

00:00:35.826 --> 00:00:38.592
A bit about the brand before getting into the swatches

00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:40.592
Bite beauty makes lipsticks that are high performing

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.249
natural, and apparently clean enough to eat

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.234
There are definitely lots of good natural ingredients

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:49.183
like nourishing oils and even Shea butter

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:52.114
They also contain Resveratrol which will keep your lips

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.716
nice and youthful

00:00:54.716 --> 00:00:56.716
But let's take a closer look at the ingredients

00:00:58.088 --> 00:00:59.568
the lipsticks may contain ingredients like

00:00:59.568 --> 00:01:01.568
Mica, Titanium Dioxide and Iron Oxides which contain

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:05.435
traces of lead naturally

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.708
Lipsticks may also contain synthetic colouring

00:01:11.908 --> 00:01:13.640
as some colours are hard to produce without the use of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.640
synthetics. looking into these ingredients, they are rated

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.900
low to moderate hazard and are under restrictive use

00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:21.728
when added to beauty products.

00:01:22.692 --> 00:01:24.089
Now onto the swatches.

00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:26.089
Our first colour is Cava.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.560
Cava is a lilac-beige that is a blushed nude

00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:34.077
with hints of brown and mauve.

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:44.985
Definitely a nice colour to wear out with a dramatic smokey eye.

00:01:48.578 --> 00:01:50.578
Next up is Vouvray

00:01:55.623 --> 00:01:58.621
Vouvray is a ballet pink that is a soft but bright baby pink

00:02:00.997 --> 00:02:02.997
The formula is definitely rich, easy to apply and smells

00:02:04.037 --> 00:02:06.040
fruity and creamy

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.755
Very cute and feminine, a your lips but better colour

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:14.349
suited for everyday wear

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:18.159
Next up is Fig.

00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:24.563
Fig is a nude-rose that is a bright but muted Rosy Pink

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.002
Definitely another great shade for everyday wear

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.768
Fourth is Zin.

00:02:49.123 --> 00:02:51.127
Zin is a muted berry that is like a stained berry red

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.999
with a hint of shimmer.

00:03:02.168 --> 00:03:04.164
It's a great understated red when you don't want bold lips.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.715

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:14.488
Next is Pepper.

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:22.209
Pepper is a dusty rose, a true muted rose with a brown hue.

00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:35.465
A great neutral for fall, especially with a subtle winged liner

00:03:42.873 --> 00:03:44.872
And our final colour, Violet.

00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:54.019
Violet is a magenta-violet, that is a saturated purple-pink.

00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:08.573
This one is perfect for a fun evening out!

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.839
Alright, so what are the results?

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.597
Bite beauty luminous creme lipsticks are highly pigmented

00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:21.081
and easy to work. Some come in sheer formulas but are

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:23.652
easy to build.

00:04:23.652 --> 00:04:25.650
There are a wide range of colours for lipstick lovers and

00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:27.984
and it is very moisturizing and does not cause peeling

00:04:29.314 --> 00:04:31.316
It is not all natural or vegan but it is less toxic than

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.036
than most commercial lipsticks.

00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:36.720
It's a great brand for those transitioning to toxic-free 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.717
products and looking for alternatives

00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:44.665
