00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.219
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here
with a review of

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:05.720
the 2012 MacBook Air 11”.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.830
I was a big fan of the previous

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.180
generation Air and the latest model brings
some solid

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.050
improvements but are they worth it?

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.050
Externally the computer

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.380
looks nearly identical to the last Air which
isn’t a bad

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.440
thing at all.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.280
The build is entirely aluminium with a wedge

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.910
shape that gives it one of the thinnest profiles
of any laptop

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.170
you can buy.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.430
Best of all the 11” Air is still totally
usable

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.800
as the keyboard and trackpad are full sized.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.800
While the 135

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.990
pixel per inch display can’t touch the 220
PPI on the Retina

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.710
MacBook Pro, it remains very good for a laptop
of this size.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.859
Powering the screen is a Core i5 or Core i7
processor with

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.729
Intel HD 4000 graphics.

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:40.949
As the latest ultra low voltage CPUs

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.050
from Intel you’ll find that there’s plenty
of performance

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.300
while still running cool and being easy on
the battery.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.300
I won’t

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.249
go too in-depth on the performance but if
you’re interested in

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:50.780
the details feel free to check out this video
I made measuring

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.989
how fast the Air is and what kind of games
it can handle.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.289
Just like the last two versions the MacBook
Air comes standard

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.290
with an SSD.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.819
I’ve talked about what SSDs are all about
before

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.350
but to sum up quickly a solid state drive
is a collection of

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.839
chips that replaces a normal spinning hard
drive.

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:05.869
An SSD is

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.270
generally more reliable as there are no moving
parts to break

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.130
and are around four to five times faster.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.130
In the real world

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.250
this means the Air is extremely snappy.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.250
The computer boots in

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.150
just over 13 seconds and programs fly open
much faster than

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.979
with a mechanical hard drive.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.439
For an 11” laptop battery life

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.920
isn’t half bad.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.130
With watching a few HD YouTube videos,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.579
writing this review in Google Drive and listening
to music

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.430
I was able to get just over five hours on
a charge.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.439
One thing that’s entirely unchanged from
the last Air is

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.350
the keyboard and trackpad combo.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.350
The backlit keyboard

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.960
is great, bordering on excellent if only it
had a bit more

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.960
travel.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.719
The trackpad on the other hand is basically
perfect

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.310
and is right up there with the MacBook Pro
as the best trackpads

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.310
I’ve ever used.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.270
It’s large for any computer but especially
for

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.119
an 11” laptop and the glass surface works
very well with the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.189
various multitouch gestures in OS X. Speaking
of OS X as of

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.719
recording this review the MacBook Air comes
preloaded with

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.380
10.7 Lion.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.329
If you’ve used any recent Mac you’ll know
what you’re

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.890
getting however very soon OS 10.8 Mountain
Lion will be out.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219
Newer Airs will come preloaded with this but
if you buy one with

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.899
Lion you’ll get a free upgrade once it’s
available.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.899
There are

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:08.899
some slight changes with the ports.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:09.899
On the left side you’ll find

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.950
MagSafe 2 for charging which works exactly
the same as before but

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.100
with a new thinner magnetic connector.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.100
Beside that is a USB 3.0

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.760
port and there’s also the headphone jack
and a microphone.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760
On the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.080
right side is the Thunderbolt port that doubles
as a Mini

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.820
DisplayPort along with your second USB 3.0.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.190
I mostly use the Air

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.320
as a portable video production machine and
it works well here.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.660
Obviously you wouldn’t want to spend all
day using After Effects

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.850
on it but it can absolutely handle a decent
amount of editing.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.600
Another thing that’s very important to me
is how quiet it runs as

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.930
the Air is usually how I record my audio.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.930
The last gen kicked the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.550
fan up pretty quickly however thankfully the
new Air with the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.040
Core i5 stays silent for much longer, the
fan only firing up audibly

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.700
when doing heavy lifting.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.140
You can order the Air with quite a few

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.140
options.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.430
The basic configuration costs $1000 for 4GB
of RAM, a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.810
Core i5 and 64GB SSD. $100 more will get you
128GB of storage and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.010
another $100 will double your RAM to 8GB which
is the Air I’m using

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.010
now.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.670
You can also order a Core i7 for an additional
$150 and bump the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.300
SSD up to 256GB or 512GB for $300 and $800
respectively.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.300
The options

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.350
you choose are up to you but one important
thing to keep in mind is

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.080
that you really can’t upgrade the laptop
after you buy it.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080
The RAM is

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.180
completely non-removable and the SSD uses
a special connector so it’s

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.970
best to get any upgrades upfront.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.320
You can always want more in products

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.970
and the Air is no exception.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.450
While the extreme thinness is great I would

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.820
gladly trade a few millimeters for an included
SD card reader and another

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.930
USB port.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.520
The battery life is solid but nothing spectacular
and while it’s

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.880
more than fast enough for 98% of users having
a bit more power could make

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.180
editing better and gaming more viable.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.550
All that said, the MacBook Air is a

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.150
fantastic computer.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.460
The size is perfect for me, the keyboard and
trackpad

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.930
are phenomenal and with both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt
you won’t lack

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.880
anything for high speed connectivity.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.370
With the new Ivy Bridge processors

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.500
and the option to get 8GB of RAM my wish list
is steadily disappearing.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.210
While it’s not a massive upgrade from the
last generation I can easily say

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.050
that the 2012 MacBook Air remains an excellent
choice.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.070
If you’re interested

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.800
in more on the MacBook Air feel free to check
out my unboxing as well as

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.580
take a look at the gaming performance and
speed test here.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.580
