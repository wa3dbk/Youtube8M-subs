00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.870
If your brakes are starting to grind,
squeal,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.210
pulse, grab, or feel squishy or soft, it's
time for us to talk.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.969
You probably know that Les Schwab is the
largest independent

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.730
tire dealer in the West, but did you know
we're also one of the largest brake

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.000
providers as well.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.960
When it comes to vehicle safety, nothing
is more critical

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.670
than your brakes. If you're experiencing
any kind of brake problems,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.820
know that letting these problems go too
long is not only

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.899
dangerous, but could also cause more
damage to your braking system

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.480
and even other parts of your car,
ultimately costing you

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.129
even more to fix. For your brakes to work
properly,

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.110
you have to maintain the entire braking system. Depending on driving style and driving

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.039
environment, brakes will wear at different

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.620
rates, and there are many reasons why a
brake system may not work as designed.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.670
So, regardless of what you may see or
hear,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.520
no one can give you a proper
and accurate cost estimate unless they do

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.390
a thorough inspection

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.250
of your brakes. At Les Schwab, we not only
inspect your brakes for free,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.760
but we also take the time, if there is a
problem, to explain the current condition

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.580
of your vehicle,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.500
and what work will be required to get
your brake system working properly.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.950
On top of that, we always provide you
with a free written

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.840
estimate up front, so you can make an
informed decision regarding your

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.560
vehicle's brake maintenance.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.680
Be sure and ask about it. Should work need
to be done,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.090
you'll find only professionally trained
technicians inspecting and servicing

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.619
your brake system,

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.759
