That unicorn, I know, I know.

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.045
&gt;&gt; You guys talking about
The Serpent Trials?

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:08.962
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:11.910
&gt;&gt; My god, I hated that book.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.410
&gt;&gt; I loved it.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.730
&gt;&gt; Seriously?

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.880
You loved it?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.800
&gt;&gt; You didn't?

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:26.040
You should feel it's like.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.150
&gt;&gt; That was one of the most inventive,
it was a metaphor for

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.590
life and how we interact.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.040
&gt;&gt; It was a metaphor for life?

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.947
&gt;&gt; Yes, I cannot believe, I mean it
must've been over your head with all that,

00:00:34.947 --> 00:00:38.100
because this is one of the most moving
books I've ever, ever, ever encountered.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.200
&gt;&gt; Can we talk about— because—

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:51.200

00:01:04.943 --> 00:01:08.147
Aubrey, I think we should take a break.

00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:09.905
&gt;&gt; You're right, this discussion's
just going in circles and

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:10.830
it's not getting us anywhere.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.752
&gt;&gt; No, not from that.

00:01:13.752 --> 00:01:15.761
From our friendship.

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:22.860
I'm sorry I have to do this again, but
I can't be book BBF's with you anymore,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.855
not until we find another
book we both love.

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:28.556
I'm sorry.
