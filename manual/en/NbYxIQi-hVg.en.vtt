Hey!
I am Akshay, the product manager on Prince

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.500
of Persia The Shadow and the Flame and today
I have got the chance to give you guys an

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.820
inside look on the development of the game,
make you meet the team and see what Prince

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.320
of Persia the shadow and flame is all about.
So, let's go take a look...

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.310
Prince of Persia is in itself a very strong
brand and not just in Ubisoft but worldwide.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.320
After the success of Prince of Persia Classic
on the smartphones we had more of the prince's

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.980
journey to tell and hence Prince of Persia
Shadow and the flame which in itself is a

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.329
great game but we couldn't bring it to today's
standards and not adapt it in terms of accessibility,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.829
visuals and the game itself.
0:01:11.929,0:01:10.329
So let's take a closer look at what needed

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.469
to be done to tailor-make this game for today's
audience. Initially the question was, why

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.469
remake Prince of Persia The Shadow and the
Flame? And the answer to that was pretty simple.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.700
Because people evolved, platform evolved.
More casual audiences, shorter playing cycles

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.459
and of course tablets and smartphones.
But we had an objective on our hands, we needed

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:39.289
to make a game that was easy to play but hard
to master and at the same time keeping it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.899
faithful to the original.
We needed to make a game that was more objectified

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.929
and less trial and error. Let me now make
you meet somebody who's overseen this journey

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.929
from the start.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.399
Hello, my name is Sashi Menon and I am the
producer of Prince of Persia The Shadow and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.079
the Flame. Let me give you a brief glimpse
into what Shadow and Flame was and what it

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.039
is today.
Shadow and Flame takes place eleven days after

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.010
the events in the original Prince of Persia
and Jaffar is back from defeat and has taken

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.190
control over the kingdom And now it is upto
our prince to do what he does best : Save

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.690
the Kingdom, Rescue the Princess.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.080
I must say we are very happy to have achieved
the balance between staying true to the original

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.390
and adapting it to the new platforms at the
same time. Well that's it for today, Thank

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.070
you for watching. See you all next week for
a more in-depth talk on Prince of Persia : The

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.780
Shadow and the Flame.
