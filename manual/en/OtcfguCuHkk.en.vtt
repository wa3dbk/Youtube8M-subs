How to Go F**k Yourself.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.290
You’ve just heard those 3 magic words, but
you’re not sure what to do next.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.830
Fear not—this should help.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.839
You will need A sense of self-importance The
need to be taken down a notch and a stupid

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.060
face.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.519
Please, f**k yourself responsibly.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.669
Step 1.

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.989
Realize that you may not be the most popular
guy on the planet.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.829
Come to terms with this realization.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.370
Own it.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.370
Step 2.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.260
Clear your schedule for the day and eliminate
any and all distractions from the task at

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.260
hand.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Step 3.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.260
Create an action plan.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.739
Do you want to be f**ked for life?

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.550
Or just the afternoon?

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.920
While the exact meaning of the phrase is ambiguous,
the intention is consistent.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.280
Basically, have a sh**ty day.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.280
Step 4.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.110
Have you been cheating on your wife?

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.559
How about your taxes?

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.649
Time to own up, you lying turd!

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.789
Pick up the phone and let them know what you
really are.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.290
Don’t stop there—tell everyone!

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.310
Step 5.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.580
Identify a few items you simply can’t live
without…and get rid of them.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.759
Remember, you won’t need possessions down
in hell!

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.759
Step 6.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.060
Don’t do anything drastic like set fire
to one or both your legs.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.720
It’s not likely, but a serious and sudden
injury might stir up sympathy for your miserable

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.189
self, and that’s antithetical to your ultimate
goal.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.350
Step 7.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.420
Get creative!

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.009
When it comes to f**king yourself, the options
are endless.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.009
Step 8.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.159
While you’re on a roll, why not visit your
boss, and tell him to go f**k himself too.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.159
Congratulations.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.159
You’re f**ked.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.700
And you did it all by yourself.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.830
Did you know In 2004, Vice President Dick
Cheney famously told Vermont Senator Patrick

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.350
Leahy to go f**k himself.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.959
There is no law against obscene language by
a vice president on the Senate floor.
