00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:05.659
&gt;&gt;HEY THERE KID.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.780
&gt;&gt;JOHNNY, WHAT ARE YOU-

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.940
&gt;&gt;QUIET NOW, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.389
I'VE COME TO SAY GOODBYE, SALLY.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:11.510
&gt;&gt;WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.289
&gt;&gt;I MEAN YOU AND I CAN NEVER BE.

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.449
I KNOW WE'RE TERRIBLY IN LOVE, BUT MY LIFE
IS JUST TOO

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.310
DANGEROUS FOR A DOLL LIKE YOU.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.140
I WOULD DIE IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.800
&gt;&gt;WHY ARE YOU SAYING THIS?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.420
&gt;&gt;BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU KID.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.720
&gt;&gt;NO, I MEAN, WHY ARE YOU

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.900
SAYING WE'RE IN LOVE?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.239
&gt;&gt;ARE WE NOT?

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.759
BECAUSE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION...

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.470
&gt;&gt;YEAH, NO.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.540
I'M SORRY JOHHNY.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.200
I'VE JUST NEVER REALLY BEEN THAT INTERESTED IN YOU.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.300
&gt;&gt;WHAT?

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.539
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.059
&gt;&gt;I'M SORRY!

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.829
I'M JUST SURPRISED THAT YOU EVEN THOUGHT WE HAD A RELATIONSHIP.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.070
&gt;&gt;ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.390
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE TIMES WE HELD HANDS?

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.129
&gt;&gt;YOU MEAN ALL THE TIMES YOU REACHED FOR

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.469
MY HAND AND I PULLED AWAY?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.640
&gt;&gt;YEAH...WHAT ABOUT THAT?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.280
&gt;&gt;WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY HOLDING HANDS.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.989
I FACT, 40 YEARS FROM NOW THAT'S

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.629
GOING TO BE HARASSMENT.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.379
&gt;&gt;BUT, WE'VE KISSED!

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.089
MANY TIMES!

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.370
DID THAT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.320
[LAUGHTER] &gt;&gt;WE DEFINITELY HAVEN'T KISSED.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.370
&gt;&gt;WE KISSED LAST NIGHT UNDER THE FULL MOON!

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.460
&gt;&gt;JOHNNY, I WAS OUT OF TOWN LAST NIGHT.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.240
&gt;&gt;YOU WERE?

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.420
WHO THE HECK HAVE I BEEN KISSING?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.820
&gt;&gt;HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT   QUESTION?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.810
&gt;&gt;I DON'T KNOW!

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.470
IT WAS DARK AND THIS TOWN IS EXCESSIVELY FOGGY!

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.840
&gt;&gt;IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE SOME THINGS TO FIGURE OUT.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.190
&gt;&gt;I MIGHT'VE BEEN KISSING A LAMP POST!

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.710
&gt;&gt;I SHOULD REALLY GET GOING.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.230
&gt;&gt;BUT, HERE!

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.260
THIS NOTE!

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.080
YOU LEFT IT ON THE PIANO IN THE CLUB.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.140
"I LOVE YOU JOHNNY.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.690
GOODBYE."

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.980
&gt;&gt;THAT'S NOT MY HANDWRITING.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.340
AND I THINK THAT ACTUALLY SAYS "JANEY" AND
NOT "JOHNNY".

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.570
&gt;&gt;I'VE BEEN STEALING SOME DAME'S NOTES?

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.890
MAN, DO I FEEL STUPID.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.300
I'VE PROBABLY RUINED SOMEBODY'S RELATIONSHIP.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.340
&gt;&gt;I'M SORRY JOHNNY.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.800
I REALLY AM.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.510
I BETTER GET ON MY FLIGHT.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.920
&gt;&gt;YEAH.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.570
YEAH, ME TOO ACTUALLY.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.990
MINE'S ABOUT TO LEAVE.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.340
&gt;&gt;OH NO!

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880
CLASSIC

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.560
NO. THAT WAS A PARODY OF A CLASSIC

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.940
HAVE YOU NOT SEEN CASABLANCA?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.940
YOU SHOULD GO WATCH IT.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.420
'CAUSE IT IS JUST LEGENDARY.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.880
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU SHOULD DO?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.360
JUST GO AHEAD AND SUBSCRIBE

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.360
THAT'S GOOD TO. THEN COME BACK AND START

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.600
COMMENTING WHEN YOU'RE BORED HALFWAY

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600
THROUGH THE MOVIE

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.600
'CAUSE IT'S PRETTY LONG
