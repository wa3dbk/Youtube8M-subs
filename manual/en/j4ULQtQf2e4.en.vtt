A wedgie from a woman, that's a messed up neglect.

00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:20.738

00:00:53.817 --> 00:00:56.228

I'm makin' lots of money. Life is good at the top.

And it's never, ever, ever, ever, ever, gonna stop.

00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:34.341
	Don't think for a second that I wished this from a genie.

00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:36.999

00:01:54.657 --> 00:01:57.243
	And I know what you be wantin', to touch it and lick it.
