00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Hello! Hi! Nicolette. Valerie, nice to meet
you.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.700
Hi, can I have a seat? Hello, yeah! What's
your name?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.900
I'm Sarah. I'm Jian Hao. Nice to meet
you.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.631
I'm going to drink some coffee first.

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:39.470
Hi! Hello! I'm Valerie! Aaron. Nice to meet
you.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.770
So...

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.610
Apparently we're supposed to just talk to
each other.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.730
Sorry, your receipts. Thank you.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.070
Eh it's on me, it's on me. Ok... uh...
thanks!

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.280
Find something in your childhood you both
have done.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.480
When I was a child I did quite a lot of things.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.680
Like when I was in primary school I did dance,
art, piano...

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.310
Woah you sound like one of those super "up
there" "guai"(good) kid.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.500
No no no, not really.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.700
When did you have your first kiss? What???

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.910
First kiss ah... Eh... Seventeen. Woah... player.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.950
I'm a bit slow when it comes to such things.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.110
My childhood... I have an elder brother.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.280
So I usually play with like super hero figurines.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.340
Hey I do that too. When I was young, it was Captain Planet.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.020
Captain Planet? Have you watched Captain Planet?

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.060
I know Captain America. No it's totally
different.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.740
Captain Planet saves the planet. Captain America...

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.020
saves America! I suppose so.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.170
Something in your childhood that you've
probably

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.280
done would be play hopscotch? Have you done
that?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.000
No! No? You have not played hopscotch?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.330
I thought guys don't play hopscotch.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.820
It's a girls thing right? Umm... like catching?

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.120
Alright yeah, Police. Ok, done that, tick.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.700
Why do you think Singaporeans don't talk
to strangers?

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.640
I think people here are a little bit more self-conscious, they are afraid of being judged.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.740
If you start talking to a stranger at a coffee
shop

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.629
or a restaurant, people will start thinking "what's wrong with this guy?"

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.730
It's very conservative here.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.120
When I talk to strangers they will just give
me

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.719
that weird look, like I'm some sort of freak.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.749
Am I giving you that weird look?

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.899
No you're being very nice.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.279
I think parents always tell their kids not
to

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.959
talk to strangers so they grow up thinking
that they shouldn't talk to strangers.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.999
How many times did your parents tell you to say "hi" to people that you don't know?

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.579
"Oh you don't know this uncle, don't
talk to him."

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.090
Yeah exactly.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.719
Who says Singaporeans don't talk to strangers?

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:57.000
I do actually. I do too. I always make friends with taxi drivers, shop keepers and all that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.340
Its these nice little conversations you have, a moment you share with someone, that will never ever come back again.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.273
Its these nice little conversations you have

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.590
Its these nice little conversations you have

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.590
that you share with someone that will never

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.590
ever come back again.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.310
I think its when you find something in the
moment

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.889
that you have in common and you tap on it
to

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:08.600
start a whole conversation.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.900
"One thing you would change about Singapore"

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.900
The weather. I think the weather is horrible and it's not ok. It's far from ok.

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.189
I want Singaporeans to learn to have fun more.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.799
Have fun in what sense?

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.499
Just be more joyful about things, cause we
tend

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:26.959
to want to complain, want to compare,

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.040
we want to find loopholes in the whole system

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.430
and just not feel happy about being in Singapore.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.889
I think that is something that I want to change.

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.059
There are mornings when it's a bit cold,

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.299
but not that cold, and people are already
complaining.

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.620
So, yeah, that 's also one thing I should
change

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.510
about Singapore because people complain so
much.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.790
Yeah, people complain all the time.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.849
Except that I think I've complained quite
a lot already in our conversation.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.700
What makes you happy? Balloons? Yeah balloons. Flowers make me happy.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.200
What makes me really happy is when I can see others happy as well.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.300
Aww... that's so sweet!

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.070
I like to make people's day.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.000
What does it mean to love unconditionally?

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.029
You just give and not expect anything in return.

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:17.880
I think all religions preach that.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:27.200
If you're going through bad times, you don't give up on each other. Even though that person farts in his sleep, you'll still love him.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.400
It's hard to hate someone for farting in
their sleep.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.300
Yeah I know, but I mean some people could
find

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.600
that disgusting. Well I mean it is disgusting.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.400
Would you fart in front of your partner?

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.200
No, I mean I will try not to!

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.800
Are you religious?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.300
Kind of. I grew up as a Buddhist but I'm not too caught up with the label that I put on myself.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.500
I mean everything is fine, I don't mind
going to church, I don't mind going to a mosque or a temple.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.200
To me it's just different paths that lead to the same end point.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.100
Come up with the lyrics for next year's

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.400
national day song. What? How do you do that?

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.000
If I were to write a national day song for
Singapore, it would be about food because I mean

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.729
everybody loves food here. It'll be all
about food.

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.379
Ok what's the national dish? Because I mean we've got chilli crab, we've got chicken rice

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.470
You've got to say chilli crab first right? The one that's contested.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.909
1, 2, 3! "Eat it together as a nation."

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:30.039
Ok done, that was awesome. That was in sync, it was awesome.

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:44.300
"Singapore is really awesome, that's why
our national animal is a possum. Oh wait, it's a Merlion. I get confused when I'm flying!"

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.700
Do you have an email address? We can be pen pals.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.700
Keep in touch! That was fun!

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.000
Nice meeting you. I didn't have any of my
coffee.
