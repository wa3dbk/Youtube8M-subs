00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.700
Is it November sixth yet, God...

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.760
Just a few more minutes, Grif. Then we can play all the Halo 4 we want.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.520
Uh, hey, Sarge.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.860
What in the devil are you boys doin' here? You told me you needed to take a sick day on November sixth. That's today!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.560
Huh? Oh right- uh hghm hghm hghm coughing h-hm, u-h-h-hm. Uh, just needed to get some fresh air, Sarge.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.440
It's thirty degrees below freezing.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.740
Wow, really? I had no idea. Uh-huh, whoo!

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.600
Maybe you should go home. And, you know, get some bedrest.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.520
What?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.160
Good point. If anything's gonna kill you it's me! Not some girly little bacteria.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.880
Simmons, what the hell are you doing?

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.640
Don't worry Grif, after I beat the campaign you can be my player 2 in Spartan Ops.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.020
You'll never get away with this you son of a-

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.540
Hey, Tiny Cham, get yer keester in the jeepster.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.880
Hhh, you're right Simmons, I should come clean.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.440
What?

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.040
What?

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.660
You got me Sarge, Simmons is the real sick one. I just drug him outta bed so that he and I could be the first few people to vote for President.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.240
You mean this is the line to vote?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.140
...Yes?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.700
That's- that's not true.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.380
It isn't?

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.880
Grif's the sick one, it was my idea to come out here and vote.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.740
Clearly the fever's gone to his head.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.300
What!?

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.980
Since when did you two start to care so much about voting?

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.500
I've always cared about voting.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.340
Is that so.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.520
Absolutely.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.360
Prove it.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.420
You've got to be kidding me

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700
This is all your fault.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.760
I'm not hearing entertaining and informative lyrics.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.020
Awesome, Halo 4, this is the best!

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.900
Achoo. Hm. Hblb.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.340
Hmm, sounds like that cold of yours is getting worse. Maybe you should head home, Private.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.160
What're you gonna do?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.380
Are you kidding me? I'm gonna go play Halo 4! I bought it while you two were singing that stupid song.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.860
You took our spot in line!? We stood in the snow for seven hours!

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.380
Nah, I had it preordered. Picked up my forest armor skin and arctic battle weapon skin too. The Blues don't stand a chance.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.340
See you back at the base, suckers. Heh heh.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.820
Ah, ahahachoo.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.740
Well, I guess it's a good thing we took a sick day, huh Grif?

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.120
Oh God... I sneezed all over my visor!
