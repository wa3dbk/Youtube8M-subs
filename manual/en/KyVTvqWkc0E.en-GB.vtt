00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:15.179
So this is your first test seam stitched

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:26.260
Normally seams are pressed open from the wrong
side

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.489
We have created a nice flat seam from the
right side

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.320
We will neaten the raw edge to stop it fraying

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.700
As for the darts, we tie off the ends with
a simple knot

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.360
I use a pin or needle to position the knot
close to the dart point

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.500
A second knot to be safe

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.729
Cut the threads with a bit of a tail

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.239
We'll say this is the Centre Front

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.299
Waist darts are normally pressed towards the
centre

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.000
Press up to the dart point and no further

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.860
Then press the area beyond the dart

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.560
We have created the shaping

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.220
Bust darts are normally pressed downwards

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:32.430
Again press up to the point and then press
from the other direction

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.109
So to neaten our straight seam edges

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.409
we use a zigzag stitch on its widest setting
on a standard machine

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.299
Line the raw edge up with the centre of the
foot

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.739
I'm using a standard stitch length but you
can lengthen it if you like

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.280
Keeping the edge in the centre of the foot

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.770
allows the stitch to wrap the edge rather
like an overlocker

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.879
We don't want the edge to roll as this will
result in a bumpy ridge

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.159
that will show when the seam is pressed

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.160
This simple rule will make all the difference
to the finish

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.040
A nice flat edge

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:47.169
This seam allowance won't fray however many
times it goes through the wash

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.739
That is all the basic sewing you need to know

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.269
to create a wardrobe full of beautiful garments

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.319
So let's see this process for real

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.669
Here I am joining a side seam

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.400
The pieces are right sides together

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.430
Your machine will have a setting for a standard
length of stitch

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.349
and you will use this most of the time

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.389
Straight stitching will be used throughout
your garment to join pieces together

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.900
and to stitch your darts for the shaping

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.239
I am not pulling or pushing the fabric

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.430
I am just guiding and keeping the seam line
straight

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.639
Most machines have a setting to stitch at
a slow speed

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.939
This is useful if you are finding it difficult
to control the speed with the foot pedal

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.860
Here I am stitching gathering thread around
a sleeve head curve

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.759
I have to be careful not to stretch the fabric
and distort the curve

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.020
I am just guiding, not pushing or pulling

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.720
Here I am stitching a dart

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.090
Always start your stitching at the garment
edge

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.900
and sew towards the dart point

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.560
I start as always sewing in reverse for a
few stitches

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.759
I take pins out as I go

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:02.759
Shorten your stitch length as you approach
the point and then sew straight off the edge

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.550
Leave long threads so that you can knot them

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.800
Pressing

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.840
Always press as you go

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.949
For any fabric other than cotton, I usually
use a pressing cloth

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:26.020
This reduces the risk of creating shine on
linens, woollens and man mades

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.960
I usually use a steam setting through a dry
piece of muslin

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.740
Waist darts on bodices, skirts and trousers
are usually pressed towards the centre

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.700
and bust darts are pressed downwards

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.090
I'm using a tailor's ham here but pressing
on a flat surface is fine

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.860
Lastly, keep your work tidy, clipping threads
as you go

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.620
Work with clean hands

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.949
Try not to over handle your work

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.020
This goes such a long way towards keeping
your project fresh

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.569
and brand new for when you get to wear it

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.789
And that's all you need to get started

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.030
