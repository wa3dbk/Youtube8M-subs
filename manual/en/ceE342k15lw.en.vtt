This is a short tutorial on how to set
up a site definition in Dreamweaver

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.930
so that you can edit and manage web sites
here at SSU

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.119
The first thing we're going to do is open
up Dreamweaver

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.090
and then on the top menu where it says site

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.660
pull down and say new site

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.369
this is our site definition window

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.699
and we are on the

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.160
advanced side rather than on the basic side.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.730
The first thing you're going to come to
is the site name. The site name is just a handy label

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.540
for the web site you're working
on it doesn't have to match anything on thes server

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.350
so we're going to put in this case sociology.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.600
The next spot down is the local root folder.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.720
The local root folder is a folder on your
computer where you will keep all files related

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.409
to your website

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.150
and where Dreamweaver will download files and upload
files.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.700
I'm going to create a folder on my desk top
by

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.940
pressing on the blue folder icon. You can put your
folder whereever you want on your computer but I'm

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.030
going to put mine on the desktop

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.110
and I'm going to call it sociologywebsite.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.550
Now the images folder should usually
be in the same place

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.410
with your other website documents

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.209
so I'm going to create a new folder

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.110
called images

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.750
where all of my images will be kept.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.250
Now we come to links relative to.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.670
The default is document and you'll put your web
site address here at the http field,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:49.460
so for my web site I'm going to put
http://www.sonoma.edu/sociology

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.970
You can leave case sensitive links blank

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.810
and you make sure that the
cache is enabled.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.710
Now we'll move over to the category area on the
left-hand side

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.800
and choose remote information.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.540
pull down the access menu and choose WebDAV

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.960
In the U R L  area you want to put your username and password.
This should have been given to

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.919
you either by the help desk or by the web
office

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:26.619
We're going add an S to the 
https://dav.sonoma.edu/

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:29.139
and the name of our web site,

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.069
sociology

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.530
In the login field

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.849
put your Seawolf username
and password like you use in your email

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.399
Now you can click the test button and test your
connection to the server.

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:50.399
if the login fails verify your account information
and correct the settings as necessary

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:57.550
You are now ready to edit your website or
upload and download files

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.800
Congratulations!
