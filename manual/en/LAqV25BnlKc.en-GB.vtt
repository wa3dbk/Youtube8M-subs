Hello and welcome to a new SIP tutorial.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.100
I'm sure you know how it feels, when the gearbox doesn't react properly...

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.150
When the gears just won't engage cleanly...

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.270
Sometimes this is caused by badly adjusted gear cables.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.250
But it's super easy and cheap to fix that.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.490
Let me show you, how to adjust the gear cables of a T5 largeframe model.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.220
I'll remove the side panel, so that you have a better view.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.160
This is the selector box. By operating it, you shift from on gear to another.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.200
It usually has a screw-on cover.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.450
I have already removed it.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.550
Right on top, there's the gear roll. It's pulled by two cables.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.250
One of them moves the roll to the left, the other one moves it to the right. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.150
The cables come from the gear tube. The selector box has various resting positions. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.150
First gear, neutral, second gear, third and fourth gear. 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.010
To adjust the gear cables, we switch to neutral. 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.500
Now we loosen the screws at the lower end of the gear cables.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.220
We also move the gear tube to its neutral position.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.400
Use adhesive tape or ask someone to help you.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.200
We completely screw in the adjusting srews (the fine-adjustment follows later) 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.180
and then loosen them by approx. two turns.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.100
Now we use the cable caliper to tension the cables,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and fix the clamp bracket.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100
Same goes for the other cable, of course. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.100
It's important that the tension on the cables doesn't get too hight, when you operate the selector box. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.100
Now we can further adjust the cables via the setting screws.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.100
At the handlebar, the clearance should be 3-5mm in each direction.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.100
As you see, it's not very difficult to adjust the gear cables. 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.100
If you use new cables, make sure to readjust them after a while

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.500
as they will get slightly longer.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.200
I would strongly recommend you to replace your old cables and use the SIP Premium kit instead.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.000
It comes with a PTFE coating. 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.100
I have written down all the parts that I used (including the great pliers)

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500
on a notepad. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.200
