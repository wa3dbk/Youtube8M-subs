[music]

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.345
Hi, I'm Jesse Griffiths and this is
Wild Game Cooking.

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:15.615
Today we're going to be grilling a
venison backstrap or loin.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.551
Venison is a really lean,
really flavorful meat.

00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.501
I particularly love it.

00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:23.423
I'll shoot 2 or 3 deer each year

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.386
and that will usually last me
up until the next season.

00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:29.561
Because it's so lean
sometimes it can overcook

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:30.996
and become a little bit dry.

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:33.700
So I like to grill it over
really high heat

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.235
and put it in a marinade.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:37.498
First, what we're going to
need to do though

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:40.373
is remove this membrane right here.

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.975
If we leave it on there,
it will curl on the grill

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:44.176
and it won't lay flat

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:46.380
and this is also pretty tough.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.548
To get this off,

00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:52.785
I'm simply going to hold it
with my thumb

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.855
and move a knife right along it

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:58.458
kind of scraping, kind of cutting

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:02.461
the whole loin off like so.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.298
There's a little bit left on there.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.933
I'll just come in with my knife,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.701
trim that off,

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.740
basically until I don't see any
more white membrane on there.

00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:18.811
Now that I've got this silver skin off

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.480
I can put it back in the bowl

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.478
and I can season it up with a
little bit of salt and pepper.

00:01:23.478 --> 00:01:25.751
I like to season meats
before I grill them

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:29.355
for maybe 2 hours ahead of time,
maybe even a day.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:32.225
This allows all the seasoning
to penetrate all the way through

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.893
and makes it a little more flavorful.

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:38.398
I'm also going to add
some fresh chopped herbs.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:41.635
I've got some rosemary, thyme
and oregano in here

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.436
but feel free to use
anything you've got on hand.

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:46.573
And then some olive oil.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:52.845
I'm going to toss that
to coat it evenly

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.250
and then let it sit, like I said,
2 hours or even overnight.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.385
I've got a piece over here

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.253
that I've had marinating

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:03.123
and I'm ready to go on the grill.

00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:05.758
I've got gas grill over here
set to high.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.795
You can also use charcoal grill
or even wood

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.696
and let that burn down
to nice hot coals.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:13.200
But I like to cook it
really, really hot

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.908
to develop a nice crust on the outside

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.106
while the inside stays nice and rare.

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:20.540
I cook it about 5 minutes per side.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:24.341
[sizzles]
Yeah, that is a nice, hot grill.

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:25.678
[music]

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:28.548
Texas has more White-tailed deer
than any other state

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:31.946
but only about 15% of the herd
is harvested every year.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.688
[Hunter] If you feel the center....

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.925
The way you handle the meat in the
field greatly influences the taste.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:43.030
If handled correctly, you can avoid
any unpleasant gamey flavor.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:49.268
I think the best way to store venison
is to vacuum seal it in plastic bags

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:51.371
for the freezer.

00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:54.700
So I've taken this off the grill,

00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:57.143
let it rest for about 10 minutes.

00:02:57.146 --> 00:02:58.545
It's nice and tender.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.811
Looks great.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.215
I'm going to slice it
thinly like this,

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.850
still pink on the inside.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.686
I'm going to make a really simple
sauce to go with this now,

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:09.923
just horseradish cream sauce.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:13.191
I'm going to start with a little
sour cream or creme fraiche

00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:16.663
and to that I'm going to add
a little bit of horseradish.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.998
I'm going to start with
about a tablespoon,

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:21.963
maybe a little bit more
if you like it pretty hot.

00:03:22.276 --> 00:03:23.936
Mix that in there.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:30.143
I'm going to add a little lemon juice,
a little bit of lemon zest,

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:34.480
and some chopped chives.

00:03:34.543 --> 00:03:36.081
You could also use chopped parsley.

00:03:37.763 --> 00:03:39.085
Mix all that up.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.556
This is a great simple sauce that
goes really well with grilled venison.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.860
I've also got some grilled
vegetables to go with this,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.161
perfect, simple meal.

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:50.930
[music]

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.900
This is it. This is the culmination
of the entire process,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.898
the hunt, all that preparation,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.838
butchering, preparing this.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:00.473
This is my favorite part.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:04.076
