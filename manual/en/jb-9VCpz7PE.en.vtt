hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.230
your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to make pound cake

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.859
what is pound cake? Usually there is a tin for a pound cake because when the cake

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.039
is done it weighs pound, that's around 450 grams so we're going to use

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.680
all equal quantities of hundred grams of
butter and in this add hundred grams of

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.079
powdered sugar and we're going to cream
it till it is nice and smooth

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.960
once this sugar and butter creams, in
this add some vanilla essence and 3 eggs now

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.850
we're going to again run the machine
so that this mixture get nicely mixed

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.609
now add pinch of baking powder to the
flour even the flour what we have taken

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.750
is 100 gram and put this flour also
into the machine

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.799
you know this is a very easy recipe you know nowadays they make hundred

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.260
grams and when the cake is done it is a
pound cake but traditionally they used

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.460
to take pound of each ingredient and
they used to make a cake which is quite

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.270
big and now just mix all of these
ingredients now look at this; this is one

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.500
of the easiest cake methods and when it
is done this will raise and you'll get a
