00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.040
How to Make a Wind Vane.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.230
Make a simple wind vane, and you'll soon be
able to amaze others with your ability to

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.240
forecast weather.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.940
You will need 2 paper plates Scissors Poster
board Plastic straw Straight pin Pencil with

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:29.000
new eraser Modeling clay Glue Compass Crayons
(optional) and styrofoam plate (optional).

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.190
Step 1.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.190
Write the four directions -- east, west, north
and south -- equally spaced along the outer

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.140
edges of an inverted paper plate.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.989
Make the project personal by decorating the
plate with crayons.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.219
Step 2.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.589
Use scissors to cut an arrow point and an
arrow tail from poster board, making each

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.049
about 2 inches in length.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.100
Cut the shapes from a Styrofoam plate if poster
board is unavailable.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.489
Step 3.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.129
Make small slits at each end of the straw
using scissors.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.399
Step 4.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.100
Place one of the poster board shapes into
a slit at each end of the straw to create

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.100
an arrow.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.570
This will later point to the direction the
wind is blowing.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.030
Step 5.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.890
Insert a straight pin through the center of
the straw, and then into the eraser tip of

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.470
the pencil, making sure to leave ample space
for spinning at the upper and lower sides

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.550
of the straw.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.350
Step 6.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.460
Set the pencil by pushing its point through
the center of the paper plate, and then sticking

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.610
it into a lump of modeling clay serving as
a base.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.770
Test the wind vane by gently blowing it.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.030
Step 7.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.270
Place the structure on a second paper plate,
and then glue the plates together with the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.930
clay mound inside.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.090
Step 8.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.530
Move the wind vane outdoors after the glue
dries, and then align the directions using

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.710
a compass.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.470
Watch the arrow go to work!

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.550
By learning what type of weather is associated
with wind directions in your area, it's a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.300
breeze to forecast conditions.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.640
Did you know As of 2008, Dodge City, Kansas,
was the windiest city in the United States.
