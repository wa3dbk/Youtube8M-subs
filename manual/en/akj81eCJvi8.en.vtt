[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.490
GIRL: "Full Time Kid," with Mya.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.475
[LAUGHS]

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.840
Hi, I'm Mya, and I
love Valentine's Day.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.840
This year I want to do something
cool for my friends and family,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.360
so I made my very own
candy Valentine hearts.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.790
And now I'm going to teach
you how you could do the same.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.270
Here's what you'll need.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.470
A mixer, some gloves, a
rolling pin, a rubber spatula,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.330
two pounds of powdered sugar
or confectioner's sugar,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.770
two teaspoons of
unflavored gelatin,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.750
some vanilla extract,
some food coloring,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.840
some heart-shaped fondant
or cookie cutters,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.850
one tablespoon of corn
syrup, one measuring cup,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.920
one half cup of water, some
decorating pens, one teaspoon,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.140
a cookie tray, a
saucepan, and an adult.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.500
First, with an adult, mix
the corn syrup, gelatin,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.650
and water in a small saucepan.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.030
Place on medium heat for
about 30 seconds to a minute,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.320
stirring until the gelatin
is completely dissolved.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.362
Now, pour the
mixture into a mixer.

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:06.000
MYA (VOICEOVER):
And with the mixer

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.145
on low, add the powdered
sugar one cup at a time.

00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:11.806
Sprinkle some powdered sugar
over your work surface.

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:14.506
Now, using a spatula
or your hands,

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:17.116
scoop all the dough
onto your work surface.

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:19.912
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:24.335
MYA (VOICEOVER): Knead
the dough in the sugar.

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:27.520
Fold it, turn it, push
it, and push it real good.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.925
Right now I'm rolling
the dough into a ball

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:31.550
so it'll be easier
when I flatten it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.790
out with my rolling pin.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.690
Now, with your dough, make a
tiny little well in the center,

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.070
and knead the dough in
about 1 teaspoon of vanilla

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.876
and a few drops of
your favorite color.

00:01:42.876 --> 00:01:44.375
When the dough is
the perfect color,

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.770
use the rolling pin
under some powdered sugar

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.105
to flatten out the hearts.

00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:51.070
Then cut hearts from the rolled
dough with your fondant cutter.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.672
Push out.

00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:56.774
Push on the tray.

00:01:56.774 --> 00:01:58.232
If you're running
out of space, you

00:01:58.232 --> 00:02:03.386
could fold it over, like
this, and roll it again

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:05.572
so you can create more heats.

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:07.030
Now that we have
all these cut out,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.570
we're going to leave them
to dry for about 24 hours.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.240
See you tomorrow.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.610
Once you've let your hearts
dry for about 24 hours,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.200
it's time to write on them.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.720
Try to use edible markers
because your Valentine's

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.160
going to be eating these soon.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.576
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:32.710
Let's taste these.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.080
Mmm!

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.260
These are good.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.690
Your friends are surely
going to like this.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.015
I hope you liked making
these candy hearts with me.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:43.890
Tell me what you're
write on your candy heart

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.430
in the comments below.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.230
Bye.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.740
(MUMBLING) Happy
Valentine's Day.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.560
(SINGING) Sprinkling the
powdered sugar on the counter.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.560
It's really, really messy,
but I don't know what to say.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.916
You can also ask an adult
for help on this step.

00:02:57.916 --> 00:03:00.296
Which obviously I need.

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:03.890
I want to keep doing surgery
on the man, on the dough--

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.650
the dough man.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.290
It's a heart!

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.080
