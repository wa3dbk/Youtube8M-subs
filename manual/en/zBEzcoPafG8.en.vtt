00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.259
We've got these wood panel doors.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.760
and they are drying out and I don't know if you can see but

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.930
you can see there are cracks.  See the light through the cracks?  The panels are drying out

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.279
and down there

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.369
so what I am going to do is fill those

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.010
cracks.  The technique works for painted doors but probably won't work if it has clear varnish on it

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.520
but you can see one (crack) here

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.789
where I've done it in the past

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.269
I'm going to use a technique that boat
builders use and

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.469
take a natural fiber string

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.469
put wood glue on it and pack it
in the crack

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.120
so

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.290
the first thing is to clean the crack out

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.070
the door was put together with multiple panels and they used some kind of

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.640
filler

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.250
and I need to get all that filler out of there.  I have been working on it 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.010
will utility knife and then cleaned it out
with

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.540
hacksaw blade.  It's whatever will fit in there to clean it out

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.640
and get clean wood surfaces on each side of the crack

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.680
the next step is to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.060
use a plain piece of natural fiber string

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.050
this is a ball of string I got for around a quarter

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.450
You want to make the string a little longer at the top and bottom

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.310
so you have something to hold on to.  I am going to dip the string  

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.220
in to white wood glue

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.280
and then I'm going to pack it in here.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.390
You want the string a little longer at the top because you need to hold on to it.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.390
Otherwise you will start pulling the string down as you pack it

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.869
and you will leave a gap at the top.  So you leave a bit out, hang on to it as you 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.890
pack it in there

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.929
usually I use the back of the knife to pack it.

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.679
this door is going to take 2 strings, 1 on top the other.  The only trick here

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.970
you don't want to push the string all the way through to the other side of the door.  You don't want

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.770
it sticking out the other side of the door.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.340
You can see where it is done.  

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.330
I've gotten this part in there.  It's not consistent yet.  I've switched to a flat bladed

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.640
screwdriver because I found it's tip fits the crack

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.130
much better.  If you use something too narrow it tries to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.940
pop all the way through.  If you use something too wide it won't go in there

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.780
This tool happened to turn
out to be the best choice

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.010
and of course it has to be cleaned up when I'm finished.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.030
You can see it's going in there.  Have lots of wet rags for 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.370
cleaning up excess glue.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.370
I'll continue on and show you when it's done.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.530
A sidenote here, when you are doing this, the crack is not the same width all the way

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.270
it can go from wider to narrower

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.989
crack

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.160
what you can do control the width of the string is to twist or untwist it to make it thinner or wider

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.880
If you twist it tighter, it gets narrower.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.420
if you untwist it, it gets fatter.  You can use that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.890
technique as you go along.  Tighter and 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.890
loser as needed.  If the string is just too wide for the crack 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.610
you can untwist and remove one of the sub-parts of the string.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.610
This string has 3 sub-parts and you can remove 1 or 2 to make it fit the crack better.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.890
I finished putting in the string

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.810
and I've gone back through and I

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.250
held my fingers on the screwdriver at
a particular distance

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.360
from the tip and gone back over and push
the string in to a consistent dept all the way

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.710
along, so that I have got room for another
string in there

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.760
I've also checked the outside to make
sure that

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.570
the a string has not poked through on the back side.  It has not.  

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.650
That's a good thing.  Also you want to make sure that these panels are still flat

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.510
You don't want to push the panels out of flatness while you are working.  

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.580
If you do, you just push them back in place before the glue sets.  

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.620
Once the glue sets 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.770
they will stay in place.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.510
This side is pretty much done.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.830
Once this is caulked and painted you have an airtight watertight seal.  

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.150
OK, so that's it for now.  I will

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.150
show you when the second string is in there.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.630
The second string is in.  Same process at the first.  

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.420
Lay the string down.  Push it in.  Make
sure it is at a 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.610
consistent depth.  Make sure it is
below the surface of the wood

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.050
that way when you caulk (or putty and hide the crack altogether) it

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.780
You need to have some space in there

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.960
to get the caulking or putty in there.  Make sure the string is at a consistent depth.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.680
Make sure your panels are still flat, that you have not pushed them out of flat

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.300
and then clean it up, trim off the end up
here

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.060
I'll use a knife and trim off the end.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.120
That is pretty much it.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.530
From here, you caulk it (or putty it) and paint it and you're done.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.620
Hope you found this useful.
