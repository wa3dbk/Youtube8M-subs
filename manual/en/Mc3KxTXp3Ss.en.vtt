00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.080
What do you think you're doing?

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.960
Nothing.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.300
I was... Just gonna put these DVDs away,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.320
I thought this might be the... the closet?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.060
Why don't you let me take care of those for you.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.280
Why don't you let him take care of those for you.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.100
Okay?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.780
Hey

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.160
I just had this really weird conversation with Gus.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.960
Oh yeah?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.540
He's probably hitting on you.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.740
Wouldn't be offended by that it was bound to happen eventually.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.380
What? No-

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.040
I just saying. I mean you're a good looking guy.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.380
That kind of thing happens to good looking guys.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.180
I really wouldn't know about it.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.880
No no no I'm not-

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.120
Look, you're not "good looking" good looking I'm just saying, you know?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.860
You have that crazy accent.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.780
That goes a long way.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.560
Plus you have that weird-ass Euro haircut.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.100
My hair's not- Look that's not what I'm saying.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.160
And I don't think Gus is-

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.980
Look it doesn't even matter.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.720
What's weird was that I was going in that door-

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.460
What door?

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.720
That one over there. The closet or whatever it is.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.460
Why would you go in that door? You don't need to go in that door.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.280
Why?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.940
There's nothing back there for you. You don't need to go back there.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.140
Trust me.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.260
You're hiding something in there aren't you?

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.360
In where?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.860
In there! Behind that door you won't let me go in!

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.860
That's crazy talk.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.520
Yeah, totally crazy.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520
Fucking Looney Tunes.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.360
Alright, now I'm positive you're definitely hiding something.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.720
What are you, are you like, trying to start a conspiracy theory or something like that?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.500
You been talking to Matt again haven't you?

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.280
Black helicopters.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.320
Google it.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.220
Seriously, what could we possibly be hiding?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.480
I always just figured Burnie would be hiding sandwiches?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.220
Hey!

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.580
Geoff probably some sort of illegal booze, right?

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.820
Hey! Moonshine is legal in three states.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.240
Gus probably some WOW-themed porn.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.100
World of Whorecraft is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.680
I'm gonna tell you something,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.140
and I want you to listen to me

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.500
and I want you to understand me.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.740
There is nothing secret behind that door.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.160
There is nothing in that room

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.020
that you should be suspicious about at all.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.900
Nothing.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.540
Nothing.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.680
Nothing.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.580
Oh! OH! Oh my-

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.580
We warned you.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.860
AHAHH CHRIST

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.860
You shouldn't have come here.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.980
You shouldn't have seen this.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.400
Wh- What the hell is going on in there?!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.940
Who are they?!

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.760
Well they're you of course.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.980
We had you cloned.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.820
Cloned?!

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.160
*muffled screams*

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.660
Why?

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.020
Uh, because we needed more of you?

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.520
I don't understand why would you do that?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.540
Perhaps you shouldn't be asking yourself why,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.000
perhaps you should ask yourself, "Am I the original Gavin?"

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.400
"Or is the original Gavin somewhere in there?"

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.200
Am I the original?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.860
Yeah. You are. I'm just fucking with you.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.080
But you found a way to clone me! How?

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.780
Craigslist.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.980
You can find anything on there.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.560
See your first clone figured out what happened so we had to throw him in there.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.520
Then your second clone, he figured out what happened too so we had to throw him in there.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.560
Then your third clone- Well you get the idea, we threw them all in there.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.680
You guys are really bad at keeping this a secret from me.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.960
If you think we're bad at keeping secrets you should see Geoff try to kill a clone.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.180
They scream so loud, it's distracting.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.680
Why are you always so curious about closed doors?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.040
Don't they have those in Britain?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.080
But there's- there's so many of me?!

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.140
Is that Ben?

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.500
Dear God help me!

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.400
Oh that is Ben.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.800
I was wondering what happened to him.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.680
Where am I?!

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.580
Yeah we can't really tell you guys apart cause you both have that same pompous-ass British accent.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.400
I can't even tell what you're saying half the time.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.960
What are you talking about, we don't sound anything alike. I'm from Oxford he's from Nottingham.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.680
They're totally distinct accents!

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.460
Exactly.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.460
Yeah... Seriously, not a word.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.320
It's like you're doing a scene out of Lord of the Rings right now.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.660
I just want to go home and see my mummy!

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.880
You're not gonna get away with this.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.680
Hahahahahahahaha

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.240
Why do the clones always say the same thing?

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.500
Gav we already have gotten away with it.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.920
You never bothered to read the Terms and Conditions on the website, did you?

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.160
That's not fair, nobody reads those!

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.780
Well we also put some pretty major hints in your image gallery.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.140
Oh my God I've always wondered where those came from.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.820
Yeah we took those on one of the free weekends we do like every six months. It helps keep the clones limber.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.600
And from joining Scientology.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.540
You're not gonna put me in there right though?

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.600
Please, don't put me in there. I beg you, don't put me in that room.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.720
Well we can't put you in the attic!

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.420
That's where all the Gus clones are that haven't finished their hypnotherapy.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.300
Wait, the what?

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.280
Sleep!

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.360
Okay everyone, get back to work.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.860
Alright.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.600
No no no no no

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.640
You're not gonna put me in that room, I beg you, please, don't put me in that room!

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.100
What'd he say?

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.080
I think he said "I'm totally cool with this, go ahead and throw me in."

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.840
No, guys don't-

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.200
Yeah, see, all I heard was something about finding "The One Ring."

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.180
Geoff! Don't do this! Don't put me- Jesus!

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.120
Gandalf!

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.860
Oh fuck!

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.280
We need to keep the original out here so we can make another clone!

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.400
Oh right gotta go from the source otherwise the copy DNA gets bad.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.660
Which one is the original again? They all look the same.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.400
How 'bout that one right there.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.400
Uh yeah, he'll do.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.220
Wha?!

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.260
I'm not the one you want, really!

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.680
Yeah it's definitely this one. Get a load of that goofy accent!

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.780
Hahahahahahahaha

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.240
Mordor...

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.260
*indiscernible British sniveling*

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.760
Okay, guys.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.260
*Harry Potter, Help me!*

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.180
*Harry Potter, Help me!*
If any of you guys finds a sandwich in here tonight, it's mine, okay?

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.120
If any of you guys finds a sandwich in here tonight, it's mine, okay?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.560
If I find out that even one of you takes a bite of it...

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.880
I will gut the FUCKING LOT OF YOU YOU BRITISH FUCKING SKANKS!

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.580
Okay. See you guys tomorrow, okay?
