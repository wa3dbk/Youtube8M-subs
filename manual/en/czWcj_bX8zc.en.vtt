00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.540
Youtubers, Frankieseshy here. Today we're looking at a very common problem you

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.529
might encounter while plugging in a pair
of headphones

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.300
or speakers into your computer.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.310
So the problem goes like this: you're
sitting at your computer

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.680
listening to a creepy story with your
speakers, but then all of a sudden

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.859
someone comes into the room and starts washing dishes. The sounds so loud and distracting

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.310
it totally kills the vibe. So you decide to switch over to your headphones.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.230
You plug your headphones in, and... Nothing. You're still hearing sound from your speakers.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.190
So now you're here watching this video totally pissed and trying to fix the problem.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.190
I've been there before so I'll make this
quick.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.140
When I use the computer I constantly switch from my speakers

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.080
to my headphones. If you like me you'll
soon run into this problem.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.210
Why this is happening? Well, its because
your computer's instructed to output audio

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.190
only to your speakers first. Because the
speakers are the default audio output

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.830
device.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.650
And since you can't output audio to
two devices simultaneously on Windows 7

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.930
it outputs audio only to the default
device: your speakers.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.930
So now we know what the problem is. How do we fix it?

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.610
We can unplug audio output devices

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.120
from the PC and plug in only the one you want to use. I'm not a huge fan of this solution

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.440
though because it can get pretty mettlesome having to do all of that unplugging everytime

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.670
here's another method and probably the
most convenient:

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.920
Try this: Plug in all of your audio devices
that you want to use on your PC.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.010
That can include microphones, speakers,
and headphones.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.130
Now anytime you want to listen to your
speakers, open your playback devices

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.010
and select your speakers as the default
device by right-clicking the device and

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.860
selecting "set as default device". If you don't see that option on the drop down menu,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.290
it's possible that that device is already
the default device.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.380
Upon selecting the default device, Windows will automatically save it and you won't

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.600
have to select it again.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.540
If you would like to change from
listening to your speakers to listen to

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.420
your headphones,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.830
simply repeat the process by selecting
your headphones as the default device this time.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.810
I don't use method either because I
don't always want my headphones plugged into my PC.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.840
I prefer to plug my headphones in only
when I'm going to use them.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.080
To do this I use a process of combining
the other two methods

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.879
Here's what I do most of the time:

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.660
I like to select my speakers as the
default device because that's what I use

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.390
about 75 percent in time,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.989
then when I want to use my headphones, I
shut my speakers off

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.620
and wait a second or two so Windows can recognize the device is no longer

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.400
connected.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.110
Then, I plug in my headphones. Since the
default device is powered down, it will

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.670
instead output sound to the next device in
line:

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.350
my headphones.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.940
Unfortunately, you have to be very
careful with the audio devices on Windows 7.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.410
The Windows Audio service has a ton of problems that
I have made a bunch of videos on myself.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.260
It wasn't made very convenient to change which
device you'd like to listen to you.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.640
And a lot of these procedures should
have been automatic, and should work a lot more

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.460
seamlessly.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.650
It may be bothersome to deal with but
it's not impossible.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.850
So there you go, it's really quite a
simple process.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.830
The only thing that can get a little
tricky is knowing which device on the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.570
playback devices list is which

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.570
and here's what I mean:

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.420
Here you can see I have many devices to choose
from.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.659
The VX238 is my monitor, if I select that
as my default device, sound will output from my

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:59.299
monitor.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.760
Also, my monitor has a 3.5mm
headphone jack,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.680
so if I plug my headphones into that and
select the monitor as the default device,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.810
Windows will output sound to my monitor
and my monitor will output sound to my

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.580
headphones.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.430
So basically, I can hear through my headphones
by plugging them into my monitor, and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.570
selecting my monitor as the default device.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.940
Similarly, I can do the same thing with
my Blue Yeti microphone.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.860
If I plug my headphones into it and
select the mic as the default device,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.479
I'll hear audio from my headphones. If
your device is disabled,

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.690
right-click it and select "Enable". If you
do not see your device on the playback

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.690
devices list,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.860
right-click and make sure "show disabled
devices"

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.660
is selected. Don't forget to re-enable
the disabled device.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.650
If you still cannot see your device on the list, there may be a problem with the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.650
driver.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.220
To fix this: Click "start",

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.700
"control panel", and then select "Device
Manager". Head over to

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.170
"sound and video game controllers" and on
uninstall your audio device.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.860
In this case "high-definition audio
device". (The AMD device is a third-party

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.740
device is not related to this guide).

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.940
Right-click "high definition audio device"
and select

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.830
"uninstall". The device will now uninstall
and it will reinstall upon restarting your PC.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.700
If the device experiences a problem while
reinstalling and fails to install the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.370
new driver,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.770
check out another video on my channel
that deals with specific driver related

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.000
issues by clicking the annotation here,

or find the link in the description.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.290
Keep in mind that this is the best case scenario.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.640
This is assuming that all devices and software are
functioning properly.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.090
If you followed my directions and
understood them, but you still cannot hear

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.670
sound from the correct device,

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.210
or can't hear anything for that matter, you
should take a look at another video from

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.990
my channel that can help you diagnose your
audio issues with your Windows 7 PC
