he also built second hearings and it
promotes the RSS feed entries

insures our link since indications get

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.410

so much more that takes place in the

background

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.140
which will talk to you about in a moment
but first

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.340
let me log into my account and show you
around while trying to explain further

through

your attention is the list of supported

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.440
connections

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.239

at the system supports

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.760
and each time a user joins a system and
adds an account

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.670
that account then gets placed in a pool
of available accountants

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.680
these accounts then become available for
all users on the system to benefit from

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.970
this means uses that join the system

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.500
and at one of each account actually get
thousands of accounts

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.580
open to them ready to publish the
content

private network of social media accounts

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.360

social accounts ready to promote
