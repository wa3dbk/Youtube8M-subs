00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.070
Angelo State University manages a major financial
aid program that provides assistance to 3

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.750
out of 4 of our students. With strong gift
aid support, including the Carr Scholarship

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.470
program, ASU students graduate with one of
the nation's lowest average debt burdens.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.950
The Carr Scholarship, which is unique to ASU,
is one of the largest endowments at a regional

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.020
university in the United States. Over the
past 30 years it has aided over 28,000 students

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.780
in attending Angelo State.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.320
"This scholarship has allowed me to do so much.
I've been able to spend time that I would have

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.140
spent having to work in the study hall studying.
My GPA was a 4.0 last semester."

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.760
"One of the main things this scholarship has
done for me personally is I don't have to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.490
work as much as I would have. It's really
helped clear that financial burden off my

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.390
shoulders so that I can be more involved on
campus, especially with student organizations."

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.240
