00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.509
Robot Voice: Two-Ingredient Takeover.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.950
Alyssia: Welcome to Mind Over Munch Two-Ingredient
Takeover, where I make delicious desserts

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.449
out of two simple ingredients.

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.040
This week I'll be making my two-ingredient
cake.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:27.540
Can you guess what the two ingredients are?
Cake mix and carbonated water.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.530
You can sub soda or carbonated water for all
of the oil and eggs.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.020
A fraction of the calories and fat, and you'll
never know the difference.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.460
In a large mixing bowl, add cake mix, and
carbonated water.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.379
I am using peach mango flavor but you can
use any flavor you'd like or plain.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.789
Mix to combine.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.420
Pour the mix into your cake pan or pans that
have been floured and sprayed.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.179
I'm using two smaller circles for the top
and bottom layer.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.680
Place in an oven pre-heated to 325 degrees
Fahrenheit for about 18 minutes or according

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.350
to package directions.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.250
Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely
before frosting.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.640
Today I'm going all out with chocolate.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.360
Then place the next layer on top and ice completely.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.100
Robot Voice: Ingredient spotlight

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.840
Alyssia: Just like my two-ingredient brownies,
this recipe uses a box mix.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.360
Now again, I know box mixes have their nutritional
drawbacks but this is a great way to lighten

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.550
up your cake when you just don't have time
for homemade.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.640
Using a carbonated water instead of oil and
eggs cuts back over 50 calories and 7 grams

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.590
of fat per slice.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.390
Say whaaa?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.490
Soda cake for the win.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.450
And there you have it.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.390
Two ingredients, one delicious recipe.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.350
