00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.210
Hi there. Welcome to the Morning Shred brought to you by snowboards.com. I'm Jenna. I've got Levi

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.300
from Burton. We've got the Burton Rampant Boot. So, Levi, couple

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.390
different things going on with this boot. A lot of value for the price. Tell me about it.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.540
Yeah, this is actually one of my favorite boots in the entire line. I can

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.680
pick whatever boot I want and this, often times, is the one I gravitate toward

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.790
just 'cause it's a great mix of comfort and performance

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.830
and awesome for a guy that's riding a lot of freestyle terrain

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.980
so couple things that help set this apart from

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.100
any other boot out there is going to be the fact that it's got

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.190
what we call a Cross Bone Tech which, it's got an articulating cuff on the inside.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.260
And, actually, a little carbon rod stitched on the outside.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.390
So, you can flex inward where you want that flex to grab your board and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.480
tweek out any grabs or anything like that but then when you're leaning 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.560
into a press or leaning into a turn you've got the support on the outside of the boot so

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.590
kind of that support where you need it

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.710
and...
Flex where you need it too?
Yep, flex where you need it so,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.800
also this boot has the Imprint 2 Liner which, compared to the Imprint 1,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.860
which is on lower end boots, it's going 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.990
to actually have a cuff that links this liner down into the shell so it makes them become more

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.080
of a single unit really, gives you more of a heel hold in this boot.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.160
Also, something kind of unique to this boot is the fact that we

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.240
use these webbing loops down here right

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.350
at the ankle point there and the nice thing about using those webbing loops

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.370
instead of these hooks is the fact that when you're running big asymmetrical ankle

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.420
straps like we do on a lot of our bindings, you're not going to have your

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.550
strap running into that hook so it takes away a 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.590
pressure point right there. Great all-around boot. One of the lightest

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.660
boots I've ever picked up. It's also got our EST Sole where

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.810
in bindings it also stands for Extra Sensory Technology and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.930
basically you can get more of a feel for what's going on underneath your foot.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.020
So, really awesome boot all around.
So, tell me about

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.070
Man Fur and Shrinkage.
Man Fur is going to be this

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.210
nice, soft little fur on the top of the boot

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.300
that just gives you that added little feel of nice plushness

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.400
when you're putting your foot in this thing. And then also this boot has what what we call

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.540
Shrinkage as well as many other boots in the Burton line. Shrinkage

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.680
is basically going to minimize the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.790
footprint of this boot and yet still

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.840
allow to go into smaller bindings and kind of cut down on weight

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.990
so say this boot is a size nine,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.100
it actually would have the footprint of most other company's size eight

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.210
just because of the way we actually shape this boot and minimize

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.400
all the materials on it so...
Cool. You can fit into a smaller binding like you said and...great.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.570
All right, well make sure to check out the Burton Rampant on snowboards.com

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.610
and thanks for watching the Morning Shred.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.660
 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.380
