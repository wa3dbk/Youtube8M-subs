00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.260
Today we are going to install part number
65043 from Draw Tite and we are going to install

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.990
this on a 2006 Ford F150.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.429
This will be a front mounted hitch.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.089
Our hitch will install on the inside of the
frame.

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.839
It will use existing holes that are in here.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.000
The holes that will be used in the frame will
be the square hole here and this round hole

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.609
up here, that is sometimes covered by this
balance right here.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.029
We can start by actually holding up the hitch
into position.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.020
This is a good one to have an extra set of
hands for.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.720
It goes on the inside of the frame and there
are 2 notches on there to keep it a little

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.020
bit higher or a little bit lower depending
on clearance with your bumper.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:52.750
It is a good idea to install your hitch as
close as possible then install your hardware.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.280
In this case we have the hitch install in
the lowest position.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.860
That should give you an idea of what kind
of clearance you can expect.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:06.860
Once you have your bolts installed you can
go ahead and install your hardware.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.310
You still want to leave it loose because you
might have to move your hitch back and forth

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.200
for the rest of the hardware.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.409
Again we will install our hardware from the
outside in to the square hole.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:26.899
Also this plate goes in between the hitch
and the bolt.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:39.140
We can go ahead and put the rest of our hardware
on there.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.369
Again just repeat the same thing for the other
side.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:54.350
All that remains at this point is to tighten
down all of our fasteners.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:24.940
Once you have them snugged down we will go
ahead and give them their final torque.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:03:09.790
One other thought is if you want to put it
up on the higher setting which would bring

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.900
it up about another inch you can actually
cut out the finishing here a little bit to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.570
give you a little more ground clearance.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.410
Obviously you can do something similar for
the loops at the end.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.790
There you have it for our install of part
number 65043 from Draw Tite.
