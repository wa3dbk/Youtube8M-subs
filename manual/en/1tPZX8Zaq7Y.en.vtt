Hi, thank you for visiting expertvillage.com.
My name is Yvette Parish, I’m a flamenco

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.309
instructor and we’re going to be talking
about mantons today, the different sizes and

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.280
how to use them. There’s some few basic
rules with mantons when you pick them out

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.730
you can call them shawls or piano shawls,
they come in all different sizes. This one

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.599
is about an average size manton and as you’ve
seen its cut in a triangular way with pretty

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.410
fringe on the bottom. You can get them in
any color, any kind of embroidery, some do

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.070
not have embroidery, some have very long fringe
or short but this is about a typical manton

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.160
that you’ll see for about the average armed
and size dancer. The longer you are and the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.390
longer arms you have and the longer the reach,
the longer manton you’ll need. I am a petite

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.080
dancer about 5 foot 2 and I prefer a little
bit of a smaller manton but I want to show

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.770
you some other sizes that you can get. This
is a little bit of a longer if you can see

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.810
how pretty that is it’s much longer and
you see even on my arm length it’s even

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.530
a little bit long for me. So if you’re 5’4,
5’7, 5’8, I’d go ahead and get a longer

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.350
manton it’ll be easier for you to handle,
the longer the arm the longer the manton so

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.710
you can remember it that way and of course
once you become an expert you can use any

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.770
size. This is a full size manton this one
came from Spain it’s a beautiful size. This

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.429
one is cut in a square so you can see it’s
just a beautiful, beautiful piece of work,

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.210
a piece of art really. You can wear it as
part of your costume, you can hang it up behind

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.869
you as far as a decorative piece but a lot
of dancers use this during the routine. You’d

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.819
fold it to make it a triangle and you’d
use it the same way you would the other manton

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.000
and of course you can wear it as well. So
it really depends what size, what budget you

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.500
have, this runs about an average of about
$300 for a full size and then you can get

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.920
them as economical of $20. So it really depends
how you’re going to use it, how long your

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.080
arms are and how much you want to invest in
them.
