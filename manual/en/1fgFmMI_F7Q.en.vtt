Hi guys, my name is Disha Khanna

00:00:02.273 --> 00:00:06.833
I'll be showing you a very cool DIY on how to make a bag out of a t-shirt!

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:11.600
Now, I'm sure you all have that one t-shirt that you all don't use but still don't wanna get rid of!

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.380
So, let's see what we can do with it!

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.280
All you need is a t-shirt, a ruler,

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:25.628
a thread &amp; a needle

00:00:25.628 --> 00:00:27.883
scissors, a marker, measuring tape,

00:00:27.964 --> 00:00:28.764
and an iron!

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:33.261
Starting with the T-shirt, make sure it's flat on the surface...

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:37.574
Now, if you can see these creases, make sure they are flat, so...

00:00:37.652 --> 00:00:39.272
we're gonna iron it!

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:47.176
Now turn the t-shirt &amp; fold it into half

00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:50.685
Make sure the edge is right on top of the other

00:00:52.277 --> 00:00:57.397
Whatever shape of the bag you need, just mark it on the t-shirt &amp; then cut it off

00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:12.351
This is gonna be the top of my bag

00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:15.634
These are gonna be the sides, so either you can stitch it...

00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:19.434
or you can glue it. What I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna glue it, because

00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:20.777
it's faster &amp; easier

00:01:20.777 --> 00:01:23.941
I'm gonna mark half an inch &amp; eye-ball it all around...

00:01:24.107 --> 00:01:26.107
and I'm gonna start sticking!

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.400
Now I'm gonna place this cloth...

00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:09.734
horizontally! To cut the slits, I'm going to...

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.260
...fold my cloth along the slit horizontally...

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.880
all I'm gonna do is make half cuts, because since it's turned it's gonna cut both the sides...

00:02:30.773 --> 00:02:34.053
Now what we're gonna do is again, fold it into half

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.320
and just make one line a mark for your handle

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.200
This becomes your handle!

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.960
Now, the most interesting &amp; fun part about this bag is gonna be stretching it!

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.700
So all we gonna do is stretch it!

00:02:49.638 --> 00:02:51.238
So when we stretch it...

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.040
these slits wrinkle up, curl...&amp; it looks really good!

00:02:58.034 --> 00:03:00.354
Okay! And last but not the least...

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.240
turn it inside out

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.520
and your bag is done!

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.480
Do not wash the bag with hot water if you use glue

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.680
If you stitched it, it's okay to use any kind of water.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.474
So this, I think, weighs around 2 kilograms.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.440
So you can carry books to college in this..

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.000
Anything that weighs unto 2KGs, or maybe 2.53 will also do!!

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.800
