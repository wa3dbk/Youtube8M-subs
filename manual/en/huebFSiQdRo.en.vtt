00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.950
This is our grand tour bag. A very, very popular
bag. As you can see it’s shaped very nice,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:29.580
it’s got some large outside pockets. Got
a front pocket here and to open this bag you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.500
simply unzip here, get to it from the top,
it’s got a lot of room in here as you can

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.430
see. It’s got a storage section up here
that’s closed off to this top section here,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.870
so whatever you put in the top does not get
lost down in this bottom section.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.750
It’s got a little pocket net here to put
some stuff for convenience as well.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.510
To attach the grandtour without a backrest
if you do not have a passenger and you do

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.100
not have a backrest you’re able to tie it
down to the backseat by doing a few things

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.100
with your backseat.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.860
First of all, you have to take your screw
out of your backseat. You then are going to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.409
take this leather piece that’s separated--and
the reason it’s separated is because you

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.460
need to adjust it in different ways for skinny
or wide backseats. The skinnier the backseat

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.549
the closer you need to bring this to itself,
the wider the backseat, the further apart.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.950
You do want these d-rings, once you bring
it under here, right underneath your seat.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.189
So this is a skinny backrest so we’re going
to adjust it pretty much all the way.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.210
And you’re going to pick up your backseat
and you’re going to slide that as most forward

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.270
as you can and then push your seat back down
and put your set-screw back in.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:01.139
During your trip you can leave it just like
this or you can take it in and out all the

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.139
time.

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:08.119
Once that’s done, take your bag with your
lumbar that you’re going to lean against

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.319
toward the front of your bike, set it on the
backseat, and you then want to take these

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:22.541
and criss-cross these to these d-rings underneath
and do that on both sides and you’re set

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:29.800
to go. It’s going to be a little wobbly
but once you sit on your bike and lean against

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.280
it it’s automatically going to tighten it
up.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.760
The grand tour bag also comes with this lumbar
pad for you to lean against when you are by

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.450
yourself. It is adjustable on your back, you
can put it low or high, wherever it’s most

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.730
comfortable, and once you get on your bike
to lean against it, you’re down the road.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.390
The grand tour bag also is able to mount on
the backseat if you have a backrest. It does

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:05.680
not require this leather under-the-seat mount.
Simply put it on your backseat with your lumbar

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.870
pad facing you so you’re able to lean against
it. Take two of the four straps that it does

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:19.240
come with and clip it to this bottom d-ring,
come underneath your pad, and back up to the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.420
top and snug it down. Do that on both sides
of the bag there and here and snug it down

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.280
and it will not go up or down or move sideways
and once you sit on your bike and lean against

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.020
it, you’re keeping it from moving as well.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.970
Now I’m going to show you how to secure
the grand tour bag to the luggage rack if

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.950
you do have a passenger. When you do have
a passenger you want to leave your lumbar

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.530
pad at home.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.970
Open up your universal back-rest strap, lay
it on your luggage rack, and close up on your

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.430
backrest strap.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.180
You have four tie-down straps here to secure
it to the bike when it’s on the luggage

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.180
rack.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.020
First, on both sides of the bag, you’re
going to clip to this front bottom d-ring,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:18.229
you’re going to go underneath your pad to
the top d-ring and cinch it down on both sides.

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.039
That’s going to keep your bag from rocking
back and forth while you’re going down the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:29.940
road. To keep it from moving left to right,
take your other two straps, buckle the front

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.340
bottom one and either go around your signal
lights to the back d-ring if you have signal

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.599
lights, if they are rubber-mounted signal
lights or you do not have signal lights, you

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:52.820
need to come forward around your back-rest
post to your back d-ring and cinch that down

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.840
on both sides.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.949
That keeps your bag from moving left to right.

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:02.370
The grand tour bag is very, very weatherproof
on its own but it also comes with a waterproof

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.919
rain cover for heavy, heavy storms.
