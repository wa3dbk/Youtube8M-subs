Sometimes, I'm asked to design logos. Certain
calligraphers are really great at designing

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.919
logos. May I mention one of my mentors, Raphael
Boguslav? You can check out his work just

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:19.380
by going to the internet. I can't really say
that I've had a zillion jobs doing logos,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.060
so I can't really say that I specialize in
it. I find that, as a calligrapher, there

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.239
are certain types of businesses that a hand
done logo works for. Obviously, obviously,

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.239
I'm going to do my own logo. And so, I would
call, you know, this is a trade card design.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.920
It winds up to be a little tiny thing like
this, of course. I wonder if you remember

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.670
in the beginning when I showed you that fancy
P from the Book of Kells? This is actually

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.670
a clever reference to that. Black, white and
gray. Can you see the black,white and gray

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:13.360
in this? Alright so, let me show you a few
other logos that I've done. There is a, an

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.070
absolutely magnificent patisseire chocolatere
gelatere in Mt. Kisco, New York, and it's

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.780
called La Tulipe Desserts, and I designed
their logo. And it is just an absolutely enchanting

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.860
place to visit with absolutely delicious pastries
and so on. And a logo like this, alright,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.580
winds up going on all kinds of things. So,
designing a logo has certain requirements

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.920
and one of them is that it's a design that
needs to go up and it needs to go down. And

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.500
it needs to get battered by different kinds
of media that might be taking it on. This

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:05.750
is an example of an advertisement that I did
for them when I first started. And you see

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.659
here's the logo.
