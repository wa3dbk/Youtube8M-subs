Hey guys this is Salah

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.980
Today, I'm going to show you how to set up
your Amcrest View mobile app

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.980
to work with your DVR so you can see your
cameras remotely

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.840
Before we begin, you want to make sure
that your router is connected to your

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.350
DVR 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.930
With an Ethernet Cable, like so.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.820
First thing you
want to do is, just left click

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.310
Open up the Main Menu here under:
"Settings" we're gonna find the network

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.500
icon, go ahead and click that and its gonna
start you off at the top left at TCP/IP, we need

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.290
to go down to "P2P"

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.239
you'll notice here that the status is
"Offline" because it's not

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.340
enabled so we can go ahead and check
Enable. P2P is

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.200
what's going to get your mobile app to talk
to your DVR, so

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.050
"Apply" and click "Save" and when we re-enter this page here you'll notice that

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.490
the status changes back to "Online"

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.160

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:10.390
