00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.830
For October 2013 this is CTA News in Review.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.860
Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Governor Pat Quinn, CTA
President Forrest Claypool, and city and state

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.380
officials, unveiled the new Red Line South,
one of the largest and most innovative transit

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.260
projects in the country, and a significant
investment in the ongoing modernization of

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.500
public transportation in Chicago.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.150
The CTA was the first transit agency in the
country to completely rip out and replace

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.151
such a large stretch of railroad in such a
tightly condensed period of time, and with

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:55.950
such an extensive alternative service plan,
a strategy that provided customers with a

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.070
better railroad in a shorter amount of time
while saving tax payer money.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.760
The 10.2 mile stretch was closed for five
months to rebuild the railroad and upgrade

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.580
8 stations along the rail line, which serve
dozens of communities along Chicago's south

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.750
side.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.750
The $425 million project, which created more
than 1500 jobs, many of which will continue

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.430
after the project ends, was completed on time
and within budget.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.590
The CTA has hired a construction manager for
the new Red Line 95th Street terminal at the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.540
95th Street Dan Ryan station through a process
designed to help insure timely, efficient

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.300
completion of the project, that promotes strong
participation from disadvantaged business

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.530
enterprise contractors.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.180
The $240 million project will expand and great
improve the 95th Dan Ryan terminal and bring

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.611
significant improvements to a bus and rail
station that is a vital part of the South

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:55.920
Side and serves about 20,000 customers each
week day.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.460
As part of the 95th Street terminal improvement
project, the Chicago Transit Authority has

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.000
tapped internationally recognized Chicago
based artist Theaster Gates to create the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.640
largest public art project in the agencies
history.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.750
As part of that effort, the CTA and Mr. Gates
will host a series of meetings to discuss

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.140
the historic artwork planned with members
of the communities near the 95th red line

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.160
terminal.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.909
To find out when and where the community meetings
will be held go to transitchicago.com.

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:34.330
CTA President Forrest Claypool proposed a
balanced $1.38 billion budget that maintains

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.030
transit service, and holds the line on customers
fares while continuing unprecedented investments

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.930
in projects and programs to improve service
and modernize regional transit.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.439
The budget reflects the positive impacts of
operational efficiency reforms by CTA management

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.709
to reduce wasteful spending and maintain day-to-day
operations more efficiently.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.540
The budget also includes the 1,000 customer
facing jobs the CTA created in 2013 to better

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.590
serve passengers.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.650
Furthering its efforts to upgrade technology
to benefit customers, the CTA will soon bring

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.409
faster and more reliable voice, data and web
services throughout its subways.

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.090
The CTA is seeking wireless telecommunication
companies to upgrade the existing wireless

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.709
network to 4G technology.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.349
This initiative is one of several efforts
by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and CTA President Forrest

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.599
Claypool to modernize infrastructure and make
the CTA a world class transit system.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.629
The Chicago Transit Board approved an agreement
with PNC Bank to install 65 new automated

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.010
teller machines in rail stations expanding
the number of ATM's already in CTA stations

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.469
and increasing convenience to customers.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.989
Under the agreement PNC will pay a fixed rate
amount of rent and a percentage of transaction

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.260
sales to the CTA and a monthly electric charge.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.709
The five year agreement is estimated to generate
$5.2 million.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.400
The Chicago Transit Board approved a plan
to begin permanently offering bus service

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.859
on the west end of the #35, 31st/35th Street
bus route after a yearlong service trial,

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.780
and the addition of new service on that route
to the 31st Street beach during the summer

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.780
months.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.290
These changes in service will improve public
transit options and connections for customers

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.700
on the cities south and southwest sides.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.770
