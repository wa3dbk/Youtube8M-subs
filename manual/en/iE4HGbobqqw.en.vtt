00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.296
This is Shakedown on DRIVE,
home for your auto racing

00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:02.806
info, analysis, opinion,
attitude,

00:00:02.806 --> 00:00:04.186
and dare I say, fun--

00:00:04.186 --> 00:00:05.516
Monday and Friday.

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:07.806
Monday's Shakedown is the
racing recap show.

00:00:07.806 --> 00:00:11.876
So today we close out the Dakar
Rally and the Dubai 24

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:14.496
and share some news about
2012 race cars.

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:17.086
And I finally was going to do my
Chris Harris joke that got

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:18.616
left out of an earlier show.

00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:21.226
But for logistic reasons, it's
not going to happen today

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:22.506
again, either.

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:25.096
See, we did an earlier Shakedown
comparing cornering,

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:26.616
drifting versus racing.

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:29.316
Then our DRIVE partner Chris
took it to Chris Harris

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:32.656
extremes with his space-saver
donut driving experiment.

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:34.146
So I had a comment.

00:00:34.146 --> 00:00:35.626
Well, maybe some day.

00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:37.566
But check out both
shows anyway.

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:41.246
In fact, just subscribe
to youtube.com/drive.

00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:44.326
So with no Chris Harris, I
scoured the news for a new

00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:45.986
story to start the show.

00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:49.036
Maybe something serious, like
an analysis of the new Lotus

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:52.016
F1 anti-dive front brake system
that's already this

00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:55.526
year's F-duct blown diffuser
tech spec to have.

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:56.136
No.

00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:58.956
But for sure, in a future
Shakedown when the F1 cars

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.736
debut in February,
we'll cover it.

00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:02.436
And then I found the story.

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:05.696
Danica Patrick is looking
for a NASCAR nickname.

00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:08.576
She likes Honey Badger, because
to quote Danica, "The

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:11.926
honey badger doesn't give a
crap, takes whatever he wants,

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:14.576
and that's how I'm going to be
going this year, like a honey

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:16.426
badger." Wow.

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:17.956
Shakedowners, we
can do better.

00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:21.386
So let's start the show with a
call for your suggestions for

00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:23.806
Danica's 2012 nickname.

00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:25.316
She deserves the
best creativity

00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:26.756
Shakedown can give her.

00:01:26.756 --> 00:01:27.926
Hey, I've got one.

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.429
Tim Tebow.

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:39.106
[CAR ENGINE]

00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:42.646
OK, speaking of name calling,
what do you call an engine bay

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.246
when it has no engine?

00:01:44.246 --> 00:01:47.716
Look at this, and tell me what's
going on with this car.

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:49.016
Figure it out?

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:52.096
It's the all-electric
Drayson Lola LMP.

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:54.246
And that's the battery pack
where the internal combustion

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.796
engine's supposed to be.

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:58.236
Drayson launched at the
Birmingham, England Autosport

00:01:58.236 --> 00:01:59.456
Racecar show.

00:01:59.456 --> 00:02:03.316
The car will race in the 2013
FIA Formula E world

00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:04.566
championship.

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:09.056
Four electric motors give it 640
kilowatt, 850 horsepower.

00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:12.516
Car with driver weighs
only 1,085 kilo.

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:16.206
60 miles an hour in three
seconds, 100 in five, a top

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:18.356
speed of 200 mile
an hour plus.

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:20.876
Three battery packs with
inductive charging.

00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:23.346
No plug-in, just roll onto
the charger plate,

00:02:23.346 --> 00:02:25.186
and it charges up.

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:30.106
Also at the Autosport show was
a Quimera AEGT electric.

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:32.276
Quimera and the American Le
Mans Series announced a

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:35.096
partnership to develop the
next generation of green

00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:38.316
motorsport, working together, as
the press release says, to

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:41.716
prepare investors, the public,
media, and sponsors for

00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:44.806
motorsports' impending embrace
of clean technology.

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:46.896
Translation, listen
up you cynical,

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:49.156
future-fearing bastards.

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:54.426
In 2012, the all-electric AEGT
is is, quote, "expected to

00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:59.636
make demo runs at select ALMS
races." By 2013, Quimera and

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:02.366
ALMS will launch an
international electric vehicle

00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:05.356
series they say will be
the first clean-tech

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:06.196
championship--

00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:09.596
well, other than the FIA Formula
E, unless both groups

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:13.196
are talking about the same
series and taking credit.

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:15.746
Then the PR gets more confused,
as it suggests the

00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:19.366
series will have a ton of car
classes, including open wheel,

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:23.136
a tie-in with TTXGP, the
electric bike series, and what

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.236
the hell, drifting.

00:03:25.236 --> 00:03:27.466
The only electric tech not
mentioned here are those

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:28.476
Trojan vibrators.

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:31.306
And I'm not going to
get into that.

00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:32.376
I don't want to have
this electric

00:03:32.376 --> 00:03:33.586
racing discussion now.

00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:36.416
But we're going to have to
in a future Shakedown.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.056
And I'm not against new tech.

00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:41.406
I'm loving all the Porsche,
Audi, Peugeot, Toyota-- all

00:03:41.406 --> 00:03:45.126
the hybrids coming to racing,
including this Prius race car

00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:48.486
for Japan Super GT,
the GT300 class.

00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:49.926
But what do you think?

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:53.086
Is green tech best showcased
racing itself in a separate

00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:56.716
series, or put up against the
current race cars and may the

00:03:56.716 --> 00:03:58.776
best tech win?

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:01.556
Hey, didn't I promise to do
a race recap news today?

00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:02.946
So here we go.

00:04:02.946 --> 00:04:04.026
Dakar finished.

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:05.106
MINI won.

00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:08.466
Stephane Peterhansel got his
10th Dakar win, his fourth car

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:10.986
victory following his
six motorcycle wins.

00:04:10.986 --> 00:04:13.795
And this was the first
Dakar for MINI.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.045
Stephane and MINI were in
control for most of the rally,

00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:17.876
despite some tire punctures
and getting

00:04:17.876 --> 00:04:19.846
sand-bogged near the end.

00:04:19.846 --> 00:04:22.086
The race controversy was,
of course, our US

00:04:22.086 --> 00:04:23.996
bad boy, Robby Gordon.

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:26.736
Peterhansel and Gordon had an
on-course coming together.

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:29.446
Robby challenged Stephane's
sportsmanship.

00:04:29.446 --> 00:04:31.676
And then the legality of
Gordon's Hummer was also

00:04:31.676 --> 00:04:32.406
challenged.

00:04:32.406 --> 00:04:35.306
So Robby disconnected the
questioned tire inflation

00:04:35.306 --> 00:04:38.236
system and told the inspectors
to kiss his ass.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.876
Robbie would have given them the
finger, but out of respect

00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:44.046
for world superbike racer John
Hopkins, who gave up his

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:46.366
finger to race this year,
Robbie did not.

00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:46.946
You know what?

00:04:46.946 --> 00:04:48.296
Google around to
get that joke.

00:04:48.296 --> 00:04:49.386
Or watch FLD.

00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:51.656
Derek's got that story today.

00:04:51.656 --> 00:04:54.896
In bikes, Cyril Dupre took
the win for KTM, the

00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:56.506
brand's 11th in a row.

00:04:56.506 --> 00:05:00.456
In trucks, Gerard de Rooy,
with his Iveco.

00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:03.426
The Dubai 24 race was the other
recent race of note.

00:05:03.426 --> 00:05:05.736
Mercedes took a podium-sweeping
one, two,

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:06.606
three victory.

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:10.816
The Ferrari front row and all
the BMW Z4, Lamborghini, Audi,

00:05:10.816 --> 00:05:13.786
Porsche, Nissan, GTR competition
fell to the

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:16.586
horsepower and pace
of the SLS.

00:05:16.586 --> 00:05:20.366
The PlayStation GT Academy team
made it to the podium.

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:22.621
United Autosport made it into
the headlines troubleshooting

00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:24.796
their electrical system
problems via,

00:05:24.796 --> 00:05:26.426
of all things, Facebook.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:29.856
And a certain Z4 racer, Faisal
Binladen, tried to keep his

00:05:29.856 --> 00:05:31.596
family name out of the news.

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:32.836
No, he didn't crash
into anything.

00:05:32.836 --> 00:05:35.556
And yes, it's that
Binladen family.

00:05:35.556 --> 00:05:37.456
Some other racing news
quick shifts.

00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:40.606
Ferrari F1 announced hiring an
ex-Bridgestone tire engineer

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.566
to fix their troubles, getting
the Pirelli tech to work on

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:44.726
the Ferrari.

00:05:44.726 --> 00:05:47.416
Then Ferrari suggested the new
car will be ugly due to the

00:05:47.416 --> 00:05:50.746
new rules, lowering the nose
height but not the tub height.

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:53.666
Thanks scarbsf1.com
for the rendering.

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:57.726
Ford's been testing their Focus
WTCC car, a bit more

00:05:57.726 --> 00:06:00.441
racy than the ST-R we
saw in Detroit.

00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:03.686
And in Detroit, I was told
that Ford was offered the

00:06:03.686 --> 00:06:06.426
opportunity to power the
DeltaWing Le Mans car and

00:06:06.426 --> 00:06:07.966
politely said no.

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:10.371
So any guesses as to who should
provide the motor for

00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.826
this Delta?

00:06:11.826 --> 00:06:15.346
Sidebar, we asked SRT boss,
Ralph Gilles about racing the

00:06:15.346 --> 00:06:19.336
upcoming Viper in ALMS and at
Le Mans, whereupon he paused

00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:21.156
and gave us a smiling,
no comment.

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:23.791
Which prompted me to retort,
you just did, and I'll look

00:06:23.791 --> 00:06:25.006
for the cars.

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:27.146
Back to Ford, who showed
their world rally car

00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:29.356
paint job for 2012.

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:31.516
Finally, more Ford blue
in this scheme.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:31.956
But you know what?

00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:35.036
I liked the Death Star
black of last year.

00:06:35.036 --> 00:06:38.196
Monte Carlo World Rally
Championship is this weekend.

00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:39.396
Everyone's been tested.

00:06:39.396 --> 00:06:41.676
And there's footage on YouTube
that I can't show you unless

00:06:41.676 --> 00:06:43.216
you go off playlist.

00:06:43.216 --> 00:06:45.336
So we'll put some links
in the description.

00:06:45.336 --> 00:06:49.486
See you Friday, or on Drive
Central or Road Testament.

00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:50.166
And you know what?

00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:53.486
Before I go, thanks for all
your comments on YouTube,

00:06:53.486 --> 00:06:56.116
@DriveTV, and @LeoParente.

00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:58.716
I'm reading them all, liking
your suggestions.

00:06:58.716 --> 00:07:00.116
Keep going, and thanks.

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:04.213
Now go watch your
WRC car prod.

00:07:04.213 --> 00:07:58.286
