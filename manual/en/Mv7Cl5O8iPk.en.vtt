00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.150
- So it's an early years session

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.570
and we were focusing on writing

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.600
and inspiring our boys to write.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.700
So leading up to this we found
some poo on the playground

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.620
and some bones and some footprints

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.590
and we had to decide
what left these things

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.423
on the playground.

00:00:21.423 --> 00:00:23.910
Was it a dinosaur or
a monster or an alien?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.380
And the children were really
excited by it being a dinosaur,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.640
so we're continuing with that this week

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.330
and to try and get our
boys writing a lot more,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.360
we're trying to get them
to trap the dinosaur.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.800
So that's where this is going to lead.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.850
We also have a focus
on building vocabulary,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.520
so we've got some messy
activities happening

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.850
to try and get the children's
vocabulary extended

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.910
and hopefully that will
excite them this morning

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.803
with that topic.

00:00:52.058 --> 00:00:56.052
I think something happened
outside this morning, didn't it?

00:00:56.052 --> 00:00:57.420
- Yes, yes!
- A poo.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.580
- Now who can tell me what
happened outside today?

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.820
You were coming into school
and everybody came running in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.740
and told me something had happened.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.112
Stephan what happened?

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:10.069
- A dinosaur poo again.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.582
- [Teacher] A dinosaur poo again.

00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:15.940
Hmm, who saw the dinosaur poo?

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.773
- Me!
- Me!

00:01:16.773 --> 00:01:18.337
(child laughs)

00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:19.311
- I saw a T-Rex...

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:20.144
- [Teacher] Was it a big one?

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:20.977
- [Children] Yes!

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:22.029
- A T-Rex!

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:23.243
- [Teacher] Was it a huge one?

00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:24.076
- [Children] Yes!

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:25.560
- [Teacher] Was it a massive one?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.950
- [Children] Yes!

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.790
- Do you think it was from the T- Rex?

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.755
- [Children] Yes.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.037
- A flying dinosaur.

00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:33.270
- Do you think it was a flying
dinosaur, a pterodactyl?

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.420
- No I didn't see wings on it.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.306
- [Teacher] Didn't see any wings?

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:38.327
- No cause they don't...

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:42.195
(children talk excitedly)

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:43.922
- Shh, shh, shh, okay, right.

00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:47.720
Let's listen, Riley, shh, Riley.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.680
I think this dinosaur
is back because it wants

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.160
to tell us something.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.760
Just going to turn our music down.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.460
I think that dinosaur is trying to find us

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.810
because he's been here now
twice hasn't he, this dinosaur?

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.730
Last time when the dinosaur
was here we found bones

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.820
and footprints didn't we?

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.300
And now the dinosaur is back
and he's done another poo

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.770
in our playground.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.583
I think that dinosaur wants something.

00:02:14.578 --> 00:02:15.943
- He wants food!
- Food!

00:02:15.943 --> 00:02:19.000
- [Teacher] Why don't you turn to partner

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.940
and talk to your partner

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.460
about what that dinosaur might want.
