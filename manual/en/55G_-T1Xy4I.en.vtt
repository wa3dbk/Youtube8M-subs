00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:12.660
Welcome. Today we test the Volkswagen Golf Sportsvan with 2-liter TDI engine with 150 hp and DSG gearbox.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.760
We're on the highway. Some time ago, I drove to the SkawiÅ„ski junction.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.300
I immediately reset the fuel consumption.

00:00:27.474 --> 00:00:30.114
Average speed is 91 km/h.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.120
I have also DriftBox that shows equal to 90 km/h and according to the indications I set the cruise control.

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:44.293
As you can see the difference is very small order of 2 km/h.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.280
By the way, we can check the engine RPM.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.360
At 90 km/h in 6th gear we have 1550 rpm.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:13.560
On the computer you'll see a sign E6.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.680
We have something like drive mode.

00:01:22.753 --> 00:01:27.353
The button lights, so I chose the economic driving mode - Eco Mode.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.960
I hope that through this we get an interesting result.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.720
Let's see what so far was measured.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.320
Already 4 km behind us.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.720
Journey time is 2 minutes.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.680
Average fuel consumption is 4.3 l/100km.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.560
In accordance with previous findings, the air conditioning is turned on for the first stage.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.400
The temperature is 22 degrees.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:14.880
I repeat once more. The height difference between the Skawinski junction and Wielicki exit is less than 1 meter.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.360
From this it follows that the measurement will not be in any way distorted.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.880
Average fuel consumption is 4.3 l/100km at an average speed...

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.480
...90 km/h

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.000
Here we have a nice summary of the last reset.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:54.640
Average fuel consumption is 4.3 l/100km, while the average speed slightly decreased.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.280
Time for a measurement at 120 km/h.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.080
We're going 120 km/h.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.960
Average fuel consumption is about to calculate.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:22.360
Current consumption is quite high, as we were going up the hill.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.600
Misrepresentation of the speedometer is minimal.

00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:34.633
The speedometer shows 123 km/h, while DriftBox equal to 120 km/h.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:45.520
When it comes to the engine speed, on the 6th gear we have at the moment about 2100 rpm at 120 km/h.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.280
Let's see now the result of the fuel consumption...

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:02.880
...after 4 kilometres we have avarage 6,2 l/100km.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.880
Here we have a speed limit of 100 km/h

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.240
So lay off a little bit.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.400
Instantaneous fuel consumption is zero.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.600
I already have the end of the speed limit.

00:04:26.914 --> 00:04:30.794
Since reduced by 20 now I'll increase by 20 km/h.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.960
We'll go for a while with a speed of 140 km/h.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.400
Behind us the 10 km ride and a few hundred meters  from the highway exit.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.320
Average fuel consumption of the entire test is 5.8 l/100km.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:57.200
And now burning on a cold engine and stretch three kilometers.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.280
The 2.0 TDI with 150 hp.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.920
DSG gearbox.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.880
After the first minute average fuel consumption of around 16 liters.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.520
One kilometer behind us.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.040
Average fuel consumption 12.6 l/100km/

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.080
After 2 kilometers average speed of 33 km/h...

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.320
...fuel consumption of about 9 liters.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.960
After driving 3 km average fuel consumption is 7.6 l/100km.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.560
Avarage speed is 44 km/h.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.880
This time we were traveling much faster than usual on this route.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.560
Even so, fuel consumption is not shocking.
