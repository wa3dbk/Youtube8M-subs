00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To celebrate each new year of observing,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope captures stunning new images of the sky

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This year for its 24th birthday

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the space telescope has released a new image of part of NGC 2174

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This region, also known as the Monkey Head Nebula,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is filled with young stars embedded within bright wisps of cosmic gas and dust

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Episode 73: Hubble revisits the Monkey Head Nebula for 24th birthday snap

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Nebulae are a favourite target for Hubble

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Their colourful plumes of gas and fiery bright stars create ethereally beautiful pictures

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Some of Hubble's most beautiful and popular images have been of nebulae

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
for example, take the telescope's striking image of the Ring Nebula released last year

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
or this delicate and beautiful infrared image of the Horsehead Nebula

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
produced to celebrate Hubble's 23rd anniversary

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In 2012 Hubble viewed the Tarantula Nebula to commemorate its 22nd birthday

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and for its 21st snapped the stunning cosmic rose Arp 273

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now, to celebrate its 24th year in orbit

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Hubble has revisited part of NGC 2174

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
more commonly known as the Monkey Head Nebula

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Dark brown and rust coloured dust clouds billow outwards

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
framed against a background of bright blue gas

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
These striking hues are formed by combining several Hubble images

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000
taken with different coloured filters to reveal a broad range of colours not normally visible to the human eye

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
This is not the first time Hubble has turned its gaze to the Monkey Head Nebula

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Sitting about 6400 light-years away in the constellation of Orion,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
NGC 2174 was previously captured by Hubble in 2011

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The violent stellar nursery contains all the ingredients needed for star formation

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
However, the recipe for cooking up new stars isn't very efficient

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and most of these ingredients are wasted

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
as the cloud of gas and dust gradually disperses

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The rate at which the nebula disperses is accelerated by the presence of fiery hot young stars

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
which trigger high velocity winds that help to blow the gas outwards.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Launched in 1990,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the Hubble Space Telescope has witnessed countless cosmic marvels in its 24 years in orbit.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Capturing the elegance of nature,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
it is a unique window into the Universe and continues to astound us year after year

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
with stunning images and cutting-edge science.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Happy 24th birthday Hubble!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Hubblecast is produced by ESA/Hubble at the European Southern Observatory in Germany.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
The Hubble mission is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency.
