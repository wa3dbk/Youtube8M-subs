00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.490
So, this is the second Test to the Oil-System.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.490
The bearings are now closed on both sides.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.359
On the inside with the rubber covers, but
this doesn´t helped.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.820
So we have to look, how we can fix this problem.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.890
The combustion chamber is now completely finished,
so that it can be screwed.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.890
The Turbine blades are honed.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.509
I cut a bit from the front part of the case,
because it was a bit too long.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.789
Then we made a "grommet" for the rear part
of the axis, because when you firmly screw

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:40.190
the Compressor and the Turbine together the
inner rings of the bearings are against each

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.190
other warped.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:02:07.740
So we fixed the problem that the axis doesn´t
run smoothly.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:04:15.269
Now you can watch these Updates.
