00:00:00.477 --> 00:00:02.550
- Do you wonder what I'm doing here?

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.856
You have no frame of reference.

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:06.473
You're like a child who walks
in halfway through a movie

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:09.592
and starts asking all these questions.

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:14.592
(comical music)

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:17.140
If you're reasonably quick on your feet,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.562
there are a lot of
problems you can outrun.

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:23.504
Stuff like killer snail
attacks, the blob, zombies.

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:25.264
Alright, I guess I should really specify

00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:29.432
zombies from before the 28 Days Later era.

00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:30.586
But I digress.

00:00:30.586 --> 00:00:33.415
Here are four situations
where running away

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:36.868
is almost always a bad call.

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:38.149
(bear growls)

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.626
(man yells in fear)

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:41.785
- Look, I get it.

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:43.027
Sometimes you eat the bear

00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:44.873
and sometimes a bear eats you.

00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:46.533
When you're face to face with a bear,

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.205
you're instinct is to hoof it, right?

00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:51.126
But barring, not bearing,

00:00:51.126 --> 00:00:53.806
but barring some very
unusual circumstances,

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.653
you cannot outrun a bear.

00:00:55.653 --> 00:00:58.793
I mean some bears can
charge at 30 miles per hour.

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:01.874
In 2009, the Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:06.120
topped out at a maximum
speed of 27 miles per hour.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.837
So, yeah.

00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:09.787
The good news is that most bears want

00:01:09.787 --> 00:01:12.029
absolutely nothing to do with you.

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:14.321
If you do encounter a
bear in the wilderness,

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:17.337
most experts agree that you
should back away slowly,

00:01:17.337 --> 00:01:20.295
facing the animal, but
not making eye contact.

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:23.399
If the bear tries to follow
you, then try to scare it off

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.358
by shouting, making yourself
appear as big as possible.

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.934
If you plan on going into bear country,

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:33.022
research beforehand what park services say

00:01:33.022 --> 00:01:36.231
about the best practices
for animal encounters.

00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:41.458
So if you suddenly realize your home

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:43.818
is in the path of a
tornado, you should run,

00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:47.011
but only to the part of your
house with the best shelter.

00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:49.996
If you try to hop in your car and flee,

00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:52.421
you might find evacuation
routes obstructed

00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:54.718
or clogged with traffic, leaving you stuck

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:57.177
out in the open in your car.

00:01:57.177 --> 00:01:58.818
Instead, get low.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.072
Not a song reference.

00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:02.957
Your best bet is to retreat
to the nearest basement

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:05.021
or other low-lying area,

00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:07.560
and cover yourself with
pillows or blankets

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.747
to protect your body from falling debris.

00:02:13.607 --> 00:02:16.828
Alright, dogs might chase
humans for all kinds of reasons.

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:18.829
Maybe they're protecting their territory.

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.377
Maybe they're following their
instinct to pursue prey.

00:02:21.377 --> 00:02:23.297
Or maybe they just want
to sniff the remnants

00:02:23.297 --> 00:02:26.042
of that ham soup you spilled
in your lap at lunch.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.636
In a lot of cases, running
from an aggressive dog

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:30.950
will only encourage it to chase or attack.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.169
Instead, you should try to
become as boring as possible.

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.462
Stand still.

00:02:36.462 --> 00:02:37.404
Be quiet.

00:02:37.404 --> 00:02:40.066
Avert your eyes until
the dog loses interest.

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:46.657
If you can evacuate before
a storm hits, great.

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:49.658
But if a flood is already
underway in your neighborhood,

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:51.334
remember these four words:

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:53.300
Get to high ground.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.066
It can be tempting to
flee the area via car,

00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:58.760
but flood waters are shockingly powerful.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.120
Just six inches of rising water
can knock you off your feet.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.379
And just 18 inches can drag an entire car

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.847
away in the current.

00:03:06.847 --> 00:03:09.596
You do not want to be
stuck out in a flooded road

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:12.159
trying to get out of
town when the water level

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.882
reaches these markers.

00:03:13.882 --> 00:03:15.409
With power lines coming down

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.074
left and right all around you.

00:03:17.074 --> 00:03:19.817
Instead immediately seek
out the most elevated

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:22.104
secure point you can safely reach.

00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:23.699
The top of a hill for instance.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.292
A neighbor's house, or even
your own roof as a last resort.

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:28.897
So what are some threats that you've

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:31.029
tried and failed to outrun?

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:32.551
