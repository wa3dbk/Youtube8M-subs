00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.720
one, two, three, four!

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.960
Rev up your engines!

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.390
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel,
if you thought all full-size pickup

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.179
trucks get horrible gas mileage, then
stay tuned, because I'm going to show you one

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.710
that doesn't,
now this F150 sure is a

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:38.170
full-size truck, but it has a newly
designed engine and transmission so it can get

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.839
get 23 miles a gallon on the highway and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.489
I know you naysayers are going to say hey
it's only a v6 engine it doesn't have

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:59.019
enough power, but this new v6 engine puts
out 302 horsepower, so I've certainly got

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.699
no complain about power, now if we take a
look under the truck we'll see the new

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.720
transmission, the new transmission is a
six-speed automatic transmission and

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.909
it's also a double overdrive
transmission which comes in real handy

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.640
because if you're not towing anything
when driving, you leave it in double

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.090
overdrive but if you're towing, you push
the tow haul button, then little light

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.310
comes on and you're only using single
overdrive instead of double, so you can

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.970
get the best gas mileage when you're not
towing, but still have plenty of power

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.180
when you're towing stuff and if you look
under the hood, you'll notice something

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.070
else different, there's no power steering
pump, now that's to get better gas

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.690
mileage too, it does have power steering
but it's electronic, here's the steering

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.790
and it goes down to an electronic power
steering assembly and it also helps to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.010
get better gas mileage, so the next time
somebody tells you all full-size trucks

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.490
are gas hogs, you can tell them that that
isn't true

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.189
because the new six-cylinder f150 is
pretty efficient for a large truck and

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:17.640
