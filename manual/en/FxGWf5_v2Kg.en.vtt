00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.929
So Moss Stitch is really fun and renders a
really beautiful deep textured fabric that

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.430
looks a lot more complicated than it is.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.400
But it does require a little bit of explaining.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.860
So, essentially what we're doing is, knit
one, purl one, knit one, purl one, all the

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.860
way across.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.560
And we're going to be doing it for two rows
high this time instead of one like regular

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.560
Seed Stitch.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.500
So if you've ever worked Seed Stitch, you
know that you switch your pattern every single

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.500
row.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.879
And in Moss Stitch, it's like a double high
Seed Stitch.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.969
So if you can look only at the top two rows
of this Moss Stitch sample, you'll see that

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.289
I've got knits stacked on top of knits and
purls stacked on top of purls.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.319
So if you can just see the very top portion,
you'll see what looks like one by one ribbing.

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:03.469
However, after those two rows have been achieved,
we're going to switch the pattern, just like

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.870
in Seed Stitch, to begin our checkerboard.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.660
So here I have a knit on top of a knit, which
means it's time to switch the pattern.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.890
I'm going to be purling now on top of those
knits, and knitting on top of those purls.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.900
So I'm going to work knit one, purl one, across
this row, remembering to switch my yarn every

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.320
single time.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.670
So what I'm doing, I'm knitting and moving
the yarn, purling and moving the yarn.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm going fast, just so we can get to the
end of the row.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.320
So what I'm doing right now is, I'm breaking
the pattern that I established previously

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.020
on the last two rows but we're setting up
the new pattern for this row and the one to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.290
come after it.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.640
So we're switching our pattern after every
other row.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.530
So now I've worked across, and you can see
that.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.200
Above the two knit stitches, I now have a
purl, and above the two purl stitches I now

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.820
have a knit.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.540
So when we work the back, this is where we
get to put in that second row, and this time,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.249
because we're stacking them for two rows,
we get to, what I call 'knit them as you see

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.249
them'.

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:24.079
So that looks like a purl, go ahead and purl
it.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.909
It looks like a knit, go ahead and knit it.

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.319
So here we are doing what feels like one by
one ribbing.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.239
Knitting them as we see them, as we go across.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:40.370
So just stacking up a purl on top of a purl
and a knit on top of a knit, remembering to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.980
switch the yarn every time.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.269
Yarn to the back and knit, yarn to the front
and purl.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.190
And when we get across this row, we'll look
at the front and we'll see what we've made

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.819
in Moss Stitch.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.640
Now, some people call this double Seed Stitch,
which totally makes sense, because it is Seed

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.569
Stitched done for two rows before we switch,
which is what makes it Moss.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.849
So here we go, our new two rows, a front row
and a back row of stacking knits on top of

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.730
knits and purls on top of purls.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.340
But because it's Moss Stitch, when I start
this next row, I've got a purl on top of a

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.340
purl.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.340
That's two.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.609
So I'm going to knit, and continue on as such.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.709
So that is the wonderful Moss Stitch, which
gives you a really nice deep texture, and

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.709
you only have to pay attention every other
row.
