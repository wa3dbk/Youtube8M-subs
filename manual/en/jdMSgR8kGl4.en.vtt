00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.420
Welcome to Moorea.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:09.500
These are my adventures in biology on the island
of the yellow lizard.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.610
Among my first stops on the island was the
Intercontinental resort and spa, home to a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.780
sea turtle clinic for injured and rescued
turtles.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.880
Dr. Cecile Gaspar is founder of the turtle
clinic and associated non-profit society,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.920
Te Mana O Te Moana.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.680
As both a marine ecologist and a veterinarian,
Dr Gaspar has been rehabilitating sea turtles

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.140
for over a decade.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.160
So clearly we started with this ? because basically there was a need,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.920
We were called by some local fishermen, some local residents

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.560
telling us I found a ? could you take care of it because I'm a vet, so.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.200
And I was like, okay I'd like to, but we need to have a good place for that.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.200
Cecile presented her case to the owner of
the intercontinental spa, knowing full well

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.110
that in order to be effective in helping turtles,
she needed a lot of support.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.890
This is the list of what we need, you know,
we need a lagoon, we need some nurseries,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.370
we need a clinic to take care of them, and
maybe down the road we need an office, and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.920
then we need an educational room, like a classroom,
because we do a lot of education.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.999
The hotel owner obliged, and the non-profit
society was created.

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:17.060
Injured turtles from all over French Polynesia
come to Te Mana O Te Moana.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.799
They have agreements with many local transportation
companies and airlines to make sure the turtles

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.409
reach them safely.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.840
The main cause of the injuries is poaching.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.859
It's poaching, okay.

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.419
We have a lot of injuries by speargun in the
neck, very very strong injuries, very difficult

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:33.490
to take care of.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.310
We meet Tortilla, a Hawksbill turtle that
arrived at the center with extremely deep

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.359
gashes in her right pectoral fin.

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.409
Tell us what happened here.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.979
She got caught in some fishing line?

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:43.979
Yeah.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.169
And so this was entangled around the flipper,
and as you can see, those are very deep cuts

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:53.679
but this is in a very good state of recovering
but we have some dead skin to clean up.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.479
So you can see those very deep cuts, that's
why some nerves have been damaged, and that's

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.020
why she's not moving it as she was before.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.469
Everything that is like this--
This is just scar tissue?

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:06.469
Yeah.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.530
And what we don't want is, behind this, trouble
and infection going on.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.379
A quick application of antibiotic ointment,
and Tortilla is good to head back to the lagoon.

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.310
But we quickly notice that she's still not
really using her injured fin.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.230
She needs more time.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.439
Another long-term resident is ?, a large
Hawksbill rendered permanently blind from

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.430
a speargun wound to her head.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.670
Yeah you got it!

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.879
Don't take the stick.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.879
Oh!

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.440
She doesn't want to give it up.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.670
Oh, right in the mouth!

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.670
That's awesome.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.670
Okay.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.739
Next it's feeding time for some rescued juveniles,
and some brand new hatchlings that were just

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.980
brought in from one of the nearby ? The hatchlings
were stranded in a deep hole.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.990
They were dehydrated and would certainly not
have made it without the center's intervention.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.240
We are at these two day old turtles.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.480
We are going to feed them.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.400
? has got food on his finger, this mulched
up baby food.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.519
This is the first time that they will have
eaten, so it's important to make sure that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.280
each turtle is actually eating, because if
it's not eating, that could signify some kind

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.280
of a problem.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.120
How's it looking?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.400
Did one of them have a little bit of chow?

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.840
Oh look look, right here.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.320
That one, yeah.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.400
Oh he got it!

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.959
After lunch, we head out to some nearby reefs,
because Te Mana O Te Moana isn't just a rescue

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:35.959
center.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.760
They're actively monitoring Hawksbill and
Green turtle populations around the islands.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.709
It's the coolest research protocol that I
have experienced.

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.520
Being towed behind the boat while looking
for turtles.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.400
Once a turtle has been spotted, Matthew freedives
down to catch it with his bare hands.

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.840
Once caught, the turtles are brought onboard,
where they are weighed, measured, and tagged.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.900
A tissue sample is also taken for DNA analysis.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.160
And then, it's back into the drink they go.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.400
All right, here you go.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.680
Woo!

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.000
All in a day's work.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.280
I have to say, I was so impressed by the turtle
work going on at Te Mana O Te Moana.

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.919
I had some skepticism going into it, about
the legitimacy of a rescue center attached

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.729
to a major tourist hotel.

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.470
But Te Mana O Te Moana is making a massive
difference for sea turtles in French Polynesia.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.940
What a fantastic place to visit, and what
a responsible choice by the owners of the

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.940
Intercontinental.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.350
Okay so that's it for today!

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.350
Thank you!

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.190
In the next episode, I get up close and personal
with some sharks and stingrays.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.610
