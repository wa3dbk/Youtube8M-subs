Make flash cards. I know that it seems silly
and it's pretty time consuming but learning

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.269
from speaking to yourself and using flash
cards actually helps you memorize it a lot

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.670
better than simply looking over your notes
or maybe re-writing your notes.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.789
We like to have study sessions. We're big
on study sessions in our major, so that really

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:21.210
helps.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.210
Attend class, study all that's on the final
and just eat right, exercise, and be prepared.

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.360
I'm big on like making study sheets. I write,
usually re-write everything, like my notes

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.260
and everything and do like a little study
guide to take with me to study in-between

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.829
classes.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.789
The day before tests shouldn't be like a study
day. It should be like um... a revision day,

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.420
like going over and reviewing your notes instead
of trying to memorize them.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.629
For cumulative, I try to maintain reading
my notes from the beginning of the year, all

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.100
throughout the year so that I keep fresh on
the material.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.940
Nursing, you can not cram, and if you do,
you're going to be a bad nurse.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.840
Yeah, don't cram. It don't work, especially
when you have a whole bunch of information

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.690
to try to memorize. It'll go right through.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.000
Definitely start the week before, even if
you're behind. I know I'm behind in a few of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
my classes, but I'm gonna catch up so that
I can be able to study 100% next week as well.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.710
Definitely don't overwhelm yourself and uh..
don't wait last minute. That's the worst.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.270
You won't remember anything and by the time
you're finished with the exam, your brain's

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.010
going to be fried. So, take it easy and don't
overwhelm yourself.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.290
I'll just give you tips for finals and also
for life, you know, this is where I'm gonna

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.250
say to you, ok, uh.. we all, the one thing
that everybody in the world has in common

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.260
is time. alright, you know, uhÃ‰ me and Bill
Gates, he may have more money, but we have

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.510
the same amount of time, okay? The difference
is how he uses time and I use my time, okay?

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.630
And you also. Use your time wisely, you know.
Take as much, you know, I mean don't just

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.460
BS and play around. Use your time and, and
use it efficiently and effectively, you know.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.670
Make sure- make your time, don't waste your
time. Make it work for you. That's the best

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.920
thing I can give them. That's what- That's
what worked in my life.
