-Welcome to Scissorhill
GoPro Tips Number Four--

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.760
how to build fast gear
egg timer in 360 degree

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.580
rotation for 30 minute device.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.900
I'm Oyvind Sakshaug from
Scissorhill Productions.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.610
Today, I want to show you
how to make a time lapse

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.770
unit for your GoPro camera.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.380
For this DIY project, I
used two IKEA egg timers.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.220
I used two pivot arms, and
too short thumb screws.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.120
I used one long thumb
screw and, of course,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.220
my GoPro Hero camera.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.710
In many cases, it's difficult to
keep a full hour of recording.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.366
When I put two egg
timers on each other,

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:59.316
I will reduce the time a 360
degree rotation to 30 minutes.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.900
