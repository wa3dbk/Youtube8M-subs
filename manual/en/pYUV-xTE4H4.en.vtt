00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.890
-So we're going to film this
morning a great shorty do.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.530
Everyone loves the
short hairstyles

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.430
that are popular right now.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.780
But there's always a dilemma on
what to do that makes them fun.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.396
So we're going to do one.

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:15.770
This morning, I'm
going to do one

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.470
called double French twistbacks.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.466
Hey.

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.420
-Hi.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.447
-And you start it
by, I've just started

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:24.780
by parting her hair on the left.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.910
Tip this way a little bit.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.390
You can part it on
either side as normal.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.400
And then, I have just
taken a part, just

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.710
a small section of
hair on the front.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.490
And I've just put
a little clippy in

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.490
to hold the rest
of her hair back.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.370
Turn your head this way for me.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.310
Now, to start, I'm
going to just pick up

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.950
a little section of
the front part I have.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.610
And you're going to
divide it into two.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.782
I'm going to grab a
water really quick.

00:00:55.782 --> 00:01:00.460
She has fine hair that--
I'm going to just dampen it

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.220
just a little bit.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.370
You divide it into two pieces.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.850
And I always twist towards
the back of the head.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.337
So we're going to start a twist.

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:11.920
Now, what makes this
a French twist is

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.378
that on the front
piece, we're just

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:14.940
going to add a little hair in.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.850
So pick up a little hair and
then add it in and twist it.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.340
Again, pick up a little hair.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.526
Add it to that front piece.

00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:26.680
And twist it back.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.789
It's very easy.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.580
You don't have to pick
up hair on the back.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.660
And we're just going to continue
until we run out of hair.

00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:45.070
And then, we're going to just
twist it down a little ways.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.080
You'll have to forgive my--
I have a cold this morning,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.850
so I feel like I'm
really [SNIFFING] sniffy.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.220
Here, will you
hold this, sweetie?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.930
Thanks.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.430
OK.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.930
Now, I'm going to
do two sections.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.050
So again, I'm just going
to come in here, section

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.800
off a little more hair.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.570
You don't want it to big or
makes the twist way to big.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.040
And when, I'm happy
with the part,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.020
I'm just going to secure all
this back out of the way.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.275
So again, you're going
to start up here.

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:20.400
Let me just spritz
the top, again.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.220
Section it off into two pieces.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.330
Tip your head this way, honey.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.219
And begin twisting.

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:30.760
Pick up some.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.220
Twist it in.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.725
Pick up some more.

00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:37.810
And it in.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.120
Pick up some more.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.112
Add it in until you're
at about the same place

00:02:45.112 --> 00:02:46.570
that you stopped
on the last twist.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.730
I'm going to do one
more right there.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.960
And then, finish it off,
again, by twisting it down.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.980
So this hairdo is
really one that you

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.630
can use on any type of hair.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.810
If you have longer
hair, at this point,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.630
I would pull it back into a cute
messy bun or a cute side braid.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.650
I've done both on my girls.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.270
And I'll try to
stick pictures up

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.240
of-- I know I have one with a
messy bun that's really cute.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.360
But if you have
short hair like her,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.940
I'm going to take just a
clear elastic and rubber

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.900
band the two ends
together just to add

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.903
a little extra security
on those twists.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.940
And then, you can
lay it flat like this

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:43.310
and pin it, or pull up a
little hair and pin it.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.625
So you take your bobby
pins and bobby pin it.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:54.450
Remember, to cross your bobbies.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.480
And then, lay her
hair down over the top

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.460
and try to hide the bobby
pins as best you can.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.040
And there you go.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.920
You have cute little twists.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.520
That was a little too much hair.

00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:10.770
There.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.740
So you can still see
the twists a little bit.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.170
OK.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.149
And you're good to go.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.459
Say bye.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.009
-Bye.
