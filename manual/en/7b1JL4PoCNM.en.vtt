It finally came in the mail.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.850
We've been wanting one of these for a long
time.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.700
Folks, this is the Cold Steel Recon Tanto.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.510
High performance.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.570
Thanks for watching Survival Bros.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.960
Let's see this!

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.449
We're not getting paid to do this product
review.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:33.753
We are just checking it out for the first
time for fun.

00:00:33.753 --> 00:00:43.979
That's a nice sheath with it.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:44.979
And...ahhhh!

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:50.989
Oh man, let me back up.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.600
That is pretty bad to the bone man.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.519
Tell me what you are thinking.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:56.589
You just bought this.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.399
Yeah, I think it looks mean, and I saw the
tests on Cold Steel for it, read some reviews...It's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.860
slowly becoming a real popular knife, it's
been steadily popular for awhile but from

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.640
what I've read online the sales are taking
off.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.070
A lot of guys from the Military are starting
to like this because it's a hardcore combat

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.280
knife.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.280
It's badass!

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.280
That's one of the reasons I got it.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.859
I'm taking this bad unit with me to Afghanistan.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.149
We'll see what happens with this thing.

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.829
I'm sure it will be a loyal friend man.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:33.829
I want one.

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.939
The weight on this guy is 9 ounces.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:43.829
It is 11 and 3/4 inches (in length) overall.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.689
7 inch blade.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.499
4 3/4 inch handle.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:02:00.579
Blade thickness on this thing is 3/16ths,
and it's made of Japanese AUS 8A Metal.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:01.579
Steel.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.719
I feel you.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.930
You can bend this thing, and we've seen the
videos on this.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.730
It's cutting pigs up, slicing watermelon,
they were going to town on water bottles.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.160
It was crazy, so check out Cold Steel dot
com.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.110
But yeah, we just got our hands on this.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.470
So what do you think about his handle?

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.250
It's got a hole too.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.260
You could put a lanyard on there, if you want.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.260
Sure.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.260
It feels sturdy.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.110
It feels like, even if you got it wet it would
give you some good grip.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.020
It's got got this good little lip here, your
can tuck your hand up under.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.160
Protect your hand a little bit.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.530
I've wanted one of these for a long time.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.010
It feels rubberized, you'd say?

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.050
Yeah.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.030
No serration.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.810
Just a straight up slicer.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.110
Let's check out this sheath.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.110
Yeah.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.200
Tell the folks at home what you paid for it.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.160
First cut test.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:11.370
I actually picked it up off Amazon, and paid
like $70 plus shipping and handling.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.260
They call this their Secure-Ex sheath.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.190
From what I've heard from reviews I've read
online, it's actually pretty good.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.190
Let's see it.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.510
How am I suppose to film this?

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.510
Oh, sorry.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.200
Come on, Vanna White it for me.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.980
lol Ok, here we go.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.140
Let's see if it rattles around.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.140
Is it secure?

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.410
No rattle.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.410
Nice.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.120
Nice little button.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.490
Feels good to you?

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.490
Yeah.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.140
Put it on your backpack, your side, something.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.010
It looks like you could 550 cord it to whatever
you wanted.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.570
It's got these other one inch slots where
you could actually put some one inch webbing

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.830
through it if you want.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.030
For sure.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.800
Velcro, button for extra security.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.870
Well made for sure.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.870
Very cool.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.019
The Recon Tanto from Cold Steel.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.680
What up?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.989
Let's see that thing.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.650
So, damn!

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.330
Seven inches.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.330
Yeah.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.330
Whoo!

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.330
Very cool.
