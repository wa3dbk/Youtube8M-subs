00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.870
hey guys so I just wanted to shoot a quick video to buy a minecraft server and my

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.810
experiences

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.730
and a really good hosting company I
found call pickle hosting

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.280
When I started off I know that there is
some people who have had problems like

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.440
bad hosting waste their money

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.600
they don't get any responses when the
message the people

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.380
at the hosting company well I've had
experiences like that to where I

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.680
have made a hamachi servers and they're
great for small group of people but when

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.250
you want to really make a big server
then it stirs distant

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.440
they're not good at all so arm and I
know that there's some hosting out there

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.180
that they dis-

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.230
really aren't getting a

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.360
just scam you so like this is one other

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.879
thus a hosting that I found that's it's
actually good night I've

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.750
tried it out and I had a server for a
while so I trust them they really get so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.840
other name is pickle hosting and
their

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.550
I think that they're really good like
the they've good server power

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.520
like for five dollars a month you get 8
gigabytes have a dedicated RAM which is

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.500
really nice

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.010
and then up it really has got
affordability to like you could see if

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.640
you have a budget five dollars

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.610
you can do that or if you want like a
hundred thirty-five dollars for

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.790
dedicated 12

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.409
and like this 24 like right here you can
talk to them live so

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.110
it's perfect if you want right away
answers or if you need

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.689
help right that minute they're right
there too talk to you and help you so

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.549
they also have a I it's easy and quick
setup so pretty much went to buy it

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.020
it's right away just gonna be set up net
within Nadal

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.040
minimum our maximum of 24 hours it's
gonna be

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.210
up in ready in even that seems pretty
crazy for to be 24 hours for them

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.960
and then they also up as you can see you
instant feed the beast in tech install

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.689
which is nice to i've seen. low service
like that but they're expensive

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.509
DDoS protection by Kraft which is

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.790
a lotta service have a but its still
nice to have in them also I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.399
as really good things to come like with
for five dollars getting

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.119
unlimited slots in all the stuff it's
just it's really nice I

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.430
I did i want for the fifteen dollar plan
and I was completely

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.800
completely arm satisfied with what I

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.940
guy and I definitely think I got my
money's worth so also I'm

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.580
the and then just looking at the deals
like it for five dollars he can get

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.489
EQ bytes of RAM or sister for example
acquitted these guys

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.569
arm for $14.99 get 2 gigabytes

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.099
which is nothing it's like not

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.160
anything compared to how much this is in
its like

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.629
what that three times more money for the
other one so

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.970
I really think it's like a good deals
that they really actually like

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.140
know that not many people have a lake
all this money to blow on servers so

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.300
it's a really really really good a.m.
hosting company and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.840
also I with my passive experience is
like

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.650
I would try to download minecraft host plugins like I
stop server I was a complete newbie I'm

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.510
not even gonna lie

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.150
on and it was just so hard for me to set
up the server and then

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.230
they help you look down the dim my
plugins for me when I couldn't figure

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.980
out how

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.750
and it wasn't even that much money
really to get them to do for me in them

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.140
they're always there to help me out when
I needed

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.750
to talk about some issues and really I
didn't have any issues it was never down

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.319
in time that I had it

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.060
and I i I was really happy with

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.379
