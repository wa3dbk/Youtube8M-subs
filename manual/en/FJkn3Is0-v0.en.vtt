00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.680
I’m Courtney Matlick with Stahls’ CAD-CUT®
Direct. Summer is heating up and our recent

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.090
launch of CAD-CUT® Glitter Flake™ in the
color white couldn’t have better timing.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.560
This year along with your summer holidays,
there will be additional opportunities to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.590
embellish your customers in red, white and
blue to show their patriotism for the World

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.330
Cup Games. And what better way to show that,
then sparkle and shine with multicolor bling

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.040
designs in Glitter Flake. Let’s take a look
at how you can create two, three and four

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.720
color designs with CAD-CUT® Glitter Flake™
white and mixing in other colors. Four our

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.230
first design I’m going to use a blue garment.
This way I can create a red, white and blue

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.520
design using only 2 colors of Glitter Flake.
Preheat to remove any of the moisture and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.730
wrinkles. And now I’ll lay down my first
color. When creating multicolor designs I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.620
recommend changing the application to limit
your first application. I’ll change this

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.200
to 5 seconds; it will make it easier for me
to line up my second color. Pull the carrier.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.610
And then I can line up my second color. Again
that shortened application just makes it easier

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.890
for me to be able to line up my second color
because it reduces any shrinkage in the application.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:31.030
Since I have Glitter Flake exposed I’m going
to put a cover sheet over, and seal for the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.990
full 15 seconds. This will ensue that the
application is going to go through both layers

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.310
of Glitter Flake and have a durable garment.
Pull the carrier on the red, and you have

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:51.130
a completed red white and blue design.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.290
For me second design I’m going to complete
a three-color design with red, white and blue.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:04.570
All the designs created for this were created
in CadworxLIVE using a trapping technique.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.980
Since Glitter Flake is not able to be directly
layered, I created gaps in all of my artwork

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.300
like you can see here in the USA. So that
other glitter colors can fall in and still

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:22.459
touch the fabric on the garment. Again I’ll
press that for 5 seconds …tacking down my

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.980
first layer, and then I’ll go over it with
the second color of my USA. Along with white

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.090
Glitter Flake, I’m also using the bright
blue color here, which also gives you a more

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.410
of a vibrant Royal Blue in the glitter. Again
I’ll grab my heating printing cover sheet

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.870
to cover the Glitter Flake™. Tack it down
for 5 more seconds to get the second color

00:02:43.870 --> 00:03:00.940
on. And then I’ll go over it for the full
application with the red. After the full application,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.319
I can pull the last color and you can see
I have a 3-color design.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:17.519
For my last design I’m going to increase
the color count to 4 colors. This way I can

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.500
add an extra outline color to make the glitter
really pop. I’ll load my garment on and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:33.850
do my preheat to remove any moisture and wrinkles.
And align my bottom layer, which is going

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.120
to be the outline of my design. I went ahead
and used a silver which is our hologram silver

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.920
in the Glitter Flake color for this just to
create more of a subtle outline, but still

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:53.720
makes the colors pop. Press this for the 5
seconds. Peel the carrier and then since I

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.629
have 3 other colors left, I’m going to actually
apply the red and the blue together since

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:04.959
they won’t overlap in my design. When doing
multicolor designs, you can do multiple colors

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.720
as long as the carrier isn’t in place of
the vinyl. Cover sheet to cover the Glitter

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:38.360
Flake that’s exposed, seal for 5 more seconds
and then we can do our final color. Peel the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.280
carrier one last time and we have a completed
red, white and blue design that can be used

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:52.840
for soccer or any holiday events this year.
