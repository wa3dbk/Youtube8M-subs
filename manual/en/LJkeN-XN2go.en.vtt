NEIL HUBBARD: So now we're going to talk about
tuning and actually tuning the instrument.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.460
The way to tune the chanter is by moving the
chanter reed in or out. What you want is a

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:27.300
nice balance between the low A and the high
A, a nice octave interval. The intervals between

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.089
the other notes on the chanter are not standard
western intervals. Some of them are slightly

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:44.109
sharper than others, some of them are slightly
flat than the standard interval. So, the scale

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:56.339
on the bagpipe is.

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.539
Putting the chanter into the pipe, I'll now
demonstrate how you can get a better sense

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:34.380
of the balance of the chanter.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.130
So, what I did was, I set 1 drone to the low
A, played the low A, and then I played a high

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.729
A to see if it was a good pitch. Right now
the chanter is slightly flat on the high hand,

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.999
so I had to move the drone up just a bit to
get that balance. I would need to go back

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:02.700
and put either some tape over this or change
the position of the reed to flatten that top

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.520
hand a little bit.
