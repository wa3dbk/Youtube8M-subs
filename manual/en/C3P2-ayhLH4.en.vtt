00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We came from the television industry,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.160
and we found that some content wasn’t suited for TV

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.600
or wasn’t done on TV the way we would like.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.080
It also had to do with trying new communication formats

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.600
and new audiovisual languages.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.360
On the internet this didn’t happen; you could explore, you could try new ways of communicating.,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.720
If you say something and it doesn’t bother anyone, then you haven’t said anything.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.200
You don’t have to be afraid when coming up with new content,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.120
of offending or provoking someone.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.440
You just make it, you know? And that’s when you’ll see where your audience is,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.880
who you connect with and who you don’t.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.240
Whenever you want to say something

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.080
there will be someone somewhere who wants to listen to it,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.160
someone that had the same thought as you, or that has the same interest that you do…

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600
I’m Mexican

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.320
I’m Polish

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.920
Romanian

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.720
Guinea

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.360
Brazilian

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.880
Chile

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.720
South Africa

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.160
I’m Spanish

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.120
Colombian

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.280
Action!

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.840
Olé!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.440
In general when you work with a brand, you receive a brief,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.400
a sort of book,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.640
and they tell you this is what we want to do.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.360
Add a little creativity.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.080
The invitation was very different in this regard. It was like,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.440
put the car to test in any way you can think of.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.520
Test it in the most exotic,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.120
craziest ways possible.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.160
The idea is to see that the car is ready to take on anything a person can think of.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.600
Having such a broad scope

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.240
made for a very interesting process,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.280
and we had ideas that were really crazy,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.600
and those are the ones that we are using.
