00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.520
For the removal of this chimney breast
in the loft

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.340
a drill bit and chisel were used to
rake out mortar

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.620
from between the bricks so that one by
one, 3 support steels could be inserted.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.260
A length of threaded bar was then inserted

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.700
through pre-drilled holes to prevent the
bars from ever spreading apart!

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.600
After removing a few rows of bricks

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.939
a bottle jack was used to prop up the
steels,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.759
so that a metal wedge (in the shape of a
chisel)

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.559
could be inserted at the wall, to secure
the steels.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.540
The left hand side was then supported in the same way,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.420
 with another chisel being rammed into place,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.780
before the jack and further rows of bricks could be removed.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.900
Although not advisable

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.010
works took place in this house to
reinstate the upstairs ceiling

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.410
and loft area before the gallows
brackets with fitted!

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.500
The loft boards did make the continuation

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.800
of the remaining works much easier though.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.360
Gallows brackets were offered up to the wall

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.500
but both required new holes drilling in them

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.000
so that the securing bolts would be more
securely fitted

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.749
centrally into the bricks

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 and both were
bolted into place using 'through' bolts.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.540
 The time and heat weakened mortar around the chimney breast and gallows

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.460
 was re-pointed when necessary

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.400
(but not on the chimney breast itself at this
stage!).

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.360
Both of the gallows brackets arrived painted in a red oxide paint,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.800
these were top coated with a high-temperature

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.649
metal paint to help comply with fire
regulations

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.170
and to also add a further coat of rust
protection,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.759
and as such the rest of the metal work was painted up to match

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.220
including three lengths of box section
steel

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.860
that would be used as the lintels.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.080
The steel lintels were easily slid into place on the gallows brackets.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.000
Any small gaps

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.180
were filled with metal wedges and then
packed around with a concrete mix.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.760
Now that the chimney breast was
supported by lintels

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.800
the mortar was also raked and re-pointed where needed.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.800
That was the chimney breast work in the loft completed,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.319
don't forget to check out my other
videos

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.099
showing upstairs and downstairs.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.220
Thanks, bye!
