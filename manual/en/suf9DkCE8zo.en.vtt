00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.090
&gt;&gt;Hi. I’m Diane Van with the Food Safety
 &amp; Inspection Service at the United States

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.890
Department of Agriculture. Our guiding principle
is prevention, primarily the reduction of

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:17.190
pathogens before products reach the market.
Secondarily, to make sure industry provides

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.690
a safe product. Until we devise the perfect
system to ensure that, it is our responsibility

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.640
to provide consumers with the information
that they need for safe food.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.940
&gt;&gt;Today we’re in the kitchen to help you
prepare a safe turkey dinner. We’ll teach

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.480
you the best ways to keep foodborne illness
ruining your meal.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.470
&gt;&gt;When cooking a turkey, for safety’s sake,
roast the turkey and all other poultry in

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.120
a preheated oven set at no lower than 325°
F. Use a roasting pan with sides no higher

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.670
than 3” and on a rack so heat can circulate
under the bird for even cooking. Tuck the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.550
wings of the turkey under the body of the
bird in akimbo style so the heat penetrates

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.109
the deep crevice that is often the last to
reach a safe internal temperature. You can

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:12.209
add a half cup of water to the bottom of the
pan to create stream for more even cooking.

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:19.179
Tent the turkey with aluminum foil for 1 – 1½
hours to prevent quick browning. If a pop-up

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.929
timer is inserted in the turkey, make sure
to also use a conventional food thermometer

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.009
to measure the internal temperature. A dial
thermometer is designed to be used in large

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.779
cuts of meat, such as a turkey, and may be
left in during the cooking. Stuffing is safest

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:39.490
cooked in a casserole. However if the turkey
is to be stuffed, it should be stuffed just

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.060
before cooking. Cook the turkey and stuffing
to a safe minimum internal temperature of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.509
165° F. And check the temperature in the
wing joint, the thigh and the thickest part

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.979
of the breast, and the center of the stuffing.
Remove the stuffing after cooking. Check the

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.789
temperature in the center of the stuffing
to be sure it reaches a safe minimum internal

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:08.909
temperature of 165° F. Allow approximately
20 minutes stand time before carving.

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:16.599
&gt;&gt;If you have further questions, call the
USDA Meat &amp; Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:24.170
&gt;&gt;Or ask a food safety question at askkaren.gov.
