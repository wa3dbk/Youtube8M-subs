00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.830
Suppose that you and two of your friends are
splitting a pizza for dinner. When you open

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.110
the pizza box, you see there are 12 slices.
You want to be fair and make sure everyone

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.110
gets the same number of slices.. How many
slices does everyone get? This is a VERY important

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.600
problem because we’re talking about pizza
here. One way to solve this is to have everyone

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.250
take turns picking a slice. First everyone
takes one slice... Then everyone takes a second

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.480
slice... Next everyone takes a third slice...
And finally everyone takes a fourth slice...

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.270
So everyone gets 4 slices.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.270
This is division! We divided 12 slices of
pizza among 3 people and everyone got 4 slices.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.980
We write this mathematically like this {gesture
up}. We say this aloud as 12 ÷ 3 = 4. That

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.160
symbol with two dots is called the division
sign. You can also call it the division symbol.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.990
Let’s do another example, except this one
will have a surprise ending. Suppose we want

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.990
to divide 14 gold coins among 4 pirates. The
pirates take turns picking a coin until they’re

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:33.620
all gone... One... Two... Three...
Four? Garrr, hold on a minute. The first two

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.060
pirates each got 4 coins, but the last two
only got 3. That’s not fair! Let’s take

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.159
those extras away so everyone has the same
number of coins. So each pirate gets 3 coins,

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.220
and there are 2 left over.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.520
This is something new! After the division
there were leftovers! We call those leftovers

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.500
the REMAINDER. We write this mathematically
like this. We say this aloud as 14 ÷ 4 = 3

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:11.720
Remainder 2. Instead of writing the word “remainder,”
people will often write it as 14 ÷ 4 = 3

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.730
R 2. That's division!
