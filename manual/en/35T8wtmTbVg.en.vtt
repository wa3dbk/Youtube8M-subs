00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.660
Oh my gosh.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.960
Where do I even begin?

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.440
From 1 to 10 my stress level is at about a 6.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.940
Um my stress level today is probably in-between a 7 and an 8.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.800
Can I want that please?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.880
Well my phone was just a stressful situation.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.760
I dropped it, I lost all my contacts.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.420
Cause I just came out of court and just trying to relax, trying to get away from all that stress.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.060
I want to study.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.920
My recent break up is a little bit of a stress.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860
I'm an independent contractor and I work for myself.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.300
One thing that brings me stress is deadlines.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.522
It always seems like it is going to fall apart at any second.

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:44.822
I drove to Arizona and back yesterday.

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:48.800
The top three things that stress me out is not having enough time..*kid squeals*

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.440
All I want to do is relax.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.680
I just don't know how.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.540
*exhale*

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.860
Welcome to this guided meditation.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.320
Are you ready? Let's begin.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.680
Find a comfortable position.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.840
Close your eyes. Take a deep breath in.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.780
*Inhale*

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.120
And as you exhale, let you body begin to relax.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.440
Listen to the gentle purry of the happy kitten.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.580
Purrr

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.860
Purrr

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.580
Purrrrr

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.060
Now open your eyes.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.860
Meow!

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.460
*Cheerful music starts*

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.000
*Music Pauses* *Dog Wimpers*

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.140
*Cheerful Music resumes*

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.880
You can't be stressed after sitting in a box full of kittens.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.420
Being around young creatures just reminds you to take it easy.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.500
It was great, unexpected and adorable.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.388
Can I do that again?

00:02:48.388 --> 00:02:49.448
You want to do it again?

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:49.940
Yeah

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.660
Right now?

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.160
Yeah!
