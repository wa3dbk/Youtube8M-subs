00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.410
Based on the first-hand, nonfiction book of
the same-name by Marcus Luttrell, this American

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.170
war film was released nationwide on January
10, 2014, where it eventually tripled its

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.670
$50 million dollar budget. Mark Wahlberg stars
as Luttrell, an elite Navy SEAL who gets pinned

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.920
down in the rocky mountains of Afghanistan
after a anti-Taliban op goes south. Ben Foster,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.630
Taylor Kitsch, and Emile Hirsch portray his
intrepid squad-mates... and while we learn

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.189
almost nothing of their back stories, their
camaraderie and lived-in relationships feel

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.019
very believable. Facing impossible odds against
an incoming horde of nearly one hundred enemy

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.550
combatants, the foursome dig behind cover,
and attempt to survive until backup can arrive.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.690
Their performances truly sell the horrifying
circumstances of their situation, with every

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.020
glance between them carrying the weight of
their life-or-death struggle. Despite being

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.320
severely outnumbered, they maintain their
composure and determination, with Foster remarking

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.440
to himself regarding a Taliban fighter in
his sights, "You can die for your country,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.309
I'm gonna live for mine." As the title would
suggest however, their fates are unfortunately

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.840
a forgone conclusion, but the narrative is
no weaker because of this inherent spoiler.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.360
The brilliant, and Oscar-nominated sound design
is particularly noteworthy... especially during

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.250
a harrowing sequence when our heroes tumble
down a jagged cliff side, with bones cracking,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.220
and bullets whizzing all around them. The
R-rated adventure is often graphic, with blood

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.470
flying in all directions, but never gratuitously
so. The colorful language, gruesome violence,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.780
and loud explosions only lend to the film's
meticulous realism. The opening act is deliberately

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.240
slow... methodically building palpable tension
before the first shot is even fired. But once

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.159
the fighting begins, this seamlessly paced
121-minute story morphs into a whole new beast,

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.159
that rather effectively transports the viewer
inside an active war zone. For those who don't

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.810
watch until the end of the credits, you'd
be forgiven for assuming this picture was

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.090
filmed on-location in the rural hillsides
of Afghanistan, and not New Mexico. A minimalist

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.980
score from the rock band Explosions In The
Sky, and composer Steve Jablonsky is a droning

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.170
and appropriate background that suitably elevates
the mood without ever distracting. Director

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.510
Peter Berg balances the action in the field
with rescue efforts back at base, all filmed

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.790
via a handheld, anamorphic frame. With the
events of this story, and the war itself still

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.870
so fresh in the families' minds, special care
was taken to make sure they approved of the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.849
final portrayal - and the final treatment
is a respectful one, that honors their memories,

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.599
rather than exploiting them. Their Afghan
adversaries however, are given nary a line

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.629
of dialogue or development: just faceless
individuals for Walhberg's team to pick-off

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.830
one at a time with abrupt headshots. Although
the narrative isn't particularly deep, and

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.769
few real morals or lessons are ever learned
- this is a strong, and thrilling war film

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.140
for a new generation of soldiers, and one
I wouldn't mind watching again. "Lone Survivor",

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.400
"Shallow story surrounds disturbing experience."
Here's what you had to say in the YouTube

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.400
comments.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.709
Our final ratings for "Lone Survivor"... two
EIGHTS. Widely mixed, but still positive scores

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.920
for this picture, with everyone applauding
the realism and battle-scenes, you thought

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.360
it was GREAT. Highlighting the last moments
of brave men who fought and died for a caused

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.530
they believed in, this is a gripping and compelling
picture I'll be rating a GREAT as well.
