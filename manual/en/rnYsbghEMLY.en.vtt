00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.030
Hi, I’m Shane Epperly. Welcome to another
edition of our Clinical Massage Vlogging Series.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.180
Our regular clients are already quite familiar
with the feel and effectiveness of the Deep

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.390
Muscle Stimulator unit that we use during
our trigger points sessions. But for those

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.440
of you not fortunate enough to have experienced
the Deep Muscle Stimulator (DMS), or those

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.500
of you just curious about what the heck this
thing is, we thought we would pull back the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.830
curtain and reveal the “Mighty OZ!”
A lot of our clients want to marry it, others

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.610
just want to take it home for the weekend,
but most of our clients affectionately refer

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.670
to the DMS as "The Jackhammer," when coming
in for a treatment.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.540
I should take a moment and point out the fact
that this is not a paid endorsement, but rather

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.820
an unsolicited testimonial. Part of the goal
of these vlogs it to disseminate useful information

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.890
on all topics related to the business and
practice of Clinical Massage Therapy, to clients

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.810
and fellow Massage Therapists alike. We simply
hope that this information will be useful

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.620
for prospective clients who might be curious
about the DMS, as well as other Massage Therapists

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.950
who are looking for an effective tool to add
to their tool box.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.530
The DMS is an FDA-approved medical device.
The mechanism of action of Deep Muscle Stimulation

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.960
Massage involves providing deep muscle tissue
with kinetic forms of percussion and concussion

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.070
vibration at an unbelievable rate of 2200
RPM.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.570
Clients may remain fully clothed for these
sessions, as the vibration need not be applied

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
directly to the skin. But we have found it
to be most effective when used in combination

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.560
with manual therapy.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.759
DMS Massage is extremely effective in targeting
and dissolving adhesions and trigger points

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.530
and relieving pain relatively quickly and
comfortably. DMS Massage is most frequently

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.369
focused on one or more trouble spots, rather
than on the entire body.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:11.900
Let me give you a little bit of a sampling
of what if sounds like and looks like…

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.819
That feels wonderful.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.090
Ample amounts of water must be consumed following
a Deep Muscle Stimulation Massage session

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.340
in order to facilitate the removal of the
significant metabolic waste products that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.530
the dissolved trigger points release into
the blood stream.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.440
We never charge extra for the use of our DMS
unit. If we deem its use to be appropriate,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.500
it will be incorporated into your session
as a complimentary amenity.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.270
You can visit our website and find out more
information about the DMS, or go to this address

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.740
