00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.734
The Press:
"Hello, everybody."

00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:02.734
The President:
That was pretty good.

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:03.734
The Press:
I've been working on that.

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:04.734
The President:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:07.166
(laughter)

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.734
I was actually going
to say, "Good morning."

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:10.433
But I guess it's
afternoon by now.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:16.500
As part of the health care
reform law that I signed last

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.367
year, all insurance plans are
required to cover preventive

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.100
care at no cost.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.433
That means free check-ups,
free mammograms,

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:29.967
immunizations and
other basic services.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:35.033
We fought for this because it
saves lives and it saves money

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:39.900
-- for families, for businesses,
for government, for everybody.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.834
That's because it's a lot
cheaper to prevent an illness

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.834
than to treat one.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:47.667
We also accepted a
recommendation from the experts

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:51.934
at the Institute of Medicine
that when it comes to women,

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:55.400
preventive care should include
coverage of contraceptive

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.266
services such as birth control.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:01.333
In addition to family planning,
doctors often prescribe

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:05.066
contraception as a way to reduce
the risks of ovarian and other

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:09.066
cancers, and treat a variety
of different ailments.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:12.800
And we know that the overall
cost of health care is lower

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.900
when women have access to
contraceptive services.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.100
Nearly 99% of all women have
relied on contraception at some

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.633
point in their lives -- 99%.

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:28.900
And yet, more than half of all
women between the ages of 18 and

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.500
34 have struggled to afford it.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.500
So for all these reasons, we
decided to follow the judgment

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.533
of the nation's leading medical
experts and make sure that free

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:45.300
preventive care includes access
to free contraceptive care.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.500
Whether you're a teacher, or a
small businesswoman, or a nurse,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.900
or a janitor, no woman's health
should depend on who she is or

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.667
where she works or how
much money she makes.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:02.367
Every woman should be in control
of the decisions that affect

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:03.900
her own health.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.233
Period.

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:09.533
This basic principle is already
the law in 28 states across

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:11.633
the country.

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:15.266
Now, as we move to implement
this rule, however,

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:18.100
we've been mindful that there's
another principle at stake here

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.967
-- and that's the principle
of religious liberty,

00:02:20.967 --> 00:02:25.333
an inalienable right that is
enshrined in our Constitution.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:30.066
As a citizen and as a Christian,
I cherish this right.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:33.166
In fact, my first job in Chicago
was working with Catholic

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:37.967
parishes in poor neighborhoods,
and my salary was funded by a

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:40.000
grant from an arm of
the Catholic Church.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.667
And I saw that local churches
often did more good for a

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.400
community than a government
program ever could,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.867
so I know how important the work
that faith-based organizations

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:56.533
do and how much impact they
can have in their communities.

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:58.633
I also know that some
religious institutions --

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:01.233
particularly those affiliated
with the Catholic Church --

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:04.900
have a religious objection to
directly providing insurance

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.367
that covers contraceptive
services for their employees.

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:12.533
And that's why we originally
exempted all churches from this

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:16.233
requirement -- an exemption,
by the way, that eight states

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:18.133
didn't already have.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:21.233
And that's why, from the very
beginning of this process,

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:25.100
I spoke directly to various
Catholic officials,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.000
and I promised that before
finalizing the rule as it

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.834
applied to them, we would spend
the next year working with

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:35.734
institutions like Catholic
hospitals and Catholic

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:40.000
universities to find an
equitable solution that protects

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.967
religious liberty and ensures
that every woman has access to

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:46.233
the care that she needs.

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:49.433
Now, after the many genuine
concerns that have been raised

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:52.734
over the last few weeks,
as well as, frankly,

00:03:52.734 --> 00:03:55.633
the more cynical desire on the
part of some to make this into a

00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:59.367
political football, it became
clear that spending months

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:03.133
hammering out a solution was
not going to be an option,

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:05.633
that we needed to
move this faster.

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:08.867
So last week, I directed the
Department of Health and Human

00:04:08.867 --> 00:04:12.467
Services to speed up the
process that had already

00:04:12.467 --> 00:04:13.467
been envisioned.

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:15.200
We weren't going to
spend a year doing this;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.333
we're going to spend a
week or two doing this.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:22.300
Today, we've reached a decision
on how to move forward.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.533
Under the rule, women will still
have access to free preventive

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:30.533
care that includes
contraceptive services --

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:32.867
no matter where they work.

00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:36.033
So that core principle remains.

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:40.433
But if a woman's employer is a
charity or a hospital that has a

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:44.166
religious objection to providing
contraceptive services as part

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:47.934
of their health plan,
the insurance company --

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:50.133
not the hospital,
not the charity --

00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:53.433
will be required to reach
out and offer the woman

00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:56.200
contraceptive care
free of charge,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.533
without co-pays and
without hassles.

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.767
The result will be that
religious organizations won't

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:06.633
have to pay for these services,
and no religious institution

00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:09.266
will have to provide
these services directly.

00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:13.500
Let me repeat: These employers
will not have to pay for,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.633
or provide,
contraceptive services.

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:20.567
But women who work at these
institutions will have access to

00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:23.700
free contraceptive services,
just like other women,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.567
and they'll no longer have to
pay hundreds of dollars a year

00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:31.233
that could go towards paying
the rent or buying groceries.

00:05:31.233 --> 00:05:35.567
Now, I've been confident from
the start that we could work out

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:38.166
a sensible approach
here, just as I promised.

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:41.600
I understand some folks in
Washington may want to treat

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.333
this as another political wedge
issue, but it shouldn't be.

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:49.967
I certainly never
saw it that way.

00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:53.867
This is an issue where people of
goodwill on both sides of the

00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:58.367
debate have been sorting through
some very complicated questions

00:05:58.367 --> 00:06:02.200
to find a solution that
works for everyone.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.133
With today's announcement,
we've done that.

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:07.300
Religious liberty
will be protected,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.867
and a law that requires free
preventive care will not

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:14.166
discriminate against women.

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:18.834
We live in a pluralistic society
where we're not going to agree

00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:22.633
on every single issue,
or share every belief.

00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:25.700
That doesn't mean that we have
to choose between individual

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.767
liberty and basic fairness
for all Americans.

00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:33.233
We are unique among nations for
having been founded upon both

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:36.567
these principles, and our
obligation as citizens is to

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:37.967
carry them forward.

00:06:37.967 --> 00:06:41.066
I have complete faith
that we can do that.

00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:42.166
Thank you very much, everybody.
