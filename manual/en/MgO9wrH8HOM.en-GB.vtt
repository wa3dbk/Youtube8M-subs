00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.944
Forehand Net Deceptive Flick (3) take it in front of your body

00:00:04.387 --> 00:00:08.004
Next element for this one is

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:12.446
be able to take shuttlecock in front of your body

00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:16.093
this is crucially important

00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:16.925
Now

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.052
shuttle is there

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.271
watch my legs

00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:24.725
you should move

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:25.567
look

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:26.983
there

00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:29.113
and there

00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:32.108
so I see shuttle cock

00:00:32.108 --> 00:00:33.067
I see this corner

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:34.189
I see that corner

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:35.192
I see that corner

00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:36.776
I can see that corner

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:42.192
so all 4 corners are in my view

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:43.641
in my choices

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:49.026
after the shot I am already ready

00:00:50.807 --> 00:00:53.094
and because I see the corners

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.682
I hit it with vision

00:00:57.325 --> 00:01:00.605
but equally many players approach in this way

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:01.988
watch this please

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:03.997
so this is player A

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.308
shuttle is there

00:01:05.693 --> 00:01:08.933
they go straight to that way

00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.128
like that

00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:13.645
so they look that way

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:17.173
how can he do the cross net

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:19.101
I can't see that corner

00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:22.250
I can't see difficult to see that corner

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.190
further more

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.911
I hit it and then I have to look for the shuttlecock

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.337
after hitting like that my recovery will be slower than

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:34.691
I hit it I am ready now

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:36.100
hit and ready

00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:37.223
not

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:38.767
hit and then ready

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:40.122
it takes longer

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.725
ok ready like that

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:43.799
shuttle is there

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.144
go

00:01:45.524 --> 00:01:46.346
there

00:01:48.887 --> 00:01:49.742
again

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:51.742
hold there

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.786
now compare

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:55.325
now compare

00:01:56.274 --> 00:01:57.658
go there

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.266
go like this

00:02:02.045 --> 00:02:02.907
or

00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:05.074
go like that

00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:07.803
so I hit it with guess

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:09.574
compare again

00:02:09.794 --> 00:02:10.890
it should be

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.708
there

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:14.585
there

00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:17.745
there

00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:24.150
so the second point is move wide

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:27.739
don't follow the shuttlecock

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:29.966
you lose vision

00:02:31.872 --> 00:02:33.958
so look shuttlecock

00:02:35.036 --> 00:02:40.852
the direction of viewing all the corners

00:02:40.852 --> 00:02:42.552
not only shuttlecock

00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:47.787
Move wider and take shot in front of your body

00:02:47.787 --> 00:02:51.322
then you will be able to see all

00:02:53.418 --> 00:02:56.777
