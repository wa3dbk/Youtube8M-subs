00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.040
We are going to cover rider's safety as they
are mounted. We are very committed and all

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.350
of our riders do wear helmets. Not only as
mentors to the young children that ride with

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.809
us but also because as trainers we have all
heard and/or experienced the incident of another

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.339
experienced rider who has had that unfortunate
fall. So we start out with a good fitting

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.519
helmet. Our rider today has chosen one that
when I place or put my hands on the helmet

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.210
and move the head, the head should move with
the helmet. We also want to make sure that

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.840
the ear pieces are tucked up there underneath
your earlobe so that securely fastens it from

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.230
front to back. And then our chin pieces is
secure enough that this helmet will not fall

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.420
off in the event of a fall. Our rider is going
to make sure that their saddle is in fact

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.120
properly put on. Fastened to all the secure
pieces, so that when we try, that when we

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.780
get on, we can be certain that we have made
that final check to be sure that our saddle

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.690
is not going to loosen as we ride along today.
Our back girth or back cinch should also be

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.200
snug enough that the horse's leg could not,
in a quick and handy move, the horse's leg

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.560
could not come up and get itself catch in
there. It needs to be somewhat loose; just

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.969
enough so it doesn't provide any discomfort
to the horse which could cause them to misbehave.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.950
Many a horse will buck if this cinch is too
tight. So that is where the name bucking strap

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.320
did once come from. We want to be sure our
bridle is in fact, well fitting, it's secure

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.259
enough, loose enough that it's comfortable
but it also has some sort of a device that's

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.369
going to keep it in place. This is a one ear
bridle. This piece here is going ensure that

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.189
this bridle doesn't slip too far back or in
fact get, move forward enough when a horse

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.790
is shaking his head or any other kind of movement
that could bring this bridle off of the horse's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.200
head. We want to be sure that our stirrups
are even. We like to look from the front to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.020
that the knees are level and that the foot
is in its good place. Because, as we ride

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.929
along, we are going to want to ensure that
we are balanced with the horse. And anything

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.130
that brings us to be off balance will make
that a discomfort throughout the ride. So

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.399
this rider has herself in a good position.
She's got enough of a knee bend and a foot

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.670
position where her foot can rest lightly in
the stirrup and keep her secure through the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.789
ride.
