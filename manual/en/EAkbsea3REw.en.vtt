00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.899
Two Ingredient Takeover.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.440
Hi there and welcome to Mind Over Munch

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.350
two ingredient takeover where I make delicious
recipes out of two simple ingredients.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.420
Today I'm making my two ingredient mozzarella
cheese sticks. The two ingredients are

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.520
mozzarella string cheese

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.700
and won-ton wrappers.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.110
Start by cutting your mozzarella cheese
steak into quarters

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.820
First widthwise and then lengthwise. Set them aside.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.440
You can cut these cheese sticks in half
but I like to get more bang for my

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.910
nutritional buck by cutting them into quarters.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.940
Layout a single wonton wrapper with a little bit of water

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.100
on the side. Dip your finger into the
water and wet the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.190
edges of your wonton wrapper. Place one
of your string cheese quarters onto the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.500
wonton wrapper and roll it up completely.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.220
Use your finger to wet the seam to seal
it and then press down on the sides of the cheese stick.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.080
Use a fork to crimp those edges. Secure and cute.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.130
Be sure to place these inside a plastic
bag or underneath some plastic wrap so

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.140
that they don't dry out while you're working.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.320
Optional third ingredient brush some egg
whites onto your cheese sticks.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.210
This isn't necessary but will help them
brown up a little bit more in the oven.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.060
Then a place them onto a large baking
sheet lined with parchment paper

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.759
and sprayed. Place in an oven preheated
to 375 degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.680
for 8 to 10 minutes. These babes
will be HOT so be sure to let them cool for

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.290
a bit before you devour.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.540
Today I used a part skim mozzarella
cheese stick which is totally fine and

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.770
delicious but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.049
if you're looking for a really gooey
cheese stick and are feeling a little

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.810
bit more nutritionally indulgent

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.829
you could always use a full fat string
cheese. And there you have it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.549
your two ingredient mozzarella cheese
sticks. So much healthier and away less

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.899
greasy than the original.
