00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.180
Welcome to Xyron's Inspiration in Motion.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.180
You already love Xyron products for their
use in scrapbooking, but did you also know

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.240
that Xyron is terrific for kids' crafts, home
decor, school projects and more.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.720
We've created some short project videos to
get your creative juices flowing.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.960
So, come on in!

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.820
Beth Kingston: Hi, I'm Beth Kingston and this
is my friend, Jessica Barnett and we cannot

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.800
get enough of glitter and so we are going
to just glue the shadang out of something

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.800
today.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.781
We are going to show you guys how to do it
and it is all using Xyron products and we

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.840
are going to make this darling little house
that would be perfect as a gift or to put

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.640
in your little foyer for Christmas.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.970
I know it would all be good.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.970
Jessica Barnett: So cute!

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.970
Beth Kingston: Any who.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.980
So, we've already, as you can see, pre-...
done a little bit of work.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.430
This is actually a chipboard house that you
can buy at any mass craft store and what we've

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.540
already done is we've taken the roof and painted
it white and while it was still wet we shook

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.240
glitter on it and shook it off.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.460
We've been glittering all day today.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.780
it's been spectacular and then let that dry.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.140
We've also painted the house with sort of
like a like you do for your own room, the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.610
bathroom I am currently redecorating and then
we also painted the bottom green and again,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.220
while the bottom was wet, shook the glitter
on and let it dry.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.540
That's currently the point we're at right
now.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.110
So, what we are going to do now is show you
how to create these darling, they look like

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.290
glass window panes and we are going to do
that using Xyron and glitter.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.310
We've already run some transparencies through
and Jessica's going to go ahead and get started

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.720
with the fun glitteriness...

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.890
Jessica Barnett: Yes.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.920
Beth Kingston: ...while I use the 5 inch Creative
Station and I am going to put on the templates

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.100
that we've already cut out.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.600
So, I'm running these through the 5 inch Creative
Station.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.000
How is the glittering going over there?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.820
Tell the folks at home what you did.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.260
Jessica Barnett: I just stuck those on the
insides so that the only adhesive that's showing

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.010
is just the little bit right inside the windows.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.770
Just going to finish shaking it around.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.160
Beth Kingston: I'm also going to go ahead
and work on the pieces for the roof that are

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.560
already completed.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.590
Xyron has an entire field of products: 1.5
inch, 2.5 inch, 5 inch, 9 inch.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.190
So, I'm just going to be using... this is
our 1.5 inch Create-A-Sticker, which is just

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.209
the cutest thing ever.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.160
So, I'm going to use that for our little tiny
pieces.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.050
You can actually fit several pieces at once.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.940
Kind of guide them along with your fingers,
pull the tab right here and that's going to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.560
come out and make everything sticky.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.419
How is it going over there?

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.582
Jessica Barnett: I think it's pretty good.

00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:00.960
Beth Kingston: That does look cute!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.650
Here, do you want to start sticking on our
sides, our edges?

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.980
Jessica Barnett: I don't know.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.910
I'm a little glittery right now.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.299
Beth Kingston: Are you a little glittery?

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.299
And we are adhesing.

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.299
Jessica Barnett: Okay.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:23.690
Beth Kingston: Alright, let's put the little
Howdy Doodies on the house.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.959
I'll work on the roof.

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.959
And the other little nice thing too is when
you are using, for example, we used the Xyron

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.650
to put the glue on the windows, if you were
to do that with liquid glue, you would have

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.019
to set this aside for probably a good 2 hours
to let it dry without having to worry about

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.060
touching it.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.959
With the Xyron machine it is essentially dry
instantly, so that makes it perfect.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.340
You can just zip right along.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.269
Jessica Barnett: And one of the ways you can
set glitter so that it's not so much everywhere

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.270
is to give a little sprits of an aerosol hairspray.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.270
Beth Kingston: I like the hairspray idea.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.130
Jessica Barnett: Not a ton, just like a quick
little sprits and that helps set it into place.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.709
Beth Kingston: You're a genius as usual, and
see how quickly this comes together, once

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.329
you have everything cut out.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:19.290
So, this is a great last minute gift or little
piece of home decor.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.239
Look at how cute we are!

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.260
Okay, then we turn on our little magical candles,
which I think are so cute and you can buy

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.770
these again at any craft store.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.770
Put on the lid.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.330
Jessica Barnett: And you can see the light
without having to look at the actual candle.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.460
Am I putting the lid on backwards?

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.120
Beth Kingston: No, we're good.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.120
Yeah.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120
Perfect!

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.120
Fantastical.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120
We make a fine pair.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.310
This is a great project.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.849
