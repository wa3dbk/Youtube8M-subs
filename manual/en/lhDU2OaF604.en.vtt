00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.889
The community here at Westfield State is absolutely
ideal. It's small so you can get to know everyone.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.370
There's always people to meet.
The thing that attracted me to Westfield was

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.189
the campus, primarily...just it being small,
open.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.210
I think our campus is beautiful. It's a nice
small size. There's the green in the middle

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.270
that kids can play sports on. Everything is
in walking distance. I think the farthest

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.820
classroom is less than 15 minutes away.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.900
This campus has to one of the most beautiful
campuses in Massachusetts. I did go look at

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.550
all the state schools and I did pick this
one because of the campus. I love the way

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.299
that it's all centered around this big green
where everyone can go outside and hangout.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:46.839
The campus at Westfield State, with the green
in the middle and the globe and everybody...

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.710
It's a great atmosphere and you include Stanley
Park across the street from campus. Everybody's

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.330
kind of out, especially when the weather is
nice.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.390
I love going to Stanley Park. It's great for
hikes, for walking.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.390
I like the green grasses. I like the trees.
You know, in China, there is not enough space

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.920
for you to have so many green grass here.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.730
The school also has lots of big white chairs that kids can sit on, hangout, and just talk
with their friends, especially on nice days

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.490
like this.
Everything is so nice. This place is to relax

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.600
in the sun, play football, play basketball—just
anything you want to do on campus, you can.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.180
I would describe the campus like its own little
city. I love when it's nice out like today,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.590
you go outside and all the grass areas are
packed and you see people are playing baseball.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.640
You don't ever have to leave campus for anything.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.520
So what's happening today on campus is this
end of the year huge event. They've got fun

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.770
things like snow cones, fried doe, and bouncy
houses. Everything like that so that all the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.610
students can go out and have a lot of fun.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.010
The thing that attracted me to Westfield was
the faculty. They hold their professors to

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.210
a standard that blows me away. They really
are very knowledgeable.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.520
The faculty really encourages you to get to
know them.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.409
Professors here are very friendly and very
close to you. You can easily talk to them.

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.630
They give you their phone number, their email.
They always recommend that you call them,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.580
email them—they really care about your education
and your learning.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.970
You can go to them for any problems and they're
always there for you. They work with you.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.700
They're really friendly and I love them.
Ultimately, the deciding factor for me was

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.980
the atmosphere at Westfield. I talked to a
couple students here, a lot of the faculty

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.560
in the administrative offices, and they all
just seemed like great people.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.200
It just felt like the right fit for me.
