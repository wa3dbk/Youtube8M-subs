00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.689
Samsung Galaxy S6 Tipped to Sport Full Aluminium
Body, Dual-Edge Display

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:12.240
Following the previous rumour of the yet-to-be-announced
Samsung Galaxy S6 sporting a half-metal body,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.460
the anticipated Samsung flagship is now being
tipped by an Italian blog to sport a complete

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.410
aluminium build.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.340
Notably, Samsung has already launched its
full-metal handset range, the Galaxy A series.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.540
The Samsung Galaxy S6, in-line with an earlier
report, is also being tipped by the blog to

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.140
sport a 'dual-edge' display that will be curved
on the both (right and left) sides.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.260
Notably, Samsung's first smartphone to feature
an 'edge display' is the Galaxy Note Edge.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.480
Notably, the purported Galaxy S6 with a curved
display may be the rumoured Galaxy S6 Edge

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.340
instead, which an earlier report claimed would
launch alongside the Galaxy S6.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.230
Sammobile had claimed that like the Samsung
Galaxy Note 4 and the limited edition Galaxy

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:14.590
Note Edge variant, Samsung will launch a Galaxy
S6 Edge variant alongside the Galaxy S6.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.270
Earlier this month a purported variant of
the Samsung Galaxy S6 was spotted on the AnTuTu

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.100
benchmark site along with some detailed specifications.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.560
The benchmark listing of the alleged Samsung
Galaxy S6 (SM-G925F) shows the device running

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.140
Android 5.0 Lollipop out-of-the-box on a 64-bit
octa-core Exynos 7420 processor alongside

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.690
Mali-T760 GPU and 3GB of RAM, in-line with
earlier reports.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.740
Notably, the SM-G925F model number of the
Samsung Galaxy S5 successor is one of the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.430
several expected region-based model numbers
of the Galaxy S6 that was reported earlier.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:15.890
According to the leaked model numbers of the
Galaxy S6, the SM-G925F is a European variant

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.610
of the flagship.
