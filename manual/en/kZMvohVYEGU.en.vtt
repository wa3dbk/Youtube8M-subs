00:00:04.383 --> 00:00:06.110
BENNO WILLEIT: Why come
here to Andorra?

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.850
It has been a little bit of time
in between Val di Sole

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.350
and here now.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.310
We have a few highlights
in between.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.220
We had Mountain Bike
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.360
World Championship, where
Kristof won the race.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.980
And now we're here for
the World Cup.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.700
We had the leader of the MotoGP,
who can pick up a new

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.030
bike that he got from
Specialized, custom painted.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.050
We were very stoked to have
someone like him here to show

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.660
him what we do.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.210
MARC MARQUEZ: Yeah, normally for
my physical condition, I

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.560
train with motor bike.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.280
So it's very good
for my training.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.350
One day I would like to try
downhill, because it's like

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.170
more or less what I
like on the bikes.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.060
You need to take out a lot
of risks, and that--

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.550
I like it.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.450
BENNO WILLEIT: And the second
highlight for this event is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.610
definitely the new bike that
we got from Specialized.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.550
It's the new S-Works
2014 29er Epic.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.810
The race style of the
cross country event

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.570
has changed a lot.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.890
For that reason, we came
out with a new bike.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.840
So we shortened the chain
stay on the back.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.230
Also oversized, so it makes
the bike much stiffer.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.370
The wheelbase is shorter now,
then also the head tube

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.360
shorter, then the steering
angle also sharper.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.330
So it makes the bike corner
faster, going through those

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.720
tight turns much quicker, you
can carry the speed with.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.190
Also the rear shock got a little
bit downsized, so that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.540
we were able to save
some weight there.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.510
The Brain technology--

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.710
we kept that, of course.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.020
Everybody likes the performance
of the Brain

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.120
suspension.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.670
You can be focused on the speed,
on the turns, on your

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.310
riding style.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.200
You don't have to think
about, should I

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.790
lock, should I unlock?

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.610
We have integrated cables now.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.160
So the down tube
is very clean.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.690
Just needs one wipe, and you
drop about 200, 300 grams

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.460
right there with just
taking the mud off.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.860
We sized down the seat post
from 30.9 to 27.2.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.280
First of all, it makes
the bike lighter.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.730
It gave us also much more
space around the bottom

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.680
bracket that we can use to
oversize the tubing.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.060
Overall stiffness with the
through axle is way bigger

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.630
than with a normal
quick release.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.500
We have that now,
front and rear.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.500
You got two bottle cages now.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.900
The SWAT is a little package
that you can attach to the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.090
frame just next to the bottle
cage, where you can fit all

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.380
your tools.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.370
Everything is on the bike.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.280
You grab the bike and you go off
and you ride and have fun.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.220
JAROSLAV KULHAVY: Yeah, I
look forward for first

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.150
race on this bike.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.090
It's shorter, much stiffer, much
better in the corners and

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.440
the technical section.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.770
The course is a little bit old
school, because it's not so

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.710
much technical, just single
trails, roots and stones, and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.500
a lot of grass.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.340
The first climb is
on the grass.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.860
It's pretty slow.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.975
But then is a good long climb
on the gravel, and I mean it

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:53.080
will be good for me.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.930
KOHEI YAMAMOTO: And now
it's dry condition.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.823
So maybe tomorrow,
very high speed.

00:02:59.823 --> 00:03:03.000
On the downhill,
it's very easy.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.850
ANNIKA LANGVAD: It's
very high altitude.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.070
It's around 2,000 meters here,
so that definitely plays an

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.230
important factor
here, as well.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.780
Myself, I spent the last two
weeks here at the altitude.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.320
Hopefully I feel a whole
lot better than I

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.920
did in Val di Sole.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.410
Now finally I'm finding
my power again.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.380
So I'm really, really looking
forward to the race.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.631
TEREZA HURIKOVA: When
I did the fast

00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.280
slip, it took me like--

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.370
I think 18 minutes.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.650
So I don't think
it's so short.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.450
But it's so little technical,
and so many parts is on the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.210
gravel or on the grass.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.040
So it's quite bumpy.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.400
And I think it will be
a lot of suffering.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.215
And very physical
race, especially

00:03:48.215 --> 00:03:49.465
in this high altitude.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.290
ANNIKA LANGVAD: Straight away,
I'm into the first climb.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.390
I was almost in the top--

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.790
I don't know, two, five,
or something--

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.810
really, really good.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.620
And then I made a mistake on
the very steep descent,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.180
because my front wheel
washed out.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.730
It was tough coming back.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.375
I fought the best I could--

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:30.630
like, felt I couldn't go over my
limit and so I just focused

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.390
on keeping my rhythm
from there.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.550
So, yeah, I did my best.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.470
TEREZA HURIKOVA: In the middle
of the race I felt already a

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.980
really nice speed.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.840
But then I broke a chain, and I
had to run like half a lap.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.040
All the girls passed me.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.620
But I thought, it's important
to finish the race even if

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.030
it's such a bad luck.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.900
JAROSLAV KULHAVY: New bike was
perfect at the technical

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.320
section and the corners.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.260
But my body was bad today.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.470
Bike was perfect but we
must go together.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.760
I didn't go over 80% of
my limits, and then

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.630
I was really dead.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.950
I don't know what is the
problem, maybe some sickness.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.830
So I'm very sad.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.340
And back home and check up
everything, and I will see.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.770
KOHEI YAMAMOTO: Yeah, they
had for this [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.830
not good.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.210
BENNO WILLEIT: Well, today's
racing definitely not went the

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.190
way we want it to, because
we came here to win.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.570
But sometimes racing is
different than you

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.260
think it will be.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.240
Definitely today was
a day like that.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.890
From here we go heads up
into the next race.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.640
Make sure we make it better
than here, and, yeah.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.890
That's what it is.
