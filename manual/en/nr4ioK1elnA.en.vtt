00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.430
Hi! Today we are going to show you how to
clean some fresh shrimp and I say fresh only

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.990
because previously frozen shrimp tends to
be a little fishy if you will. A lot of times

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.500
when people have had seafood they tend to
be very strong, it's because its been previously

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.529
frozen before and it was stored differently
and once it was thawed it may have sat at

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.460
room temperature a little too long and things
of that nature. So I am using some fresh shrimp

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.070
today just because if you can get a hold of
it during the summertime, it's a good thing.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.239
These are wild shrimp as well. They are not
farm raised. So this size here is about a

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.399
2125 which means there is about 21 to 25 of
these per pound as far as that goes. These

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.340
are some Gulf white shrimp. So these have
already had the heads removed so we are just

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.660
going to peel the rings of shell off along
with the legs, and I am going to leave the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.340
tail on. We've got some other videos coming
and we are going to show you how to make the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.670
shrimp into quite a few different things.
But I usually just leave the tail on for a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.300
multitude of recipes. I've got here just a
paring knife and I am going to go along the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.680
back of the shrimp there and we are just going
to remove this vein with our fingers because

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.210
we don't want to eat that. In a sense, this
is just when you ask for or when you order

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.520
from a fish market peeled and deveined shrimp,
this is exactly what you are going to get.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.740
This is the finished product right here. Now
in the event you want to butterfly the shrimp

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.630
which we are actually going to do on a couple
of other recipes, what I will do is take that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.500
same cut that I just made with my paring knife
and just go a little further down into the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:02:02.920
flesh of the shrimp. Not too far, I want to
leave some substance there and that is a butterfly

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.420
shrimp.
