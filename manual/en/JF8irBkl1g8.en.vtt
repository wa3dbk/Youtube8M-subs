00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.510
We've gone over all different types of stencils.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:17.039
What I want to go over right now is a little
more advanced with the stencil and the artwork,

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.210
as far as skateboarding goes.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.740
You know, you don't always have to be the
guy going down 14 sets of stairs.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.160
You can be the guy designing the graphic of
the kid using that board.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.260
Or maybe he's wearing your sweatshirt.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:38.160
So I'm going to show you some examples of
some, basically a next-level stencil.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.640
And the funniest thing about this stencil
is that it's from the 80s.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.710
Here's an example of the artwork.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.219
The artwork was done by a friend of Shut's
in the mid-80s.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.800
From there, this all-over print on a board,
kind of ahead of its time.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.890
This one here we've created from the negative
space off of this one here.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:16.050
We've done some artwork with this one for
t-shirts, sweatshirts, a lining of a jacket.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.759
Here's the example of two hoodies that were
made with this similar graphic.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.909
We've also done the hat in multiple colors,
as well as this one here, this.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.860
And it's kind of cool where you can paint
a lot of the original graphics and create

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.160
stencils with them.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:51.700
We've even gone as far as taking some of our
stock logos, right here, so matching here

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.310
from the stencils.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.750
This kind of stencil for the grip, the best
way to do these is if you print out the image

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.430
or take the image and upload it into your
computer, and it you reverse or turn it around.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.170
You can do that in Photoshop.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.580
Once you've printed it out, then you can apply
it to the back of this to get the cutout so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.150
it will show the correct way.
