00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.000
Donna: The benefits of attending the forum
here at OCR are the fact that I actually get

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.760
to have a say in the qualifications as they're
being developed and renewed, and you can actually

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.730
see a link between what we say here in the
forum and actually changes being made 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.220
to the qualifications. I feel like that you
have a real impact.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.620
Female (VO) 1: OCR is part of the oldest exam board in the U.K., but we're committed to developing

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.050
qualifications that are fresh, cutting-edge,
and above all, engaging and stimulating for

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.390
students. We want to make our qualifications
the best they possibly can be. But it is almost

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.020
impossible for an exam board to do this in
isolation. Here at OCR, that's Oxford, Cambridge,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.250
and RSA Examinations, it's just a point of
principle that we get views from

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.610
across the education community. This is why, for some years now, we have been running regular subject forums.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.800
Female 2: A big welcome to what is our now
the seventh consultative forum.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.490
Female 1: This is where we invite a wide range of experts to meet with us for 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.080
two-way discussion. These experts are subject specialists, universities, employers, and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.130
arguably the greatest experts in education,
teachers. Teachers have a deep passion for

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.650
their subject and are far from being passive
recipients for qualifications. 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.020
They have important views that exam boards need to hear.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.460
Donna: I also feel quite strongly that if
we want OCR to create qualifications that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.030
are user-friendly for our students and staff
in schools, that we have to have an input

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.939
in that. So it's our real duty to do that.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.740
Female 1: At our forums, we give members up-to-date
information about our vision for a subject

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.630
as well as any regulatory changes. Their feedback helps to develop new qualifications and to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.549
be more informed in our official responses
in consultations. 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.780
Female 3: Because I think it's really important that we're working with quite a number of

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.820
teachers actually, but otherwise, there's
the risk of bringing out something that teachers

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.209
just don't feel prepared sufficiently to actually take upon and teach.

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.139
Female 1: The OCR subject forums 
have allowed us to consult with nearly a thousand

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:23.049
experts. We have forums on more than 14 subjects, including all the key ones undergoing reform

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.549
and many others. Those who attend the forums like to come for three main reasons. Firstly,

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.040
they can express their views about
the development of qualifications.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.769
Brian: I think that is the key benefit of
it. I believe that everybody here is treated

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.500
equally and all their views are very much
valued. I personally relish the opportunity

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.000
to make a contribution, have my
voice heard in these contemporary debates.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.410
Debra: I think what's impressed me is just
how genuinely consultative they've been and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.519
how vibrant the discussions have been. I've really enjoyed that.

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.169
Female 1: Secondly, forum members get plenty of up-to-date information from

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:06.150
us about the way exams are designed, crucial at this time of major reform to GCSEs

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.470
and A-levels. Discussion at the forums covers all areas, from subject content to core structure

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.699
and marking systems to classroom sources.

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.269
Female 4: We currently have 40% grade of English literature.

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.269
Female 5: There is a Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, substantial selection of poetry,

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.889
including romantic poetry. That was a triumph right at the very last minute.

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.720
Male 1: For making students think as literary critics.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.100
Donna: I'm responsible for GCSE English
at school. One of the great things about the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.889
forum is I get to meet people from lots of
different sectors, so I can see where how

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.850
GSCE. English fits in with all
the other English qualifications.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.180
Debra: Well, I work in higher education. I'm in a graduate school of education, and I'm

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.780
responsible for training secondary PGCE
English teachers. Obviously one big element

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.150
of training them is preparing them
for the examinations that they will be teaching.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.620
Female 1: The final benefit is that forums
are a great place for networking. Dozens of

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.410
schools and six form colleges are members of this English forum. Alongside academics

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.600
from universities of all types, representatives from Shakespeare's Globe and the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.769
Royal Shakespeare Company, learning societies and professional associations, the British

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.860
Library, and many more. Bringing everyone together allows us to deepen and broaden the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.730
conversation about what an English education might look like. 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.980
Debra: It just gives me a rare opportunity
actually to network with stakeholders in English

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.620
teaching on a very broad basis. The fact that there are representatives from other H.E.I.s,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.270
from schools, from subject associations, and things like the Royal Shakespeare 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.150
Company. It's rare to get that opportunity
to come together and discuss English teaching

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.870
with so many different stakeholders, so I
feel I've gained an enormous amount from it.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.810
Female 1: With such a wealth of expertise and the passion in the room, we hope our subject

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.010
forums will continue to help us design 
excellent qualifications, qualifications that

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.730
are as relevant and engaging as they possibly
can be.
