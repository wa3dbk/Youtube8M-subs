Carrington-class CME Narrowly Misses Earth

In mid-April, scientists, government officials, emergency planners

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.760 position:97%
and others converged on Boulder, Colorado, for NOAA's Space Weather Workshop

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.720 position:97%
an annual gathering to discuss the perils and probabilities of solar storms.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.810 position:97%
The current solar cycle is weaker than usual, so you might expect a correspondingly low-key meeting.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.940 position:98%
On the contrary, the halls and meeting rooms were abuzz with excitement

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.440 position:88%
about an intense solar storm that narrowly missed Earth.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.180 position:72%
The close shave happened almost two years ago.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.180 position:97%
On July 23, 2012, a plasma cloud or "CME" rocketed away from the sun as fast as 3000 km/s,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.760 position:97%
more than four times faster than a typical eruption. The storm tore through Earth orbit,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.590 position:97%
but fortunately Earth wasn't there. It did however, hit the STEREO-A spacecraft.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.140 position:81%
Researchers have been analyzing the data ever since,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.880 position:97%
and they have concluded that the storm was one of the strongest in recorded history.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.070 position:97%
"If it had hit Earth, we would still be picking up the pieces," says Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.960 position:97%
who presented a talk entitled The Major Solar Eruptive Event in July 2012: Defining Extreme Space Weather Scenarios.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.240 position:98%
"This storm might have been stronger than the Carrington Event itself."

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.870 position:97%
The Carrington Event of Sept. 1859 was a series of powerful CMEs that hit Earth head-on,

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.530 position:75%
sparking Northern Lights as far south as Tahiti.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.870 position:97%
Intense geomagnetic storms caused global telegraph lines to spark,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.210 position:97%
setting fire to some telegraph offices and disabling the 'Victorian Internet."

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.050 position:97%
A similar storm today could have a catastrophic effect on modern power grids and telecommunication networks.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.270 position:97%
According to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, the total economic impact could exceed $2 trillion

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.530 position:91%
or 20 times greater than the costs of a Hurricane Katrina.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.430 position:98%
Multi-ton transformers fried by such a storm could take years to repair and impact national security.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.780 position:97%
A recent paper in Nature Communications authored by UC Berkeley space physicist Janet G. Luhmann

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.840 position:98%
and former postdoc Ying D. Liu describes what gave the July 2012 storm Carrington-like potency.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.380 position:97%
For one thing, the CME was actually two CMEs separated by only 10 to 15 minutes.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.700 position:98%
This double storm cloud traveled through a region of space that had been cleared out by another CME only four days earlier.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.570 position:98%
As a result, the CMEs were not decelerated as much as usual by their transit through the interplanetary medium.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.240 position:98%
Had the eruption occurred just one week earlier, the blast site would have been facing Earth,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.590 position:97%
rather than off to the side, so it was a relatively narrow escape.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.430 position:97%
When the Carrington event enveloped Earth in the 19th century,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.950 position:97%
technologies of the day were hardly sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.490 position:97%
Modern society, on the other hand, is deeply dependent on sun-sensitive technologies

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.140 position:86%
such as GPS, satellite communications and the internet.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.700 position:97%
"The effect of such a storm on our modern technologies would be tremendous," says Luhmann.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.640 position:98%
During informal discussions at the workshop, Nat Gopalswamy of the Goddard Space Flight Center noted that

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.440 position:98%
"without NASA's STEREO probes, we might never have known the severity of the 2012 superstorm.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.570 position:98%
This shows the value of having 'space weather buoys' located all around the sun."

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.330 position:97%
It also highlights the potency of the sun even during so-called "quiet times."

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.230 position:98%
Many observers have noted that the current solar cycle is weak, perhaps the weakest in 100 years.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.470 position:98%
Clearly, even a weak solar cycle can produce a very strong storm.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.400 position:58%
Says Baker, "We need to be prepared."

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:02.142 position:98%
