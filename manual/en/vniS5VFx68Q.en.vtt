00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:02.131
A street light is at the top

00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:04.199
of an 18 foot tall pole.

00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:06.671
A woman six feet fall
walks away from the pole

00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:10.412
with a speed of four feet per
second along a straight path.

00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:12.654
How fast is the tip of her shadow moving

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:16.249
when she is 45 feet from
the base of the pole?

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.999
Let's let this be the light pole.

00:00:22.232 --> 00:00:23.757
We know it's 18 feet tall,

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:28.124
so we know the length
of this segment here.

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:30.048
We know the woman is six feet tall

00:00:30.048 --> 00:00:32.143
and walking away from the pole.

00:00:32.143 --> 00:00:34.893
Let's let this be the woman here.

00:00:37.363 --> 00:00:39.458
And we know she's six feet tall,

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:42.625
so we can label this segment six feet.

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:47.716
Because she's walking in this direction,

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:50.927
notice how this segment here

00:00:50.927 --> 00:00:53.760
would be the length of the shadow.

00:00:56.413 --> 00:00:59.593
Also notice we have two similar triangles.

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:01.503
We have this large right triangle,

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:04.005
and we have this smaller right triangle.

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.295
Let's go ahead and let
this entire length here

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:07.462
be equal to y,

00:01:08.737 --> 00:01:12.904
and let's let the distance from
the pole to the woman be x.

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:16.973
Notice if we label it this way,

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:18.795
the length of the shadow would be

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:22.842
the longer length y minus
the shorter length x,

00:01:22.842 --> 00:01:23.925
or y minus x.

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:30.171
Now because the woman
is walking at a speed

00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:32.042
of four feet per second,

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:34.535
that would be how fast x is changing,

00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:36.992
therefore we know that dx, dt,

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:39.139
the change in x with respect to t,

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:43.226
is equal to positive four feet per second.

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:46.895
X is increasing, therefore
we know this is is positive.

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:48.564
We also want to determine how fast

00:01:48.564 --> 00:01:50.432
the tip of her shadow is moving

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:53.379
when she is 45 feet from
the base of the pole,

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:57.046
which means when x equals 45, or 45 feet.

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:03.818
To determine how fast the
tip her shadow is moving,

00:02:03.818 --> 00:02:08.326
when x equals 45, we can
find how fast y is changing,

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:09.159
or dy, dt.

00:02:10.185 --> 00:02:12.685
So our goal is to find dy, dt.

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:16.070
Now we need an equation relating x and y

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.901
so we can then find the
derivative with respect to t,

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.792
and then use this
information to find dy, dt.

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:24.163
And again, because we
have similar triangles,

00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:26.539
we can set up a
proportion, cross multiply,

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:28.020
and solve for y.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.514
So looking at the larger right triangle

00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:31.320
and the smaller right triangle,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.820
notice this side corresponds to this side.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.296
So we can say 18 to six must equal,

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.916
now again, looking at
the large right triangle,

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:49.083
this side here, which would
be y, must correspond to

00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:54.596
this shorter length
here, which is y minus x.

00:02:54.596 --> 00:02:57.263
So we can say y is to y minus x.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.904
This'll be our equation
that relates x and y,

00:03:02.904 --> 00:03:05.271
so let's solve this equation for y.

00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:08.875
We could simplify 18 divided
by six, that would be three.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.495
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:12.859
Again write that as three over one

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.359
equals y divided by y minus x.

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:20.924
Now let's go ahead and cross
multiply and solve for y.

00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:23.007
So one times y must equal

00:03:23.897 --> 00:03:27.047
three times the quantity y minus x.

00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:29.978
So again we'd have, one
times y is y must equal

00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:32.895
three times the quantity y minus x.

00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:38.145
Let's go ahead and distribute the three.

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:41.645
So we have y equals three y minus three x.

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:44.841
Subtract three y on both sides,

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:49.012
that would give us negative
two y equals negative three x.

00:03:49.012 --> 00:03:51.845
Divide both sides by negative two.

00:03:53.448 --> 00:03:56.949
Notice how we have the equation y equals

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.699
three halves times x.

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:03.073
So this is the equation
that relates x and y.

00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:06.475
So now we'll find the
derivative with respect to t,

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:08.098
solve for dy, dt,

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:11.617
and then perform substitution
using the given information.

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:14.424
Let's go ahead and finish
this on the next slide.

00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:16.902
Now take the derivative of
both sides with respect to t,

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:19.319
we'd have the derivative of y

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:23.079
with respect to t must equal

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:27.246
the derivative of three
halves x with respect to t.

00:04:29.628 --> 00:04:31.533
Because we're differentiating
with respect to t,

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:34.124
we do have to apply the
chain rule on both sides.

00:04:34.124 --> 00:04:35.822
The derivative y with
respect to t would be

00:04:35.822 --> 00:04:38.572
one times dy, dt, or just dy, dt.

00:04:41.373 --> 00:04:44.374
Equals the derivative of three
halves x with respect to t

00:04:44.374 --> 00:04:47.291
would be three halves times dx, dt.

00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:54.138
Remember our goal here is to find dy, dt,

00:04:54.138 --> 00:04:57.016
and now we can because we know dx, dt.

00:04:57.016 --> 00:04:59.556
Notice how dy, dt is actually
going to be a constant

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:01.932
based upon how fast the person is moving.

00:05:01.932 --> 00:05:05.015
It's not dependent on the value of x.

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:11.196
So dy, dt, in this case,
is going to be equal to

00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:15.363
three halves times dx, dt,
which is four feet per second.

00:05:22.506 --> 00:05:24.311
Notice here, the four
and the two simplify.

00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:27.701
There's one two in two,
and two twos in four,

00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:31.201
so dy, dt is equal to six feet per second,

00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:38.434
which is how fast the tip
of her shadow is moving

00:05:38.434 --> 00:05:41.514
when she is 45 feet from
the base of the pole,

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:43.856
or actually from any
distance from the pole

00:05:43.856 --> 00:05:46.237
as long as she's walking
in the same direction

00:05:46.237 --> 00:05:48.237
at four feet per second.

00:05:51.578 --> 00:05:54.078
I hope you found this helpful.
