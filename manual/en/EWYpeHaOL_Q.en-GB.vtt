To make this DIY Face mask

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:13.680
We will need gram flour, Honey, Coffee, Coco Powder and plain Yoghurt

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.400
First I am taking 1 teaspoon coffee, coffee will work as skin scrub and will remove dead skin cells

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.260
Add 1 teaspoon of Coco Powder, coo powder will soften our skin

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.220
Add 1 teaspoon Gram Flour or Besan, this will make our skin look glowy

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.420
I am mixing all the ingredients

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.100
Now, add 2 teaspoon Plain Yoghurt

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.460
Yoghurt will help to fade Acne scars from our face and it will help to brighten our skin

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.460
I am adding 1 teaspoon Honey to the mixture

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.880
Honey will help to soften our skin

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.440
Honey will also help to reduce Acne scars, and will make our face look bright
