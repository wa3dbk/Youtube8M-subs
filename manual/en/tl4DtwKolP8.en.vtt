00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.720
Hey folks it is Barry here welcome to my virgin
kitchen I am just finishing off peeling an

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.720
egg.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.360
Not the most exciting start to a video I know
and Boston is trying to have some shell.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.600
Today we are going to be moulding eggs ok.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.439
Do not worry they are so pointless I do not
need them but maybe at the end of this video

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.529
you would and can win it.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.189
But anyhow I have already boiled my eggs so
have peeled the shell off let me tell you

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.390
a bit about it whilst I get the egg ready.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.369
So we have 3 types of egg moulds here, the
first one was the square one which caught

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.830
my eye, apparently really good for egg sandwiches
because they will hit all the corners rather

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.450
than the circular bits but then I delved more
into the world of egg moulds and found a car

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.670
one and a heart one there are more available
but this is enough!

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.300
So lets start off with the medieval looking
egg cubing one.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.690
Lets get it in there and see if it works.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.050
Ok I have taken it apart and apparently we
have this little base plate that goes in the

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.050
bottom.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.050
There is some little square there.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.140
Ok so we have our egg and we are going to
stick it in here, it is actually very tight

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.920
it does not want to go in there it does not
want to be shaped so there we go.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.150
Press the pressing plate on top of the egg
and screw the lid down until the egg is compressed

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.819
so lets press that in there.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:24.420
Ok can see it has a bit of give and we use
this lid thing to bite I guess and we are

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.580
just going to screw ok can you see that.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.509
Oh wow can you see that it sounds wrong it
is actually squishing it though that is weird

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.510
can you see that?!

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.079
Apparently it could be done in as little as
20 seconds but for best results put in the

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.079
fridge until cooled.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.310
So I am going to do that and quickly work
on my other 2 eggs.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.959
Ok so my eggs, I will just slightly warm them
up a little bit all I am going to do is whack

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.360
them in their clamps now this one has a nice
lever on it and this one is old school going

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.119
to have to push them in so in goes this egg,
these are medium eggs ok.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.799
That has closed quite easily, ok now I will
just clamp it.

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:10.799
Oh wow, ok.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.159
Did you see that, the egg exploded out of
the side of it.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.159
But that is in there and apparently goes into
the fridge too.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.950
Lets do the heart one that will be more tricky.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.610
So that hole goes there and we clamp it into
place.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.370
So come on in you go, I did mention I am going
to give this away so I am not sure that is

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.870
actually egg broken on there.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.069
Its not the clamp broken you can keep it guys
alright.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.720
These are going in the fridge with the square
one so we will give it fifteen minutes and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.970
see what they look like.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.739
15 minutes laterï¿½.

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.489
Right I have opened the fridge and there is
something you do not see everyday, lets see

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.180
if this has worked.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.310
It has to be the square one first, apparently
we undo this lid, take off the presser thing.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.080
Alright it has not sprung out, it is kind
of a curved one actually like a dice by the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080
looks of it.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.370
And I just push this like an elevator here
it comes.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.349
Oh my gosh that is a square egg.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.610
I am intrigued now lets see if the car one
has worked.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.569
Oh here we go pop this one open.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.460
Hahaha yes amazing it is working we have got
a car shaped egg.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.209
Amazing, this was the one I was worried about
the heart shaped which seems flimsy.

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.459
Oh it stinks.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:41.752
It is really eggy, I hate egg, so I am not
going to eat it.

00:03:41.752 --> 00:03:42.752
Oh here we go it kind of worked.

00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:46.549
It has a bit of broken heart there and some
goosh there, not sure what that word means

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.549
but nevermind.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.750
Pop that out get those bits off of it.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.510
Woooo it is a proper stonking smell in here
guys and not a good r Kelly one a proper egg

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.329
festival right now so I cut the square egg
in half and you get a proper egg yolk there

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.269
all square like that the car and the heart
one not so much it just goes kind of round

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.980
but it does stink I want to throw them out
and will send to a lucky winner.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.879
