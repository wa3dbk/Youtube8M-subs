00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:16.580
In this clip we're going to look at some
case studies of conservatories. This

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.500
first conservatory was built as an
exempt structure on a listed building so

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
we need planning permission and listed
building consent.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.570
It also had confirmation from the local
authority that building regulations

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.480
weren't required. This conservatory
replaced a small dilapidated old forge

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.640
and it was constructed in timber with
double glazing with safety glass

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.079
everywhere except in the roof. The old
back door was kept between the

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.420
conservatory and the house and also to
the bathroom. To maintain the separation

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.879
between the conservatory and the
dwelling the conservatory is under 30

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.079
square meters and all electrics were
carried out by a part p competent

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.300
electrician who supplied certificates.
There is no fixed heating in this

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.670
conservatory it's only heated by an
electric radiator. You could

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.420
theoretically use a log burner but
please don't use one in a plastic

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.800
conservatory. The next example of a
conservatory is much larger. It needed

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.360
building regulations and actually it's
classed as an extension not a

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.780
conservatory. This structure is more than
30 square meters. Tt has more wall area

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.789
and better glazing. It's still separated
from the house to prevent overheating or

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.500
excessive heat loss but the structure
was all checked out because it needed

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.069
building regs approval. It had suitable
foundations and a raft slab and a Part P

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.069
electrician was used for the electrical
work.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.789
This next example isn't a conservatory
at all it's actually an extension with

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.299
lots of glass and it needed building
regulations approval.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:09.519
This isn't separated from the main house
and the room has heating. It's also an

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.510
alteration to change an exempt glazed
roof to a solid one.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.319
This makes it an extension rather than an
exempt conservatory

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.420
so this will need building regulations
approval. Many councils are happy to

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.049
confirm in writing that your
conservatory is exempt - you should ask

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:26.739
them.

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.610
It's not a problem if yours isn't exempt
but you will need to make an application

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.799
and you'll probably need thermal or
structural calculations. Your

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.440
conservatory might cost more than you
think

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.360
so please plan ahead. You'll need to book
inspections especially if you're using a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.549
building notice so if you're planning a
conservatory and you want to find out

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.140
whether it's exempt or not or you want
to talk about inspections please talk to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.579
your local Building Control Department
