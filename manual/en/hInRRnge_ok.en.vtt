Hello, everyone, it’s Mia who got a shower of kisses.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.720
Today, I’ll show you the sweet innocent makeup tips with Lancome.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.360
Actually, it is the sweet innocent makeup, but I also call it the makeup inviting a lover’s kiss.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.880
Anyway, I will show you how to put on makeup which attracts men’s loves.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.400
Then, here we go!

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.280
“Have you seen it?”

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.480
“Where is Kiss?”

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.960
“Where are you, Kiss~ come here~”

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.360
Today, I will show you how to express moist skin texture.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.300
And first of all the other steps, you can boost moisture on your facial skin much more,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.260
by applying this product before foundation. 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.360
Actually I was surprised as it is spread very thinly on the skin and even so natural and moist.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.820
As it contains lots of moisture inside, I think it is a very ideal item for extremely dry skin during winter season. 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.740
I have dry skin, yet I absolutely prefer mat type products

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460
– I hate moist looking makeup because of sticky texture.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.120
I hate my hair stuck on my cheek and also having handprints on my face! 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.620
But in dry season just like these days, there is no alternative but moist makeup in fact.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.756
So, this is a tiny but awesome tip for those who are just like me!

00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:36.116
It is a “sponge”! 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.280
Just lightly pat on the face with a puff or sponge and help the product be absorbed into the facial skin enough. 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.860
It will provide enough moist on your face but never leave too-much gloss. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.860
And your face will moderately shine. 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.000
And in my case, also the problems of glossy makeup, such as sticky feeling or not-fully-spreading foundation, are much less. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.360
This time, as it is “sweet innocent” makeup, I will create a subdued feeling of eye makeup.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.020
But since it could look slightly boring, I will specially highlight the “eyelash”.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.700
If you make a mistake during controlling the thickness of the eyeline, it could be too thick. 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.960
So before we begin the makeup, let’s wear false eyelashes first.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.600
Wear the light type ones for daily use and apply the subdued pearl-pink color on the eyelids, 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.240
under eyes area, and inside corner part of the eyes.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.740
If you use your finger, the color could be applied too strongly. So, use the brush. 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.280
Now, pick the reddish light brown color and reapply it, as if you are drawing a line, to create shading effect, 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.580
and also apply it on the triangle zone on the outer part of the under eyes area. 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.740
Now, I’m going to do eyeliners with a liquid type one.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.320
Draw a natural line on the edge of the eyes.   

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:46.120
And for the inside corner, draw very thinly, following to the line of the false eyelashes.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.120
For the middle part of the eyes where we haven’t applied yet,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.400
 just lightly apply the product only above the line of the false eyelashes so that it is not conspicuous.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.940
During this work, be careful not to draw a line out of the eyelash lines. 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.220
Also apply on the inside corner of the eyes to make the eyes look much bigger.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.815
Lastly, cover the lines which we’ve just drawn, with a thick brown color shadow to create a gentle feeling.

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:04.535
Also lightly touch the triangle zone on the under eyes area. 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.840
After curling the eyelashes, apply the product on the eyelashes as it is the biggest point in today’s eye makeup.  

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.780
Don’t forget to apply also to the under eyelashes, and it will be also good to do a little bit more strongly. 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.500
For the cheeks, I will use Velours. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.080
If apply it directly on the cheek, it may look too vivid. 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.960
So touch it on a sponge first, and then apply on the cheeks very very lightly for two or three times only. 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.420
And then, turn a sponge and pat lightly to spread the product.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.280
However, as the base makeup is moist today, never try to spread strongly!

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.820
Otherwise, foundation already applied on the face could be removed and the makeup will look ugly!

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.940
If the makeup looks too much, just put a very little bit of the foundation on a sponge and apply it on the cheeks. 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.380
Then the color will become subdued and the cheeks will gain gloss, and the face will look more tridimensionally.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.600
If you want the highlighter, also apply it on the highlighting-required parts to complete the makeup.  

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.980
And on the lips, apply So Coral which we used for the cheeks on the inner part of the lips to gradate.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.920
Then, pick up the Darling Rose, a delicate nude pink color, 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.660
and apply it on the upper lip outline and middle part of the lower lip to give a plumping effect.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:13.740
Because it is a moist type lipstick, your lips will look much more plump and attractive.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.920
Then, it’s done! The adorable sweet innocent makeup!

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.040

Q. Today’s makeup - does it look attractive enough to call for Kiss?

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.120
“Hmm… well, yes, it does call Kiss.. 

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.874
Kiss~ where are you~ haha”

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.640
“Kiss is… 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.100
good.. (with a wicked grin)”
