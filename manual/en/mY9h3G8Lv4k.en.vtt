Today's question comes
from Biznick in Missouri.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.410
Biznick asks, Does indexing
a mobile website create

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.240
duplicate content issues
with the main site?

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.000
Any recommendations
for mobile SEO?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.390
Great question.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.680
So first off, let me just say
that we'll put a link in the

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.110
description of this video
that points to a blog post.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.730
It was done by a bunch of
people who have experience with

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.370
this particular topic from the
Japan team, in fact, who talked

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.160
about SEO, mobile, all that
stuff, how they interact.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.020
But let me go ahead and share
the best practices with you.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.930
Googlebot has a specific user
agent, I think it's Googlebot

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.220
mobile, for mobile search.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.110
So if you see Googlebot mobile,
then serve up your mobile site.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.650
If you see just regular
Googlebot, I would serve up

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.390
just your regular site.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.730
It can be nice to have the
content on a separate URL, so

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.560
maybe m dot whatever your site
is dot com; that can be a

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.290
very good best practice.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.180
The other thing that some
people seem to worry

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.100
about is they say well
aren't I cloaking?

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.780
Is this going to cause some
sort of cloaking issue?

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.040
Will I get into a penalty
from that perspective?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.190
And the answer is no for
the following reason.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.060
Cloaking looks at the
difference between what

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.150
is returned to the main
Googlebot-- that is our

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.700
Googlebot web crawler
versus to the user.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.080
So there's no problem returning
your main site to Googlebot and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.140
your main site to users using a
regular web browser, Internet

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.380
Explorer, FireFox, Chrome,
anything like that.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.300
Now if you see a mobile user
agent come in, so something

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.960
that you can tell from the user
agent is an iPhone or an

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.860
Android phone or something like
that, then it absolutely makes

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.660
sense to return your mobile
version of your site.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.000
So in essence, all we ask you
to do to avoid any cloaking is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260
if regular Googlebot comes, the
web crawler, treat us just like

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.370
a regular web user visiting
with Internet Explorer or

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.430
FireFox or Safari or Chrome.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.060
If a regular user comes in or
if Googlebot comes in and it's

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.950
Googlebot mobile, then give it
the mobile version

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.340
of that site.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.980
Other than that, those are the
main things to bear in mind.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.090
I think it is very handy to
have a separate URL, like m

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.900
dot, whatever the name of your
site is, because then you can

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.280
always do testing, you can
make sure that things work.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.800
It might keep it a little bit
more clear in people's mind

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.320
about what's going on.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.800
But if you do those you
shouldn't have any

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.230
duplicate content issues.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.220
And if you do, please stop by
the forum linked to from

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.320
google.com/webmasters and let
us know what sort of issues you

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.100
see, and then we'll take that,
see if we can debug it, and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100
make sure that it works
better for everybody.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.400
Thanks.
