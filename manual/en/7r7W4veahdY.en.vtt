Living in Whitney is an experience.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.000
It is very social, it is a lot of fun,
and you meet a lot of people.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.100
There's a lot of people to meet with all these
floors, you are bound to find the best

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.890
friend, good friend, or a boyfriend and girlfriend
here. The Whitney Hall community is pretty social,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.340
very exciting, and lively.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.640
I think Whitney Hall is a great place start a
college experience.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.740
It's nine stories of just sheer freshmen

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.930
and first year students.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.070
Everyone is here to have a great time

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.920
and it's really fun experience. I chose
University Housing because

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.650
I thought it would be a great way to meet people.
The Whitney Hall community is everyone coming together. There are

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.500
chairs and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.030
lobbies on every floor

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.710
and everyone just kind of comes together and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
you like get to hang out and meet different people
from different places.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.140
You really get to make good and new friends.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.480
Sarah and Anthony is a resident of Chico State's
largest residence building, whitney Hall.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.930
Home to most students of any hall, Whitney

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.700
is the tallest building north of Sacramento,
and its size leads to a diverse and almost metropolitan

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.160
feeling for residents.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.950
if you're excited about meeting new people
when you're arrive at Chico State

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.880
and are looking to expand your social horizons, Whitney
Hall is a place for you.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.140
At nine stories, Whitney offers commanding
views of the campus surrounding

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.850
the city of Chico.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.820
Each floor is divided into two residential
wings, which are separated by a central elevator

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.760
lounge. Here you can study, hangout, or watch
the campus life from huge windows looking

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.840
out on the campus and the world beyond. Each
lounge is like a town square for its floor.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.240
At Whitney, student rooms are double occupancy,
with a few single and triple rooms available

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.210
for assignment with community restrooms close
by.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.239
Like all other Chico State residence halls, Whitney
Hall features fully furnished rooms, high-speed

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.329
wireless computer connectivity,

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.609
air conditioning,

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:21.419
cable television, and the option to subscribe
to telephone service with voicemail.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:27.559
Other amenities that foster a sense of community, and aide
you academic life are a computer lab, study lounges. There's

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:33.599
also a recreation room with a community TV,
and laundry rooms to make your chores easier.You wont need

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.899
to be hoofing it to laundry mats while living at Whitney.

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.660
Outside, Whitney is surrounded by Chico State's
famously lush greenery.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.500
It's just steps from the creek that runs through campus.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.040
This puts you at the center of campus life,
within site of the campus core. It also provides

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.940
easy access to the University Library,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.180
classroom building,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.629
the Bell Memorial Union, and the New Wildcat Recreation
Center.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.129
Whitney's also just across the street from
Acker Gym and the Student Health Center.

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.819
A quick walk beyond that is the lively and beautiful
downtown area of Chico.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.290
Whitney shares a pleasant courtyard with Sutter
Hall,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.239
home to the residential dining center and
UHUB.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.339
uHUB is the center of entertainment for residents
on campus, and home of Prime Time Productions, the

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.459
organization responsible for entertaining
residents.

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.209
As a resident with us, you'll be part of the
Student Dining Program.

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.969
It's a good bet you'll be eating most of your
meals with us in the Sutter Hall Dining

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.199
Center, a state of the art dining experience.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.860
For more information on the dining program,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.849
take a look at the Living In Handbook or the
Residential Dining Plan Video on our website.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.809
They discusssome of the unique aspects of the residence
dining program.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:50.939
beyond the planning we've put into the living experience
and features, we take seriously our commitment

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.789
to student safety.

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:57.209
that's why each resident is provided with a
unique room key or access to main front

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.229
door and their room. It's resistant to copying
or tampering.

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:07.049
Added to this is the fact the entire residence
hall area of campus is patrolled regularly

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.379
by University Police.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.559
Finally, each floor of Whitney Hall has a Residential Life staff
representative.

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:17.229
If you've got a problem, chances are they can
help.

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.199
The Whitney Hall community is really open; everyone 
usually as their door open and you can walk down

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.710
the hall and always make new friends.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.459
Everybody is always down to go down to the lobby,
watch a movie, or walk downtown.

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:30.080
The building

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.800
is great, you have a nice view from all the floors
and

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.160
it's cozy.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.470
I like the rooms because they are easy to make them
into your own, like I have put stuff all over my

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.080
walls and and is definitely my room even
if it starts out looking like nothing.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.099
I like living on campus because it's really
convenient; you can walk down to the library

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.650
or even downtown if you need to.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.110
Other people are always close by so you can find someone
to study with. 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.520
Whitney Hall is lot of fun you should try it out.
