Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of one of my most popular books the natural

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.490
hair Bible and founder of howtoblackhair.com
and for these videos I answer the questions

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.820
you all send me via email so if any of you
have any questions you would like for me to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.230
answer check out the description box below
for more information so this video is because

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.950
of an email Chrissy sent Chrissy says that
she knows that her hair type is 4C but she

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.290
wants me to pass along some pros and cons
as what to look out for what kind of things

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.570
she keep in mind when dealing or managing
her hair so Chrissy of course I have for you

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.910
some tips and techniques and some different
things give you more insight on what you want

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.440
to do to make sure that you are caring for
your hair so my very first tip is that you

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.930
want to make sure that when you are identifying
any problems with your hair you want to identify

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.950
your hair when it is dry and product free
when it's dry and products free you can notice

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.549
if you're ends are tapering or starting to
thin you can notice if you're experiencing

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.909
breakage you can notice if you're experiencing
excessive shedding you can notice that if

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.670
you are thinning on any areas of your hair
and so much more so identify what kind of

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.490
problems or things that you need to prevent
when your hair is dry and product free because

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.659
products will skew what you think you're looking
at especially if you using any volumizing

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.180
ingredients in your products your hair will
appear a lot more thicker when in reality

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.010
is not as thick or your hair will appear as
if you don't have much splits when in fact

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.500
you might have a lot of splits so that's why
its important when you're trying to figure

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.421
out if your experiencing any problems with
your hair that your hair is dry and product

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:54.560
free so the second thing that I'm going to
mention applies to all of my people have relaxed

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.580
hair and that is you want to pay close attention
to the health of your roots yes you have to

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.970
make sure that you keep your relaxed hair
healthy as well but your roots will soon be

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.119
relaxed hair so make sure that your noticing
to see if you are experiencing and balding

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.790
any excessive thinning any problems to a degree
that you need to start to pay more attention

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.920
to if your rots are always dry you need to
start pumping up the volume on the way that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.290
your moisturizing your hair you may even need
to the deep condition more often so that way

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.010
are not experiencing dry hair because dry
natural hair after it's relaxed is usually

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.770
a lot more drier so just pay careful attention
to the health of your scalp and your new growth

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.131
so that you can continue to have very healthy
relaxed hair and then my last tip that I am

00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:45.480
going to suggest applies to both and that
is instead of depending on the call type you

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.629
have to you have to focus on the porosity
and texture of your hair so what I refer to

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.100
texture, texture is the feel of your hair
entire hair feels the most hair feels into

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.250
three different types of textures about feels
will either feel cottony silky or thready

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.410
you can notice by simply running your fingers
through your hair when it's dry or touching

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.930
different areas of your hair to notice what
your predominant texture or what other textures

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.820
you have in your hair as well so to make sure
that you're picking the right products, the

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.849
right products applies more to the texture
of your hair than it does for your crow pattern

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.410
because with micro patterns I have 4C hair
my hair has more of a cottony texture and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.379
also some of the thready texture but my hair
is not silky at all and I've honestly seen

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.879
a lot of people who have 4c hair and her hair
has a very high shine to a which usually relates

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.349
to more of a silky texture with someone who
has more of a silky texture the dont have

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:48.580
to use much heavy oils on her hair such as
Shea butter almond butter or any other butters

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.379
on their hair but if you have more of a different
texture like cotton or thready textured and

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.879
almond oil jojoba oil coconut oil can sometimes
even Olive oil will be the better types of

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.010
oils to use in your products for your hair
so instead of depending on everyone else who

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.190
has the same texture or excuse me the same
curl pattern to their hair you have to rely

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.470
on the texture you have and match in accordance
to the type of products that work for you

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.709
texture if you want more in-depth information
on that thoroughly talked about it and pretty

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.509
much in commandment one a commandment Bible
my book the natural hair Bible when referring

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:31.129
to your curl pattern and your texture so thanks
for your email as you can see I don't have

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:36.460
anything negative or anything really positive
to say because I just want to talk specifically

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.440
about the facts on what you want to think
about and keep in mind when dealing with your

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.749
hair so the pros and cons is not a big deal

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:50.809
