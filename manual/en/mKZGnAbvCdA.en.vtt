Hi my name is Tishambia Caine and I'm with
Studio Soiree and I'm teaching the cardio

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.722
cabaret chair dance. Now what we're going
to talk about is stretching. A lot of the

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:15.790
dance is actually stretching. This is pretty
much of a low impact type of work out we are

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.269
doing. So a simple stretch that you can do
with the chair is to simply lean and start

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:30.779
lifting your leg, start lifting your leg and
lift it up a little bit more and then work

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.440
on the other side and lift your leg and each
time try to lift it up a little bit more to

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.039
try to get that leg stretched out. So another
good stretch is to stretch the hamstring.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:54.769
With any chair simply put your ankle right
on top of the chair and slowly lean. Now the

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.510
key is not to round out your back and do this
that is not the whole point of stretching

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.930
your hamstring, it is taking the lower part
of your body and leaning in to the leg. Now

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.470
I'm not doing too much of a stretch but I
can definitely feel it. You do not have to

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.899
go all the way down. Bring it out, shake it
out a little bit, do it on the other leg.

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.930
Whatever you do to the left, you do to the
right. Again bring that lower part of your

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.530
body in to the leg. Another wonderful stretch
which I love and it is part of the dance routine

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.700
is to simply lift your leg up and down in
a very controlled manner, lift your leg up

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:48.240
and down, lift your leg up and down. Not so
much even a stretch as it is a strength move.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.780
Here is a nice little strength move, working
your triceps I am going to be in this position

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.299
here. Now I have a little bit of shoulder
injury so I can't go down as far as I usually

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.719
can so I am going to do this very carefully.
You are in this position and slowly go down

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:13.340
and use your triceps to bring you up, slowly
go down and use your triceps to bring you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.190
up. Again I am not using the full range that
I normally could but it is an excellent work

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.760
out for your triceps. Everything you are doing
here you can do with a chair, you don't have

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.150
to go to the gym. Another movement that will
get this part of your body stretched out is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:45.950
to lean back and you can use the chair to
support you, bring it up, on your toes, bring

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.380
it down, lean back. That will stretch this
part of the muscle which is pretty tight when

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.379
you don't use it for many many years. Bring
it up, down, one more time. When you are strong

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.090
enough you could probably let your legs go.
You also have to use a lot of stomach muscles

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.980
to keep you up. Bring it up. So those are
some very simple stretch moves, even this

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.400
one, which you can do on the floor or on the
chair. Let me show you what it looks like

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:33.549
in the sideway position. Very nice and relaxing
stretch. It is the same stretch as the one

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.970
that you do on the floor except you do it
on the chair.
