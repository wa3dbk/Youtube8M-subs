00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.400
Hi Food Tube, I'm Jack, I'm new so please
be nice to me, bear with me. When I was unemployed

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.320
I started off writing a blog about feeding
myself and my son quite cheaply. That blog

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.619
got quite a hit following and I've ended up
here. In this video today I'm going to be

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.810
showing you how to make a rhubarb and ginger
soda bread. This is a really simple recipe,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.820
less than an hour from start to finish. It's
warm, it's soft, it's affordable and it just

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.330
works perfectly. So it's just bish, bash,
bosh, there you go you can make bread. Once

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.490
you've got a good soda bread under your belt
you can chuck whatever odds and sods you've

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.570
got in your fridge in there. Mine today is
gonna be rhubarb but any fruit, any veg, any

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.680
herb, any bits and pieces you can just fling
it all in a soda bread and make it into a

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.680
whole new thing. I'm just going to chuck all
this in a bowl, put a bit of sugar on top.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.710
Rhubarb can be a little bit bitter so I'm
just gonna sweeten it up a bit. So just a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.710
couple of generous heaped teaspoons of sugar
there. Now it's all nicely chopped I'm just

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.999
gonna leave that to one side while I do all
the bready bit. Now this is really simple

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:12.929
bread making. Take half a lemon, squeeze it
into 300ml of milk; this will make your milk

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.759
curdle a little bit and start to sour which
is essential when making soda bread. Traditional

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.179
soda bread recipes would use buttermilk which
is soured milk so essentially that's exactly

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.920
what I'm doing but for a fraction of the cost.
And with milk I've got normal, bog standard

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.520
semi-skimmed and then, there you go, I'll
tip that up towards you there. it doesn't

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.670
look great but trust me it is absolutely fine.
When I started writing my blog I was looking

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.689
for the absolute cheapest ways to do absolutely
everything and I found that if you've got

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.889
a pot of yoghurt sitting in the fridge going
a little bit off, soda bread is the perfect

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:48.549
place to smuggle it. So now I've got 300g
of self-raising flour, I'm gonna tip it in

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.719
here just like that. Add a rounded teaspoon
of bicarb and that reacts with the lemon juice

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.130
and the milk and makes your bread go from
a dough to a bread. Take your rhubarb, think

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.969
I've got a bit too much here so I'm gonna
tip that lot in, give it a mix through. And

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.920
I'm just gonna add some ginger to that as
well. I've lost my grater so instead I am

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.069
just scraping this ginger with a teaspoon,
which is the easiest way to peel it. It's

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.920
got extremely thin skin so you can just scrape
the skin off it and you also don't lose too

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.379
much of that ginger there because it literally
only takes off the skin. So I use that method,

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.900
I'm gonna get it in nice, thin strips. Just
gonna mix that through as well using the world's

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.650
smallest spoon to mix all this through. And
make a well in the centre of it, add a little

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.650
bit of this nicely curdled milk here. So I'm
gonna add most of that, mix it up. So add

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.390
the liquid gradually. Because the last thing
you want to end up with is a sticky mess that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.019
clings to you like a three year old that wants
its dinner. Yeah it's looking just right.

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.900
It needs to come together but if it goes a
bit too dry you can add a little bit of the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.689
extra soured milk to it. If it goes too far
the other way then you can just add a little

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.349
bit of extra flour and keep mixing it in.
So it's quite simple. There you go, that's

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.489
just about perfect, it's a nice little ball.
It's a little bit sticky, a little bit tacky.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.879
The secret to doing good soda bread is not
to mess around with it too much. So you fidgets

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:19.879
and fiddlers resist, you leave it to do its
thing. It needs some more flour. Bung that out

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:29.200
there. I'm just gonna turn this over once
or twice, pat it and leave it alone. Lightly

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:37.700
dust your loaf tin, pop that in, make a split
down the middle for the fairies. Irish folklore

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.370
says that soda bread is full of fairies, you
make a split down the middle to let the fairies

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.549
out. They're making your bread all nice for
you, you let them free, let them go and do

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.739
the next one. I'm gonna chuck that in the
oven, 180Â°C for about forty minutes. Told

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.000
you it was simple, told you it was easy and
that's it.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.689
So that looks great actually. It's

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.700
got that good little knobbly, crusty texture
that you'd expect from a soda bread there

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.260
and I'm quite looking forward to cutting this
open. Just gonna get into this and see how

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:19.500
it looks. Oh nice. So I'm just gonna break
a bit of that open there, look at that gooey

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:26.539
bit of rhubarb. I'm gonna give this a go
for you, yeah? Oh my god, it is really good.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.220
It just sort of falls apart in your mouth
there because it's sort of soft and gooey

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.530
and it just works really perfectly. I love
it as you can tell. So thanks for sticking

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.419
with me guys. Remember I'm new, this is my
first Food Tube video so let me know what

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.840
