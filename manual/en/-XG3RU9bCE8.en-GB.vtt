Hi everyone!

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.000
Today I'm going to show you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.220
how to make very easy chocolate cake (GÃ¢teau au Chocolat)

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.680
using only two ingredients: eggs and chocolate bars.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.060
The other day I was looking for a cake pan (?)

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.740
and then I ended up looking for a chocolate cake

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.300
you know that happens, right?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.360
So then I found blog posts, and many recipe posts

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.540
about this two ingredient chocolate cake and I was really curious about it so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.500
I tried it, and it turned out amazingly delicious so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.980
I hope you can try it out and I hope you enjoy it

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.500
So as you can see you just need eggs and chocolate

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.360
line the cake pan with parchment paper

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.180
now bake in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.440
Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.
