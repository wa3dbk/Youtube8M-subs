00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:08.799
Now we are going to start cutting. I choose
this pick. That's very, very nice. It's sharp.

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:20.970
And you can cut this with a knife but this
is better. It makes quite clean cut. It's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:35.280
going to be a little long process because
I have to be sure that way I'm following the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:47.129
lines carefully. Sometimes you cut, that's
a trick, cut those pieces out. Then you're

00:00:47.129 --> 00:01:20.189
having a cleaner cut. And here you have to
clean this, too. Okay this is, in order to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:32.960
do that and keep the shape you have to cut
with this tool vertical. As vertical as possible.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:46.770
If not it's going to be under the template
and then you are going to get different shape.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.590
The shape on the surface is going to be okay
and same but here they are going to be in

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:07.680
or out then it's going to be deformed. Try
to cut like this always. Okay now we have

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:19.640
it. That one. Then it's alright. Then I'm
going to mark, only mark slightly around because

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.470
this is going to be the size of the face that
we are going to cut and maybe develop apart

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:37.290
and later put it on. Now we can pull the template
out if it goes okay like this. Now we have

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:48.930
a beautiful sun already. Now next we are going
to recycle all this clay and we are going

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.280
to make a round face that we are going to
put it on top of here.
