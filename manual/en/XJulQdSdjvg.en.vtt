00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:23.160
Lately, due in part to watching awesome video
over on our CGR Pinball channel, I’ve been

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.869
getting more and more interested in video
gaming’s older cousin.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.109
And then I actually try playing a physical
table and I just get hosed.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.289
Like, bad.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.620
So I’m gonna stick to digital interpretations
for the time being, which leaves me with...

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.629
Kirby’s Pinball Land, Mario Pinball, Metroid
Pinball, Pokémon Pinball, Zen Pinball, Pinball

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.550
FX2, the Pinball of the Dead... and others.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.019
But none of them really felt like my kind
of pinball.

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.460
When I run into a problem on the table, I
don’t hold the ball on a flipper and plan.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.039
Planning’s for wimps.

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:01.269
No, I just solve every problem by scrambling
a Gundam.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.659
Super Robot Pinball, like the long-running
Super Robot Taisen series, is just a reason

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.149
to smash giant robots together into one big
katamari of awesome.

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.950
Only this time, they’ve left the usual RPG
mechanics behind in favor of a pair of flippers

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.270
and a potential lawsuit from Nintendo.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.900
This game feels uncannily similar to Pokémon
Pinball, right down to a database of all the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.450
heroes and foes you’ve encountered throughout
what will assuredly be many playthroughs.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.130
And, like Pokémon Pinball, there’s a level
of depth to the challenge beyond just smacking

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.170
targets around the playfield.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.219
The basic flow is thus: Destroy five targets
in this bank, and something evil this way

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.219
will come.

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.229
From that point, you have two minutes to shoot
this Scramble ramp, from which you choose

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.420
a giant robot, followed by this rightmost
ramp to actually enter the fight.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.899
This takes you to a smaller table where your
mecha of choice goes toe-to-toe-analog with

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:54.899
the invader.

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:05.500
You’ve gotta pummel away its HP, while shooting
the side-loops to charge up your own attacks.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.459
While you start off with just six robots - Gundam,
Dancouga, Combattler V, Mazinger Z, Raideen,

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.819
and EVA Unit-01 - there are a total of 41
in the game, with new ones unlocking if you

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.510
can encounter two or more foes on a single
ball.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.069
Gotta scramble ‘em all, I guess.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.070
I really can’t explain it better than that:
This is really just Pokémon Pinball, with

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.129
only one table, and awesome chiptune renditions
of classic anime theme songs.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.750
The mechanics feel very similar, and the ball
physics are almost completely identical.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.680
It’s the same kind of easygoing pinball
experience - heck, the out lanes aren’t

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.180
even out lanes, they just wrap around the
bottom of the table - but it’s there to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.439
be really fun, and facilitate other, weirder
mechanics.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.540
You won’t be seeing this at PAPA any time
soon, but don’t think I’m not searching

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.049
for a copy of my own as we speak.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.280
Much thanks to Felicity in Worcestershire
in the UK for the donation, and opening my

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.909
eyes to how good Cruel Angel’s Thesis sounds
on a Game Boy.
