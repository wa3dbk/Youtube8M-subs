00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:15.230
There are around 200 species of sea urchins
that are found across oceans around the world.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.540
Sea Urchins are found in warmer waters on
ocean floors and close to coral reefs.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:32.470
They are a threatened species due to over
fishing and pollution.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:40.050
They range in size from between 1.2 to 3.9
inches in diameter.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.019
They have a globe like shape which is covered
with long spines and their bodies have a radial

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.789
symmetry.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.350
They are protected by a shell formed of bony
plates that provide protection for their soft

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.059
inner organs.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.710
They vary in colour depending on the species
of the sea urchin, however the majority of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.730
them are black, brown, purple, red or green
in colour.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.490
They have five rows of paired feet on the
underside of their body. These feet have suckers

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.710
on them which means that they can grip the
ocean floor.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.080
Amongst the spines on their bodies are claw
like structures which are known as pediculurae

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.070
which are used for protection against predators
and also to collect food.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:58.870
There are species of sea urchin that also
have spikes that are filled with venom.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:06.890
They have a unique type of mouth called Aristotles
lantern. The mouth has five sharp teeth which

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.160
they use to drill holes in rocks.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.030
They are omnivores by nature consuming both
animals and plant life such as algae, sea

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.310
weed, plankton and other organic matter.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:40.020
The main predators of sea urchins are humans,
sunflower stars, crabs, fish and birds.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.341
Sea urchins mate in the spring time and reproduce
by releasing eggs and sperm cells into the

00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:53.490
water in a process called external fertilization.
The fertilized egg will then go through a

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.470
larval stage before it becomes a grown adult.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:07.120
Whilst the sea urchin is in its larval stage,
it will swim with other types of tiny creatures

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.040
as part of zooplankton.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:22.030
Sea Urchins live up to thirty years. In fact,
the red Sea Urchin lives up to 200 years making

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.990
it the longest living creature.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.041
Sea Urchins are not aggressive creatures.
However, if they are touched most Sea Urchins

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:39.739
will try to defend themselves using their
spines and some species have spines that can

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.030
pierce a diver's suit.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.100
Some species like the purple Sea Urchin have
another defence mechanism which are tiny jaw

00:03:51.100 --> 00:04:00.240
like structures which clasp onto a diver's
skin and inject a powerful poison. They are

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.120
nestled down between the spines and are difficult
to come into contact with unless the diver

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.340
impales them self on it.
