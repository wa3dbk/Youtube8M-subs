JAYNE ENTWISTLE: Hi. I'm Jayne Entwistle with
expertvillage.com. ANDREW STUBBLEFIELD: And

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:07.060
I'm Andrew Stubblefield. Welcome back. JAYNE
ENTWISTLE: We're playing some of our favorite

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.849
improv games today, and one of the great games
is called lies. Now I call it lies, some people

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.140
call it lines, and the subtle difference is
that lines are lines of dialogue and lies

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.990
are lies that you might tell. Normally, we
would get those lies from the audience. So,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.950
I have a little box of lies here and we are
going to take a little handful and not look

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.090
at them, and we're going to put them in our
pocket. And then what we're going to is Andrew

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.800
and I are going to do a scene using some of
those great rules and structures we've talked

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.930
about--yes and, accepting, give and take,
not blocking, who, where, what--and we're

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.329
going to pull out those lies and incorporate
them into the scene. So this game is called

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.329
lies. ANDREW STUBBLEFIELD: Go ahead. JAYNE
ENTWISTLE: For the sake of this scene, how

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.760
about we're at the park? ANDREW STUBBLEFIELD:
Good, great. JAYNE ENTWISTLE: Okay. ANDREW

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.960
STUBBLEFIELD: Oh, this is the hottest Fourth
of July I've ever felt, Sarah. JAYNE ENTWISTLE:

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:20.830
Oh, Johnny, I think I forgot the hotdogs.
ANDREW STUBBLEFIELD: I just flew in from Texas.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.130
JAYNE ENTWISTLE: I know, and you said you
specifically wanted your favorite hotdogs.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.960
I can't believe I forgot them. I know how
much you love them, really I do, and I just

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.330
think it's me, not you. It's my memory. ANDREW
STUBBLEFIELD: I'm so glad you realized this.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.340
I mean, you've always blamed me and now I'm
glad that you're taking responsibility on

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.040
your own. I've never been arrested, never
in my life, and now the fact that you're taking

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.150
on responsibility, maybe all of that past
criminal history will not follow you either.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.960
JAYNE ENTWISTLE: I don't want it to follow
me; I'm tired of my criminal past. I've traveled

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.880
extensively with the circus and it just gets
you in trouble. So that is an example of lies.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.250
We used those funny little lies on our pocket.
And the thing with lies that's a great example

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.830
is when you pull out a lie and you read it,
even if it doesn't fit your scene, you can't

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.040
throw it out, you can't deny the lie or block
the lie--you have to incorporate it into the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.090
scene. This would have been a fun one. I'm
not wearing underwear. Hmm, lies.
