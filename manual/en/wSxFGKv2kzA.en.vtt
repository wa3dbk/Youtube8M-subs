00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.970
A CFO's advice to Eastman Kodak  and other companies going bankrupt
In 2012 Eastman Kodak filed for bankruptcy after being

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.009
in business for almost a hundred and
twenty five years

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.849
the company was formed in 1889
by George Eastman

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.869
about twenty five years after the end of
the civil war

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.230
in 1888 he invented his
first camera

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.489
his technology was so advanced

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.199
that people like thomas edison use
them in motion picture films

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.760
in 1976 the company was so advanced in it's sales and it's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.070
technology

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.820
that it became the Google of it's time owning
about 90% of it's market share

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.130
in the photographic film sales.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.220
Interestingly in 1975
the company invented the first

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.820
digital camera

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.030
they decided not to use that technology
because they did not want it to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.010
erode into its photographic film sales.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.270
Eventually competition started using the
digital technology. The photographic

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.760
film sales started going down and declining

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.770
and the company's stopped earning a
profit in 2007 and had to

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.750
file bankruptcy.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.870
When Eastman Kodak filed bankruptcy they
have two options; chapter seven and chapter

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.730
eleven.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.390
A chapter seven bankruptcy filing

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.299
would have caused them to close the
doors, to sell off their assets and quit

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.430
doing business

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.790
A chapter eleven reorganization allows
them to continue doing business they

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.120
will make sales to customers and they
will continue to pay their creditors and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.950
keep doing business

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.540
now they have some challenges

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.220
The US trustee did a study and they found
out that only

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.150
29% of businesses that
do a chapter eleven reorganizations

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.620
survive

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.700
Now what some of their challenges they're gonna have increased

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.040
competition. Companies are going to come in and try to take away
their customers

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.690
Their key employees will most likely leave.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.540
They will have to pay their
secured creditors and they're going to

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.850
have billions of dollars in legal and
accounting costs. Those are going to be some

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.970
of the challenges that they're going to
face among other things

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.659
Advice for Eastman Kodak

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.680
I have a lot of experience in chapter

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.569
eleven reorganization

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.679
and i really truly like to see kodak
survive.

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.379
They've been a national legacy or about
a 125 years

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.069
I want to give some advice. My advice
is to not get distracted

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.449
let all the attorneys and accountants and
others have all the paperwork in the

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.299
busy work of the chapter eleven
re-organization.

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.069
My advice is to focus on the consumer

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.279
back in 1888

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.629
your founder George Eastman

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.869
was an inventor. He created things he,
wanted to find out what customers wanted

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.549
and that's what your challenge is. To do
research and development, find out what

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.039
the consumer wants

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.369
and go forward

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.989
being

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.280
company that you are with a great legacy
in the good name and i think you have

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.889
a good chance of surviving

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.449
Thank you
