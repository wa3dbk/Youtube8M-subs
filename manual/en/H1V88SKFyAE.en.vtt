Hey guys, Blinks here, and this is how you
play anti-mage.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.990
Anti-mage is an agility-based melee carry.
His Q passively adds mana burn to his auto

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.230
attacks. His W is long-range blink. His E
passively increases his resistance to magic-damage.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.570
and his Ultimate is a single-target nuke that
does damage based on how much mana the target

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.980
is missing.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.060
Anti-mage is a weak hero early-game but one
of the strongest heroes late game. Focus on

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.770
farming until you get a battlefury, and then
start farming your jungle and lanes simultaneously.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.079
Your goal early-game is to get a quick battlefury,
and then build into a manta-style. Use your

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.750
extreme mobility to split push, farm multiple
lanes simultaneously, and to keep the enemy-team

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.210
scattered.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.280
Anti-mages skills seem relatively simple,
but actually have a bit of complexity to them.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.100
Remember that you can get away from snares
like Puck’s ultimate and Slark’s Pounce

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.559
by using blink. Also, remember that Anti-Mage’s
ultimate not only damages but also mini-stuns,

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.870
so use it to cancel TP’s or channeling spells
like Sand King’s or Witch Doctor’s Ultimate.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.949
Once you are ready to teamfight, remember
that until you build a heart or a butterfly,

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.030
you are still a very squishy hero, and you
need to be careful. Try to focus heroes that

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.440
have disables or stuns to deplete them of
mana and make them incapable of cc’ing you.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.440
Once you get a sense of what heroes you need
to focus, you will become virtually unstoppable,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.110
as anti-mage is one of the hardest carries
in the game.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.850
When leveling anti-mage, put 1 point into
each spell, and then prioritize R &gt; Q &gt; W

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.430
&gt; E. As far as items go, rush a battlefury
as fast as possible, and then build power

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.630
treads and manta-style. End-game options include
Heart, Butterfly, BKB, Abyssal Blade, or MKB.
