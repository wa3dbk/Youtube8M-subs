Hi, I’m Gabrielle Shrager, Senior Story
Director

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.500
at Ubisoft Montpellier Studios and Im the
Lead Writer on ZombiU,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.570
so let’s talk story…

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.570
Episode 2
LONDON: A CITY OF BLOOD &amp; FIRE

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.050
I've lived in London,
And the team spent a lot of time walking around

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.420
the city
to take in its unique flavour and atmosphere,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.309
And what we've created from that, is a kind
of sublime vision of the city.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.309
A creepy apocalyptic, hyper-real version of
London, where hell is just around the corner.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.780
We have a variety of locations in ZombiU,
that reflect the contrast of modern London.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.560
From the splendor of Buckingham palace to
the squalor of a ruined council estate.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.310
And where else can you meet a Zombie bobby,
a beefeater or even a royal guard?

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.070
It is 2012, and the Black Prophecy is about
to be realized.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.450
John Dee foresaw the coming of the apocalypse
400 years ago,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.320
and now you are right in the middle of it.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.510
Run if you want to live!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.230
In ZombiU we have three main characters,
each of whom has a different approach to survival

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.840
and interpretation of John Dee’s Black prophecy.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.060
The Prepper is your mysterious guide and mentor,
a survivalist who saw the apocalypse coming

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.030
and prepared; he’s ex-army, and no-nonsense
and he will do what he can to teach you to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.700
survive…
and live to see The Black Prophecy realized.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.700
Hey lad, over here! Come down into the station!

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.210
Sondra is one of the leaders of a secret society
know as The Ravens of Dee.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.569
They have spent centuries studying John Dee
and The Black Prophecy

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.620
and their aim is to help as many survivors
as they can, escape the London.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.620
Sorry, that's all I can help with, I need
to clear the other rempart.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.280
Dr. Knight is one of the Queen’s doctors.
He has survived deep beneath Buckingham Palace

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.230
in the Royal Bunkers,
where he is obsessively searching for the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.040
fabled “Panacea”,
a universal cure that John Dee died looking for.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.500
Welcome, do make yourself at home.
But please don't touch anything, this is all

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.480
vital scientific work.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.709
Dee was a fascinating man, one of the most
compelling and mysterious people in British history.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.209
And so, we created a rich, detailed mythology

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.180
around his life and work for players to discover.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.950
What we soon realized was that the overall
story of this game,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.840
doesn't belong to the survivors you play,
it belongs to you, the player.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.090
You're the one following the narrative, from
start to finish.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.890
We’ll also encounter some other survivors
up Brick Lane and see how they’ve managed

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.440
to stay alive.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.099
These characters help keep us in the flow
of the game.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.090
Each one of our survivors benefits from the
progress of the last and pursues the end-game,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.099
like a deadly relay race
in the hopes that maybe one of our survivors

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:34.730
will make it out alive.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.700
In the next episode

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.500
Surviving the hard way
The mechanics of ZombiU
