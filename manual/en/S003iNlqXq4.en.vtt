00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.950
We don't realize what a child goes through.
Some of them are not at home, some of them

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.740
are in foster care, some of them are, you
know, being molested, some of them are just

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.930
in all types of situations. Then they come
to our schools...substitute teachers, no books,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.270
the food is horrible.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.180
And then you say, "Do well." You know, but
where is the support? I'm going from bad to

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.510
worse, and you want me to thrive, you want
me to have this positive attitude, how? I

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.510
don't see any hope.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.090
And I can remember growing up and I could
say I want do something. I want to make a

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.550
difference. And I would throw it in the back
of my mind.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.471
Then Zenae was born. Zenae was born and I
can remember saying, okay, I'm going to be

00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:56.300
your godmother. And, I took this young lady
under my wing and I just really nurtured her

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.260
and loved her with travel and she was like
my best little friend. And so then, she's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.130
like, "Godmommy, my friend wants to go". And
I'm thinking, okay, they can go. And, here

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.761
it is, I'm taking a carload of youth with
me on weekend trips. And then it went from

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:18.670
weekend trips to week trips. And I said, this
is what I want to do.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.090
God has given me a gift to go into these neighborhoods
or go into these schools and just love on

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.049
them, accept them for who they are and just
really love them. And that's what Godparents

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.049
is about.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.929
&gt;&gt; ZENAE: It's a traveling mentor program,
and what it does it kind of opens the child's

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.929
mind to the world around them.

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.310
And I like how it's affecting not just our
family and friends, how it's affecting the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.609
community because that's what we need now.

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:52.119
&gt;&gt; TANYA: I go after the C's and the D's students.
I go after the ones people tell them they

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.329
can't amount to anything. I go after the ones
that lost all hope, and give them the strength

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.659
and the self-motivation to know that as long
as your relationship with Christ is straight,

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.920
and you focus on that, that's all you need
and you can excel and keep going.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.400
So, it's a life-changing experience.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.920
&gt;&gt; ASHLEE: At the time I was doing bad in
school and I was doing what I wanted to do,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.265
and I wasn't on the right track. She thought
that is wasn't too late to turn my life around

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:24.680
and turn it around. And she knew I wasn't
a bad person or a bad kid. I went from, my

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.599
auntie says, a bad egg to a good egg, I guess.
And I'm more positive, more smiley, I'm more,

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.189
you know.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.819
&gt;&gt; TANYA: And then I started seeing how the
trip was really changing them. And then God

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.270
gave me the opportunity again in 2006. He
said "You're going across country and I want

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.730
you to give this time." He said, "Utilize
all your resources." And I'm thinking, how

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.599
do you do that? He said, "Start talking."
And so I'm sitting here and I get on the phone

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.469
and I call Arizona, I call New Orleans, I
call Dallas. I said "I want to come to your

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:58.120
city and give. I don't want anything. I just
want to find the kids in need and I want to

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.290
give to them."

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.439
December comes along and it was like, keep
going, don't stop. Although you don't have

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.349
the money, keep going. Prepare as if you had
it.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.531
And LA Times came out. She said, "You have
the front page of the weekend edition. People

00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:18.040
will see your article all over the world."
Not knowing marketing, I'm thinking, "Oh okay,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.690
that's wonderful." Still didn't have the money.
I laid down on Saturday and I said, "Lord,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.579
you said in your timing. I have less than
24 hours." I said, "Let your will be done."

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:36.689
Six o'clock that morning, a phone call came
in and the lady said, "I am reading your article.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.620
Where can I send you some money?" LA TImes
called, they said, "We have never received

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.040
a response like you. We are getting emails
from all over the united states."

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.950
The people couldn't email fast enough, they
start calling. The people that couldn't reach

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.549
us on the phone started coming to my door.
God was so good, I started crying, my aunt

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.709
ran in there and she was like, "Tanya, what?"
I said, "It's happening. He's blessing me."

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.439
By the end of that night I had forty thousand
dollars.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.909
And at that point, God said, "Money is not
your issue. It's trust and faith. And I need

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:14.030
people to see. I need a soldier out there
so people can see if you do and be obedient,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.829
I'm going to bless you. But you got to sacrifice,
you got to line your life up with me. You've

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.010
got to put me in front." And Biola taught
me that.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:31.100
The Bold Program gave me an experience that
I now filter into the community. And I use

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.600
some of the strategies that were brought to
us. You don't need a whole lot of time to

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.073
do a lot. You need to make up in your mind
whether you're going to do it or not.

00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:46.890
And when we are obedient, then God can use
us. And it's not always in that little box

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.090
that you're in. Sometimes He has to train
you, school you and move you outside. But

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.470
you have to be willing to travel light and
move fast.
