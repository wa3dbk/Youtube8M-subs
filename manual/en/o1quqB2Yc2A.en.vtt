00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.620
My name's Sarah Campbell

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.660
I studied a Bachelor of Applied Science in Recreation Planning and Management

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.760
and I currently work for Adelaide United Football Club.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.830
The most relevant subject to me at the moment in my career

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.010
was the Sport and Event course that we did in our third year.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.600
Basically, it was just how to run an event from

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.370
start to finish, everything you need to do in the lead up,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.690
everything for the day and everything afterwards

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.750
so every week when I have a W-League game, I need to write

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.800
an event plan and it's a full on event plan with

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.860
team officials and match officials that are involved,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.160
timings that your signs are going to put up, your flags are going to be put up,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.280
everything like that, when all of your contractors can bump in and out

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.710
so I've got like a ten page document of a seating plan

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.240
everything like that for the entire stadium and the entire day

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.030
so anything you need is in that document

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.160
so I do that every single week for every single game.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.200
With the UniSA practicums, I actually

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.910
did one for the South Australian Jockey Club

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.940
I figured the Adelaide Cup was a huge event and because

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.030
I knew I wanted to be Sport and Event focussed, I went for that and

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.410
they actually rang me up when I was doing my exams in my last year

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.420
of study and said "Hey we've got a Marketing Assistant job for you"

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.180
"It's not big, it's nothing much but you'll get your foot in the door."

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.120
So I definitely took that and that was where I spent

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.110
my first four years when I was out of uni.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.580
Another practicum I also did was back when the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660
South Australian Soccer Federation was around

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.700
so I did a practicum there, I actually ran a little tournament here at

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.770
Hindmarsh and it was a little five a side tournament that they took

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.410
the winners from each state and then they played as a curtain-raiser

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.440
to the World Cup quite a few years back

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.670
so that was a big project that I did here

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.700
so I've made some great networks because I knew

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.810
you know, I knew I wanted to work in football, I knew that

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.340
from the start, even when I was at the Jockey Club

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.990
I always had that five year plan that

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.050
"Nope, I'm going to be working for football in five years' time"

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.090
so I did you know, I was at the Jockey Club learning as I went

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.160
even there I did running sheets, I did event plans

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.800
I helped with marketing, everything like that

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.170
So, it was definitely a great experience to get there

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.320
but I knew that in five years' time I'd be back here at

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.360
Hindmarsh Stadium so it was a really good thing with the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.450
UniSA course and the way it runs and the way

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.150
you actually get out there in the workforce.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.220
I met some great people, I knew the competitions manager

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.680
at the Soccer Federation and everyone like that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.250
there was even a guy that worked for the competitions manager

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.720
that when I came for this job, he actually put in a good word for me

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.810
so the people that you meet are just so invaluable

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.170
to your future career.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.230
My job really has two parts, I have the administration side

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.300
which is getting the girls contracted, training

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.570
schedules, everything like that, so all of the office work

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.910
that's half of my job, I also plan all of our travel as well

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.690
so bus, plane, everything like that, meals, accommodation.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.740
So that's all the in-office stuff. I then get to travel with the girls

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.790
so that's a lot of fun seeing the work that you've done.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.870
When we come here to play at Hindmarsh, I run the event

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.660
you know, make sure everyone's there on time

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.000
teams arrive on time, referees are there, everything happens on time

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.150
the players know when they're in the change room, out the change room,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.730
when they can warm up, everything like that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.940
make sure they've got their drinks, they've got their food

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.710
the volunteers are here, the signs are up, so yeah

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.160
there's that whole... just from whoa to go, the entire event experience

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.370
and then you get to watch your team play as well

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.440
so yeah, it's a good experience.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.490
I've really stayed in touch with UniSA

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.590
I'm in the alumni, which means I get to meet all the up and coming students

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.680
and it's great to meet such excited people about what they do

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.330
and passionate people, as I believe you need to follow your passion

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.530
you have to love what you're doing every single day

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.580
get out of bed and realise you are doing the job of your dreams

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.630
so I'm very lucky in that way and all these up and coming students

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.960
they're really, really excited about what they do

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.050
and because I've needed volunteers for games, I've actually been able to go back

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.120
to alumni functions and meet with all the young students and I've actually

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.180
got a girl named Dara that actually comes here and she

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.230
runs our ball crew for us on match day, so she's been

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.270
really great and hopefully we can help her with her resume

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.240
which is important for the future

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.340
because I'm in football but this isn't you know, this is

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.400
just the beginning for me, I'd love to just keep

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.440
going up the ranks in football, there's the Football Federation of Australia

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.480
who I work closely with and have good relationships with, so you know

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.360
that's kind of the next step up to go national, then there's all

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.420
the national teams, then there's of course FIFA, so it's endless

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.520
you know, I'm just at the beginning of my career and

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.630
yeah, I pretty much owe it all to my studies and who I met along the way

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.080
because it is good what you know

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.640
but it's also really good who you know.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.680
I think if you love sport, you may not be

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.280
an A-League athlete like the guys behind me, but

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.200
if you love sport, there is a career for you

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.250
and the Recreation Planning and Management course was just the best thing

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.150
I've ever done and I highly recommend it because

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.400
you can have a career in sport without being an athlete and

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.510
the opportunities are endless and if you're passionate about it

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.580
which you really need to be to get through the uni course

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.640
just follow your passion and you'll end up in your dream job.
