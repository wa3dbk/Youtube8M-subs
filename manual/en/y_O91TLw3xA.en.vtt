Hey folks, Abel Body Experts Kevin Weiss and Scott Abel here.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.009
the division of our series on glutenintolerance again is is not a

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.240
technically of oblivion park's college

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.340
reusing gluten intolerance as an example
reflective of what i call the diet

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.539
mentality which is being the round three
perceptual bias in fear mongering

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.879
which has more consequences the benefits
of if you need to be played out last

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.519
twenty seconds of what i just said
please do so because that is the gist of

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:37.880
the argument

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.330
overusing gluten intolerance because
it's the ball trend

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.790
that that exists right now

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.940
here's more from the research

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.900
the the gluten-free lifestyle does
introduce its own problems that you

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.780
meant by three from the heart medical
school harvard medical school one step

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840
at least with free products

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.620
may provide less fire if you're an
interest in standard supermarket option

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.360
something he referred to earlier coach

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.280
sent us here at their own harvard
researchers imagining have allocated for

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.870
two years and i never thought that that
that's what thank you thank you

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.230
dedication ceremony

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.630
all right

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.869
in a recent study published in the
british journal of nutrition

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.670
a recent study published in the british
army attrition found that gluten-free

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.650
diet could hear her

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.280
the growth of beneficial a beneficial
dot bacteria let me read that again

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.830
journal of nutrition famine blue for you
guys can hamper the growth of beneficial

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.020
got bacteria which leads to other guided
digestive issues when they bleed and die

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.260
research trying to digest for wider
array of food choices 'cause eventually

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.749
you're gonna get tired of limited food
choices

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:51.639
and you're going to try to introduce
financial aces you're not going to

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:55.549
digest the money i think that's each
reinforcement would have been told that

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.070
i don't believe in torrance no you don't

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.259
so this reinforces your idea that you're
a victim that you can't stomach or

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.020
tolerate that specific foodstuff and in
the year twenty twelve that just happens

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.379
to be gluten but if you follow along the
east

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.259
these are the same as we realize that
this is done

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:18.539
from the year two thousand invented ten
and for that the nineties and before

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:19.619
that the eighties

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.029
so again

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.899
the gluten free lifestyle introduces its
own problems especially even had a to

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.819
begin with which again for everyone who
tested positive for

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.389
ten to eleven tested negative for so i
get back crossed and then the studies

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.069
from harvard and a journal of nutrition

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.939
uh... illustrate the problems are
postponed

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.639
yeah i think you know if you have people
who make the

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.089
salute from their guts closer than

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.789
and then reintroduce it they're not
reintroducing out

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:51.650
but usually a hole through the night

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.129
phobia or something like that

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.089
they introduce ah...

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.829
protests and resume a dot

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.430
well that's not much wider that that
gives you candidate i probably didn't

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.730
get a keneally's and if your

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.349
supposedly trying to be healthier

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.249
which we thought we were raised used a
proper whatever uh... should be senator

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:14.229
has been simply based

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:18.269
salazar and zampedri yet this is using
that as an example that the other one

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.979
trying to sell their gluten intolerance
when he woke me up

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:27.189
sonar vanity insanity as a holiday
season that he needed a

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:32.059
timothy egan or former nazis because i'm
not as a dilemma generate whatever

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:36.459
happens to be uh... but flavor week
there right whatever data but if you buy

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.899
into in oregon have all that fast that
the injury or

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.759
ancestor and outside

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.079
so it can

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.379
org engineers the end of this and i
guess i'll finish olympus so once again

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.419
what started as a parallel is holed up
close

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.259
at the diagnosis

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:55.389
for a few

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.849
for a good reason because the panacea
diet praise for the men

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.769
all right so instead of killing

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.159
five thousand

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.579
it respect others a hundred pound

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.879
all right so go back to permit if you
don't know what i'm talking about so

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.459
in terms of the whole of the entire
silly i think

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.699
in terms of the proposed

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.840
five thousand people saved

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.259
fifty thousand victims created

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.229
all through the diet mentality

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.100
care to fear mongering

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.560
and creating perceptual bias and
blackness and in the consumer final

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.220
class coach yeah something dramatic
comes right down to is the consumer like

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.139
that

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.270
food markers they obviously pay
attention to these things in a

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.639
it's even that was something that starts
coming up in a

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.659
that's rush right away at it yet here s
products to markets because they don't

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:53.080
exist on the last twenty years maybe
last and poorly ec

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.940
the word at you tend to think it's true
yet despite all of this gluten-free must

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.660
be true that people who so many people
are good and i want to compliment our

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.179
math

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:05.680
because you get bombarded with a message
dot that is true wisconsin

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.580
four people that aren't even if it may
not even really know

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.869
what it means the steamboat freon
harassing staff here so that purchase

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:16.070
that will work for senior editor

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.770
already or prior just because it says
gluten-free which started with twelve

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.580
panelists odeon sonya three fat-free all
crazy was the reason why

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.710
liquor stores was promoted as fat free

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.349
threatening for years frank animating
still say that on the package

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.949
so he lectured for about an hour later
cause i don't know anyone else dilemmas

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.759
for free on yet another student part of
any workshops like that people with

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.009

personal announce on gluten intolerance

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.560
one releasing passage of the diet
mentality that caters to u a specific

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.439
perceptual bias about food that uses
fear

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.309
in order to create

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:13.419
uh... faults awareness so

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.120
the entire system that mentality

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.830
one called bold trading

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.449
uh... in the industry

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.370
today's be aware

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.669
