00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.400
These are the instructions for an origami
elephant.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.840
The first step for the origami elephant, take
out your sheet of paper and we're going to

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.110
make a diagonal fold.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.580
So start with the white side up, take the
bottom corner and fold it all the way up to

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.780
the top.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.980
Try and get it where they touch as precisely
as you can.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.860
And then once you have that locked down, go
ahead and slide your finger down and hold

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.350
it in place so it's nice and flat, and then
go out to the left hand side and then out

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.410
to the right hand side, just like that.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.860
We're going to open it back up and do the
diagonal fold.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.520
So the bottom corner all the way up to the
top corner like that.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.129
Next we're going to open everything back up
again, and we're going to take one of the

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.620
corners, it doesn't actually matter which
one.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.020
We're going to fold it into the middle so
it touches right in where that X is.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.510
So right in the middle of that corner.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380
It's a single blintz fold.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.340
Next we're going to do two kite folds.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.220
And the kite folds are going to start at this
point right here and they're going to connect

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.490
all the way down to the bottom point.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.060
So I'll show you, we're going fold this over,
see how I'm getting it where it goes right

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.659
up to there and then I'm lining it up so it
goes all the way down to the bottom, as well.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.860
So you fold that over on one side.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.851
I'll show you how that makes that crease line
right between those two.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:31.030
I'm going to fold that over that, and I'm
going to do the same thing on this side, where

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.400
I fold this side over it's going to touch
the top point and then it's going to come

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.710
down and meet right at the bottom like that.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.450
Next we're going to make the ears on the elephant.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.899
Go ahead and fold this panel out and out to
the side.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.040
So it's going to go right up to this point,
then slide out to there, and the same thing

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.939
on the left,and fold that one out as well.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.840
So those are going to be the ears.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.190
And then next we have a little bit of a pointy
part here at the top, so I'm going to fold

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:19.910
this down about that far, not too much, it
just sort of rounds the corners off like that.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.850
Finally go ahead and flip it over and see
a little bit and there is the elephant face.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.390
And now the fun part about this one is the
trunk.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.290
What I like to do is fold it up and then pleat
it back down a little bit and then do that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.170
all the way down the trunk, so you have some
nice ridges on the elephant trunk.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.800
You can go up and down, and up and down, and
then I make a little fold right at the bottom,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.160
so that the trunk doesn't have such a point
on it.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.880
And you can see here, you've got some nice
ridges there.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.190
So there is the origami elephant.
