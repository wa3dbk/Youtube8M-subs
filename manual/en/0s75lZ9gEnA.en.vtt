00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.800
Let's talk about wedding hair.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.931
I think wedding hair is, of course, the most
important day of your life, so you have to

00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:19.320
remember you're going to take a picture and
that picture is going to be following you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.029
the rest of your life.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.650
So if your hair is not right or good or the
way you like it, you're going to hate that

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.890
picture forever.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.730
I think wedding hair should be as simple as
possible, because no matter what, it's not

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.250
really about the hair.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.870
It's mainly about the dress that's going to
overpower the hair.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.290
If you have a veil in your hair, you won't
see the hair anyway.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.240
What you're going to see is maybe two pieces
in the front, maybe the side.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.760
So wedding hair should be simple and elegant.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.510
It shouldn't be crazy.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.400
You shouldn't have like ringlets coming around
your face, because especially when you take

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.030
pictures, that probably is going to make a
shadow on your face.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.329
And that's going to be like, "What does she
have on her face?"

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.030
So like I say, let's try to keep it as simple
as possible.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.159
So we're going to do a little hairstyle for
a wedding.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.570
So I'm going to start by teasing your hair.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:33.590
Spray it a little bit.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:44.920
Smooth out the hair, keeping as much fullness
as possible, and we're going to keep it actually

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:59.179
pretty loose.

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:15.100
This is simple.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.390
I could actually bring and pin some either
natural flower into your hair or actually

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.690
put a veil on here and actually have a simple
look for your wedding.
