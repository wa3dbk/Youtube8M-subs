00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.740
The performance is really extraordinary; we consume far less fuel than last year

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:33.754
It's the only circuit where, as a driver, you can make a difference. I tried to make it to the finish, but unfortunately it didn't hold together.

00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:36.634
Can we know which team you think you will be with next year ?

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:38.814
For the moment, the team has total confidence in me.

00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:50.120
It's important to feel that you've got people who support you -- like every driver. When you're at an F1 Grand Prix, you're so focused on the race that it's quite difficult to have any real contact with the fans. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.600
On the other hand, the fact that you can make yourself much more available and that you're under much less stress makes moments away from races easier and more enjoyable.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.780
He's a nice driver.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.140
He's always the same. Always available. Always smiling.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.140
It's really nice to have a chance to meet him.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.320
How do you become a Formula 1 driver ?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.000
You need to win in karting

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.880
He's a good driver, no ? Very good.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.180
I've always driven Renaults in single-seater racing. It's extraordinary for me, I'm really happy to be able to continue and I really hope to win again with Renault.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.360
I'm very happy to have you with us today. It's an honor

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:51.740
Thank you, everybody. Thank you for being here. ... Since the beginning of the year, I have been pushing very hard. It was an extraordinary week. We qualified in seventh place and could have ended up fifth if I'd been able to finish the race without any problems. 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.140
It's been a great day

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:05.440
I'm someone who believes that human relations are very important and, as a Formula 1 driver, it was really important to come here to see all these people, shake their hands and talk to them
