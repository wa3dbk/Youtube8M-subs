Frank Spear: Actually I get asked the question
a lot of how I ended up being a dentist. Or,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.099
what motivated me to get into dentistry. I
came from a small town with a father who was

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.480
a mechanic and a mother who was a second-grade
teacher and there was two dentists in the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.309
town I was growing up.
And so I ended up at Pacific Lutheran University,

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.620
and spent my first year there, trying my best
to make it. And, ended up with like a 2.3

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.039
GPA and even got a D in one class. My sophomore
year my parents said, like, “You gotta figure

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.899
out what you’re gonna do with your life.”
Well, all of my buddies- because I was playing

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.510
football in college-all my buddies were physical
education majors. And so, for me, it seemed

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.210
like what I’ll do, I’ll be a coach. That
had the requirements of the phys-ed major.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.830
The two biggies were anatomy and physiology.
What I didn’t count on, was following just,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.360
in love with anatomy. And the instructor was
a woman named Ruth Sorensen. I’ll never

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.659
forget it: it was December 19th, 72. It was
a Thursday. And I go into her office and she’s

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.840
sitting there at her desk and she looks at
me and she says “What are you going to do

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.350
with your life?” And, honestly, the only
other thing I thought about was being an electrician.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.479
And honest to God, after listening to her
talk about my potential, 15 minutes later

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.920
I said “You know what? I’ll be pre-Med.”
And I literally that day, sitting at that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.750
desk, December 19th, 1972 – that’s when
I decided to be a dentist. And for me I honestly

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.240
didn’t know until that moment.
People ask me why I love education so much.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.850
And why do I do what I do in education. And,
in reality I never ever walk on stage, ever,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.660
that I don’t say to myself, "I hope I can
be Ruth Sorensen for somebody in that audience

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.819
today. I hope, I can let them know there’s
more in them than they have a clue about.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.260
They just don’t know their potential yet.
They really don’t know their potential."

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.099
And as educators we can see it in them. But
they don’t see it yet. And what Ruth Sorensen

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.319
did was she saw something in me that I was
clueless about. I was truly clueless about

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.150
it. For me, I always pray I get to be be Ruth
Sorensen for somebody, especially students

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.800
in seminars and workshops. So, long story
short, that’s how I ended up being a dentist.
