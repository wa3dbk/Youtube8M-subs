00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.290
Ahoy, matey! No, I'm not just any sailor; I'm a yard-saler!

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.290
And I've dropped anchor to show you how to host a profoundly profitable yard sale!

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.809
Stay Cheap!

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:19.460
Hey!

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.239
I'm Jeff Yeager, the ultimate cheapskate and host of The Cheap Life!

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.989
Yard sales are a great way to de-clutter and earn a few extra bucks,

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.530
but there's more to it than just putting price tags on your old stuff and a sign out in the yard.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.900
First, go big

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.110
or go home.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.160
Team up with neighbors, friends, family
members or participate in collected

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.380
yard sales sponsored by communities, churches or schools. Bigger events mean

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.760
more visibility, more publicity and of course, more customers.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.760
LJ: That's a win for everyone! *whistle blow* What's the best deal you've ever gotten at a yard sale? Tell us about it in the comment section below for a chance to win a $50 gift card!

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.010
Umpire offscreen: You're out!

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.470
Jeff: Every yard sale needs to be properly publicized. Post neon signs in your neighborhood directing

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.210
customers to the sale!

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.350
And advertise a week or two in advance on community bulletin boards, neighborhood

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.640
list serves, and on Craigslist. List specific big ticket items to entice would be

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.870
shoppers. Sometimes it's not very smart to
price everything, or even anything.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.130
Just tell shoppers to make you an offer. Experts say you'll move more merchandise, and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.090
make more money!

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.120
Whether you price your items or not, make sure you know what something's

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.120
truly worth before you sell it.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.150
In March 2012,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.780
Zack Boedish dropped

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.480
fourteen bucks on what he thought was
a Picasso poster at a thrift store.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.240
Turns out it was the real deal and he
was able to turn around and sell it for

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.440
seven grand

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.340
to a private buyer.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.069
Remember, sometimes a poster is a poser.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.330
Peak people's interest by having some attractive, or even strange,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.299
items front and center. Also stage some items further back

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.459
to tantalize would be shoppers out of their cars, and off the sidewalk.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.149
It's time for a Cheapskate Shout-out!

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:30.780
My good friend at yardsalequeen.com likes to set the mood at her yard sales

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.669
with music

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.540
and maybe even refreshments.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.019
If it's fun, people will be more likely to stick around and buy more stuff!

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.219
Thanks, Yard Sale Queen!

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.689
And after your big sale is over, and you're done basking in the glory of less clutter and

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.439
more moolah,

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.999
consider donating leftover items to local thrift stores and other charities.

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:59.999
I'm sure there's somebody out there who could fit into these old overalls of mine.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.799
I'm Jeff Yeager for The Cheap Life! Yard sale away, and stay cheap!
