00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.510
Hello everyone! I am Dmitry Pobedinskii, I am pleased to welcome you to the portal QWRT,

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.410
where you can learn about science and technology without boredom..

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.310
Approximately 75 thousand people on the planet Earth

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.740
have the so-called transposition of internal organs.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.220
Their hearts are on the right side, and their livers - on the left.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.859
And location of all internal organs is like a reflection in a mirror.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.039
Nature can easily reflect us like in a mirror, and nothing will change.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.600
And there is no need to reflect the external appearance, because we, humans, as well as virtually

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.420
all other animals, are outwardly mirror symmetrical.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.760
But where has this symmetry come from?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.000
Hands, arms, legs, feet, head, tail - all have different functions.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.899
Thus it is clear that the upper and lower part of the body must be different.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.580
As well as the front and rear. However, despite all this,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.540
the left and right sides are identical, as if nature has forgotten to think of,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.030
what the left side can do better and what the right side can. So what's the reason?

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.850
Let's go 4 billion years back, at the time when life on Earth was in its infancy.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.430
Back then all organisms were single-celled, and the most ideal form for them was a ball!

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.600
They did not move much and interacted with the environment

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.960
on all directions, so they had to grow equally in all directions.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440
That is, all organisms were spherically symmetrical.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.120
Whatever direction you rotate them, they looked the same.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.940
But in the course of evolution, organisms were getting more complex, and their mass was increasing.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.740
And here gravitation manifested itself. It is because of it living beings

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.540
became asymmetric in the direction up-down. Sense organs and the mouth

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.140
went up, organs of motion went down, and so on...

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.340
But they preserved radial symmetry, that is, when turned around

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.000
the vertical axis at a particular angle, they look the same.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.680
The next stage of evolution began when organisms realized that to move is cool!

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.940
For example, to move for overtaking another creature and eating it.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.740
This is how predators and their prey appeared, and both needed speed and attentiveness.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.680
The former - to successfully hunt, the latter - to successfully escape.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.840
This is how front-to-rear asymmetry appeared. Senses and the brain, the most important things,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.510
moved to the front, The rest moved towards the rear.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.390
But evolution ignored the interior left/right asymmetry.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.230
It simply was not an obstacle. And it was suitable for duplicating some of the organs,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.600
which was an advantage. For example, thanks to the two ears,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.119
we can determine where the sound comes from by the difference in its delay.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:45.359
With two eyes, we have a binocular 3D vision.

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.499
Even two nostrils are for a reason, though, it may seem, one nostril would be enough.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.200
In fact, almost always air moves slightly slower through one of the nostrils

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.900
than through the other. Because of this, we can detect smells,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.239
perception of which takes a little more time than usual.

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.799
So the two nostrils expand the range of smells we can detect.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.400
Thus, the mirror symmetry is a feature passed down

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.840
by our ancestors. After all, it did not impede the evolution.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.100
As for the asymmetry of the internal organs, initially it did not exist.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.780
It developed as a response to the increasing complexity of the vascular and digestive systems.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.560
But take simpler animals, such as worms, insects, shrimps.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.080
Their internal organs are located absolutely symmetrically.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.860
As for plants, their symmetry is dictated

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.400
by the interaction with the environment.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.160
For example, the flowers that grow vertically, are radially symmetrical, because for them,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.299
all directions are equivalent. But for flowers growing laterally

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.440
this is not the case; they lose front-to-back symmetry and become only mirror symmetric.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.840
Of course, everything may have exceptions, for example,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.120
the fiddler crab, the leaves of begonias, the flounder.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.360
But as great Sherlock Holmes said:

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.580
"These are exceptions that only prove the rule."

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.400
