00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:10.808
We are developing soft-bodied robots and there are three important

00:00:10.808 --> 00:00:13.889
things to know about these robots. First, their bodies are made

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.638
out of soft silicon and they can bend and twist because of that.

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:22.458
They're also inherently safe to be around. Second, because of their

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:26.896
bodies capability to bend and twist, these robots are capable

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:31.466
of very compliant motion and they're also capable of very rapid

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:36.154
agile maneuvers which pushes the envelope on what machines

00:00:36.154 --> 00:00:41.177
can do today. And, thirdly, the robots are self-contained and

00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:45.959
autonomous; in other words we can package the power source,

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:50.098
the computation and the actuation and sensing needed for these

00:00:50.098 --> 00:00:51.757
robots to deliver their motions.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:56.771
Traditionally soft robots have been either self-contained or capable

00:00:56.771 --> 00:01:01.695
of high-performance, but not both. So specifically in our lab we

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:05.872
want to achieve both of those goals simultaneously in one machine.

00:01:05.872 --> 00:01:10.691
Currently a soft robot has two parts. One, which is a little bit smaller,

00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:13.638
is the rigid part where we store all the supporting hardware.

00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:16.990
And the second part, which is a little bit larger, is the soft body

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.307
where all the continuous, natural movement happens. And so

00:01:20.307 --> 00:01:23.459
when we thought about it, a fish made sense. It has a very similar

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.441
structure: in the head of the fish where the brains are held, it is a

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:31.791
little bit more rigid, but in the rear of the fish where the angulatory motion

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.767
happens, it's quite soft and compliant.

00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:38.485
This is our soft robot fish. Like we said, he has a soft body here in

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:42.530
green and the supporting hardware up front. The way this fish works

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.724
is it stores fluid onboard, in the form of a gas, and then releases

00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:51.506
this gas through a series of pipes and valves into the body.

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:55.693
If you think about it, it is very similar to blowing up a balloon.

00:01:55.693 --> 00:01:59.390
In that case, your mouth would be the pressure source and the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.784
balloon would be the body actuator. And basically by inflating and

00:02:02.784 --> 00:02:06.331
un-inflating different parts of of the body we can get it to angulate.

00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:10.647
What is special about this fish is it has its brains onboard too.

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:13.786
So if I, from my computer, tell the fish to move forward a signal

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:18.204
is sent wirelessly through the water to the brains and then the brains

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.701
tell the hardware what to do in order to move forward.

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:26.098
Biological fish use the 'escape maneuver' or the 'c-turn' to escape

00:02:26.098 --> 00:02:31.022
prey and they do these maneuvers very fast; on the order of

00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:35.985
100 milliseconds. Our robot fish is also able to execute this escape

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:39.462
maneuver at the same speed: 100 milliseconds.

00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:43.247
The fact that our fish can perform an escape maneuver is really

00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:47.580
important for the field of soft robotics. It shows that soft robots can

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.325
be both self-contained and capable of high performance.

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:55.823
The maneuver is so fast and it has got such high body curvature

00:02:55.823 --> 00:02:59.726
that it shows soft robots might be more capable than hard robots

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:02.405
in some tasks.
