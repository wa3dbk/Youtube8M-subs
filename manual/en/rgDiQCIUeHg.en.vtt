hi fashionsistas, if you are new to putting
on make-up it may be confusing as to where

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.300
to place concealer so today I’m going to
show you where to place it for a flawless

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.450
make-up look.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.010
Now concealer is best applied after you have
put foundation on.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.550
You can use concealer to cover blemishes dark
circles or you can simply use concealer to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.150
highlight . You don’t necessarily need to
use different coloured concealers to highlight,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.929
you can just use one colour concealer in all
the places you want highlighted because your

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.739
concealers should be a little lighter than
your foundation.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.140
Around your brows placing concealer on your
brow bone and above your brows will open up

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.660
your eyes and add some highlight to your face.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.010
And if you fill in your eyebrows like me,
it’s going to sharpen and define your brows

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:58.579
too.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.490
Under the eyes
Whether you struggle with dark circles or

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.149
not your under eyes always need a little lifting
with concealer.

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.320
The best way to apply this is when you apply
triangle shape along your under eye, down

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:22.560
your nose and then join the corners together.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.090
Inner Eye Corners
Shadows are the naturally the darkest around

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.680
inner corners of your eyes so you want to
place a concealer at the inner corner here

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.499
to brighten and highlight that area.

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.689
Down the centre of your nose
Add some light centre of your face and naturally

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.170
enhance your face by placing a line of concealer
down the bridge of your nose.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.659
Around nostrils
If you've got any redness around your nostrils,

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.850
you are placing some concealers here are going
to neutralise that redness.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.369
Around
Applying concealer along your top lip is great

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:13.580
for making your lips appear more pouty.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.460
At the centre of your chin
Get rid of any shadows and redness by adding

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.630
a touch of concealer at the centre of your
chin.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.610
This is also going to brighten this area as
well.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.980
If you want a little extra coverage from your
concealer, leave it on for a couple of minutes

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.100
to allow to set.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.350
Then blend it all in you can use either sponge
or a brush.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.350
I prefer brush as it’s a little quicker.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:53.880
When I want a really heavy coverage I’ll
press the concealer in with 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.090
a sponge.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.500
And if you want to explore with using different
shades of concealer, I’ll include a link

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.370

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.900
