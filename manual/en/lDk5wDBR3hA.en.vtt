00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.480
Aged Angus Banger with cheese

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:14.748
and a crispy McDalmond
chicken wrap.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.049
Fries in the hole.
Order on five.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.918
Give me more Giggle Meals.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.052
What the hell do you mean

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.054
they want apple slices
in the Giggle Meals?

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:22.422
Corporate wants to offer
a healthy option.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:24.625
A healthy option?
Yes, a healthy option.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.027
Well, silly me, I thought we
stood for something around here.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.729
No, beef dunk sales, down.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.130
Giggle Meal sales, down.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.498
Fries, Coke, Sprite...

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.233
Let me guess, down?

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.835
Look, I don't like it
any more than you do.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:36.103
But let's play by
their rules this time

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:37.571
till we get the ball back.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.773
Jasmine dropped a burger patty
under the soft-serve machine.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.108
Well, fish it out
and reheat it.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.010
What is this,
half-past amateur hour?

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.078
Wrong side of the bed
this morning, JJ?

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.213
I sleep on a Futon.

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:47.881
I've been using the same
Brita for three years.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:49.216
My roommate is a bassist.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:52.152
You tell corporate I'm not
putting apple slices on my menu.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.922
What's next, no more
chicken beaks in the Everything?

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.891
Now you wanna tell me why
you been acting so strange?

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.827
This is my first day back,
and I'm nervous around you.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.065
You look good, JJ.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.200
Look, I wrote to you.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.402
The letters came back,
where have you been?

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.438
I worked my way up to being
a GM of a Sbarro in Tel Aviv.

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.741
Then one day, I'm stuffing
couscous into a calzone

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:17.311
and I realized
a woman's life is worth nothing

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.380
unless she's making
a great man greater.

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:22.182
Let's get
one thing straight--

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.450
No, let's get
two things straight.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.986
You and me make a good team
and you know it.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.088
And if just for one second
you could drop this whole

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:30.357
damaged goods routine,
we could make this work.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.092
Now I'm not asking that
you (bleep) bang me

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.127
in the back of
my Tercel like it's 1997.

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.097
I'm just asking for a chance
to make a difference.

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:38.932
That's three things.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.467
That's what you said
in my Tercel.

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:41.969
Guys?

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.103
You better take a look at this.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.406
♪

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.845
We got a school bus out there.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.180
It's the short kind.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.482
I need Dora the Explorer
figurines ready yesterday.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:57.117
Throw two in some of the bags,
they'll think it's Christmas.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.319
McCaskell,
defrost the Aged Angus Bangers.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.154
No, hold on McCaskell,
you won't need to do that.

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.890
They're just gonna want
Giggle Meals and apple slices.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.124
Don't tell me what they want.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:06.293
There's a Dominican flag
on that dashboard.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:07.494
This is Angus Bangers

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.096
and family-size curlies
all the way home.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.464
I know this order,
we do this my way,

00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:11.498
you understand?

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:12.799
We lost picture.
Well, pull it up.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.067
Fix the Goddamn feed.

00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:15.068
Here comes the order.

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:16.937
We're gonna have to fly blind
on this one.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.205
Ugh!

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:22.242
Jesus, JJ.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:29.216
(man)
<i>Uh, gimme 18 Giggle Meals</i>

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.984
<i>or whatever's cheapest.</i>

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.186
<i>I've got $30.</i>

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.821
Do you want fries
or apple slices?

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:36.290
<i>Whatever's fastest.</i>

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:38.125
I'm sorry.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.960
(beeps)

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:43.330
Yes, JJ, apple slices.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:47.100
That's the post-9/11 world
we live in now.

00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:51.004
Unless you change the dialogue.

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:54.308
If anyone can do it,
you can.

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:56.777
Or doesn't that JJ
work here any more?

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.111
♪

00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:12.960
Good afternoon, sir,
I'm the manager here.

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:16.096
One of the managers.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.966
I'm afraid we're not gonna be
able to give apple slices today.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.267
<i>Yeah, whatever,
no one cares.</i>

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.468
You know, there was a time
in this country

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:25.405
when apples were
for feeding horses.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.808
When McDalmond's was more
than just a parking lot

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:29.810
where people met to buy Ritalin.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.979
People weren't obese.

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:33.280
They were just fat.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.883
And if you wanted an apple,

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:40.320
you'd have to eat a pie.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.823
That's why I'm not gonna
give you what you ordered.

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:46.493
No, today, I'm gonna give you
3800 calories

00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:49.863
of the greatest Goddamn
country in the world.

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:52.099
(static on intercom)

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:56.003
Pull ahead.

00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:58.438
JJ?

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.041
Someone emptied their but
in the women's bathroom.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.180
Hand me my mop.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:12.052
(JJ)
Ugh, there is a lot
of (bleep) in here.
