00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.949
So I'm just finishing up the forehead, I'm
just going to give you a little, make that

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.240
scrape a little more prominent. Really. Just
like that, just a little bit. See that texture

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.769
gives it that scraping effect and then you
can use the end of the sponge without the

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.630
makeup to get off the excess. So it looks,
yeah. Nice. Just a little scrape on the chin.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.320
Ok so that's basically the red effect. Ok.
I'm going to move on to the next color. Would,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.500
that would be? Which would be, I'm going to
use a little black now to do the charring

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.710
effect. Ok. And that's just going to give
it the effect of, of that was, you know a

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.899
road burn and also the charring from the fire.
Ok. Because you were burnt up pretty bad.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.100
Yeah. It was a pretty bad accident I'm glad
you didn't have to see it. I took a little

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.960
peak. Made me a little sick. You can just
use the same sponge, you can just use a different

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.330
to it, that's fine. OK. Yeah if it mix. Just
a little bit yeah. Yeah if it mixes it's not

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.370
a big deal. I'll just use a different end.
Just going to do a little along here. So you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.820
just do little touches of the black right?
Yeah. It's really to, I mean honestly it's,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.920
there is no right or wrong, I mean it's how
you want, how you want it to look. Ok now

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.500
how charred you want it to be, and I want
to make you pretty charred. So I'm going to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.860
do just all around the injury here. So you
have to have an artistic sense. Yeah, it's

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.500
just one of those things, I mean I'm, I'm
mostly self taught, I mean I did the makeup

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.420
for Halloween Haunted and some other (Really)
stuff but I really, just experimentation and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.930
just seeing what looks good, I mean that's
all makeup artists work that way. When they

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.271
did the Freddy Krueger makeup I think he was
using a piece, David Miller was using a piece

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:35.450
of pizza and he arranged it the way he wanted
to and said oh that's it and that's how he

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.540
got the face for Freddy it's makeup. How cool.
So it is a lot of experimentation, especially

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.810
if you are creating a character, more times
that not you have an idea of what the director

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.299
you know is going for. What they want. Right
and even then there's always room for experimentation

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.159
so you know what and give them some options.
You always want to give them options. I might

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.270
give you a little there. A little there yeah
on the scrape. See that so that's a nice little

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:09.730
scrape. Maybe even..Oh on my lip. Blood on
your lip. So I'm burned, burned, burned, burn

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:16.020
baby burn. Yeah. Oh that piece is coming off,
there you go. Yeah because I've been laughing

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.950
too hard, it's your fault. There you go. I'm
a happy burn victim.
