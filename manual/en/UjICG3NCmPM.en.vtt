00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.119
we're going to make another awesome
mince meat preparation that is keema with

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.050
chana dal; chana dal also has a nice meaty flavor and these two combine along with

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.449
this masalas it will be excellent

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.960
so to make this, take oil in a pan in this
add onions and also add salt and we're

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.100
going to cook this onions till they're slightly golden in color now when

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.239
they're slightly coloring add
ginger-garlic paste and cook this in the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.379
garlic paste in the raw flavor is gone
in this add green chillies, cumin seed

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.660
powder, red chilli powder, lot of red
chilli powder because i haven't eaten this

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.180
spicy keema for a while now

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.180
wow, in this add the minced meat that is
keema wow and as soon as you add this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.060
keema you know just mix it so that none of these masalas get burned and this keema

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.659
will slightly ooze out some moisture and
going to cook this till the keema is all

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.320
well cooked put the flame on medium and put the lid on so that the keema oozes out some

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.490
of the moisture and also get cooked its own juices; after around 10 minutes

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.070
the moisture is also evaporating and the
keema is almost cooked that is when we're

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.560
going to add some tomato puree  you know this will give a very nice flavor for the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.890
keema you know you want this keema to be nice and juicy

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.560
so we're going to add some of the tomato puree to this and we're going to once again

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
cover it and let it cook for another 5
minutes now look at this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.740
kheema masala this is very very tasty
but still not done in this we're going

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.340
to add the boiled chana dal and add the
water of the chana dal on top of it based

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.689
on the consistency you need you adjust
this water if you add the entire thing

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.970
and if this becomes too much then it
won't taste good chana dal and the meat is

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.260
a great combination

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.010
you know we make awesome kebabs and so many things so dear friends in this in the last

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.230
add some chopped mint garam masala
powder i think i will need to add some

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.849
more of this water from the boiling
chana dal and also we need to adjust the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:38.010
salt to check this taste haha now this
mint leaf also will give an excellent

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.730
flavor to this now and now in this check
the seasoning

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.290
yeah actually the salt is enough in between i added little bit and sprinkle

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.569
some chopped coriander put the lid on
and let it simmer for two minutes and

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:05.519
switch off the flame and your dish is all ready haha so much of aroma wow

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:19.709
with this chana dal and the mince meat that's keema hmm wow you have to add the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.540
mint leaves because the chana dal flavor
