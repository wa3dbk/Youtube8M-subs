00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.700
No genre takes itself as seriously as the
fantasy-RPG.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.310
Games like The Elder Scrolls, Baldur’s Gate,
and Ultima offer up grand tales of dragons,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.930
goblins, and helpless maidens, all delivered
in a completely straight-faced fashion which

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.650
is entirely oblivious to the absurdity of
the subject matter.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.430
Taking this into account, it’s refreshing
to play a title like The Bard’s Tale.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.770
A portable conversion of the 2004 PS2 and
Xbox game (which in turn was a spiritual update

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.360
of a dusty old computer RPG), this knockabout
romp gleefully pokes fun at the fantasy gaming

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.500
subset, taking every available opportunity
to mercilessly stick the boot in - with predictably

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.270
amusing results.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.780
Instead of being the archetypal fresh-faced
hero on a mission of justice, the titular

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.740
Bard is a opportunistic, womanising lout who
has low morals and a high libido, and he provides

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.040
the bulk of the game’s belly-laughs.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.020
Voiced by British actor Cary Elwes (Robin
Hood: Men in Tights, Saw, The Princess Bride),

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.210
The Bard is hands-down one of the greatest
video game characters ever created.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.909
His cutting remarks, pithy observations, and
expertly delivered dialogue add immeasurably

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.909
to the game’s appeal - although it goes
without saying that many of the gags are only

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.880
going to hit home with seasoned RPG players.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.510
Elwes - who also contributed to the script
- really does bring The Bard to life with

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.320
his roguish accent, and this makes up for
shortcomings elsewhere in the game’s presentation.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.210
Granted, the fact that the developers have
succeeded in cramming a PS2/Xbox game into

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.890
the iPhone is commendable (with a download
size of 1.34GB, you’ll need a wi-fi connection),

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.640
but The Bard’s Tale is hardly what one would
describe as a good-looking game, even by 2004

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.920
standards.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.920
Characters are well-modelled (especially the
numerous buxom females that litter the bard’s

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.070
path), but suffer from curiously jerky animation.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.549
Locations are often slightly bland and featureless,
too.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.130
Despite its visual hiccups, The Bard’s Tale
is packed to bursting with quest-based goodness.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.479
The game is massive, offering hours and hours
of entertainment, not to mention plenty of

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.180
secrets to discover along the way.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.799
Although it takes perverse pleasure in highlighting
the shortcomings of the fantasy-RPG lineage,

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.790
The Bard’s Tale ironically adheres to many
stables of the genre.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.169
You explore, fight, and indulge in side-quests
- all pretty standard role-playing fare.

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.799
Combat is handled a little differently, though,
with the bard using his musical skills to

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.439
summon allies and turn the tide of battle.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.499
Possibly the game’s most significant weakness
is that it was never intended to be played

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.640
on a platform like the iPhone.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.569
While the designers have done a reasonably
successful job of taking a console title - which

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.870
previously benefitted from a proper pad with
a multitude of buttons - and porting it to

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.059
a touchscreen device with no physical input,
the interface presents several issues.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.989
Many of the menu buttons are tiny, making
them hard to tap.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.900
During particularly tense moments, it feels
as if you’re all fingers and thumbs as you

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.569
try and move, summon allies, and avoid the
unwanted attention of your foe.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.030
If you have access to an iPad then we’d
recommend you play The Bard’s Tale on that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.540
platform, as the larger screen size is a real
blessing.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.159
For all of its irksome problems, The Bard’s
Tale is still a highly worthwhile purchase

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.400
for iOS RPG lovers.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.379
The entire game is drenched in an epic atmosphere,
and Cary Elwes’s stellar vocal contribution

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.849
is legitimate justification for purchase on
its own.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.969
Converting a large-scale console RPG to iOS
was a bold move, but on the whole The Bard’s

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.530
Tale is a success.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.269
Its winning humour and epic quest combine
to make its minor shortcomings seem less problematic,

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.010
and it’s sure to keep fans of the genre
busy for weeks to come - as well as offering

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.370
more chuckles than a omnibus edition of You’ve
Been Framed.
