00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, now it's on.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You know the rules?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Yes, three times Bloody Mary.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Okay... Gonna turn off the light now.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I AM DISFIGURED!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What's wrong?!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Look at my face!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So ugly!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
No, there's nothing wrong.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One of the most boring movies ever...

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's find out if everything is alright here!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Good night, by tomorrow Philipp. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Okay, even if you might not believe me,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but something is wrong here in this house!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Got up tomorrow and the coat layed totally wrong than I've layed down last night!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And I, I got the feeling that...

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
... don't know, that someone here playes games with me.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm scared of these changes,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that a ghost operates here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Something in this house goes wrong, because...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'm simply scared to turn around one day and everything is...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Oh my god, oh my god what's wrong here?!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
A movie, in which nothing supernatural occures...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
There! What was that?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That's been a fart, Philipp.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Experience 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Are you here?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It's a mask.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Who says that this isn't a mask too?!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Take it off! Take it off!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That's my face!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It's your face?!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
... absolutely nothing!

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That's not your face, you're not that ugly!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I have just found a video and directly watched it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And since that I'm afraid of someboy calling on me and...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Oh my god!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This is him!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You won't kill me okay! You won't!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You've ordered a kebap, what's up?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What's that? What is it? You hear that? 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This can't be true? What was going on today...

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Oh my god!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
No, no, no. Go away!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
What do you want? What do you want from me?!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
What? I use to cut tomatoes when shaving.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
