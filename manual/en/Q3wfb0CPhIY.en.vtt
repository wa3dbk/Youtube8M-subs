00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.950
I have this rectangle here, and
I want to figure out its area.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.860
I want to figure out how
much space it is taking up

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.950
on my screen right over here.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.650
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.320
and try to figure out the
area of this entire rectangle.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.584
And when you do it, think
about the two different ways

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:16.250
you could do it.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.040
You could either
multiply the length

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.120
of the rectangle times
the entire width,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.420
so just figure out the
area of the entire thing.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.480
Or you could
separately figure out

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.380
the area of this red or
this purple rectangle

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.920
and then separately figure
out this blue rectangle

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.090
and realize that their
combined areas is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.399
the exact same thing as
the entire rectangle.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.940
So I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.839
and try both of
those strategies out.

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.380
So let's just try
them out ourselves.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.050
First, let's look at
the overall dimensions

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.510
of the larger rectangle.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.220
The length is 9, and
we're going to multiply

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.940
that times the width.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.700
But what's width here?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.720
Well, the width is
going to be 8 plus 12.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.750
This entire distance right
over here is 8 plus 12.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.705
So it's 9 times 8 plus 12.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.060
This is one way that
we could figure out

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.120
the area of this entire thing.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.420
This is just the
length times the width.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.095
8 plus 12 is obviously
going to be equal to 20.

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:19.720
But the other way
that we could do it--

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.011
and this must be equivalent,
because we're figuring out

00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:24.480
the area of the same
thing-- is to separate out

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.982
the area of these
two sub-rectangles.

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:27.690
So let's do that.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.310
And this must be
equal to this thing.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.804
So what's the area of
this purple rectangle?

00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:33.220
Well, it's going
to be the length.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.800
It's going to be 9.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.400
Let me do it in that same color.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.750
It's going to be 9 times
the width, which is 8.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.340
It's going to be 9 times 8.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.970
And then what's the area
of this the blue rectangle?

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.250
Well, that's going
to be 9 times--

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.700
so the height here is 9 still.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.650
The height is 9.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.990
And what's the width?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.700
Well, the width is 12.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.410
And what's the area
of the combined

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.942
if you wanted to combine the
area of the purple rectangle

00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:03.650
and the blue one?

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.608
Well, you'd just add
these two things together.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.090
And of course, when you add
these two things together,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.100
you get the area of
the entire thing.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.020
So these things
must be equivalent.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.430
They are calculating
the same area.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.890
Now, what's neat
about this is we just

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.530
showed ourselves the
distributive property

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.134
when we're dealing
with these numbers.

00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:27.800
You could try these
out for any numbers.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.341
They'll work for
any numbers, because

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:31.800
the distributive property
works for any numbers.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.920
You see 9 times the
sum of 8 plus 12

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.570
is equal to 9 times
8 plus 9 times 12.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.940
We essentially have
distributed the 9-- 9 times 8

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.360
plus 9 times 12.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.270
And let's actually
calculate it just

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.500
to satisfy ourselves
about the area.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.830
So if you multiply the length
times the entire width,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.820
so that's 9 times
8 plus 12, that's

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.610
the same thing as 9
times 20, which is 180.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.820
And over here, if you
calculate the area

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.050
of this purple rectangle,
that is 9 times 8.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.980
So that is going
to be equal to 72.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.910
That's the purple rectangle.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.162
The area of the blue rectangle,
9 times 12, well, that's 108.

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:28.912
And we're going to
take the sum of the two

00:03:28.912 --> 00:03:32.340
to find the area of
the larger rectangle.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.760
What is 72 plus 108?

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.340
Well, 72 plus 108 is
also equal to 180.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.180
So we've verified.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.172
These, indeed, are equal to each
other when we calculate them.

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:44.630
And they make sense,
because we are

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.263
calculating the same exact area.
