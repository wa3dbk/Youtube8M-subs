Today were going to take a look at the Thule
Pack and Pedal Tour Rack, part number th100016.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.500
The pack and pedal tour rack is a rack thats
designed to clamp on to your bikes frame either

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.889
at the front of the bicycle or at the back.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.090
The system provides a place to attach some
of Thules Pannier bags or even use the top

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.650
saddle for strapping down cargo.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.029
There are three main components: You have
the base rack structure, theres a top saddle

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.320
piece thats going to attach to our frame from
the underside that will sit on our frame underneath

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.479
the tab and a couple of locking hooks and
provide the attachment platform for some of

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.420
Thules Pannier bags.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.920
Finally there are the adjustment braces: Theres
a set of large, a set of medium that we already

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.569
have on our rack, and a set of small braces.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:01:18.229
Youll use the different side braces depending
on the size and shape 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:55.189
of 
your 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:49.079
