Rose Yeong Singapore Being a woman is not

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.849
easy to-to be in the business - this business
world is mostly dominated by men. So I was

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.953
willing to really work and work and work and
make myself a name in Singapore. Title: Rose

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:35.390
Yeong The Shoe Lady of Holland V. My home
town is in Ipoh, a very small little town

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:44.150
in Malaysia. I m the eldest girl in the family,
with two younger brothers. I m not the favorite

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:52.370
of my dad. Because in the olden days girls
are not popular. Boys are superior. So I did

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:02.730
had a hard time. Card: In 1972, at 18 years
old, Rose ran away from home. I was very happy

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.450
to run away. I can t consider myself runaway
from home. I got myself to Singapore, and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.330
I got myself a job. And I worked as a waitress.
Card: Within 3 years, Rose met and married

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.281
her husband and gave birth to her first son.
The little boy was my mother in-law s and

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:25.164
father-in-law s doting grandchild. so they
have to look after him. Everybody take turn

00:01:25.164 --> 00:01:31.030
to look after the little boy. And he was like
four months old. My-my husband said, Hey,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:44.159
look here. You have lots of time at home.
Go, go. Let s go and look for a place. I was

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.420
saying, What shall we sell? And my mother-in-law
said, Well, women love shoes and handbags.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.600
That s what you re going to do. So we found
this little place in Holland V. So finally

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.070
I said, Okay. Just set the business and I
will run it. When I first started my business,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.690
it was all by myself. When I started, I don
t know- I don t about selling shoes or anything

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.470
I don t know about business. Our shoe suppliers,
they ask for cash in advance, payment in advance,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.490
so we, being new in the market, so we pay
them. We pay them the money; the stock never

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.540
come. The stock did not come. And there-there
were times that when we paid them, the stock

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.130
came but it s not what we have ordered. And
from there I started to be more smarter. I

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.180
had gone for a shoe designing course, so I
know my products I know what they are putting

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.599
into the shoes. So if my shoemakers, they
try to hoodwink me and if they try to give

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.550
me inferior property or design or whatever,
or quality, I told them Hey, this is not what

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.470
I ve ordered. In about two years time, I m
able to build up a very good reputation for

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.480
myself and my business. And that s when I
built up a name for myself being the Shoe

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:05.311
Lady in Holland V. Eventually, my marriage
fail because I was so into my business. My

00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:09.140
husband felt that I m smarter than him. He
felt that he s inferior because I am making

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:17.099
money from the business. I I have becoming
the sole breadwinner. So he is not that happy.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.349
And he used my boys as an excuse for that
I m neglecting the children, neglecting the

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:30.170
family. I said, No, I m not. I have to work
hard. Even when I m very sick, I still need

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.269
to go back to the shop and work, and make
sure the business keep on going. Card: Advice

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.099
that fits Whether you re married or single,
and especially if you are married, it s very,

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.650
very important that you have to be independent.
Otherwise, just like what happened to me,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.680
when my husband left me high and dry, I ve
got nothing in my account. The next day when

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.159
I open my shop, the first sale I make, that
s my money. That s how it keeps me going.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:08.319
Question: How many pairs of shoes do you sell
a year? A: A year? I have sold more than 10,000

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.135
pair of shoes a year. Q That s a lot of shoes.
Lots of shoes. {Lots of shoes} [laugh] Lots

00:04:13.135 --> 00:04:14.570
and lots of shoes PAGE PAGE Default Absatz-Standardschriftart
