Hi, I'm Kelli, on behalf of Expert Village.
I'm going to show you some tips and techniques

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.850
I use when I'm trotting and jogging my horse.
So, the next thing we're going to do is we're

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:22.429
going to stop and back from the jog. So let
me move here up into a jog. *cluck* *cluck*

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:29.949
*Easy* So, when we want to stop, there's two
different ways that you can do it, depending

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.160
on how your horse is trained. Now, if your
horse is trained to Squeeze Stop, you can

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.239
stick both of your spurs in and just stop
your forward movement, sit deep in your saddle

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.440
and they should stop. If your horse is not
trained to Squeeze Stop, there's a couple

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.590
of different things that you can do. Of course,
you want to sit deep in your saddle, whoa,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:07.460
and you want your horse to listen to the word
whoa as a voice command. Or, if you're jogging

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.280
around and you want your horse to stop, whoa,
you may have to pick up a little bit. Ideally,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.189
you want your horse to stop, using the least
amount of rein pressure as you can, especially

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.610
if you're showing. Such it shows a little
bit of a greater skill. Whoa, so you should,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.299
you don't want to have to pull or jerk too
hard on your reins. cluck, cluck, so, once

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.490
you have your horse stopped, there's a couple
of different ways that you can back. She's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.119
trained to back off of my spurs, so if I stick
my spurs in each side and gently roll them

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.890
up her belly, she's going to back right off
of them. Some horses, whoa, are trained to

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.900
just really easily back off of a light rein
pressure, so if I just apply a little bit

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.220
of calf pressure and gently pick up, she'll
back right off of that. Now if you're just

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.320
training your horse to back and your horse
isn't real skilled at it, you may find that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.950
you have to pull a whole lot harder to get
your horse to back but and you, it may end

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.690
up bing a little bit of a tug-of-war. They
may pull a little harder at you but, you know,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.390
as soon as you get them to do one step, give
them, stop, give them a pat, say "thank you",

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.430
you did what I wanted you to do and eventually,
they'll the get the idea of what you're asking

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:33.180
them to do. So again, you can stop and back
off of spurs, which is really a helpful technique,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.230
especially if your horse does Squeeze Stop,
by putting in the spurs, you can just roll

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.390
them and get your horse to back right up.
Or you can, if your horse doesn't Squeeze

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.780
Stop, you can gently pick up, say whoa and
then just pick up really lightly and get your

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.030
horse to back off the bit. So those are some
tips and techniques I use for stopping and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.090
backing my horse.
