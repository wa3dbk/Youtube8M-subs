00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.470
How to choose an air filter from AFE.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.630
We have three different types of filter medias
that we offer.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.009
We offer the Pro Dry S which is a dry media.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.689
We offer the AFE Pro 5R which is a five layered
oil filter, and we also offer the Pro Guard

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.050
7 which is a seven layer filter and it is
also oil.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.930
Choosing what is right for you.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.480
If you are looking for the ultimate in convenience,
we call our convenience filter our Pro Dry

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.510
S. The convenience filter from AFE, as I am
going to demonstrate for you is the fact that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.610
it is a very easy maintenance filter.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.469
For cleaning on the Pro Dry filter it is easy.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.250
If I want to tap it clean, I am going to take
a filter that is already dirty.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.969
And for cleaning, as you can see here as I
am tapping out particles of the filter.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.210
If I tap out this filter, I can get back to
an 86 percent restoration of the filter.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.719
You can kind of see where we tapped it how
it is lighting up again.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.760
If I want to get back to a 92 percent restoration,
what I am going to do is I can take a vacuum

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.760
cleaner.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.290
I can vacuum this filter out as well.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.730
If I want to get back to 100 percent restoration
I can use soap and water to clean the filter.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.380
And it will go back to 100 percent restoration.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380
It is a convenience filter.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.150
1:21
The second one, if you are looking for the

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.900
greatest amount of air flow and performance
you will use our five layered filter, which

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.760
is going to be our Pro 5R.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.220
This is actually an oil filter as I said.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.850
Cleaning on the oil filter from AFE is simple.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.270
What we do when it is time for cleaning, you
are going to use a solution which we call

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.930
a restore kit which is a cleaner and actually
an oil.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.850
The restorer is actually sprayed on there,
a solution, when it sets you will rinse it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.850
with water.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.811
When it comes the time to re oil, you are
basically going to take two strands of oil

00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:06.440
and ring it around the center of the filter
like this and set the filter.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.020
In a few hours, when you come back you will
see that that filter is completely covered

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.180
because the oil will seep and find its way.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.730
One thing I do like to mention is that you
do not have to over oil a filter.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:03:01.470
As you can see this oil filter almost looks
dry.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:41.069
