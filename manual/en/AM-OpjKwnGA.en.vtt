00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.380
there's Lauren hard at work designing and
building recumbent wooden bicycle step

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.000
one was idea generation then he sketches
in his engineers notebook in front of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.910
them then from there you went to
Autodesk Inventor and then modeled it

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.700
and all right this is my recumbent bike
so I started out with paper plans and

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:35.280
sketched the ideas and then I made the
parts in Autodesk Inventor which I then

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.019
assembled into this assembly here it's a
scale model of it and then I took the

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:53.999
parts for the CNC over to mastercam to
toolpath through the router and then

00:00:53.999 --> 00:01:01.710
I'll be able to run these parts on the
CNC router on the shop thought for the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:13.400
day Lauren it was a good day forward
progress hi Lauren test run, dont hit the fence

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.530
wood recumbent bike beautiful this is
Lauren and his wooden recumbent bicycle

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.070
tell us about it Lauren alright so I
started out by editing some plans I got

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:39.050
online and I made the wooden frame and I
incorporated metal bike parts

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.100
and then I did some an internship at a
bike shop to kind of learn more about

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.100
how the components worked and I got
components from

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.750
the guy in town and we got it all set up
that works pretty well my first first

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.580
run at it
how'd you get the wood out partly with

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.630
the bandsaw and partly with the CNC
router for the plywood gussets and then

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.630
I pressed the bearings for the crank
into the wood

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.780
upholstered the seat made custom
aluminum dropouts bent these tubes to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.740
hold the chain tight

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.200
what's that had to call it Cal Poly
engineering that's where we going yeah
