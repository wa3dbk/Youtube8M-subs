The group that does 3D
digitization for the Smithsonian

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:11.611 size:84% position:42% line:64%
actually met with educators

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.380 align:start position:0%
from all over the institution
and they were really

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.184 align:start position:0%
interested in what I would call
teachable objects 

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:22.822 align:start position:0%
objects that told compelling
stories, objects that could be
more accessible

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:26.759 align:start position:0%
if they were reduced or
increased in scale,

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.596 align:start position:0%
objects that could teach
lessons that the public really
wanted to learn.

In the museum where I work less
than one percent

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:47.513 align:start position:0% line:72%
of our collections items are on
display for people to come and
see

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:51.717 size:78% position:39%
in exhibits, but we have
another way of making the
collections accessible

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:55.354
and that's via the Internet.
And now we'll be able to share 

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:58.791 align:start position:0%
3D data that could be printed
somewhere else. 

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.194 align:start position:0% line:68%
The 3D printing aspect is a
major

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:03.629 line:64%
motivational tool for teens. 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.332 align:start position:0%
They're very interested in
being able to print 

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:09.435 align:start position:0%
real objects from a set of
data. 

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:13.406 align:start position:0%
Whether they are people who we
have read about who are now
deceased,

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:17.310 align:start position:0%
or if they are historical
figures who we have never met,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's something about being
able to come in contact with
something that they've

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.818 align:start position:0%
held, touched, used, that makes
us feel that we are

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.620 size:81% position:41%
a part of their existence.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.624 align:start position:0% line:68%
If students are using data sets
to create their own 

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.726 align:start position:0% line:68%
prints, they're obviously
taking on 

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.629 align:start position:0%
the science and technology end
of it.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.698 align:start position:0%
I think that there are a number
of ways

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.668 align:start position:0%
that it'll enhance classroom
learning. 

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.508 align:start position:0%
The 3D viewer I think is going
to be one

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.977 align:start position:0%
of those great things in the
classroom.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:55.548
One of the things that we work
hard to teach students about

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:59.185 align:start position:0%
history is that it's always
been told from multiple
perspectives

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:03.756
and so the "Tour" tool will
allow us to look at an object

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.325
in a bunch of different ways. 

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:09.595 align:start position:0%
On the 3D viewer there will be
what we're calling "hotspots"
and they're

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:13.666 align:start position:0%
pin points to different pieces
of the object. What it does

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.002 align:start position:0%
is it enables them to self
guide. 

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:19.539 align:start position:0%
What really excites me for the
future is that we'd like to
have 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:23.342 align:start position:0%
the tool be available as an
authoring tool for students and
teachers

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:28.047 align:start position:0%
so that students could be
creating their own tours,
making their own discoveries 

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:31.116 align:start position:0%
and pretty much work right
along side us at the Smithsonian

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:33.152 align:start position:0%
and do their own authentic
work. 

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:37.656 align:start position:0%
Teachers want access to the 3D
data because

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
they want to help their
students master the
mathematical and technological 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.531 align:start position:0%
skills necessary for working
with 3D because they know

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:49.301 align:start position:0%
that today's fifth graders in
ten years are going to go into
a world

00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:52.772 align:start position:0%
where 3D data is gonna be part
of their everyday life. 

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:56.609 align:start position:0%
As our classrooms move to
multidisciplinary 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.113 align:start position:0%
curriculum and lessons, this is
just

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:06.219 align:start position:0%
one more way that they can
bring all of the aspects of
teaching together. 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.589 align:start position:0%
Teachers are really yearning to
instruct in a more

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:14.727 align:start position:0%
integrated fashion and these
kinds of projects with 3D

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:18.331 size:75% position:38%
printing get students so
excited and motivated.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:22.201 align:start position:0%
I actually think it will
revolutionize the way in which
we teach.

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:31.410 align:start position:0%
We feel that this technology
allows everyone to be as 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.615
inventive as they want to be
and then they have the ability

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:39.852 align:start position:0%
to share what they have learned
with others in a very easy and
simple way.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:43.589 size:78% position:39%
I'm really excited to get
feedback and to stay in
communication with our

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
teacher and student community
to find out what exciting
creations

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.462 align:start position:0%
they're going to make with what
we have.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
We believe that solving the
great problems of the world is
in the hands of

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.037 align:start position:0%
every single person and that
the more they have access

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:01.407 align:start position:0%
to the tools, the better we all
will be

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:04.510
for their having learned how to
use them and how to share them.
