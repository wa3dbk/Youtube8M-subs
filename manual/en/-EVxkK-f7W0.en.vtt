00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.950
Much like the product, so have its critics
become predictable.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.950
Go ahead.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.740
Read almost any review of this particular
and yet remarkably un-particular game.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.181
They’re almost all dictated by the same
narrative—someone telling you this is a

00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:38.250
game that’s not captivating, but had them
utterly captivated.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.750
And you know, the interesting thing is that...they
kind of have a point.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.570
This is a game that brings nothing to the
table from a gameplay perspective, but sets

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.160
its crosshairs on the hope—or depending
on who you are, the reality—that you’ll

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.330
care enough about its story to overlook the
fact that you’re doing something you’ve

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.520
done a hundred times before.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.760
In fact, that’s the most interesting thing
about this game.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:18.299
That it’s a symptom of a much larger problem
in gaming.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.180
Released over the summer to HD consoles and
PC, Spec Ops: The Line is about the 347th

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.460
cover-and-fire shooter since Resident Evil
4 planted the seed and Gears of War fertilized

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.460
the sh*t out of it.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.730
And after you kill your 347th enemy for reasons
I’m told are emotionally impactful on 347

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.370
different levels, you’ll have a choice to
make.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.250
Are there 347 reasons to love Spec Ops?

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.780
Or did you prefer its 347 other incarnations?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.370
So if you’ve played any of the shooters
that have dominated the industry for nearly

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.530
a decade, you’ll be able to jump into Spec
Ops without missing a beat.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.830
Using the Marcus Phoenix model, you play as
an American solider sent to Dubai for what

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.970
he thought was a rescue mission.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.459
And then...cover, shoot, cover, shoot, morality,
M. Night Shyamalan, cover and shoot.

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.480
I’m not making this up.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.010
There’s some strategy here and there, but
it’s just for the sake of having it.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.740
The game looks technically impressive, but
its reliance on realism takes away some of

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.740
the power.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.300
There’s just nothing here that qualifies
as new or interesting.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.340
I wish there were.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.299
That’s why I play games—for the gameplay
experiences.

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.159
But maybe I’m different.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:51.860
And therein lies the problem...the issue for
which Spec Ops is merely a symptom.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.599
Some will say, “Well, games have changed.”

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.980
But what changed is what the hardcore expects
from them.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.700
That’s a problem because their expectations
aren’t necessarily in line with those of

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.700
average consumers.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.440
Unfortunately, we have an industry catering
to the prior—to the person so immersed in

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.409
the product, they don’t care that they’re
playing the same thing over and over.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.530
Not as long as it’s given some grandiose
new coat of paint.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.249
In the case of Spec Ops, it’s in the form
of a “gripping story”...slapped onto the

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.659
same vehicle we’ve been driving since 2005.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.439
Does that make it bad?

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.480
No, not necessarily.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.920
But it certainly doesn’t make it great.
