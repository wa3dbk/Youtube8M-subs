00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:06.646
&gt;&gt;We need more highly adaptive
solutions on how to help a variety

00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:09.156
of children reach these
high standards.

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:13.656
There can be no more top down
one size fits all approach

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:15.326
to school reform.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:18.376
My name is Barnett Berry and I'm the
founder and President of the Center

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:22.716
for Teaching Quality, a policy
research organization that's

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:27.136
dedicated to advancing a twenty first
century results oriented profession.

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:30.116
Waiting for Superman
is a powerful film

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:33.346
that elicits some very
important emotion in all of us

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:36.886
about the urgency for
change and to serve children

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:38.366
in high need communities.

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:44.446
But unfortunately the film is
based upon I believe the assumption

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:48.396
that most people in our public school
system now are not doing what needs

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:53.426
to be done because they don't
care or they're not motivated

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:59.566
or they're just incapable and that
I believe is way, way off the mark.

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:03.066
If we're not getting the job
done the way it needs to be done

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.326
and in many places we're
not getting the job done is

00:01:05.326 --> 00:01:07.326
because we don't have
a system in place

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:12.506
to support well meaning educators
who really want to make a difference.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:15.456
They need more preparation, they
need more opportunities to work

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:20.666
with each other and to share their
practices in a highly accountable way

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:24.386
and they need more time
to work with a whole array

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:28.046
of other support providers
for children,

00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:28.976
especially in our high
need communities.

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:41.156
&gt;&gt;In the year 2030 we
have a very hopeful vision

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:44.336
that we believe can be realized

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.846
and it's built upon
four emergent realities

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:50.626
and we call them emergent realities
because we're beginning to see bits

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:53.856
of them if you will,
beginning to emerge

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:57.796
and they are what we believe
must be in place if we're going

00:01:57.796 --> 00:02:00.386
to have this results
oriented profession

00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:05.276
and they include one a new
learning ecology for both students

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:11.256
and teachers that not only provides a
kind of twenty four slash seven just

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:15.436
in time learning environment for
both, but also allow teachers

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:21.846
in particular with new tools and
new software and new smart phones

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:25.466
that we haven't even imagined, a
way to account for who's learning,

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:30.286
who's not, why and also help
the public understand the kind

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:33.276
of ambitious goals that
we're trying to achieve.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:39.016
We also believe that as teachers work
more in cyber space there's going

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:44.426
to be a greater need for teachers to
work in brick and mortar buildings

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:48.026
that have become twenty four slash
seven kind of hubs of the community.

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:50.706
So we're calling for
emergent reality too

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:54.936
that to have teachers working
both in and out of cyber space.

00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:59.616
We also believe as our third emergent
reality that more teachers need

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:05.076
to work as a team and we
ought to strategically recruit

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:08.686
and place teachers according to
their strengths and the needs

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:09.866
of the children they serve.

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:14.896
But also build a profession
that makes it much more possible

00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:17.746
for teachers to kind of move in
and out of different positions,

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:20.326
in and out of different
school districts,

00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:23.906
in and out of different roles at
different points in their career.

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:28.696
A much more differentiated career
pathway built on the needs of kids

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:32.456
and then finally to drive it all
is our emergent reality number four

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:37.006
which is all about teacherpreneurs,
teacherpreneurs are those teachers

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:39.856
who are out best, best
classroom practitioners

00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:43.756
who teach regularly children,
never lose that touch

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:46.626
because they are working
with children

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.876
and serving them on a regular basis.

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:51.846
But they have time,
space, geography and reward

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:55.976
to spread their expertise again
in and out of cyber space.

00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:08.286
&gt;&gt;The first thing I would say is
find other like minded colleagues,

00:04:08.846 --> 00:04:13.136
it is not easy because I know you're
working very, very hard every day

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:16.826
to serve the needs of kids in your
community, but there are plenty

00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:19.346
of other teachers who really
want something different

00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:21.496
and they're beginning to kind

00:04:21.496 --> 00:04:24.516
of organize themselves both
formally and informally.

00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:27.936
Find those that actually
have the focus that you have,

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:32.766
the hopes that you have, the dreams
that you have and begin to learn

00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:34.706
from each other and to organize.

00:04:35.036 --> 00:04:38.136
I would also ask teachers
to go to their unions

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:41.636
and tell them it is time
to change dramatically.

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:46.156
We want you as you union leaders to
turn our organizations into much more

00:04:46.156 --> 00:04:49.726
like professional deals, where the
focus is on teaching and learning

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:53.576
and where the unions themselves
could actually help broker these

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:58.576
relationships in and out of cyber
space and to demand excellence

00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:00.976
but also support excellence
amongst all of us.
