00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.389
&gt;&gt;[EVIL LAUGHTER] AT LAST IT'S READY!

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.119
IGOR, COME QUICKLY!
IT'S FINISHED.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.059
&gt;&gt;WHAT, MASTER?
&gt;&gt;MY EVIL CREATION, WHICH WILL BRING UNTOLD

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.660
MISERY TO MANKIND.
I CALL IT JUNIOR HIGH.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.560
&gt;&gt;SHOW ME MASTER.
&gt;&gt;I STARTED BY CREATING AN EXTREMELY

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.599
AWKWARD STAGE OF LIFE.
I CALL IT A "TWEEN."

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.599
HE'S NO LONGER CUTE, BUT NOT YET USEFUL;
OLD ENOUGH TO LIKE GIRLS, BUT TOO YOUNG TO

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.260
KNOW THAT AXE
BODY SPRAY WON'T ATTRACT THEM.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.590
AND HE'S OUT GROWN HIS PARENTS, BUT CANNOT
YET DRIVE SO

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.359
HE HAS TO BE DROPPED OFF AT PARTIES BY MOM;
THE CHAUFFER OF SHAME.

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.260
&gt;&gt;OH, THAT DOES SOUND DREADFUL.
&gt;&gt;AH, BUT THE PARENTS DON'T STOP THERE.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.449
OH NO!
THEY ALSO MAKE THE CHILDREN WEAR THIS INVENTION.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.199
I CALL THEM BRACES.
THEY'LL MAKE HER LOOK BETTER BY THE TIME

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.780
SHE'S
GROWN UP AND SECURE.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.330
BY MAKING HER LOOK WORSE AT THE MOST
VULNERABLE TIME IN HER LIFE.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.290
[LAUGHTER] BUT DON'T WORRY.
THEY'RE EXTREMELY PAINFUL.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.650
&gt;&gt;YES, THAT IS QUITE EVIL.
&gt;&gt;THANK YOU.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.350
&gt;&gt;SO WHERE DOES JUNIOR HIGH COME IN?
&gt;&gt;AH, THAT'S WHERE THINGS REALLY GET FUN,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.050
IGOR.
FOR EXAMPLE, I'M MAKING THIS ONE STUDY

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.750
GEOMETRY AND ALGEBRA.
AT FIRST HE HATED IT, BUT THEN AFTER LOTS

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.460
OF HARD WORK AND PERSEVERANCE
HE STILL REALLY HATED IT.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.160
&gt;&gt;WELL WILL HE AT LEAST USE THEM IN HIS FUTURE

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.680
CAREER?
&gt;&gt;YES, IF HE EVER TEACHES GEOMETRY OR ALGEBRA.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.710
&gt;&gt;YOU MEAN THEY EXIST ONLY FOR THEMSELVES?
&gt;&gt;MHM.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.390
THEY'RE THE KARDASHIANS OF THE MATH WORLD.
[LAUGHTER] &gt;&gt;YOU ARE SADISTIC MASTER!

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.490
&gt;&gt;AH, BUT I DON'T STOP THERE!
I'VE EVEN MODIFIED THEIR BIOLOGY.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.480
I'VE TIMED THE GROWTH SPURTS SO
THAT BOYS LIKE THIS ARE

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.510
SUDDENLY SHORTER THAN ALL THE
GIRLS IN THEIR GRADE!

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.020
TRUE, HIS VOICE IS GETTING DEEPER,
BUT AT HUMILIATING MOMENTS.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.700
IT WILL BETRAY HIM WITH A SQUEAK
THAT WOULD EMBARRASS

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.830
THE VIENNA BOY'S CHOIR.
&gt;&gt;[SQUEAK] &gt;&gt;[LAUGHTER]

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.100
OH AND THEN THERE'S THE-- &gt;&gt;BUT--
&gt;&gt;--FACIAL HAIR.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.010
IT'S STARTS OUT FAINT AND WISPY--
&gt;&gt;MHM.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.600
YEAH?
&gt;&gt;AND THERE IT REMAINS, LIKE SOMEONE TOOK

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.280
SCISSORS TO A TOOTHBRUSH.
&gt;&gt;WELL WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.510
&gt;&gt;I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE GIRLS.
&gt;&gt;OH!

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.880
SO CRUEL MASTER.
&gt;&gt;OH AND HERE'S MY FINEST CREATION; ACNE.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.670
&gt;&gt;OH!
WILL IT GO AWAY?

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.590
&gt;&gt;THAT'S WHAT HIS PARENTS TELL HIM,
BUT REALLY NEVER.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.780
&gt;&gt;OH.
&gt;&gt;ONE DAY HE'LL WAKE UP AND START HIS MORNING

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.780
WITH BOTH ACNE
TREATMENT AND DENTURE INSERTION.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.830
[LAUGHTER] IT'S LIKE IMMORTAL
PUBESCENT FACE LEPROSY!

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.010
&gt;&gt;OH!
YOU ARE WAY TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.680
&gt;&gt;[LAUGHTER] JUNIOR HIGH, HOW I LOVE IT.
ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING CAN MAKE THEM MISERABLE.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.840
THIS ONE JUST REALIZED SHE'LL
NEVER GET THAT

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.240
LETTER FROM HOGWARTS.
&gt;&gt;OH!

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.420
&gt;&gt;NOT A GOOD DAY FOR LITTLE HORMONE-Y MYRTLE.
[LAUGHTER] &gt;&gt;OH PLEASE!

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.500
PLEASE, LET THE MADNESS STOP!
&gt;&gt;AH, BUT I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THE BEST PART

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.500
IGOR.
I TAKE ALL OF THESE TORTURED SOULS AND QUARANTINE

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.380
THEM IN THEIR OWN SCHOOL!
LIKE A TANK FULL OF AWKWARD BETA FISH.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.180
[LAUGHTER] &gt;&gt;OH!
&gt;&gt;I'VE MADE IT SO CLIQUEY THAT SECRETLY,

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.069
NO ONE IS POPULAR!
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.959
&gt;&gt;NO!
YOUR IDEAS WILL NEVER CATCH ON!

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.640
&gt;&gt;WON'T THEY IGOR?
I'VE ALREADY PRODUCED MY OWN HORROR FILM.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.300
I CALL IT, "JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL."
FULL OF TERRORS BEYOND DESCRIPTION;

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.580
DETENTIONS, BAGGY GYM SHORTS,
THREE-RINGED BINDERS WHOSE RINGS WON'T LINE UP!

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.900
&gt;&gt;[CRIES]
&gt;&gt;[LAUGHTER]

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.500
&gt;&gt;ENOUGH!
OKAY!

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.700
RUN AWAY!
RUN AWAY!

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.700
&gt;&gt;NO!
NO, IGOR.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.700
YOU FOOL!
&gt;&gt;GO!

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.700
&gt;&gt;NO!
&gt;&gt;YOU TWEENS!

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.989
&gt;&gt;YOU'VE UNLEASHED A FAR
GREATER EVIL ON THE WORLD.

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.989
&gt;&gt;WHAT?
&gt;&gt;THAT WAS ONE DIRECTION.
