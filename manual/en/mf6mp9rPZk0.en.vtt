Hi I'm Liz Hood on behalf of Expert Village
and I'm going to be talking with you about

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.599
taking your baby out on a hike. Now sooner
or later when you go out in the wilderness

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:18.320
your going to have to change a diaper that
just kind of comes with the territory. One

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:26.681
thing you definitely have to have is a changing
pad this one actually came with the diaper

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:35.170
bag that I have. It's a little bit small so
if you want to bring a blanket as well to

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.399
supplement that's good as well, it's kind
of a little padded so that it makes this rocky

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:48.730
surface just a little bit more comfortable
than usual. Another thing that you absolute

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:58.989
must have is large ziplock bags so that you
can dispose of these dirty diapers, "are you

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:08.560
helping me", and one thing you definitely
need to keep in mind is that you need to stay

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.250
on top of keeping them in fresh diapers the
entire time. Like for instance the type of

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.439
carrier that I use kind of squishes the diaper
right against them so if there's wetness in

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:29.170
there or it's pushed right against the skin
and there's a lot more chance of diaper rash

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.430
or just irritation. So you really need to
change the diapers as much as possible one

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:45.890
thing that helps a lot is using Vaseline I
like to do that anyway, just to get the areas

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.729
that are a little bit red cause riding around
in this all day is going to make problems

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.320
for the areas that are just a little bit irritated.
But other than that we just changed his diaper

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.060
and we're going to keep on hiking, so we're
doing good.
