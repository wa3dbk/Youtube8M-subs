00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:40.733
The dull wind blows through the soft wheat fields

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:48.206
Her hair slightly tickles the tips of my nose

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:55.927
The summer sun at dawn shines through the car window

00:00:55.927 --> 00:01:01.732
She is looking at it, its so bright

00:01:01.732 --> 00:01:06.302
Shall we go to the sea to catch fish?

00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:09.719
I pick oysters and put the pearls around her neck

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.537
And with mango and papaya scented lips

00:01:13.537 --> 00:01:17.405
Please kiss me,
my sweety......

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:21.064
The sun setting beach,
underneath the sunlight,

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:24.152
Me and her, us together on our honeymoon

00:01:24.152 --> 00:01:28.447
Under my feet are white waves crashing

00:01:28.447 --> 00:01:32.220
Lets make summer memories

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.688
Dont ask about past events or past girls

00:01:38.688 --> 00:01:42.541
Lets live happily!

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:53.667
I've waited more than anyone else
for today to come

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:58.114
Please accept my heart!

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.871
If you want to be luxurious

00:02:10.871 --> 00:02:21.980
We can build a hut made from banana leaves

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.975
Writing the same address,

00:02:25.975 --> 00:02:29.594
becoming more like each other,

00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:35.294
They are things that I've waited for so long in my dreams

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:39.829
At the beautiful beach with the glass-like ocean

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.787
There are scents of coconut body lotion
and womans perfumes

00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:47.268
The silver light sand,
the whales summer dance

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:51.044
The red evening sunset,
party time

00:02:51.044 --> 00:02:54.744
The sun setting beach,
underneath the sunlight,

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:57.746
Me and her, us together on our honeymoon

00:02:57.746 --> 00:03:01.961
Under my feet are white waves crashing

00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.952
Lets make summer memories

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:12.221
Dont ask about past events or past girls

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:16.090
Lets live happily!

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:25.780
I've waited more than anyone else for today to come

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.339
Please accept my heart!
