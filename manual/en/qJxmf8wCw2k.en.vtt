00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.040
Hey there, this is your Pal Pallie and welcome
back to Git Er Raid.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.610
Ever want to feel like a rat in a big machine
screwing it all up and pissing an engineer

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.610
off?

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.080
Then Siegecrafter Blackfuse is the fight for
you!

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.720
So this one is a 2 tank and 2 to 3 heal encounter.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.670
If you watched the PTR guide of this fight,
there are a few changes or mechanics that

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.519
I didn't recognize from PTR so listen up for
those but mainly the fight is similar in execution.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.070
Its kind of complex and is sort of akin to
Yorshaj from Dragonsoul.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.010
So why is this fight like Yorshaj?

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.109
Well you can pick how the fight is going to
go and what mechanics you want to deal with

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.290
every half minute or so.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.449
This assembly line over here will bring out
3 different weapons that you can kill off.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.940
But once you kill one out of the set of 3,
all of them rest become immune to damage.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.119
Once the remaining weapons reach this machine
here, they pop out on the other side of the

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.639
machine and become active until the next set
comes out.

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.850
So of course, you need to send some people
onto the assembly line and kill off at least

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.350
one weapon.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.030
How you get there is by hopping into this
pipe SuperMario style.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.560
The conveyor belt here goes faster than your
run speed unless you have a boost in speed.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.619
What you need to do here is kill off one of
the weapons and then avoid getting hit by

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.140
these beams.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.690
They used to be instant death on PTR but now
on live they are mostly instant death.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.020
Seriously, no chance to survive at all.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.920
If you can reach the end here, there are a
couple of pipes you can go into to return

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.090
to the platform.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.659
I will note, there is no damage happening
to you here, so you'll notice I use aspect

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.830
of the cheetah.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.850
On 10 man normal, I was able to solo a weapon
but not all classes may be able to do it.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.039
Its about a good burst of single target dps
so you'll see I use my beastial wrath and

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.039
any other CDs I have up to get the weapon
down in time.

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.450
We would send me solo and then 2 dps when
I wasn't going in.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.289
You can't keep sending the same person over
and over.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.730
You get a debuff that only allows you to go
every minute so that means you can go every

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.830
other set of weapons.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.870
So at least a few people in your raid will
need to be well-versed in this run.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.750
So remember you kill 1 weapon out of 3 and
the other 2 come out.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.530
That means you have to deal with 2 of the
weapons being out.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.760
So lets just go through all four of the weapon
types and you can decide for yourself which

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.959
one of these you don't want to deal with.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.370
The shockwave missile will have you remembering
Ragnaros from firelands.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.830
It basically does this kind of wave like ground
aoe that you just need to avoid.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.730
Just stand near the active zone and then get
ready to move in when it disappears, just

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.760
like on Rag.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.030
Laser Turrets are pretty simple, they will
focus on a person and persue them for 10 seconds.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.260
Any place the laser hits will be superheated
and hurt you if you stand in it obviously.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.360
The Electromagnet does a bunch of just pulsing
aoe damage and pulls sawblades from the boss

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.900
to them.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.370
And lastly the crawler mines will fixate on
a raid member and if they reach anyone, they

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.640
will explode for aoe damage to the raid and
knocks everyone into the air.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.400
They are slowable, stunnable and rootable
for 1 minute and then after that they will

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.549
gain speed and pursue raid members to the
death.

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.160
It seems most groups didn't like dealing with
the missiles on top of everything else so

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.510
they disabled them and dealt with the other
mechanics.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.310
Just find out what works best for your team.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.910
We also chose to disable missiles whenever
they came out and if they weren't there, we

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.409
disabled a laser although it was rare to not
see a missile turret coming out.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.590
Thats not all thats going on with this fight.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.150
There is a whole other fight happening on
the main platform with the boss and his shredders.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.780
So first off, the boss will launch a sawblade
at raid members every now and then.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.439
They'll be cleared by the electromagnet and
you just need to avoid them as they hurt pretty

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.439
bad.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.180
As well, you need to make sure none of the
adds in this fight like the shredders or mines

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.060
get near the boss or he'll repair them very
quickly.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.850
The tanks have an important job to do as well.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.000
The boss will hit the tank with Electrostatic
Charge which does some nature damage and each

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.990
stack increases subsequent damage taken from
the charges.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.440
But more importantly they let you do a ton
of damage to the shredders specifically.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.170
The Shredders that come out must be tanked
of course but they have a buff on them that

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.630
makes them take 90% less damage.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.640
So, the tanks need to get a few stacks of
the electrostatic charge and then beat on

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.620
these shredders.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.120
In addition, you can also have the shredders
be damaged by sawblades and the superheated

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.060
ground from the lasers.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.250
So go ahead and drag them into anything you
can, but always make sure they are away from

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.280
the boss or else they will get healed.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.530
The tanks I was running with seemed to say
2 to 3 stacks would help kill the shredders

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.330
off in time for the next one to come out and
tank swap.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.060
The shredders do a few things themselves such
as casting Overload and Death from Above.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.380
Overload is just a big aoe that hurts the
whole raid and increases their damage done.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.100
Death from above is where they jump in the
air and slam down into the ground.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.380
Just don't stand underneath them and you are
fine.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.710
After they do this last move, they'll be stunned
and take additional damage on the order of

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.380
300%

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.190
So yeah, there is a metric crapton of stuff
going on in this fight and lots to learn.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.810
Tanks have to work out killing off shredders
and not standing in crap while tanking the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.250
boss.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.910
The dps need to get good at running the assembly
line and avoiding all the other mechanics.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.060
In particular, the crawler mines need to be
slowed and beat down so that you can explode

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.750
them when the healers are ready for them.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.990
And of course, healers need to be healing
their asses off for quite awhile.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.960
I've mainly touched on all of the strategy
points in the fight.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.690
We popped lust on the pull to allow for a
good burn before the fight got messy and then

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.130
from there just rotated people into the Assembly
Line to kill the right weapons.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.660
When you are on the platform, mines are high
priority and then killing the boss.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.930
Tanks will need to beat their shredder down
and drag it into stuff to get that done but

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.180
that never did seem to be an issue for our
raid group on this kill.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.330
Don't get hit with lasers and if you bring
missiles out, do the Ragnaros dance and don't

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.910
get killed.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.190
One last note and this is something I didn't
notice during PTR but was hit with on live

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.130
due to the other assembly line team dying.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.840
If you don't kill any weapons at all, the
boss will gain a shield that reduces his damage

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.500
taken by 90% for about 15 seconds.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.190
So even if you can handle all the mechanics
of the weapons and don't care to kill any

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.870
off, you still need to get on the assembly
line and kill something or else you'll be

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.380
prevented from doing dps for quite awhile.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:16.130
So lots and lots of stuff going on here, just
try to focus on your job in this fight and

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.970
it'll go down.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:24.630
Tanks handle shredders, dps run the gauntlet
and everyone avoid all the crap everywhere!
