The Somes Island project had to be one of
the most incredible experiences that I ever had,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.070
and showed me the real life applications
of university study.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.389
In a tourism lecture we were asked to identify
a research problem that affected the Wellington

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.580
tourism industry. We decided to do a project
on the harbour islands. We visited Somes,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.590
or Matiu, Island and learnt about its history
and my report was one of three that was presented

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.230
to the Kaitiaki Board.
I fell in love with that project because I

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.830
knew that what we were doing was actually
being used in real life. It wasn't just

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.970
another equation on a piece of paper, it wasn't
just another random essay. This was talking

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.300
about something in my community. It changed
it from being a project to actually being

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:58.090
something I was really passionate about.
Victoria University definitely helped me challenge

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.449
the idea that everything's black and white.
I was sort of raised with it's either a

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:13.289
yes or a no, it's either this way or it's
that way way of thinking. And being in Wellington

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.229
in a place that's so culturally diverse
and so important in terms of tourism has really

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.920
helped me understand what I'm learning in
class.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.780
Coming to Victoria there are just so many
cultures and so many people from all walks

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.890
of life. There are so many things that you
never thought of. There are so many perspectives

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.229
that you never knew existed. There are so
many different viewpoints that would never

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.780
have crossed your mind, but hearing someone
else say "ok this is the way that I think"

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.600
just reminds you that there isn't that one
way of thinking. And learning that at Victoria

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.130
has been so invaluable for a business career
in the future, because the world is becoming

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.939
such a small place.
I've changed because I've realised that

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.060
I can be so much more than what I initially
thought and Victoria has given me the tools

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.520
to do that.
My name is Acushla-Tara Sutton and I'm studying

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.030
commerce at Victoria University of Wellington.
