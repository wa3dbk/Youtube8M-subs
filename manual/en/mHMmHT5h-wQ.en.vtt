Payton manning lost the football! And the jets will score!

00:01:07.052 --> 00:01:09.052
And that will end the quest for perfection

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.979
The first thing i will be talking about 
 is the equipment you need to play..

00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:18.878
This includes the mouthgard..

00:01:19.856 --> 00:01:21.856
The shoulder pad..

00:01:19.856 --> 00:01:21.856
The shoulder pad..

00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:27.603

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:31.078

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:31.078
The helmet..

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.820
And your team jersey

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:36.537
The players on the field include

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.549
The offensive line

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.299
The Defensive line

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.230
The line backers

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:43.960
the quarter back

00:01:44.098 --> 00:01:46.100
the running backs

00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:47.370
the wide recievers

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.460
the cornerbacks

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:52.450
and the safetys

00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:55.140
The field is 100 yards long

00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:56.310
with 2 end zones

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:57.330
at the end of each side

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:59.630
you must reach those endzones to score

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.540
you score by either passing the ball

00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:16.900
by running with the ball

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:31.880
by kicking the ball through the uprights

00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:33.850
which is called a field goal

00:02:37.798 --> 00:02:41.800
or by tackling a ball carrier behind their 
 end zone which is called a sack

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:46.940
for example:

00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:48.920
to advance the ball you have four downs

00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:48.920
to advance the ball you have four downs

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.630
here is the ball

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:53.150
this line is called the scrimmage line

00:02:55.151 --> 00:02:57.150
and this line is called the first down marker

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.860
there are 10 yards between these markers

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.700
1st down and 10 yards to go

00:03:06.984 --> 00:03:08.980
lets say you get 18 yards

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.020
beyond the 1st down marker

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.610
this is what is called a first down

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.980
you move the markers to where the ball stopped

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:20.640
let's say you did not get those yards on you 4 tries

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:28.760
you may kick the ball to the other team so 
 they can be father away from your endzone

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:35.860
thats it..
