Hi! I’m Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village, and today we’re going

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.230
to talk about training dogs. So let’s teach
a Labrador retriever how to sit. This yellow

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.130
Lab knows I have treats. So I might or might
not use food as a lure with this particular

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.509
dog, I do have to use a relatively low-value
treat; of course keep in mind that Labrador

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.810
retrievers are walking stomachs. So you can
pretty much train them with anything. I trained

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.480
my Labs with little ends of asparagus and
the ends of carrots. Good girl, good girl.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.440
I’m going to let her know I have the food,
lead her nose up into the air, sit, good…

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.949
and as soon as her bottom hits the ground
I say the word, and then as soon as her bottom

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.449
hits the ground I mark it, and then I make
the treats random. Now I’m also going to

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:56.300
try serendipity here. I’m waiting to see
if she’ll offer to sit; well she would not

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.170
she needs a little more help, Telula good
and I’m going to use a little body language,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.850
that’s not working I’ll go to a hand signal,
sit, good, good girl. There are many different

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.970
ways you can teach dogs how to do things.
If a method isn’t working for you in this

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.060
video then check out a different breed. You
might get some tips there. Now she is really

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.690
not paying attention to me, so this is a great
opportunity for me to use food as a lure to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.190
get her to pay attention. Remember we want
to set our dogs up to succeed by not giving

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:36.159
them commands when we don’t think they’re
going to pay attention. Lula, good, sit. She

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:45.409
needs a little help, good, okay, sit, good.
She’s responding very well to the hand signal,

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.170
so let’s stick with that for a while, remember
we want to fade it later and get her to respond

00:01:49.170 --> 00:02:00.250
to verbal commands. Sit, good, very nice.
I’ll do this one more time, sit, good and

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.280
not give her the treat, oh, oh sometimes Labs
don’t swallow their treats, good girl, Sit,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.890
good, so we’ve ended with the success teaching
a Labrador retriever how to sit.
