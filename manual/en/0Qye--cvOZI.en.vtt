00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.200
 

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:08.633
"BPA-free"or Got BPA? Here you can see 
Waring® Commercial stainless steel container 
on the Vitamix base.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:16.799
When I found out that the Vitamix® container 
may NOT in fact be as claimed "BPA-Free"

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.733
I thought I was stuck with my "BPA-Free" 
blender... The Vitamix plastic containers is 
claimed to be Bpa-free. The claim of "BPA Free" 

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.833
The Vitamix plastic containers is claimed to be 
Bpa-free. 

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:32.466
The claim of "BPA Free" is
according to the manufacturer and NOT 
according to several 

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:38.266
INDEPENDENT scientists (not paid or 
influenced by the manufacturer).

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.532
There are now several studies (US and 
European)

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:50.466
that show that "BPA-Free" Tritan plastic leaches 
BPA and other toxic chemicals.

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:58.699
Many people might think that a plastic container 
is not a big deal, since blending just takes a few 
seconds, 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.366
and that would be true, if you did not turn you 
blender on, and start blending at high speeds, 

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:13.999
which smashes soft and hard foods against the 
plastic, at up to 300mph!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.933
So your food is not just touching the plastic sides it is rubbing/scraping the plastic into your food at VERY high speeds.

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:33.199
Here are some photos of my claimed to be "BPA Free" container. Before I took these photos of my plastic Vitamix container 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.366
I soaked it in vinegar (which is a strong acid) to 
make sure there was no food particles. 

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:51.266
As you can clearly see the area near the blade is VERY scratched from the food I blended. 

00:01:51.266 --> 00:02:01.832
According to scientists the cloudy looking, scratched, cracked plastic releases more chemicals than the new plastic. 

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:12.233
Migration of chemicals from plastic also 
increases when the plastic touches: hot, fatty or 
acidic foods. 

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:22.066
The blending is soooo fast that it creates heat 
from the friction. 
Here is a direct quote from the Vitamix website:

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:35.766
"The Vitamix® blades reach speeds fast enough 
to create friction heat that can bring ingredients 
to steaming hot in four to six minutes."

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:41.266
After much research, I found out that there is a 
VERY EASY way to replace  

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:49.199
or some might say 'upgrade' the Vitamix 
container with one of the Waring stainless steel 
container!

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:59.533
Waring has many stainless steel containers, but only one container fits the Vitamix base! 
Click this link to buy the container.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:09.599
The Waring® Commercial stainless steel container fits AND works perfectly on modern Vitamix blender bases.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.133
Both Vitamix® and Waring® do not make any 
recommendations to use their products together.

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:28.399
Be aware that if you inform Vitamix® or 
Waring® that you use their products together 
they might void your product Warranty.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:39.466
What to do with your plastic Vitamix container? 
1) Sell on eBay - Include a full disclosure as to 
why you are selling. 

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:44.299
You will be surprized that some people still want 
to buy it.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:55.566
2) Repurpose - Use as a flower pot, water your 
plants since it has a nice handle and pour 
spout, and any other non-food use.

00:03:55.566 --> 00:04:06.999
3) Recycle - Only an option if your recycle 
company accepts #7 plastic. Most curb recycle 
in the U.S. do not accept #7.  

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.133
PLEASE do NOT throw 'away'!  

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:18.166
Most conventional plastics do not biodegrade 
and they take about 500 - 1,000 years to break 
down. 

00:04:18.166 --> 00:04:27.632
The plastic breaks down into smaller and 
smaller particles that end up contaminating our 
soil and water.

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:35.333
For those of you who depend on using the 
tamper with your plastic container Vitamix 
model 5200,

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:46.666
the tamper is too long because of the lower 
height of the Waring Stainless steel container 
lid, so it will not work during blending.

00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:55.832
 I do not recomend using any plastic tamper, 
since it also gets scratched during blending.

00:04:55.833 --> 00:05:00.333
My husband made me a tamper simply from a   
tree branch.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:08.833
I will be doing more research to come up with a 
solution that will work with the Waring Stainless 
steel blender container. 

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.599
Stay tuned...

professional stainless steel container.

Also, I have added many links in the description 
area below this video.

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:29.366
Let's watch what scientist think and say about BPA and Phalates. 

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:37.932
Bisphenol A is the building block molecule.
That plastic, that is hard and clear.

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:47.766
Bisphenol A may be one of the most potent toxic chemicals known to man.

00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:58.866
BPA is found in many products including sports 
bottles, baby bottles and water coolers.

00:05:58.866 --> 00:06:04.432
The problem is Bisphenol A acts in very low 
doses as an estrogen.

00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:11.399
The recent controversy over BPA started when members of the scientific community questioned the methodology of earlier studies.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.200
All regulatory agencies around the world are based on the concept from the 16th century.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.400
That is the dose makes the poison. More is worse.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.900
That is not true for any hormone.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:34.433
We tested a dose twenty five thousand (25,000) times lower, then what anybody had ever tested.

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:37.899
And we found that it profoundly damaged

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:44.800
every single part of the male developing mouse 
reproductive system.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.433
There is virtually no major human health trend

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:54.666
over the past 30 years that hasn't increased such as childhood diabetes,

00:06:54.666 --> 00:06:57.866
that is not related to exposure to this chemical. 

00:06:57.866 --> 00:07:06.266
We find it relating to obesity, breast cancer, to 
prostate cancer, diabetes,

00:07:06.266 --> 00:07:10.599
brain disorders such as attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.700
liver disease, ovarian disease,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.700
diseases of the uterus, low sperm count in
men...
