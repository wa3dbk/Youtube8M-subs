00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.120
For Tony Lightfoot, just trying to enjoy a muffin

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.210
and coffee is a major challenge. He's had essential tremor disorder

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.300
for more than ten years. Quality of life has

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
really taken a nosedive.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.360
And eating, my wife often has to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.390
feed me with a spoon,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.460
especially the last bit on the plate. But that could all change

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.470
today, as Tony is the fifth patient at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.510
to undergo a groundbreaking new procedure. Doctors

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.530
will be operating deep inside his brain without making any incisions.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.570
Dr. Michael Schwartz is leading the study on this new scalpel-free

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.600
surgery for patient with essential tremor, which is the most common movement disorder.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.640
The procedure that we do is MR-guided focused 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.690
ultrasound, and we direct the focus

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.750
to the target that we would like to ablate. That means making

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.800
a small hole in the brain to damage the brain in fact in one area

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.850
to interupt a circuit that's bad for the patient and in this case

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.890
is causing tremor. Before the treatment begins, doctors do a final tremor

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.930
assessment, where Tony can't even hold a glass of water.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.980
He is also asked to copy the swirl on the left. This image shows his attempts on the right.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.050
After his head is shaved, Tony is fitted with

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.100
a frame, which is then placed inside a special helmet-like device. 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.190
It was manufactured by Insightec, based on research of scientists 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.250
at Sunnybrook and in Boston, and helps guide the surgical team with the help of MRI images.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.290
Tony stays awake so surgeons can test his

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.340
progress between each ablation, or zap to the brain. You can

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.400
visibly see how over the course of the procedure, his hand becomes

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.450
progressively more stable. Doctors are only able to treat

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.490
one side and focus ont he dominant hand to help improve

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.530
each patient's quality of life. So far, Dr. Schwartz says, every patient

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.550
has shown improvement. We are very impressed with the efficacy

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.570
of the procedure. So far it's been perfectly safe and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.590
we look forward to using it for other applications as well. 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.630
That may include cancers and tumours of the breast, bone,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.660
head, neck and rectum, as well as facial pain. In addition to no

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.670
incisions and no general anesthetic, patients go home within 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.730
one day, and return to activities of daily living almost immediately.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.810
Frank Winnacott had the procedure in the fall and says, it's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.850
made a world of difference. Being able to feel comfortable

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.900
in company. I play bridge. I like to hold my cards

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.960
I like to deal them properly. It's nice. 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.010
After several hours, Tony is brought out for his

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.110
post-procedure assessment, where the effect is crystal clear. 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.200
When is the last time you did that?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.220
More than ten years ago. 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.230
I'm happy, he's happy. It was a good thing today.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.260
Studies on the MR-guided focused ultrasound

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.290
will be ongoing, but so far, this trial suggests that surgery

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.330
without scalpels is a cut above. With Sunnyview, I'm Monica Matys.
