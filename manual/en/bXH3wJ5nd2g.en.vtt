00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.680
This is a story about a girl named Annemarie
Johansen, a Danish girl living in Copenhagen

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.049
as German forces occupy the country.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.650
She lives in a small apartment with her mother,
father, and sister, Kirsti.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.900
Lise, the eldest girl, died in a car accident.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.319
With German soldiers on every street corner,
Annemarie, her sister, and her best friend,

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:22.569
Ellen, quickly adapt to the intimidation tactics
of the soldiers.

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.390
Annemarie's parents hear that the Germans
are planning to relocate the Danish Jews and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.729
so they help Ellen's parents, the Rosen's,
escape and take in Ellen as their daughter.

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.500
The German soldiers soon arrive and ask the
Johansen's if they know where the Rosen's

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.500
went.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.510
The soldiers also question why one of the
daughters has dark hair, but fortunately,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.899
Ellen pretends to be Lise, Annemarie's older
sister who passed away.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.789
Suspecting that it is too dangerous to be
around, Annemarie's mother takes the girls

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.449
to visit her brother, Henrik, a fisherman
who lives out in the country near the shore

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:54.750
that overlooks Sweden.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.609
When Annemarie's mother and the girls arrive
at Henrik's house, they all enjoy the country

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.170
life and fresh air.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.899
Annemarie's mother tells the girls that a
coffin will be arriving with her great aunt,

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.360
but Annemarie suspects it's a lie.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.079
With the coffin in the living room, people
begin to arrive at Henrik's home.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.329
Even Ellen's parents arrive and reunite with
their daughter.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.150
However, German soldiers arrive at the house
and suspect something is going on.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.990
The soldiers want to open the coffin, but
Annemarie's mother quickly tells them that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.040
the dead body is carrying a contagious disease.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.619
After the soldiers leave, the coffin is opened
and is found to contain supplies, like blankets

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.759
and clothing, as all of the people in attendance
are Jews trying to escape to Sweden.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.329
A secret package is given to Mr. Rosen and
the Rosen's are led away to Henrik's boat

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.259
by Peter, the fiancee of Lise before her death.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.439
Annemarie's mother then takes the second group
of Jews through the dark woods to the harbor.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.939
Annemarie is left alone at the house, wondering
if her mother is safe.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.600
Annemarie awakes the next day to find that
her mother has not yet returned.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.320
She looks outside and sees her mother on the
ground.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.299
Her mother has a sprained ankle and calls
for a doctor.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.140
However, they discover that the secret package
that was given to Mr. Rosen is on the ground.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.410
Quickly, Annemarie hides the package in a
basket of food to bring to Henrik.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.940
On her way to the harbor, Annemarie runs into
a squad of German soldiers.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.911
They take her food and find the package.

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.590
They open it and see that it is only a handkerchief.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.220
Eventually, Annemarie makes it to Henrik's
boat with the handkerchief.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.760
After safely transporting the group of Jews
to Sweden, Henrik returns and explains that

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.190
the handkerchief has a secret chemical that
prevents the German patrol dogs from detecting

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.600
people on the boats.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.120
In the end, Annemarie and her family survive
the war and await for the return of the Rosen's.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.340
First, this story is historical fiction, borrowing
from real-life events to create the setting

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.820
for this story.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.230
The political surrender of Denmark to the
Germans, King Christian, and even the chemical

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.210
handkerchiefs all add to the realism and power
that these events really occurred.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.190
More importantly, this better strengthens
the story and connects fictional characters

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.280
to real life.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.930
This story also talks about bravery and what
constitutes a brave person.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.290
Annemarie fears that she will never be brave
and that her talk of bravery is empty.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.980
However, when she delivers the package containing
the chemical handkerchief, she discovers that

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.830
bravery is doing what needs to be done, even
though danger is present.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.940
That a brave person doesn't erase fear, but
overcomes it.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.090
One of the major messages in this story is
about growing up.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.740
This sensitive issue is best illustrated through
Annemarie and Kirsti.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.280
Not only is Annemarie older, but she is also
slowly told things that develop her maturity.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.330
Through her character, readers see how a child
grows up as the reality of the world sets

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.330
in.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.940
In contrast, Kirsti, who is still young and
immature, is kept in the dark, keeping her

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.970
child-like innocence of world events.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.610
Kirsti, in a sense, is the control.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.150
So what is the balance of revealing too much
or too little to kids?

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.230
How much do we tell children?

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.110
What do we tell them and when?

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.830
The issue of informing children how the world
really works, practically taking away their

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.200
innocence, is a difficult subject to discuss.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.670
On the one hand, part of being a child is
maintaining that innocence and ignorance on

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.440
so many subjects, yet, often in moments of
conflict, children "grow up" fast and figure

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.030
out firsthand how dangerous and challenging
life can really be.
