00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.280
We’re installing here a new set of rooms called

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.720
Making Traces

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.240
The wing of galleries that we’re occupying now

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.460
have previously been exhibition galleries

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.960
so this has allowed us to install a whole new set of galleries all at once

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.980
To enter into an open space of eight or nine galleries

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.300
yes, that’s a tremendously exciting moment

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.640
The wing is meant to give a sense of the variety of practises in which...

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.880
artists physically and metaphorically make traces

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.240
The whole process is a collaborative one

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.840
The displays team includes colleagues...

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.800
curators who have their own particular in-depth knowledge about different areas of the collection

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.640
We have certainly built the displays around the Rothko Room

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.220
It is the must see room I suppose at Tate Modern

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.460
The Rothko Room has become almost a legend in Tate itself

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.440
and they are perhaps some of the most popular works that we have with our public

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.400
and so it’s really exciting for us to be here to be able to install all nine of these works together 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.240
for the first time in three years

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.880
The gallery that we’re hanging this morning

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.480
which has monochrome works, which is immediately outside the Rothko space

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.900
most of those works were made at exactly the same moment that Rothko was working

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.980
and so it sets up a dialogue across those two spaces

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.880
A number of the works in the big gallery about painting and technology are new acquisitions

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.300
recently made works in fact

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.080
We have a computerised planning tool

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.280
which allows us to visualise works in the space in a three dimensional way

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:56.900
To see how people come in to find the old favourites and be surprised by the new things is...

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.980
that’s endlessly rewarding

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.980
The place one encounters it is on the moment that the doors open

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.860
and you see people pour in and immediately are engaging with things, or dismissing them

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.860
I mean one has to allow for people not to like things

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.620
and that sense of excitement, of drama, you are drawn from one space to another

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.200
and that’s part of our wider public service

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.010
bringing that innovative way of looking at international art

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.290
 to the five million people who come to Tate Modern each year
