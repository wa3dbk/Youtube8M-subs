00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
"Plant-Based Prevention"

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.380
The skin cancer (victim who) died at 50

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.580
may have been because 
of a teenage sunburn.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.296
And those who eat dairy -- 
milk, cheese or yogurt --

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:17.686
may have 2 1/2 times the risk 
of certain bad skin cancers.

00:00:17.686 --> 00:00:21.809
These researchers did, however, 
find something so incredibly powerful

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:25.999
that it cuts skin cancer 
risk by about 50%.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.572
Greens.
Eating dark green, leafy vegetables

00:00:28.572 --> 00:00:31.862
cuts our risk in half.

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:35.037
Yes, but how many greens 
did these people have to eat?

00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:37.720
Well, here's the data.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.100
These are the people who ate the most 
greens who had half the cancer risk

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:49.045
compared to these who ate the least, 
averaging only six grams of greens a day.

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:52.792
That's the weight of six paperclips!

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:55.915
They must've like accidentally 
ate the garnish or something,

00:00:55.915 --> 00:01:01.105
some sprig of parsley next to their steak.

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:04.826
What about the highest 
tier of greens intake?

00:01:04.826 --> 00:01:09.206
Cutting their squamous 
cell skin cancer risk in half

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:13.416
just 31 grams of greens a day --

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.216
31 paperclips!

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:18.995
That's the equivalent of 
just three leaves of spinach...

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:23.475
1,2,3 leaves a day.

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:26.275
Half the risk of this cancer.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:29.722
That's how powerful greens are!

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:36.470
My motto is, "Eat your greens 
every day of your life until you die."

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.640
Last year, there was even a 
"Greens Review" in American History.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.651
General George Washington, 1777,

00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:50.141
gave the general order for 
American troops to go out

00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:53.141
and pick the wild greens 
growing around their camps

00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:57.320
to protect them from 
"all putrid disorders."

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.610
Smart man!

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.480
Just as eating meat 
increases our risk of cancer,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.700
eating plants decreases that risk.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.792
This study found that 
eating a lot of plant foods

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:14.962
could cut our risk of getting 
breast cancer in half,

00:02:14.962 --> 00:02:17.682
thanks to dietary fiber.

00:02:17.682 --> 00:02:20.790
Remember, fiber is only 
found in plant foods.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.080
Animals have bones to hold them up,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.330
plants have fiber to hold them up.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.270
But only whole plant foods 
are good sources of fiber.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.160
Refined foods, like white flour, 
white bread, white rice, white pasta

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.740
have much of the fiber and other 
nutrients stripped from them.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.445
Same with endometrial cancer.

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:47.105
Lots of animal protein, animal fat,

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:49.085
we get nearly twice the risk.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.075
Lots of plant protein, plant fat --

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:55.005
nearly half the risk.

00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:57.950
97,000 women studied.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.220
Ovarian cancer, another 
really horrific cancer.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.741
Lots of isoflavones cut our risk in half.

00:03:06.741 --> 00:03:09.970
What's the top source of isoflavones?

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.760
Soy foods.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.240
Though soy-based meat alternatives often 
lack the fiber of whole plant foods,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.760
compare plant to animal bacon.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.850
Same serving size, but "Babe" over here

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.510
has four times the calories, 50 times 
the fat, 40 times the saturated fat,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.020
infinitely more cholesterol 
and only a 1/4 of the protein.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.640
And increases our cancer risk

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.510
while the soy-based bacon 
may decrease that risk.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.094
It's simple, right?

00:03:44.094 --> 00:03:48.174
High fruit, low meat, less tumors.

00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:50.440
I'm not just being selective 
with these studies.

00:03:50.444 --> 00:03:55.004
I have for years challenged 
anyone to produce a single study

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:58.384
showing more cancer on plant-based diet.

00:03:58.384 --> 00:04:02.390
Frankly, no such study exists.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.020
Another huge study -- Journal 
of the National Cancer Institute:

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.630
more plants, less cancer.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.920
Why?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.820
Dietary lignan intake.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.320
Lignans are one class of thousands 
of compounds called phytonutrients.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.781
"Phyto" means plant.

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:20.731
These are special plant nutrients.

00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:23.580
Best source of lignans on the planet?

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.210
Flax seeds.
