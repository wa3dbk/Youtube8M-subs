Hey, it's Mike from Swisco.com

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:09.325
and today I'm going to show you how 
 to install the 91-009 Storm Window Latch

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:14.236
In this video I'll also be using the 91-020 Latch Spring

00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:22.391
For this exercise, you will need a hammer, a 
 large flathead or slotted screwdriver, and a vice

00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:27.430
Start by fastening  your screen frame into 
 the vice, with the latches facing upward.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.816
Set your screwdriver into the groove, flat against the screen corner

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:35.453
and use your hammer to hit the screwdriver, unlocking 
 the corner and latch from the frame.

00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:40.603
Move to the other screen corner and latch, and repeat these steps.

00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:52.912
Take the disconnected piece of framing, and secure it into the vice.

00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:58.797
This time, place your screwdriver flat against the screen latch, 
 and use your hammer to hit the screwdriver

00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:05.061
unlocking the latch and corner from the frame - then remove 
 the latch spring and replace it with a new one.

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:10.773
Take your new latch, and slide it into the frame. 

00:01:10.773 --> 00:01:15.628
Then, place your screen corner into the frame, underneath the latch

00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:19.555
and use your hammer to lock the corner and latch into the frame

00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:24.702
Repeat these steps for the opposite side.

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:07.540
Next, connect the side of the frame with the new latches 
 and spring, back into the rest of your frame. 

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:14.790
Do this by placing your screen corners into the groove, and 
 using your hammer to lock the frame into place.

00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:29.230
Your new screen frame latches should now be ready for use.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.300
As always, thanks for watching!

00:02:31.613 --> 00:02:34.890
