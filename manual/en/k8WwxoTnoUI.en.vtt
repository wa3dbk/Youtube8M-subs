00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.020
We're Adam and Joanne from inspiredtaste.net and welcome to our kitchen. 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.309
We're making our soft salted caramels recipe. 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.239
These salted caramels are soft, chewy and perfectly melt away in your mouth. 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.460
Before making our salted caramels...

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.780
we always make sure we have our equipment ready...

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.859
and all ingredients measured out.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.159
Here's a loaf pan, we are going to lightly oil it...

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.950
then we're going to cut a piece of parchment paper, lightly oil that...

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.070
then insert that inside the loaf pan...

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.700
which makes our lives a lot easier for when we want to unmold the caramels when we're done.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.850
Next for the ingredients, we need to measure a half cup of...

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.420
heavy whipping cream...

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.820
then grab one stick of butter, which is also a half cup...

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.739
and cut that into eight...

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.340
equally sized pieces. 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.489
Add that to a bowl...

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.210
then add the cream...

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.550
and place it into the microwave...

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.260
then cook for about a minute...

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.040
until the butter has melted and the cream is hot...

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.290
set that aside...

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.820
then measure out a quarter cup of light corn syrup...

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.190
and one cup of granulated white sugar...

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.830
now grab a small saucepan...

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.770
add three tablespoons of water to the saucepan...

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.770
grab the corn syrup that you just
measured out and add that to the saucepan.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.360
Next for the sugar...

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.210
add it but try your best not to splatter the sugar up the sides of the pan. 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.509
Then use a spoon...

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.650
or spatula...

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.790
to stir the sugar...

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.020
into the water and corn syrup. 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.320
Heat to medium and bring to boil.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.529
Now once it as a boil you might to make sure there aren't any sugar crystals on the sides of the pan... 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.579
since this can cause something called crystallization...

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.349
which can make your caramels grainy and really ruin the texture...

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.399
to help with this...

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.399
cover with a lid for about one minute.

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.650
Remove the lid and attach a candy thermometer...

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.560
you will want to cook the sugar until it reaches 320 degrees F. 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.349
At this temperature the sugar will take on a light amber color...

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.259
now we are ready to add the butter and cream mixture from before...

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:39.919
add it in small batches...

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.349
then use the candy thermometer...

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.029
to stir it into the sugar mixture. 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.729
As you do this...

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.260
the caramel will bubble violently...

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
so you really want to do this slowly and carefully...

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.209
so nothing bubbles over.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.719
Place the candy thermometer back onto the side of the pan...

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.429
and cook the caramel...

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.819
until 240 degrees F...

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.329
this will create a soft caramel...

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.450
if you want harder caramels...

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.249
cook to 245 degrees F. 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.670
Now pour the caramel...

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.229
into your prepared loaf pan...

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:20.930
and let it sit for about fifteen to twenty minutes...

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.019
while you wait it's best to clean your
pot and candy thermometer...

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.129
fill the pot with water, place the candy thermometer into the water...

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.269
and bring the water to a boil...

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.029
this will melt away all the caramel...

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:38.889
and make clean up really easy.

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.359
After about twenty minutes you can salt the top of the salted caramels...

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.139
then let it sit...

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.949
for three to four hours...

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.559
until firmed up. 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:48.449
Then your done...

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.109
unmold the caramel...

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.349
and cut into whatever shape and size you like. Enjoy!
