00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:32.570
If there would be one game I'd have difficulty
reviewing, it would just so happen to be Dark

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.969
Souls II.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.230
I've been a fan of From Software's Souls series
since Demon's Souls, and even King's Field

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.359
if you count that.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.999
The series has forced gamers out of their
comfort zones and rewarded them for persevering

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:51.239
through the toughest of boss fights, invasions,
and icky monsters *shudder.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.050
So when Dark Souls II was first announced
back at the end of 2012, I was excited and

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.679
happy once again to have my ass handed to
me.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.530
And so were legions of Souls fans, until of
course, rumors spread that DS II would try

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.640
to appeal to a wider audience.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.540
Alas, Dark Souls II is definitely still Dark
Souls, aka, that brutal dive of a third-person,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.110
action/rpg.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.940
Much like previous games in the series, players
create a character and choose from a roster

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.290
of traditional RPG classes.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.530
Each class designates your character's stats
so that you can play as a lug headed warrior

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.390
or spell casting pansy.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:47.480
Heck, you can even duel wield swords but only
if you're a bad enough dude.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.630
In a half-hearted attempt to help new players
to the series, Dark Souls II has the courtesy

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.740
of a lengthier tutorial but not without harshly
reminding them that in the land of Dranlaic

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:08.450
death equals progress.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.281
From Software has added a few new healing
items to make the trip less painful, and they've

00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:17.319
even added covenant that'll send over a friend
whenever you get invaded.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.450
Invasions and PVP are still a big component
of the series and Dark Souls II adds a few

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.780
more covenants to spice up online excursions.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.620
You can still join the royal asshole brigade
and invade other, weaker players.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.530
Or be the good guy and hunt down said assholes.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.530
You can also annoy other players by joining
a covenant that invades specific areas within

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.530
the game.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.329
The tweaks to the rest of the game range from
good, interesting, or 'eh'.

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.450
You can now fast travel to any bonfire but
have to travel back to a hub area to level

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.709
up your character.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.830
While traveling back to Majula can feel like
a nice break, it essentially breaks the games

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.499
flow.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.560
Online fights are less a race to see who can
backstab each other though I had more trouble

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.810
with invaders who'd glitch or lag just right
behind me.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.219
Enemies only re spawn ten times but you can
use an item to replenish the area with enemies

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.459
on a higher, NEW GAME+ difficulty.

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.049
In listening to fans, From Software has delivered
more Dark Souls and the land of Dranlaic is

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:16.019
abundant with plenty of new enemies, weapons,
traps, secrets, and areas to overcome.

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.629
At the same time, a few enemies and even bosses
from Dark Souls reappear without little relevance

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.090
besides 'hey look, it's that guy' , which
becomes the first sign that Dark Souls II

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.120
has a rushed, overly designed quality to it
that makes it less absorbing than previous

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.239
games.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.299
There are more areas that make up the world
of Dranlaic than Lordran, and most are still

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.739
eerie, disturbing, and beautiful they are
also shorter, smaller, and have less staying

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.680
power.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.760
As a sequel, Dark Souls II is adequate.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.049
The game is a case of more of the same, which
is both a blessing and a curse.

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.010
The amount of content From Software has created
is impressive and the game's length clocks

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.569
in at about 40-50 hours of a dread inducing
combat and atmosphere.

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.260
It's a satisfying sequel for fans of the series
but for everyone else, taking the plunge into

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:24.449
the needle pit might seem more daunting than
ever.
