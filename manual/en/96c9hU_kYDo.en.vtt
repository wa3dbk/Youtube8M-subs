00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.800
Hey guys, it's me Saphira, I'm in my room.
I just woke up. Actually I didn't just wake

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.500
up. I woke up a few hours ago. Welcome to
my life! I planned last night that I would

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.860
be cleaning my room today because for vlogs
it is so much easier to film... um... if you're

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.690
really filming a lot and being really open
if your space is clean. Um, I don't have to

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.739
just like sit against like this one little
area that's clean. So, I'm gonna clean my

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.949
room, you're gonna see how not clean it is.
So my room is actually not nearly as bad as

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.280
it was last night. I started cleaning it last
night and I was like I could not finish. I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.290
went to bed at 2 AM because I still had to
edit and upload the video that was going to

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.600
go up this morning. So, anyway: um, let's
go! Clean my room! Come on. Let's go. We can

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:23.420
do it. Okay, so I just turned off my camera,
and according to my GoPro that was like fifteen

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.829
minutes of cleaning, I would've cleaned for
longer except for a few different things.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.859
First, it gets really, really hot in here.
Also, the biggest problem in here right now

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.750
is like laundry and dirty clothes because
our... um... washing machine is broken, so

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.210
they're just like building up. But yeah. We're
not gonna finish this today. Alright so now

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.659
that I have done a little bit of cleaning
and I just went to the computer and answered

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.079
some more emails and looked at my GoPro footage.
So yeah. Anyway, time to get dressed for the

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.659
day, do my hair and makeup and then we'll
be on our way! Ooh, Dr. Seuss is on the loose!

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.350
Okay. That Burger King cup. Right there - heehee.
This is quite possibly the cutest jumpsuit

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.869
ever. Um... it looks really, really, really
good on. Going to put this on, the only thing

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:12.430
is, this is kind of see-through, so... I mean...
I'm wearing bright pink like underwear right

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:38.470
now. So forget about like this box and that
box. I just had so many boxes built up from

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.989
like sponsorships and just things that come
in the mail 'cuz literally almost every single

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.150
day something comes in the mail and it's crazy.
So I'm all dressed, my makeup is all done.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.370
Um... or maybe - I don't know what I'm gonna
do. I'm just hungry and my mom says that she

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.430
wants to go out to lunch, so like, I feel
like I shouldn't get like actual food, but

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.790
I could get away with breakfast - maybe I'll
go to Starbucks and be basic, okay? Let's

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:20.100
go to Starbucks. I'm normally not basic, but
we can do that today. We're going

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.900
to see Miss Daisy! Hi there! How are you?

00:03:58.982 --> 00:03:59.542
Made it!

00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:28.267
So I've been walking around, and it's like all windy.  And I'm kinda sad that I didn't have a Marilyn Monroe moment, because... happy faces!

00:04:33.885 --> 00:04:36.765
I'm at my favorite overlook on Mulholland.

00:04:37.658 --> 00:04:41.498
And I wanna get a shot of me doing the Marilyn Monroe thing.

00:04:41.498 --> 00:04:46.632
And there are a lot of cars going by.  And there's this guy parked right here probably listening to me.

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:08.619
I always tell them to make it "Sophia" because

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:14.698
if I say "Saphira" then they waste time asking me how to spell it, telling me that my name is pretty,

00:05:14.698 --> 00:05:18.206
or they just spell it wrong.  So Sophia is a lot easier,

00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:24.335
except I've learned that there's a difference because they wanna know if it's a "ph" or an "f", so I need a new name.

00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:24.835
Any ideas?

00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:46.805
So we just had lunch at Benihana and now MommyFashion, I, me?  I?  And my friend Lauren

00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:52.272
are going to see Aloha, like the movie.  So this is my friend, Lauren.

00:05:52.272 --> 00:05:52.772
Hi, I'm Lauren.

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.741
Going to see the movie!

00:06:10.107 --> 00:06:15.947
Okay.  This is the end of my first Life video on this channel.  Let me know what you thought.

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:20.123
And I will be seeing you guys again tomorrow - in my next video!

00:06:20.123 --> 00:06:25.635
Um, I really hope you enjoyed!  Obviously this is my first time doing this so they're gonna get better and better

00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:32.021
As I learn what I like, my style with these, and... I don't know.  I'm so excited for you to see it!

00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:34.089
Ooh!  If you're watching this right now that means you're seeing it!

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:39.061
Okay.  That's - that's obvious.  All right.  Thank you so much for watching, have a nice day!

00:06:39.061 --> 00:06:44.576
And, as always, waking up doesn't mean your dreams are over, it means it's time to make them come true,

00:06:45.946 --> 00:06:46.906
And, be happy!
