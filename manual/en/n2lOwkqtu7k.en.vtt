00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.890
chicken which is very very popular so dear friends

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.380
this is the breast turkey which

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.360
you just cut into small pieces I am

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.469
just going to add some ginger-garlic

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.110
paste and salt because the rest of the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.969
things are going to be in a rub form

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.920
you know we're going to rub the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.230
masala on to this turkey pieces and we're

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.000
going to fry;  it's going to be fabulous

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.789
and tasty so first just let me mix this

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.610
ginger garlic paste with salt and we

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.559
want to put this in the refrigerator at

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.270
least for couple of hours you know atleast

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.250
for four five hours then the pieces will

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.219
become nice soft when you fry for any

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.040
preparation where you going to cut and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.560
fry the meat into small pieces make sure

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.119
you put in the brine especially chicken

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.700
or even turkey otherwise just marinate

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.200
it like this with some salt and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.729
seasonings and and then put in the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.710
refrigerator so it becomes nice and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.840
tender so when you're making the dry

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.180
rub kind of for preparation make sure

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.310
that there is not much moisture because

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.130
you want the masalas to stick onto this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.979
pieces of meat and be dry when you put

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.020
in the hot oil first let's learn how to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.540
make this dry masala mix for this you know

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.189
we don't want to add any color so I'm

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.320
going to add Kashmiri Chilli powder

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.450
which will naturally give good color to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.600
this preparation; in this add quarter

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.939
teaspoon of garam masala powder, 1

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.399
teaspoon of pepper powder, quarter

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.560
teaspoon of coriander powder, quarter

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.960
teaspoon of cumin powder add very little

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.119
salt because we already added some salt

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.360
to the turkey in this half a teaspoon of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.290
cornstarch and 1 teaspoon of nice flat

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.740
we're going to add flavoring salt

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.390
MSG

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.069
it's up to you if you want to add you

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.780
can add instead of adding line we're

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.450
going to add citric...this is the citric

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.380
acid you

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.060
if you do not have citric acid you can

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.030
also add some lime juice to it and we're

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.440
going to mix this

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.330
that's it this is how the masala is

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.730
going to look now in this we're going to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.650
add curry leaf powder

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.880
this is nothing but dried curry

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.220
leaves always dry the curry leaves in

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.290
the shade so that the color is retained

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.890
and is the flavor should be good now take

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.040
this masala and apply it to the piece of

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.500
turkey no moisture nothing

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.050
this has to be totally dry that should

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.340
be good and just coat these pieces

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.940
along with this masala some people if

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.160
you want to add you know red color or

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.650
anything you can add this is it that's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.310
it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.260
now all these pieces will be coated well

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.140
and you need to fry all you need to do

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.600
is just let it rest for five more minutes and

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.760
then if you feel that this moisture

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.380
coming out too much you can add some

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.980
more of this masala mix it and it'll be

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.140
perfect now get these pieces of turkey

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.900
and this masala is perfectly coated to

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.270
them now we have to see once you put in

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.080
the hot oil

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.060
what happens, will the masala come out?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.410
no it doesn't that is good so just add

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.470
more pieces that should be good

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.030
this pieces are nicely fried and let's

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.760
remove it onto a paper towel if you want

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.370

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.470

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.930
