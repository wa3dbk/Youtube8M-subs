00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.679
near the main late for the first time in
lexington distancing looking at the

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.789
soccer moms like my guess is that

fifty five-year-old is definitely had
some good

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.650
lake tahoe

of the controller so that i first read

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.690
it to be whether i was like

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:05.220
that get this now no accident that is
out there and i think i've restricted

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.640
what got such that a success and what's
most important and pass this year's six

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.310
since uh... and what do you do in the
movie

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.530
arguments and and that my characters
penitent interesting obviously physical

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.010
vat and the rocks jane johnson lights
work with and kind of his psychic uh...

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.160

for me

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.310
uh... became solemn justin

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.210
they called the nafta and the blood

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.840
i sent some supply and simon excitement

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.590

line when you kill somebody repulsion in

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.740
the face and you said you know what
clint eastwood ustinov room

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.349
the supplies and that was a bit rely you
know i have is that off my plane that

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.909
insight inaccurately say that i did

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:56.660
con son now actually getting to be

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.070
i think there is the little bit
surprised by the participants using that

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.599
this is an because i am

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:07.479
like this act practices jessica oscars a
softer side and at the horrors of him to

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.129
one of the hottest mobile homes in the
world but i think that the other studies

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:21.110

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.680
