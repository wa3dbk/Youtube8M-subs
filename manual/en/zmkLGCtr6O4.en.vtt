00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.130
Okay, let’s talk about what it takes to
make our own bonsai. This will be a very simple

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:17.300
checklist of what you should have before getting
started. First, you need your tree. Whichever

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.009
tree you choose to start with. It will be
a good idea to do some pruning on this tree

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:39.404
before you put it in the pot. So, in this
case we’re going to make the tree a little

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:47.010
shorter. Oh! We need a bonsai pot! Bonsai
pots come with holes in them, they’re ceramic.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:56.230
You can also buy plastic pots; although now-a-days
the ceramic pots are so inexpensive you might

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.070
as well see if you can get a ceramic pot.
Our bonsai soil is actually fine enough that

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:11.030
if we don’t put something over these holes
it will run right out the bottom. So, what

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:20.830
we do is cut ourselves a little bit of screen.
Generally window screen is a little bit too

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.431
fine. But, this is eighth inch hardwood but
you can also use plastic screening that you

00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:39.020
use for hobbies and crafts work quite well.
We want to cover those holes, and what we’re

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:50.450
going to do is make sure those screens don’t
move so I’ll make a little staple here and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:09.580
I’ll do one here real quickly. Okay, put
that staple through the top and take my pliers

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:25.920
and pull the wires tight. We have it tight
here, trim off the excess and that screen

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:37.950
isn’t going to move anywhere. The other
thing we want to do is, to be sure our tree

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:59.290
doesn’t fall out of the pot in the first
few weeks is to put wire through the holes

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:12.310
like this
and we’ll kind of bend those out of the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.480
way for now. So, when we get ready to put
the tree into the pot we will bend these wires

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:30.760
across rip wall and very carefully trim the
extra wire and that will prevent the tree

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.780
from coming loose, falling out, what have
you.
