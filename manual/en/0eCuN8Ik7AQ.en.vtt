00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.270
In standard fencing, you have three types
of swords. You have the foil, your epee, your

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.599
saber. Each serves a little bit different,
and each style has its own set of rules. What

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.540
I'm holding here is a saber. It has the basic
parts of a sword, of any sword are the same.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:21.100
The hilt, which I'm holding right here, consists
of the pummel, of the grip, and the guard;

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.150
which protects the fencer's hand. I'll show
you how to hold the grip in just a moment.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.800
As we move up, the parts of the blade have
names as well. This part at the bottom is

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.430
called the fort. It's the strongest part of
the blade. It's what you're using when you

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.490
pary because if you try to pary with the tip
of your blade, or even toward the middle,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.960
your blade runs the risk of breaking. It's
also not a very strong pary. So, if it hits

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.750
coming toward me and I try to pary here, it
can get through. So, this is a really strong

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.330
part of my blade. Moving up, little bit less
strong, is the foible, the middle of the blade.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.480
And, once you go up a little farther, it's
actually called the tip; otherwise known as

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.390
the pointy end. And here on the edge, you
have the button; which with a lot of fencers,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.299
you actually have a little plastic or rubber
nip here at the end. The grip can be covered

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.310
in different soft materials, but what I'm
holding here is a French Grip; which is slightly

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.900
angled in at the side, so that your hand fits
nicely around it, and it tilts in toward your

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.450
palm. When you hold the grip of the French
Grip, you want to cradle it with your thumb

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.280
and your forefinger so that you have a lot
of control just here under the guard. And

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.760
then, wrap the rest of your fingers around
it so that it's very comfortable, you have

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.590
a good grip, and if you can actually hold
on to the tip with your forefinger and your

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.860
thumb, you run much less of a chance of losing
your sword should you take a hard hit or should

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.620
you be in the midst of fencing in the heat
of battle. Another kind of grip is the pistol

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.909
grip, so named because it looks a little bit
like a pistol. And your hand fits around it

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.280
like this. It looks a little bit intricate,
but it's very intuitive because it fits your

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.830
hand perfectly. You take the top two fingers
around the top, your thumb wraps around this

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.560
part here, and the other two fingers wrap
just around. But just like before, you want

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.870
to make sure you have a good, solid grip with
your thumb and your forefinger right here,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.049
up against the guard so that you've got control
of your weapon with just the flick of your

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.489
wrist. Okay, the proper way to hold a grip
on a French Grip is to grab it tightly up

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.099
here by the guard with your thumb and forefinger
and you'll notice that there's a little bit

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.139
of a curvature here, that's for your palm,
and wrap the fingers nicely around it. So

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:42.230
I'm actually controlling the movements with
these top two fingers so that I am in complete

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.650
control of the weapon. And my entire hand
is protected solidly from the grip. Also my

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:57.999
thumb is always facing towards this part of
the guard; whether I'm parying or attacking,

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.719
so that I have control, I always know where
the control of my weapon is, and if this were

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.029
a weapon with a single edge, the edge would
be out here. My edge is always facing away

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.709
from my pary, facing towards my attack.
