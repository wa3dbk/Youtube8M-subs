00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:23.100
Testing circuit breakers is essential to ensure safe electricity supply, safe handling of network faults and safety for the utilitiesâ€™ personnel.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:40.260
OMICRON entered the power industry in 1990 with an advanced three-phase protection test set, and quickly became the world leader in this field.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.860
Ever since 2000, OMICRON has been producing test equipment for substation commissioning and maintenance.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:04.360
A major success factor for all of these devices has been their state-of-the-art power electronic design, making them multifunctional and at the same time lightweight and portable.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:20.120
The same approach has been followed with OMICRON's CIBANO 500, which combines all of the equipment that's needed for circuit breaker testing in one device.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.100
&gt; a microohm meter

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.280
&gt; a multi-channel timing unit

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.220
&gt; a controlable DC supply to power drive motors and trip and close coils

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.460
The integrated microohm meter can measure contact resistance.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.820
While injecting up to 100 amps DC, the voltage is measured with a separate set of cables to determine the resistance.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.600
Combination cables help make correct test connections, speed up the process and reduce the risk of errors.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:26.200
When measuring the opening and closing times of main and auxiliary contacts, as well as the deviations between them, the CIBANO can operate the trip and closing coils and automatically record the voltage and current signals in order to perform a comprehensive analysis.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:48.900
The CIBANO includes an integrated variable DC or AC voltage source that's used for generating the power for the trip and close coil operation, or for supplying the drive motor.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.580
This is helpful during commissioning, if the circuit breaker is in place, but the station battery isn't.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.340
What's more, this also helps to avoid wiring problems during hook-up.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.740
Always applying the identical value of DC voltage makes measurements perfectly comparable.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.120
Additionally, this allows a defined over- or undervoltage to be used to evaluate its impact on close and trip times.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.300
The output voltage of the CIBANO's DC power supply is variable,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.300
and can be used to perform the minimum pick up test and undervoltage trip test without changing the test connections.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.480
Alternatively, the station DC supply can also be routed through the CIBANO to issue the trip and close commands.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.400
The coil currents and voltages are also recorded in this setup.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.220
With the CIBANO 500, all of the typical circuit breaker tests can be performed efficiently and safely.
