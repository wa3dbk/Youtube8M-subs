Hi! I am Dr. Adrienne Mulligan and I am the
owner of Camp Verde Veterinary Clinic and

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:19.329
I am here today on behalf of expertvillage.com
to talk to you about cat first aid and administration

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.930
of medications. First, I am going to show
you how to restrain a cat for simple things

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.430
like inspecting small wounds that they might
have or finding little burs or splinters or

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.910
things that might be causing them to lick
at their paw. Most of the time, if a cat is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.800
limping, it is probably something higher up
but if it is in his paw he is probably going

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.260
to be licking at it a lot. So if the cat is
paying a particular attention to a place on

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.570
his body, you really want to look at that
area and the best way to let a cat, let you

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.070
do that, to help a cat let you do that is
to learn how to use their scruff. The scruff

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.660
is this part between the ears and the shoulder
blades that the mother uses to pick a kitten

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.040
up and carry them around. Now youâ€¦ I do
not have ?? (0105) for you to pick him up

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.740
by his scruff and carrying him around once
they are this big but you can certainly use

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.240
it to restrain him, so that he will let you
do things. Now when you restrain a cat with

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.830
the scruff it is not a mean thing to do, it
actually releases endorphins and it makes

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.560
a cat kind of remember how good it felt for
mummy to carry him around and it is not particularly

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.440
a bad thing, it actually is a comforting thing.
So basically I am going to scruff him and

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.971
if you are scruffing appropriately, the ears
should come together because you should be

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:51.619
close to the ears and you should feel their
shoulder blades right there. So you want to

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.980
hold hand of a scruff and you want lots of
scruff in your hands and you can lift him

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.820
but not up off the ground and when they are
like this you can look at their toenails and

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.060
you can see if they have a broken toenail.
You can see if they have a toenail that has

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:18.450
grown in, you can look under their paws. Occasionally,
it takes a little help with this even because

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.769
it takes two hands to really explore things.
So if someone else is scuffing them for you,

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.950
then it is easier but you can check between
the toes and remove things and you can do

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.540
the same thing with the back feet and also
if you turn them over on their back and scruff

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.129
them and roll them over you can usually check
them over really good for anything under here.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.529
But scuffing is extremely important when you
are trying to look at places your cat seems

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.919
to be having some troubles and usually they
will let you know that by licking.
