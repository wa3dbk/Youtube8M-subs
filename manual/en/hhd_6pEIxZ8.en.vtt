00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.820
For 50 years Raju the elephant was held in
chains, beaten and abused -- a pitiful sight

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.680
with his legs bleeding from spiked shackles
and living on ­handouts from passing tourists,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.360
writes Sarah Arnold in the Sunday People.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.360
He was so hungry he would eat plastic and
paper to fill his empty stomach.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.960
But last week animal charity workers swooped
to save him in a daring midnight rescue ­operation

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.570
on the streets of India.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.320
Some experts believe elephants cry when overcome
with emotion, just like humans.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.199
And Raju's rescuers insist the giant animal
wept as he realised his ordeal was coming

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.200
to an end.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.199
Pooja Binepal, of Wildlife SOS-UK, said: "Raju
was in chains 24 hours a day, an act of ­intolerable

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.199
cruelty.

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.690
The team were astounded to see tears roll
down his face during the rescue.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.410
"It was incredibly emotional.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.970
We knew in our hearts he realised he was being
freed.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.750
"Elephants are majestic and highly intelligent
animals.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.720
We can only imagine what torture the past
half a century has been for him.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.540
"Until we stepped in he'd never known what
it is like to walk free of his shackles.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.710
"But today he knows what freedom is and he
will learn what kindness feels like."

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.960
A 10-strong team of vets and wildlife experts
from the charity, based in Palmers Green,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.210
North London, were joined at midnight on Thursday
by 20 Forestry Commission officers and two

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.219
policemen to rescue Raju.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.640
The mission took place under cover of ­darkness
to avoid detection and spare suffering Raju

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.020
from the searing heat of the sun in the Uttar
Pradesh region of India.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.000
It had been exactly a year since the charity
was alerted to this plight by the Uttar Pradesh

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.009
Forest Department.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.310
A confiscation process had gone through the
courts before Raju was seized.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.000
Pooja explained: "Very little is known about
his early years but we believe he was poached

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.929
from his mother as a young calf.

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.969
"The poachers either slaughter mothers or
they drive the herd into traps that are small

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.139
enough only for the babies to fall into.

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:58.350
"The mother cries for her baby for days after
he's been stolen.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.999
It is a sickening trade.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:03.950
The calves are then tied and beaten until
they submit to their owners.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.200
Their spirits are broken.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.530
"Raju's case was particularly tragic.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.230
He has been sold on and on.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.080
We believe he has had up to 27 owners.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.560
By the time we found him he was in a pathetic
condition.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.000
He had no shelter at night and was used as
a beggars' prop from dawn until dusk.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.700
"He wasn't fed properly and was in a state
of hunger and exhaustion.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.599
He began eating plastic and paper.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.690
"His nails are severely overgrown, he has
­abscesses and wounds because of his spiked

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.409
shackles and ­continually walking on a Tarmac
road has led to his footpad overgrowing."

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.930
Once a court order was issued, a team led
by Wildlife SOS founder Kartick Satyanarayan

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.890
­carried out two days of surveillance, fearing
Raju's owner, known as a ­mahout, would flee.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.450
Kartick explained: "We had to act quickly
as his situation was so ­desperate and the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.000
cruelty so extreme.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.840
The spikes on his chains were cutting into
his flesh.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.950
Each time he moved pus would ooze out of the
wounds.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.750
Pain and brutality were all he knew.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.450
"His cruel handler even tore out the hair
from his tail to sell as good luck charms.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.030
The ­exploitation and abuse just had to stop."

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.689
But even as the mercy mission began, Raju's
owner tried to prevent his rescue.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.420
Kartick said: "He began to shout commands
to terrify Raju and try to provoke him.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.959
It created an incredibly ­dangerous situation
because a bull elephant can snap a human like

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.450
a toothpick if he becomes afraid or angry.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.500
"Then he put chains around Raju's legs in
an ­attempt to stop us moving him.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.110
They were so viciously tight they were cutting
into his legs.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.080
"But we stood our ground and refused to back
down.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.760
And as we did so, tears began to roll down
Raju's face.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.010
Some no doubt were due to the pain but he
also seemed to sense that change was coming.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.790
He felt hope for the first time.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.859
"We knew it was now or never so we made the
decision to move his transportation truck

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.049
closer and walk him 200 yards.

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.510
Every step was agony but we had to take him.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.060
We decided to remove the shackles after we'd
got him to safety."

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.189
Once the five-and-a-half-ton elephant was
loaded on an open truck and sedated, he was

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:03.819
driven 350 miles to the charity's Elephant
Conservation and Care Centre at Mathura.

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.269
Kartick said: "He took his first step to freedom
at one minute past midnight on July 4, US

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.269
­independence day.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.319
It felt fitting.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.540
"The other elephants in the sanctuary woke
up as we pulled in and came to have a look.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.760
It was an extraordinary moment."

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.570
Raju was fed bananas, banana leaves, mangoes
and some bread and biscuits and given water.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.539
The charity's head wildlife vet Dr Yaduraj
Khadpekar then began the painstaking process

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.419
of removing his shackles.

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.770
Kartick said: "It took 45 minutes to liberate
him.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.990
The chains wound round his legs caused pain
if anyone tried to take them off.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.590
Four ­mahouts gently persuaded him to sit
and finally we were able to give him his liberty.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.280
"We all had tears in our eyes as the rope
which held the final spike was cut and Raju

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.440
took his first steps of freedom.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.460
The team was exhausted but elated.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.389
Raju suffered unthinkable abuse and trauma
for so long.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.720
His spirit was broken.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.060
"The cruel spiked shackle will go to a museum
to raise awareness of a vile trade.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.490
"He will be held in an isolation pen for a
week while he receives emergency medical attention.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.750
When he is ready he will join two companion
elephants called Rajesh and Bhola, who also

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.860
once suffered unthinkable cruelty.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.460
"Bhola was blind and was run over by a truck.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.270
But despite his terrible spinal and trunk
injuries his mahout forced him to work until

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.830
we rescued him from the streets, a living
skeleton.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.000
Rajesh was brutally beaten in a circus.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.120
It made him dangerous until he began to trust
again.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.889
They've both been rehabilitated and Raju will
learn how to live again by following their

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:31.889
example.

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.940
"He will then join the rest of the elephants,
including five flirtatious females.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.050
He'll spend the rest of his life in a safe
compound in dignity and free from suffering

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.050
and pain."

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.889
The charity, which depends on donations, is
trying to raise £10,000 to help start Raju's

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:46.889
new life.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:54.199
