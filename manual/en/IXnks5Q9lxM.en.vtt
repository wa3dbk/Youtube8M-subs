00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.350
JOHN BROWN IS AN
ANCHOR IN ORLANDO.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.350
HE'S A LOCAL

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.790
NEWS ANCHOR, AND RECENTLY HE
WALKED OFF THE SET IN

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.240
FRUSTRATION BECAUSE OF YET

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.500
ANOTHER KIM KARDASHIAN STORY.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.059
THIS IS GOOD DAY ORLANDO, AND HE

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.390
IS ONE OF THE HOSTS.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.390
APPARENTLY, THEY WERE TALKING

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.119
ABOUT A MIND NUMBINGLY DUMB
STORY REGARDING KYLIE JENNER

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.120
NAMING HER BUNNY BRUCE.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.560
THE
FACT THAT THAT IS EVEN A NEWS

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.580
STORY IS RIDICULOUS, BUT THEY
WERE COVERING IT, AND FINALLY

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.659
JOHN BROWN IS LIKE, I'M GETTING
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:34.659
HE WENT

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:35.659
ON A RANT THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.539
CANNOT SHOW YOU, DUE TO
COPYRIGHT LAW,

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:44.359
BUT HE SAYS,
"I'M HAVING A GOOD FRIDAY, SO I

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.839
REFUSE TO TALK ABOUT THE
KARDASHIAN TODAY.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:47.839
I'VE HAD

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.929
ENOUGH KARDASHIANS, I CAN'T TAKE
ANY MORE KARDASHIAN STORIES ON

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:50.929
THE SHOW.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.160
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THIS FAMILY, I'M SICK OF THIS

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.679
FAMILY, IT'S A NONSTORY!"

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.639
LATER
ON, HE SAID, "WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:01.049
THIS FAMILY EVERY DAY ON THIS
SHOW.

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:02.049
NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:03.049
FAMILY ANYMORE!

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.159
I'VE HAD
ENOUGH."

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.510
IT'S INCREDIBLE,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.930
BECAUSE THIS RESONATED WITH SO MANY

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.000
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.100
SO MANY
PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO HIS

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.690
FRUSTRATION, AND THE FACT THAT
THESE NONSENSICAL STORIES KEEP

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.620
GETTING PUSHED OUT OVER AND OVER
AGAIN, BUT I DO THINK IT RAISES

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.660
AN INTERESTING QUESTION.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.690
ONE OF
THE REASONS THE MEDIA COVERS THE

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.590
STORIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WATCHING.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.450
PEOPLE ARE LISTENING, WHETHER
THEY WANT TO ADMIT IT OR NOT,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.660
PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.660
THESE STORIES.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.930
I KNOW THAT ITíS
THE JOB OF THE MEDIA TO MAKE

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.720
GOOD DECISIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT
TYPES OF TOPICS THEY COVER, BUT

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.480
RATINGS DO MATTER, AND
UNFORTUNATELY, STORIES LIKE

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.170
THIS LEAD TO MASSIVE RATINGS.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.400
I THINK IT IS A FEEDBACK LOOP
AT THIS POINT.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.440
MEDIA FEED INTO

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.680
IT, THE EXPOSURE EXPANDS IN A
WAY THAT IS MIND-NUMBING TO

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.360
ACTUALLY WATCH, YOU ARE
BOMBARDED BY KARDASHIAN TRASH

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.219
ALL THE TIME, AND THEN PEOPLE
SORT OF, I THINK THAT THEN THE

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.120
AUDIENCE STARTS TO THINK THAT
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.069
INTERESTED, AND THAT IS WHAT IS
TRENDING AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.069
TALKING ABOUT.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.329
IT FEEDS ON
ITSELF, IT IS A VICIOUS,

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.329
DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.349
I CAN SAY, AS SOMEONE WHO
WORKS IN NEWS, WHAT IS DIFFICULT

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.590
IS, IF YOU ARE GOING TO COVER
SERIOUS, POLITICAL CONTENT, THAT

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.720
ACTUALLY HAS A REAL DIRECT
IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE IN THIS

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.909
COUNTRY, IT JUST DOESN'T GET
MUCH PLAY.

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.409
TYT HAS MANAGED TO

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.820
DO SOMETHING MIRACULOUS WITH THE
YOUTUBE AUDIENCE, BECAUSE THE

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.040
YOUTUBE AUDIENCES ARE NOT KNOWN
TO WANT TO CONSUME VERY NUANCED,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.540
POLITICAL ISSUES.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.310
A LOT OF THEM
WANT TO HAVE FUN AND BE

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.450
ENTERTAINED, THAT IS WHAT

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.659
YOUTUBE'S PRIMARY GOAL IS.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.180
SO
WE DO A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTENT,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.849
AND IT ALWAYS DISTURBS ME WHEN

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.560
WE DO A STORY THAT I'M HONESTLY
RELUCTANT TO DO, AND THEN

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:18.969
WE DO A STORY ON EDUCATION
AND IT DOESN'T DO WELL.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.159
YESTERDAY WE COVERED THE
MASTURBATORY STUDY, AND EVERYONE

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.760
WAS BITCHING ABOUT IT IN THE
COMMENTS, AND YET

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.670
THAT STORY HAD MORE VIEWS THAN
ANY OF OUR OTHER STORIES.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.670
WHAT

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.900
DO YOU WANT FROM US?

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.579
IT IS A SUPPLY
AND DEMAND BUSINESS.

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:37.579
AT WHAT

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.519
POINT DO YOU GET HIGH AND MIGHTY IN

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:51.580
YOU ROLE AS A MEDIA ORGANIZATION
AND SAY THAT YOU WILL NOT TALK

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.099
ABOUT A SPECIFIC STORY?

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.370
THE IDEA
IS, I THINK IT IS A LITTLE BIT

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.159
OF A DELICATE DANCE, WHEN IT
COMES TO MEDIA, I THINK IT

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.849
APPLIES ACROSS THE BOARD,
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ENGAGE

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.520
IN THOSE ISSUES TO GET THOSE
EYEBALLS, SO THAT YOU CAN THEN

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.650
FEED THEM SOMETHING WITH
SUBSTANCE.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.970
THAT IS OUR BUSINESS MODEL.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.300
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WATCH

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.600
OUR POLITICAL CONTENT STARTED
OFF BY WATCHING A POP-CULTURE OR

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.260
SOCIAL COMMENTARY STORY THAT WE
DID IN THE SECOND HOUR.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.260
A STORY

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.430
THAT MIGHT HAVE BROADER APPEAL

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.280
TO YOUNGER AUDIENCES.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.280
EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE I WILL GET AN

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.680
EMAIL FROM SOMEBODY WHO IS
FOURTEEN, AND IT WILL START OFF

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.590
BY SAYING, I WATCHED YOUR VIDEO

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.150
ON KYLIE JENNER'S APPROPRIATION
ñ AND THAT IS NOT A DUMB TOPIC,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.270
THAT IS AN INTERESTING TOPIC ñ
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.110
STUMBLED ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR DEAL,
AND THEY DECIDED TO EDUCATE

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.110
THEMSELVES ON IT.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.620
THEN ALL OF A
SUDDEN THEY ARE NOT ONLY

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.820
FOLLOWING THE POLITICAL CONTENT
THAT WE PRODUCE, BUT THEY ARE

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.360
ALSO BEING INSPIRED TO STUDY
POLITICAL SCIENCE.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.510
THAT, TO ME ñ

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.180
IT'S WORTH DOING THE STORIES
THAT I DON'T REALLY LIKE.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.180
BY

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.130
THE WAY, I HOPE YOU GUYS
UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN WHEN WE DO

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.310
TOPICS THAT SEEMS SHALLOW ON THE

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.960
SURFACE, WE TRY TO HAVE AN
INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960
IT.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.960
YES, THE MASTURBATORY STORY
WAS ABOUT DUDES MASTURBATING,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.960
AND EVERYONE IS UNCOMFORTABLE

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.960
WITH TOPICS LIKE THAT, BUT WE
HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.960
ABOUT IT.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.960
NOBODY WAS ACTING LIKE IT WAS
HARD SCIENCE, AND AGAIN, I TRY

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.960
NOT TO DELVE INTO YOUTUBE
COMMENTS, BUT I THINK WHEN IT

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.960
COMES TO THE MEDIA, IT IS A
CONSTANT GIVE AND TAKE, IN TERMS

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960
OF SUBSTANCE VERSUS FLUFFIER
CONTENT, AND HOW TO BALANCE

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960
THOSE AND ATTRACT EYEBALLS, BUT
ALSO GET PEOPLE INTERESTED IN

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.960
TOPICS THAT ARE, FRANKLY, JUST
HIGHER RISK.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.960
IT IS ALSO THE

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960
ENVIRONMENT IN AMERICAN MEDIA,
AND AMERICAN AUDIENCES.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.960
THERE

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.960
SEEMS TO BE MORE OF AN APPETITE

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.960
INTERNATIONALLY ABOUT
SUBSTANTIVE NEWS.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.960
THERE IS SOMETHING TO THE BASIC
MEDIA APPETITE HERE IN AMERICA.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960
BY THE WAY, IT IS OKAY TO
HAVE A WELL-ROUNDED APPETITE,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960
WHERE YOU WANT ALL SORTS OF
CONTENT.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960
THERE ARE POLITICAL

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.960
JUNKIES OUT THERE WHO ONLY WANT
POLITICAL CONTENT, AND

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960
ENTERTAINMENT JUNKIES THAT ONLY WANT

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960
ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT, BUT THERE
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960
WHO ARE INTERESTED IN A LOT OF

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960
VARIETY AND I LOVE THAT.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960
I LOVE THAT BECAUSE I DO NOT
ALWAYS WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.960
SERIOUS, DEPRESSING NEWS.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960
I WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN AND TALK
ABOUT MASTURBATION, AND THAT'S OKAY.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.960
IT'S ALL ABOUT MODERATION.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.960
I
DO NOT HAVE A PERSONAL VENDETTA

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.960
ABOUT THE KARDASHIANS, BUT I
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THIS GUY

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.960
BLEW HIS TOP.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.960
I THINK HE IS THE
MANIFESTATION OF A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.960
IN THE MEDIA WHO CANNOT BELIEVE

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960
THAT THEY ARE STILL TALKING
ABOUT THIS FAMILY.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.966
GOD BLESS YOU
DON BROWN, PREACH.
