00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
I kept an angel

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.240
In a box beneath my bed

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.260
Little beast had broke her jaw

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.100
And I tried to fix her head

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.800
They said I had to put her back

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.800
That I had to put her back

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.060
Exactly where I'd found her

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.840
But I know, I saw

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.160
That she was doing good until the cat got her

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.140
And I came to write a letter

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.120
But my pen was filled with hymns

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.080
I came to drown a sorrow

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960
It seems they've learned to swim

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.220
Mouth full of pins and a heart pumping gasoline

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.120
It's late, I'm still at the sewing machine

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.100
Stitching up strays fifteen years

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.880
But this one's mean

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.080
Well I fixed you up

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.760
When they said you were past repair

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.060
And I stitched you up

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.620
I thread a needle with my hair

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.080
And I fixed you up

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.520
When you were still a common sparrow

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.500
But look who's on the shoulder now

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.260
When the road goes narrow

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.540
I kept an angel

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.460
In a box beneath my bed

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.660
Little bitch had broke her jaw

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.380
And I tried to fix her head

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.100
They said I had to put her back

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.220
That I had to put her back

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.480
Exactly where I'd found her

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.220
But I know, I saw

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.420
That she was doing good

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.560
Until the cat got her

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.300
Well I'm putting you

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.660
Out of my misery

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.980
We ain't got much

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.560
But we've got history

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.200
It was a mercy kill

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.900
No

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.060
It was a suicide

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.920
No

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.060
It was an accident

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.940
No

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.220
Well at least I tried

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.420
Well at least I tried

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.980
Well at least I -

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.140
With soft drugs and a seam ripper

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.000
Tough love and a tape measure

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.020
Stitching up boys is different that way

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.900
You fix a bird

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.060
You buy a cage

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.600
You fix a man, and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.200
You fix a man, and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.640
And he flies away

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.660
When I ran out of thread

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.540
I couldn't let go

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.480
But that's not sewing, that's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.240
That's just poking holes

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.700
And it's a strange breed

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.980
A different kind of creature

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.120
That looks for love

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.420
Through the eye of a needle

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.560
But the creed of the seamstress is

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.940
That you're pretty in pieces

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.660
I kept an angel

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.640
In a box beneath my bed

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.720
Little beast had broke her jaw

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.440
And I tried to fix her head

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.040
They said I had to put her back

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.240
That I had to put her back

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.520
Exactly where I'd found her

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.340
But I know, I saw

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.600
That she was doing good until the cat got her

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.000
Take a seat, and let me get a look at your face

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.800
Busted, back's been broken for days

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.700
Not much, a little something for the pain

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.780
Don't fuss, or I'll never get a seam to lay straight

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.400
And I keep it clean as I can

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.720
With just, just a machine and a mattress plus

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.540
I never did need for a pattern

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.580
Just some good restraints

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.860
And my bedside manner

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.080
When I ran out of thread

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.820
I couldn't let go

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820
But that's not sewing, that's

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.800
That's just poking holes

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.600
When I ran out of thread

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.640
I couldn't let go

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.640
But that's not sewing, that's

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.520
Oh, that's just poking holes
