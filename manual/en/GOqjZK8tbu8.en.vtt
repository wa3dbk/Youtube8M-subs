Aren't you happy?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I think she's nervous

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Can you tell us your name?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Everyone is calling your name

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Moe where do you live?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Moe could you please listen to me?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Where do you live?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Chiba

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
How old are you?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm 21 too!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So Moe, we would like you to pick someone and then act out the date

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Why are you laughing?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It'll be okay. They'll take the lead

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So please tell us which date plan impressed you the most

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Soohyun's

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I guess if you live in Chiba, you would want to travel to Hokkaido

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Going to a hotspring in Sapporo

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Eat something nice together and then after that
get the chocolate from his mouth
..it's that kind of plan

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Moe (chan) you know that right?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Dirty!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's not dirty!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's beautiful, it's romantic

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm going to talk first and then afterwards it will be just you two speaking
Ok?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Moe is it okay?
Yes

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Yep okay

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So what should we do?
After you've taken a bath, eaten dinner and then after that? Okay?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Okay so Soohyun's Valentine's Day date
3,2,1

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Doesn't it feel nice Moe?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The hot spring was good right?
Yes

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Oh eat a bit of this!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Moe, are you still alive?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
How was this Valentine's Day date?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So after you hang up the phone,
you're going to go on Twitter and tweet OMG!!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm sure you have a great memory of Valentine's Day now
