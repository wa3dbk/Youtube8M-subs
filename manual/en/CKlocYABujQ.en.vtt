reading on 10 minutes
the Mac second-in-command getting ready for

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.420

video

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.130
talking about this by a 10 now I'm
I wanna lick it all up point about it later

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.240
you know my full opinion when I
think about it now I have the biotin 5000

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.189
mcg and I know that there is
the 10 dozen Mzee on which is obviously a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.000
more powerful
ghost on but I just have to find other one

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.970
and I've been taking the EU fleet frequently
I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.470
I'm from behind Alex topping and then all
I take it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.970
on altogether not really a whole we can all
stop NAS was indeed a handful to

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.220
just take it like continuously to get like
the max and I think this one venue

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.560
officials take one one today but I hate to
because I mean it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.560
and the 10,000 mpg useful the day twenty days
5,000 I figure I mean that act up to 10,000

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.680
now my love it might be really
stupid

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.310
pick your these one from the morning want
at me

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.049
and honestly work every time I Lake start
taking it again I

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.539
like I immediately see results and I'm like
Oh my God my hair

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.569
seriously did grow so back I'm so I mean if
you go back to a previous videos

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.639
you'll see how short my hair was it was like
literally up to here okay an outlet

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:34.840
after he came to california leave videos will
be alert when out through injury

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.069
but one thing came to California my trend
actually cut my hair

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.049
sheetret it would like to hear all it was
a pretty much this link

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.579
I'm now the thing I like about my hair layers
so it

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.229
always kinda been they lane and then this
little on the ski

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.459
so that's how it always screws in it kinda
nine but whatever

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.560
basically it's one thing to do. but he didn't
know that this

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.950
some really does work if you're looking for
like a way to make a haircut and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.520

dishonestly how and I he recommended and i've

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.520
seen
ok reviews and it works not people I know

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.990
also
it really doesn't work and I'm like it was

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.160
different on different people so it
might work

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.830
really fast for you it might take some time
but this for works like made it way

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.690

okay but it actually a do see improvement
