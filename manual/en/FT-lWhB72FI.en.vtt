Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this segment
we are going to talk about how to use ground

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.650
covers for your yard and garden. There are
so many different types of plants that you

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.770
can use as a ground cover but there are different
factors that you should consider whether it

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.550
is sunny or shady, whether it is really wet
or really dry and then we will go from there.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.060
There are so many options. If you have got
a really wet area and it never dries out,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.770
your grass isn't growing there and it is too
shady there are different grasses that you

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.500
can use as a ground cover and this Irish moss,
any type of moss is really pretty for the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.420
shade and this has really pretty little white
flowers that bloom in the Spring time through

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
the Summer and they are depending on where
you leave and it is a beautiful ground cover

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.239
for shade. Now succulents make great ground
covers too. Here is an ice plant, Lampranthus.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.909
It is a beautiful, beautiful ground cover
but it will almost take over a bed so that

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.920
is the thing about ground covers. You kind
of have to keep them under control. They can

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.810
really multiply and this is called stone crop
it is a sedum and it is also a ground cover

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.360
and it is just beautiful, I love the different
colors and then lots of herbs make really

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.840
great ground covers. These are thymes and
different types of thymes and spearmint works

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.689
very well and then other types of succulents
too like hens and chicks make great ground

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.049
covers and they will just cover an area and
I just periodically pull out some of the dead

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.909
leaves and they'll just keep growing more
and more and more but there is other plants

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.189
that you can use as ground cover, Dianthus
in the Fall looks very good but all I do is

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.460
chop it back down to the ground but leave
a little bit of growth on there and it will

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.320
come back next Summer and have these pink
flowers which are just gorgeous and they will

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.090
bloom all Summer. Periodically just chop them
down and they'll keep blooming. So ground

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.990
covers whether they are in your yard or in
your garden are gorgeous to have and if you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.790
have an area where the grass isn't growing
and your flowers aren't growing and you don't

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.259
want to deal with it there are so many different
ground covers that you can plant. Enjoy.
