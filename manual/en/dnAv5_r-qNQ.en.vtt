In a previous video we've already show you
how to replace or repair an inner tube

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.660
when you're out training if you puncture,
but what if you're out training you've got

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.040
a pump with you but you've run out of
inner tubes, and you've got no patches?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.720
Well, there are a couple of methods that
you can use to try and get you home.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.550
Hi, there. Yeah, can you come and
pick me up, please? First thing's first,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.990
find yourself a safe place, away from
the road and away from the traffic.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.382
Then of course, you're going to
need to take the wheel out.

Just like any other time that you change a
punctured one, I'm going to check inside

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:43.668
the tire, as we did in the other
video, just do it gently just in case.

Next thing, we've got to find out
where the hole is on this inner tube.

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:03.341
Make sure you keep your finger
exactly where it is if you don't

00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:06.905
want to lose the exact point
that the whole is. All we're

00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:15.120
going to do is cut a knot in the tire,
so the hole is just up here, to try and

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.640
isolate the hole and stop any air getting
to that particular part. That looks

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.000
a bit crude. You want to get that knot as
close to the end of the tube as possible,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.296
because, of course, you're shortening it
but there is quite a lot of stretchiness

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:36.635
in these inner tubes, so it should still
fill the entire tire. Just a simple knot

00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:44.186
will do, just trying to get this one up
right towards the end. Now, if it looks

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:49.716
crude, that's because it is, but the idea
is that this bodge will hopefully get us

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:51.340
back home. Let's give it a go.

♪ [music] ♪

00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:58.877
As you can see, that seems to work okay.
There's no actual air in that end part

00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:02.267
where the hole is, and it's
staying up. All good so far.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.290
Here we go, it's on. Now we don't want
to put it up to 100 PSI like we might do

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.660
ordinarily, because that's a weak point
now. This is simply a bodge job to get you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.960
home so don't carry on with 100 mile
ride either, you just want to take the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.128
most direct route back to your home or
wherever you're staying. Well, what do

00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:35.652
you do if the single knot bodge doesn't
work? Well, it should do if it's just a

00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:39.282
small hole, but if you find that you've
got a rip and, of course, you go into

00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:46.188
GCN's bodge number two. So, I think I've
managed to isolate where the hole is in

00:02:46.188 --> 00:02:51.132
my tube. As you can see, this is a big
gash, so that single knot might not work,

00:02:51.132 --> 00:02:54.835
as it's more difficult to isolate this
hole and stop the air coming out. So, what

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:58.451
do you do in this situation? Well, we're
going to make two knots, but first of all,

00:02:58.451 --> 00:03:07.050
we need to rip the inner tube into two
parts. The aim is to rip the inner tube

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:17.010
and not to rip your hands. There we
go. Now what are we going to do?

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.770
So, now we're ready to make the two knots.
So, starting at one end of the inner tube,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.350
let's put a simple knot in it. Now, you
want the knot to be fairly close to the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.200
end but of course, not too close so
there's less chance of the air coming

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.060
through. Once you've got it roughly like
that, around about an inch to spare at the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.630
end, just pull it as
tight as you can get it.

But what do you do if the single knot
doesn't work, and the double knot doesn't

00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:23.544
work? Well you go on to GCN bodge number
three which is grass. Now, I always take

00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:27.800
some out with me in my back pocket,
and we're going to stuff that in the tire.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.440
I have to be completely honest at this
tire is at the moment, I don't think I

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.610
could ride home on it, but I can feel I've
been riding along the bits where I've got

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.790
that folded over pieces of grass
in there, it is a lot more solid.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.750
So if I had more time and pretty more
inclination because I'm freezing cold

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.790
here, I pretty could get away of it, but
it's a last resort, and remember, if you

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.330
do do it this way, be very very careful on
the way home, particularly when you're

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.080
going around corners. It's not
going to have the same strength.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.580
There's a likelihood that the tire might
roll off the rims, so just be very careful

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.128
on your way home. But if you do get
away with it, let us know in the comment

hole which is leaking the air out of your

inner tube, you need to take your patches.
