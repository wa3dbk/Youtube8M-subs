00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.820
There are a number of options for physical
therapy, when we're having a meniscus patient,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.990
if it's torn, if the meniscus is torn, the
likelihood of them having it repaired is pretty

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.060
strong, so the doctor will often provide a
protocol-based therapy program after surgery,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.790
in the case of surgery.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.350
But if it's a tear to the meniscus that does
not require surgery, the patient wants to

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.950
try to get on with conservative management
or the doctor doesn't think it's necessary

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.750
to do surgery, then there are a few things
you have to consider.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.270
First of all, the fact that there is a tear
in there, you've got to be real careful and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.520
conservative in the beginning.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.210
We typically use as therapists, an acronym
called RICE, which is rest, ice, compression

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.510
and elevation.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.930
Usually these patients have are having a lot
of pain and a lot of swelling and those first

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.680
few days are crucial to turn off some of that
pain and swelling.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.230
So with the rest, the ice, the compression
and the elevation that will really be helpful

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.350
for a few days.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.180
Once there is an improvement in range of motion,
once there's an improvement in the swelling

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.470
and the pain you're going to move on to some
exercises.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.080
And the first couple of exercises are going
to to be trying to start pumping the actual

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.640
muscles of your knee.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.220
So we're talking about isometric exercises
for your quadriceps, isometric exercises for

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.850
your hamstrings.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.110
These are easily done on the floor or in bed
and you can be doing these at home.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.900
There is no reason to be going to a gym for
this.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.210
Once you've done the isometric exercises,
you can then move on to your heel slide, which

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.710
is an exercise you can do on the floor or
in bed as well.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.990
This is a simple bending and straightening
exercise, very little friction and very little

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.320
resistance at all with the exercise.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.290
After a few days of doing that, you can then
move on to doing these same heel slides, but

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.560
maybe using your hand to assist and create
some over-pressure to the pressure.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.950
That stage can last someone between one and
three weeks.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.380
Somewhere in the middle of that stage though
however, you can start to do some biking,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.570
some cycling at the gym, as well as doing
some leg curls and some leg extension exercises,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.189
without any weight and then moving on with
some weight.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.689
And then lastly, when you're dealing with
a meniscus tear, you're going to want to start

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.450
retraining on functional exercises, like your
squats and your lunges and even your split

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.450
squats.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.939
This is a higher level exercise that you want
to wait until the end of the recovery process

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.200
to work on.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.829
It really challenges the muscles of your leg
to work in a functional manner, because we

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.060
spend most of our day either getting up from
chairs or going down stairs.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.049
These exercises really allow the muscles to
work functionally.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.430
So it's a four to six week process whether
you are doing it on your own or in a physical

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.370
therapy office, depending on the level of
the injury.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.659
And again, if it's a post-operative person,
then usually the doctor will tell us sort

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.219
of where to go and when, in terms of how to
time it and how to proceed and these are the

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.060
options for a meniscus tear.
