00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.154
Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:10.213
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:21.541
First, add your favorite type of cream 

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:26.163
to the shredded dark couverture or regular chocolate bar.

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:32.130
The chocolate will gradually melt 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.885
in the bowl heated with steam.

00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:39.867
When the chocolate is almost melted, 

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:44.304
tear the castella or regular sponge cake into pieces 

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:47.372
and place them in a food processor.

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:55.198
Shred the castella into fine pieces.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:01.574
You can also shred it with a knife or tear it into fine pieces.

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:11.645
Next, chop the rum-soaked raisins into fine pieces.

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:21.713
Likewise, chop the unsalted roasted walnuts into fine pieces.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.078
When the chocolate is completely melted, 

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:31.254
remove the bowl from the steam.

00:01:31.953 --> 00:01:35.429
Then, gently mix the chocolate.

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:41.658
Now, add the castella, 

00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:44.792
cocoa powder, 

00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:49.431
rum 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.387
and the raisins and walnuts.

00:01:57.615 --> 00:02:00.604
Combine the mixture evenly.

00:02:08.073 --> 00:02:13.142
Now, divide the chocolate mixture into 10 pieces.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.812
Using a scale will help to keep the size consistent.

00:02:22.178 --> 00:02:28.015
One piece should be about 17g or 0.6 oz.

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:31.239
And now, with the cookie cutter, 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.239
shape 3 pieces into heart-shaped chocolates.

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:46.463
Then, shape the rest of the pieces into balls.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.486
And now, let’s coat the chocolates.

00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:03.208
Place the cocoa powder into a plastic bag.

00:03:04.021 --> 00:03:05.951
Coat the heart-shaped chocolate 

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:09.024
with the powder evenly in the bag.

00:03:09.634 --> 00:03:14.026
Place it onto a plate covered with colorful sprinkles.

00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:19.794
Likewise, coat each piece with the matcha 

00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:22.418
and coconut powder.

00:03:24.713 --> 00:03:27.933
Now, they are ready to serve.

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:32.801
The rounded pieces can be also coated with the cocoa, 

00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:37.289
matcha or coconut powder and stored in a truffle box, 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:40.210
making them suitable for a present.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:55.070
If the cocoa or matcha powder is darkened with moisture, 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.139
please coat it again.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.951
Good luck in the kitchen.
