Alright folks, in this series we're learning
how to draw magical objects, and in this clip,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.019
I'm going to teach you all how to draw a magic
mirror. So let's come right up here to this

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:15.889
corner and we'll do it up there. Yeah. So
this mirror would be of the mirror, mirror

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:23.270
on the wall variety. You know, the one that
the evil king or queen goes to to get advice

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.330
on their little diabolical plot. So we're
going to start by drawing an oval shape. Good

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.960
practice. We're learning how to draw your
shapes. And now, obviously a magic mirror

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.730
cannot just be some regular, boring old mirror.
We have to make sort of a fun pattern and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.210
design for this thing. It can't just be a
boring old glass shaped thing. Unless, you

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.870
know, it's your prerogative, you can do pretty
much whatever you want. But I would say, you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.629
know, don't limit yourself. Don't be boring.
Give it like a fun sort of a pattern. And

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.449
again, this is your chance to be sort of like
a designer. Create whatever type of pattern

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.760
you want for your little mirror. And this,
you know, the way I kind of like to do it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.870
is just kind of let your mind wander a little
bit. Just like, kind of visualize what you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:29.800
want the magic mirror to look like. And then
add the appropriate shapes and designs to

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.460
it. And these could be like I said, little
rubies in there, little diamonds and stones.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:51.380
Little engravings along the edge. That tie
them all together. Anything just to texturize

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.010
your drawing and make it just more interesting
to look at. Show people that you put some

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.160
thought and detail into it instead of just,
you know, schlepping a circle upon your page

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:17.000
with a, you know, whatever is coming out of
there. So, yeah. Add your details. Create

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.920
some definition and texture. You're free to
do whatever you like. So now we got the rough

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.862
shape of the mirror. Now let's draw some flames
kind of coming up from the bottom because

00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:34.920
this is a magic mirror. Eventually we're going
to do, is we're going to have a scary floating

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:44.450
head coming up from the magical realm. And
I would say Snow White made it famous, but

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.390
you know, it's pretty much been used in a
wide variety of things now. So it's not like

00:02:49.390 --> 00:03:02.680
own the copyright to it. So let's draw like
the floating odd masked shape face in

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:30.100
the fire. Mirror, mirror on the wall, guru.
Floating face. And this is obviously. You

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.190
make this as spooky or as unspooky as you
want. But this this will be the little guy

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.360
floating up out of the middle to give you
advice. There you go. The magic mirror and

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.700
the face within.
