00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.830
Hi. This is Julie with Beadaholique.com.
I'm very excited to share you a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.420
wonderful new product called Gilders
Paste. Gilders Paste is a wax base

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.899
medium which highlights wood, metal
ceramics, even gourds and candles.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.460
Here are a few components which have been

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.539
already had Gilders Paste apply to
them in several different colors.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.689
This here started out as an antique
silver plated filigree piece

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.420
two-step plain silver color and that had
the petunia colored Gilders Paste on top

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.550
of it.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.100
Here I use an african bronze. It actually
has a very green tone to make the leaves

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.500
and an antique gold.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.080
Here's more petina

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.850
and here's actually a butterfly

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.790
which I used three different colors. I
blended them together. That's one of really

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.330
great things about Gilders Paste you
can blend the colors together when

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.700
they're still damp

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.550
and get wonderful shades and variations
of colors. You can even do the clasp as well.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.360
So today I'm going to show you how to use
Gilders Paste and to show you have really

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.549
easy it is.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.899
I wanna go ahead and make up this
butterfly similar to the one here in the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.170
necklace.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.420
So to do that what you're going to need to do
is lay down some scrap paper.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.170
I just use some printer paper here

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.360
and then you're gonna need Gilder Paste.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.329
And then when your done you're also going to
need a clear acrylic sealer. I

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.030
like to use a matte finish to keep the
antique look of the filigree I'm going

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.050
to be doing

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.850
and I just use Mod Podge.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.170
You can find this at most art
stores.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.410
You can use any type of clear acrylic
that you like.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.760
Then if you want to get more of a
looser Gilders Paste if you do you want

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.450
to have a little bit of a runnier
appearance and to able to paint it on you're

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.119
going to want to get some turpenoid
as well.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.240
Then finally for this technique
which is going to go on which we just to

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.310
use our fingers to apply it.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.560
We're going to also need some paper towels

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.049
and in the a later video we'er going to show you how
to do it with a paintbrush

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.299
but in this one I want to show you
the really easy way of just applying it

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.660
with paper towels.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.490
So to begin what you're going to need to do is
open your Gilders Paste. All of the little

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.929
cartridges say press here to open at
one spot.

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:15.749
Just take your fingers

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.419
pop it open.

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.529
Much like a can of shoe polish

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.029
and it does have quite an odor
so you want to be able to do this in a well

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.829
ventilated area or even outside.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.180
This here is a silver color.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.039
That's blue.

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.819
African bronze.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.949
You can see there's quite an array of colors
and they're really amazing.

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.469
This is petina which is a very popular
one.

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.739
And even a purple.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.189
One thing to note about Gilders Paste is

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.760
each tin that we found has a
little bit of a different consistency.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.660
The purple is super loose.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.239
You can see I can go like that with
it.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.509
And then the blue here

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.079
is a little bit dryer.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.149
So if you do have a little bit more
dryer one and you want to get to a looser

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.349
consistency that's when you're going to add some 
turpenoid to it.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.709
Both works perfectly fine.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.859
Let me put away a couple of these colors
because for my butterfly I'm going to want

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:08.969
petina

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.799
iris blue and african bronze which
are going to be these three colors right

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.299
here.

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.619
Reseal your Guilder Paste after you use
it. You don't wanna

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.279
let the air get into it for too long of a
period.

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.230
I'm take the butterfly

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.549
and apply a base color.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.649
I'm going to the base color in the deep
iris blue.

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.169
Just put my finger right into the
Gilders Paste

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.469
and then rub it

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.339
onto my filigree.

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.979
I wanna rub kinda hard cause I want to
get into the crevices

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:47.979
and the recessed areas.

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.839
You can already see
the difference between a original

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.289
and the new one

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.079
but I want to be able to get all these
color variations. So what I going to do

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.759
now is take another finger

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.049
and I'm going to dip it into the african bronze.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.099
I'm going to highlight part of it.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.469
Just the edges.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.649
I'm doing this while it's still wet so that
the colors blend together. It does take

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.309
about sixty minutes

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:24.639
for Gilders Paste to dry to the touch.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.120
Now it will become somewhat dry after just
even a few minutes. So if you are gonna

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.119
wanna blend colors together

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:33.069
do it right away. Don't wait.

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.610
Now I've got it on my fingers. I'm just going to wipe
on paper towel

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.590
to get a little bit off.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.599
I'm going to go

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.789
back with my petina color.

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.560
It's a really nice

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.840
vibrant color.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.840
I'm just touching it lightly at this point.

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:00.509
Now say that I want to take some of that
off. I feel like I got a little too

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.100
much on the wings.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.009
I'm just going to take a paper towel and rub it.

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.590
You can see that's pulling back

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.749
the vintage brass color.

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.489
Don't worry your hands are going to get messy.
Just wipe them off with standard soap and

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:19.770
water.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.940
I've even find once

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.060
I've applied a few layers and I want them
to blend together a little bit better

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.919
I do like rubbing with a paper towel.

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.819
I'm going to go back and apply a little bit more
even.

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:39.819
Touching it gently.

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.860
And I'm happy with how that looks.
That took

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.969
all about two minutes.

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.189
You can see the difference between the
original and the new one.

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.789
I'm going to wait about twelve hours

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.499
and then I'm going to seal it with
the clear acrylic sealer.

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.219
I find that three light coats works
really well. You don't want to do too heavy

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:00.289
of a coat.

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.549
If you do too few coats than I find
that the Gilders Paste will rub off. Say

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:05.889
you go and

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.399
get wet or something happens
where your touching the clasp say you

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:11.480
know repeatedly.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.990
You are going to want to seal it. You're going to want
to seal it good and I recommend

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.219
three light coats.

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:20.020
So I recommend that you don't go swimming
in this and don't take a shower in it.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.999
It is durable. It's gonna stand up

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:23.860
but you don't necessarily want to be

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.490
exposing it to a lot of soap and water
repeatedly.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.309
So have fun with Gilders Paste. It's very
addictive. Watch for our next video

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:34.309
where we're going to show you how to apply Gilder Paste
with a paintbrush.
