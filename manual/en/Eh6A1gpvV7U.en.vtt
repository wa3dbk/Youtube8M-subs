Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now I'm
going to show you how to shape

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:26.039
the dough. Basically we are just going to
make flowers. It can be 2 or 3 kinds of flowers.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:36.760
I have another cookie shape right here like
a little star. It is nice to have a different

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:49.320
variety of shapes for flowers cause this way
the flower bouquet would look more colorful

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:59.300
and interesting. Usually it is for little
kids who would like this. The heart I'm going

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:10.030
to use for the leaves for the flowers as you
are going to see.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:22.149
You can see it is thick, it is not very thin.
It is thick enough to be able to put the wooden

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:34.909
stick for grilling. From the other dough,
I want to make bears which is usually for

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:47.939
birthdays. As you can see as I'm shaping it,
I'm just shaking it a little bit to both sides

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.920
and it makes a little space between the dough
and the shape. Which would make it a little

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:14.120
bit easier to take it out. Almost done. Of
course whatever is left of the dough you just

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.860
gather it together again you make a ball out
of it. Like this make a ball out of it and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.280
just roll it again and shape it again.
