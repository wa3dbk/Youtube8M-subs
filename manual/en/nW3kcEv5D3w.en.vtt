00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.920
Dr. Laurie: So we're often asked, "How do
I travel with my bird?"

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.299
People love to travel with their birds and
many birds really enjoy traveling.

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.650
The thing to do is to prepare in advance.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.200
Birds are very habitual creatures.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.410
They like their surroundings just as they
are and sometimes it can be upsetting for

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.750
them to be moved.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.960
They'll stop eating.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.650
Sometimes they'll actually develop behavioral
problems like picking, feather picking, if

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.599
they're startled or scared or disrupted in
some way.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.020
So if you know that you're going to go on
a trip, one thing you can do is get a very

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.160
safe carrier.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.800
This is a very safe carrier here for our bird.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.450
It's a lucite, and she can see out and she
knows what's going on, and practice at home

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.830
before you travel.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.660
Maybe put the bird in a cage inside the house
and feed the bird a treat.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.210
Make it a pleasant place to be.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.880
What else can you do, Sarah?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.780
Sarah: Once you actually get the bird in the
carrier you can work on just taking them on

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.100
various short car rides.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.800
Even just walking them around the house first,
so that they know that once they walk around

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.550
in the carrier, they're going to go back home.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.550
Things are going to be okay.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.740
It's not scary.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.740
Take them in the car.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.350
Drive them around the neighborhood.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.210
Once they get used to that, go up and down
a local road.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.490
Gradually take them from 15 to maybe 20 minute
drives, so that eventually they learn that

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.170
there's really nothing to fear when getting
into a carrier.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.390
Dr. Laurie: Absolutely, it's not impossible,
even with the oldest bird who's been in a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.700
home forever and ever.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.610
I had a patient that had a 25-year-old cockatiel,
which is very old for a cockatiel.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.080
She was an elderly woman, and she knew she
had to move, and about two years before she

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.539
was going to move she actually started practicing
with this bird.

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:34.539
She bought it a carrier.

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.000
She fed it in the carrier in the house.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.900
She walked around the living room, she walked
down the hall, to the garbage chute and back.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.420
She drove around the block.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.460
Although she anticipated the worst and really
prepared for this for two years, she was worried

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.380
that the bird was going to just pass out.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.979
She did fine and the bird moved and was just
fine.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.409
So even though your bird might get a little
car sick, which is a normal thing to do.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.619
You can travel with your bird.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.090
You can even go on a plane with your bird.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.709
You just have to check with your airlines
and the requirements of these state or the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:01.840
country that your traveling to.
