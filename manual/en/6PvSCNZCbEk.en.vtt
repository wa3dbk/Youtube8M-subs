00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.250
Rats, by their very nature, are social animals.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.660
In the wild they live in colonies where they
live in small groups.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.890
They generally would never be found living
alone, and we recommend this when keeping

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.890
them as pets.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.970
It's ideal to keep at least two so that they
have company, so that they have each other

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.950
to rat around with, and so that they have
the opportunity to exhibit the normal behaviors

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.300
that a rat would exhibit when they're with
another of their kind.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.210
Certainly there's no limitation on the number
of rats you could have, within reason of course,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.770
and that fit with the type of caging you have,
the type of environment, and your own personal

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.230
interest in keeping them.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.070
I strongly recommend having at least two at
any time and not keeping a single rat alone.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.940
Certainly there may be instances where keeping
a single rat is acceptable, but as a general

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
rule having them in small groups, having them
in family units.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.660
What often works for a number of people is
to set up what they call a harem, where they'll

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.860
have one male that lives with a group of two
or three females.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.570
Certainly in this instance that male is going
to have been sterilized so he can't reproduce,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.750
but that generally tends to work out really
well for them to live in groups.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.640
In most cases there isn't a big difference
in whether sexes will get along, although

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.350
there is the possibility that two males may
become territorial, may become argumentative,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.350
and actually fight.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.090
In these instances it's recommended to have
them neutered so that they can get along really

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.869
well together.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.840
And if you're introducing large numbers of
rats, or you want to have a large community

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.960
that live together, it's strongly recommended
to make sure that the animals are spayed or

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.480
neutered so that there is no accidental breeding.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.710
Overall it's important for the rat's health
and well being, and it's important for the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.060
times that no one is around that they're not
just left alone.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.010
And it also allows them to groom each other,
to play with each other, and to exhibit a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.560
lot of the normal behaviors that rats show
with each other rather than having them sit

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.150
by themselves alone during the times you're
not there.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.590
So, overall it's recommended to always have
at least a pair of rats.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.999
Many people will go up to having several more
depending on their environment.

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.980
But it's really important both for their social
well being, for their overall health, and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.689
for them to be able to exhibit natural behaviors
that rats exhibit with each other.
