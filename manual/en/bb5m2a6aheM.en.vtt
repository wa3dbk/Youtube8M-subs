00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.900
Hi, I'm Lisa Kathleen Graddy. I'm the curator of the
First Ladies collection here at the Smithsonian's 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.099
National Museum of American History

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.220
"We're going to have to lower Barbara's purse..."

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.300
The First Ladies collection is one of the most
popular and long-lasting exhibits.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.630
The collection started in 1912
and the exhibition first went up in 1914

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.030
The First Ladies collection, contrary to what most
people think, 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.030
is not just about the wives of the presidents.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.220
When the collection was first started 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.570
it was called "The Dresses of the Mistresses of the White House"

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.989
And that referred to the woman who

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.260
took on the social duties for that particular presidential administration.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.340
Usually that's a wife, but sometimes that
is a daughter or a niece or a daughter-in-law

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.090
and for Thomas Jefferson, Dolley Madison, a family friend, frequently filled in as his hostess. 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.600
One of the most know hostesses of the White House though

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.959
was Mamie Eisenhower. 

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:08.680
This is Mamie Eisenhower's iconic inaugural gown. 
Very full skirt, 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.310
the nice ball gown top, and covered in little pink 
rhinestones. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.220
Mamie Eisenhower's dress, which is a

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.860
quintessentially 50s look

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.310
is a wonderful contrast to Jacqueline Kennedy's 
inaugural gown.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.530
The Jacqueline Kennedy silhouette is much slimmer 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.829
The inaugural gown is an interesting compromise

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.659
because it has this strapless bodice underneath 
this wonderful

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.549
embroidered beaded bodice

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.250
but then this beautiful chiffon overlayer that's 
sleeveless but adds some cover.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.610
Eventually Mrs. Kennedy could go to sleeveless 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.450
and then eventually one-shoulder dresses and
then finally strapless dresses

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.330
but there was some concern within the administration
that the public--

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.130
they might look askance at a first lady who was
wearing a strapless dress

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.780
and so they sort of eased into it.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.820
This is Michelle Obama's dress

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.940
and it's absolutely beautiful and we're so thrilled 
to have it.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.130
But I have to say waiting all day to see the dress
because they didn't announce it advance,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.039
you didn't see pictures.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:16.119
When she came out my first thought was, "Oh
this is gorgeous, it's beautiful...

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.719
How am I going to fit it in the case?"

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.180
because we weren't expecting a train! 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.180
And it turns out the train is probably now our favorite
part of the dress.

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.609
I'm Sunae Park Evans, the museum's costume conservator.  
I prepared all the gowns for the exhibit

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.789
One of my jobs is to create

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:57.259
these perfect fit forms to support the historic costumes.

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.449
So as you see, this bodice is totally different

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.349
compared to other modern mannequins.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.349
This one has really a short bodice

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:15.349
and the shoulder is dropped. And because of a corset, 
the shape really is totally different. 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.739
I used this replica of the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.349
muslin pattern 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.220
and tried to use it to create this form

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.370
so I don't have to really handle the original costume, 
which can be really fragile.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.089
As you see all different kind of mountings there,

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.769
individual costumes

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.869
need really individual 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:39.089
kind of mountings

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:40.279
So I kind of carve

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:46.429
and cut, add the conservation materials. 
The costume will tell me how to mount.

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:50.329
If I don't do that, it doesn't look good.

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.569
When you come and visit us at the museum, you may 
notice that not all of the gowns you were expecting 
to see are on display.

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.529
That's because museums do two things at the same time:

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:07.020
We want to show you objects in the national collection

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.940
but we also need to preserve them for future
generations. So we're working on changing dresses

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.470
in out of the collection, out of the display

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.979
so you can to see new things when you come

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.060
and your grandchildren will be able to see them as well.
