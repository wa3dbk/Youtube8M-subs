00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.470
This is the portrait of Lady Agnew by John
Singer Sargent. It’s one of the most popular

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.960
portraits in the gallery’s collection. It
was the portrait that helped launch Sargent

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.320
as a portrait painter in Britain and was also
the portrait which

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.420
launched Lady Agnew in society.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.860
According to legend, she walked into the studio
one day and slumped down in a chair and Sargent

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.640
really liked to capture the most naturalistic
pose for his sitters and so he decided to

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.239
paint the portrait exactly as she was on that
first day.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.880
The painting was a hybrid of English aestheticism
and French impressionism and one was expected

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.500
to look at the portrait and think of it not
just as a portrait

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.280
but as a pleasing aesthetic object.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.610
What we get here is an almost effortless paint
application. It appears he’s gone in he’s

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.900
understood the sitter he’s applied the paint
and it’s just sort of happened. But as is

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.960
generally the case with works by Sargent,
when you start looking more closely you realise

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.720
there has been a struggle within the process
and that there is a myriad of small adjustments,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.310
small changes. For example on Lady Agnew,
when you start looking closely round the sash

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.150
area you start to see where the artist has
made changes. Where is, how high did the sash

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.531
go up, how tight, how small was the waist?
Is this an exaggeration? We don’t know but

00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:49.840
he has certainly spent some time redefining
that area. Similarly with the pendant you

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.750
can just about see a slight shadow which indicates
the pendant at some point was actually hanging

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.729
lower so he obviously felt from a visual perspective
it made more sense, it balanced better by

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.039
having the pendant hanging at a higher height.
We also see some alterations in this area

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.069
here and also some repositioning round the
neckline where the artist has gone back and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.439
redefined the outline and possibly even down
the side of the face.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.989
The face is much more carefully painted than
the rest of the portrait. However, the portrait

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.620
is generally designed to be seen at a distance
so if you look very closely at the detail

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.409
you see that its, the detail like the flowers
on the chair are very roughly painted but

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.680
when you move away from the portrait they
come together and they look like proper flowers.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.150
When this was first painted it was in high
demand for loan. Allegedly the story goes

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.849
that on loan to the Grafton Gallery on its
return it sustained a damage, a tear in fact

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.049
in this part of the painting. Close examination
now we know there is a tear there; it’s

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.699
obviously been repaired a long time ago. The
owner was really quite annoyed and there’s

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:11.699
an excellent quote where he says ‘They (that
is the Grafton Gallery) they were anxious

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:16.639
enough to get my most valued picture and to
reap the benefit of its presence on their

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.110
walls. But as soon as they have done with
it they show a singular indifference to the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.040
safe delivery to the owner ’

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.660
Lady Agnew was around about 26 or 27 when
this portrait was done and she has this very

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.999
kind of dominating presence. A lot of people
find her pose very seductive although we know

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:42.939
that at the time she was suffering from this
very long illness. Despite the fact that she

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.579
looks quite fragile in this painting she was
really quite a feisty individual and she was

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.459
what one might describe as a new woman of
the late 19th century. She led a very extravagant

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:00.029
lifestyle and in fact she spent a lot of the
Agnew fortune and in the end she was rather

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:05.329
sadly obliged to sell the painting in order
to make some money for herself.
