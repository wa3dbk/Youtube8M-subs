00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Tiling works in a bathroom.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Phase 1.
Substrate preparation: priming and waterproof insulation

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Before commencement of tiling the substrate should be checked.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The substrate under the tiles should be even, sound and dry.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
To keep the smoothness of works
gather all necessary products and tools.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Mark the wet zones in a bathroom before substrate priming.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
They include:

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
whole floor,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
10 cm of plinth on the walls,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the shower unit zone and 50 cm beside it,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
bathtub zone on the whole wall height,
as well as 50 cm beside the bathtub contour,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
zone from floor up to 50 cm above a washbasin and 50 cm beside it,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
lavatory zone - similarly to the washbasin.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Prime the substrate to limit and unify its absorption.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
For this, apply the primer with a roller or a paintbrush,
evenly on the wet zones surface, with no damp patches.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
There is no need to prime the wet zones,
where the waterproof insulation is to be applied.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Use the priming emulsion ATLAS UNI-GRUNT.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
ATLAS UNI-GRUNT unifies the substrate absorptiveness,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
it also permeates the surface,
therefore the substrate is additionally strengthened.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It increases the yield of paints, finishing coats and adhesives.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It also improves the setting conditions of mortars.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The product is delivered in a ready-to-use form.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
In some cases it can be diluted 1:1.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
UNI-GRUNT is characterised by short drying time,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
therefore the next phases of works on the primed substrate
can start just after 2 hours.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The next phase is the waterproof insulation application
on the previously marked wet zones.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
For this ATLAS WODER W is used.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's highly flexible single-component, ready-to-use waterproof insulation,
available in 4.5 and 10 kg packages.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It mustn't be mixed with other materials, thinned or thickened.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
After opening the container,
the contents should be mixed to achieve a uniform consistency.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
A low-speed electric drill with a mixer for paints is recommended.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
ATLAS WODER W is recommended for sealing substrates under tiles,
where water flows without pressure.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It creates lightweight type insulation.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In order to increase adhesion a thin coat of insulation
can be brushed onto the substrate.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
ATLAS WODER W is highly flexible,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
can be used on substrates executed in floor and wall heating systems,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
as well as other substrates subject to deformations.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It constitutes the membrane waterproofing,
forms a layer several millimetres thick.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It's characterised by short drying time,
has high adhesion to typical builidng substrates.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
For indoor use.
Ideal for bathrooms and kitchens.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It allows easy visual assessment of the thickness
and uniformity of the applied coat,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because of the intense colour and the texture after drying.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The membrane should be applied at least in two coats,
applied with a brush or a steel trowel.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The execution of the proper waterproof insulation starts from places,
where the Atlas sealing tapes, corners and rings will be used.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The accessories are embedded in the freshly applied
with a brush WODER W mass.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Embed the internal and external corners first.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Then, embed the tape on the floor and wall joint
with proper overlap on the previously embedded corner.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Next embed the tape on the walls internal joints.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Embed also proper sealing rings on the pipage passages.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The second coat may be applied once the first coat is completely dry
i.e. after ca. 3 hours.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Do not apply coats thicker than recommended
or reduce the drying time,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
as it may lead to cracking of the drying insulation.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
The cured coat, after ca. 24 hours,
should be permanently covered with flooring, plaster or cladding.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
The waterproofed surfaces
should be protected from moisture for ca. 3 days.
