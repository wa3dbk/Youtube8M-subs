00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.005
(music)

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.808
&gt;&gt; I'm Dr. Quillan,
faculty here at GRCC

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:12.379
and supervising dentist in
the Dental Auxiliary program.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.514
After the patient has
left your operatory,

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.016
it's time to take care of
those contaminated instruments

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.152
and disinfect
your unit.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.121
Let's go through
the protocol.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.724
The first step is to put
on the appropriate PPE.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:28.261
This includes an overgown,
protective eyewear, mask,

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.430
and utility gloves.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.600
Next, transport your
contaminated cassette,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.304
prophy angle, and any other
equipment to sterilization.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:41.174
Please note that any
individual instruments

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:45.445
considered to be "sharps"
should be secured in a Zirc box

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.847
or cassette before
being transported

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.717
to the sterilization area.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:54.854
Next, remove all barriers,
being careful not to contaminate

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.791
the clean surface
underneath.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.058
Discard the barriers

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:02.862
in one of the nearby
large trash receptacles.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:06.266
Disinfect any services that
have been contaminated.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.936
To minimize aerosols, be sure
to spray the disinfectant

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.038
directly into
a gauze square,

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:14.808
keeping the spray nozzle
close to the gauze.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:18.344
Then, wipe
the surfaces.

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:20.580
Please remember,
computer keyboards

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.616
are always barriered, and
therefore should never be wiped

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:24.984
with disinfectant.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:27.687
The disinfectant will
damage the keyboard.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:30.490
If you are disinfecting
between patients,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.092
you only need to
disinfect the surfaces

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.994
that were not
barriered.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.996
However, if you are
done for the day,

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.765
disinfect
all surfaces,

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.468
even services that
were barriered.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.838
After disinfecting
all necessary surfaces,

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:48.041
raise the patient chair
to its highest position,

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.478
straighten the trays, and place
the foot pedal on a paper towel

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.279
on the seat portion
of the chair.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:57.650
Then, remove your PPE
and wash your hands.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.987
Here are a couple of
additional things to remember--

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:04.190
if you drop an instrument
during patient treatment,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.426
resist the urge
to pick it up.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.596
Instead, using your foot,
slide the instrument

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:13.032
to the base of the patient
chair or nearby cabinet

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:16.102
to avoid rolling over
it with your chair.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:19.672
Retrieve the instrument later
when cleaning up the unit.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:23.142
If local anesthesia has been
administered to your patient,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:26.279
disassemble the contaminated
anesthetic syringe

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.881
in your operatory.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.884
Discard the needle and cartridge
in the sharps container

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.253
located under the sink.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:36.322
Thanks for watching...
and stay safe.
