00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.920
My name is Esther Mahlangu.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.840
I'm from Emthambothini

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.560
Weltevrede, Mpumalanga, KwaNdebele.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.960
I was taught to paint
by my grandmother and my mother.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.160
I would continue to paint
the house walls

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.640
when they left for a break.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.440
When they came back, they would say:

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.600
"What have you done child?
Never do that again!"

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.280
After that, I started drawing
on the back of the house.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.320
And slowly,
my drawings got better and better,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.480
until they finally asked me

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.720
to continue on the front of the house.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.080
Then I knew I was good at painting.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.600
There is a strong theme

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.400
across all the art
of the Ndebele people.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960
The paintings, houses, vases

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.960
and even the blankets all look similar.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.360
Traditionally, we used
five different soils to make paint.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.080
The colours we had were red,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.480
black, orange, white and blue.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.400
We would then add cow dung
to make the paint thick.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.240
But today we have
so many colourful paints available.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.240
I take great pride in all my work,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.760
because I want to keep
my culture alive for the children.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.200
The most important thing
is that the artwork must catch your eye.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.800
I always want
to make something that looks beautiful.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.800
When I painted the BMW,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.000
I used what was in my heart

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.440
and mind.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.080
The painting was inspired
by our traditional Ndebele designs.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.800
Now people come from all over the world,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.800
like America and France.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.040
They come here to learn
how to draw and paint with me.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.960
Painting is in my blood.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.080
Nothing will ever stop me
painting and drawing.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.280
I will paint and draw until I die.
