Hi Damion Rutherford here with JES. With our very first episode of Chalkboard chat. Where
0:00:11.139,0:00:16.440
we answer your questions about foundation repair, crawlspace repairs, and basement waterproofing.
0:00:16.440,0:00:20.900
Today's question comes from Scott right in my home town of Virginia Beach, VA
0:00:20.900,0:00:26.710
and he askes "What's the best way to eliminate moisture from my crawlspace?"
Well Scott, that's a great question,
0:00:26.710,0:00:31.419
and to eliminate any moisture from your crawl space the first thing you do,
0:00:31.419,0:00:35.480
is you have to find the source of the moisture.
So that involves having an inspection done, or some type of
0:00:35.480,0:00:37.790
evaluation, whether it's by a professional,
0:00:37.790,0:00:39.530
or you do it yourself.
0:00:39.530,0:00:44.500
Now, if your crawl space looks anything like this, like a lot of the crawlspaces we see,
0:00:44.500,0:00:47.790
It’s probably not a place you want to spend a lot of your time at
So
0:00:47.790,0:00:50.519
if you just don't want to deal with it, take some advice:
0:00:50.519,0:00:52.520
get a professional to do it for you.
0:00:52.520,0:00:56.650
At JES, we do it free of charge. We'll do an inspection to find out what is causing the problem
0:00:56.650,0:00:59.240
and why, and what can be done to solve the problems.
0:00:59.240,0:01:01.040
But, if you do want to do it yourself,
0:01:01.040,0:01:04.830
let me go over a few things to look for to find where the source of the moisture
0:01:04.830,0:01:06.530
in your crawlspace is
0:01:06.530,0:01:11.490
First of all, realize there is 3 sources where moisture can come into your crawlspace from.
0:01:11.490,0:01:14.950
The first one is moisture from outside of your crawlspace.
0:01:14.950,0:01:17.870
For example, when it rains, or we have a snow that melts,
0:01:17.870,0:01:22.909
the ground becomes saturated with water, the water table rises, and water comes into your crawl
0:01:22.909,0:01:27.400
space from that source. Here's a great picture to show you a great example where the crawlspace is
0:01:27.400,0:01:31.049
flooded and this is from which from ground water.
0:01:31.049,0:01:33.890
Another thing to look for is your crawlspace door.
0:01:33.890,0:01:38.880
Is the crawlspace door loose, are there gaps around it?
Is there not one there at all?
0:01:38.880,0:01:42.670
if this is the case it’s another source for
outside of water and moisture to get in your
0:01:42.670,0:01:48.040
Crawlspace. When the steps there though
growl are coming off into a crawl space or
0:01:48.040,0:01:53.070
When there's gaps there, the ground water can run off into your crawlspace. Or,
0:01:53.070,0:01:54.729
even when it rains,
0:01:54.729,0:01:57.180
Likewise, look at your crawlspace vents.
0:01:57.180,0:02:01.460
If they're open, the same thing can apply.
When there's rain there's wind,
0:02:01.460,0:02:06.270
and the wind can blow the rain right into your crawlspace through the crawlspace vents.
0:02:06.270,0:02:10.670
Now, the second thing to look for in your crawlspace for sources of moisture, are sources of moisture from within your crawl
0:02:10.670,0:02:11.839
Space.
0:02:11.839,0:02:15.909
A good example of that is any type of piping or plumbing that you have in your crawlspace
0:02:15.909,0:02:20.479
that can leak.
This can be one of the sources of moisture that you get in your crawlspace.
0:02:20.479,0:02:24.559
Some homeowners in the area, they have their hot water heater down in their crawlspace,
0:02:24.559,0:02:28.299
and take a look at that equipment that you have down there.
If that leaks or busts, that can be a
0:02:28.299,0:02:31.790
source of moisture in your crawlspace.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.840
The third way that moisture gets into your crawlspace is from high humidity levels. This is the one
0:02:35.840,0:02:37.989
that people tend to forget about
0:02:37.989,0:02:40.249
when you have hot air on the outside
0:02:40.249,0:02:42.829
and cool air on the inside of you crawlspace
0:02:42.829,0:02:46.949
When you mix hot air and cold air together you get... you guessed it... condensation.
0:02:46.949,0:02:50.909
When you have high humidity levels like, take a look at this picture here, we have a
0:02:50.909,0:02:54.129
relative humidity level of almost 88 percent. 
Now,
0:02:54.129,0:02:58.159
when we're at 100% relative humidity we get rain, so 88% is very, very
0:02:58.159,0:02:59.649
High.
0:02:59.649,0:03:04.259
Here's another reading at nearly 82%.
So, when you have this high humidity level,
0:03:04.259,0:03:08.649
that can cause the condensation that you see on the piping and the plumbing in your crawlspace.
0:03:08.649,0:03:13.009
It can also be the reason why you'll get wood rot. Either in the subfloor, or in the beams
0:03:13.009,0:03:15.499
in your crawlspace.
0:03:15.499,0:03:19.099
You may also start to see condensation start to form on any ductwork
0:03:19.099,0:03:22.969
that's in your crawlspace, as you can see in this picture here.
0:03:22.969,0:03:27.759
It's also the reason you'll see the insulation in your crawlspace begin to fail, and start to rot
0:03:27.759,0:03:29.229
and fall down
0:03:29.229,0:03:33.399
and hang.
It's because it's getting wet from moisture in the air, the condensation that we talked about from the humidity
0:03:33.399,0:03:34.729
levels.
0:03:34.729,0:03:38.529
So not very good, not healthy for your crawlspace or your home whatsoever.
So
0:03:38.529,0:03:42.979
the first thing is to find out what the source of the moisture is in your crawlspace.
0:03:42.979,0:03:45.869
Once you know the source then you can stop the source,
0:03:45.869,0:03:48.089
and you do it the same way that we inspect it.
0:03:48.089,0:03:52.769
The first thing we do is stop any type of outside moisture from getting into your crawlspace.
0:03:52.769,0:03:56.549
Secondly, we stop any type of inside moisture leaks from happening.
0:03:56.549,0:03:57.709
Third,
0:03:57.709,0:04:01.029
we control the humidity levels in the air in your crawlspace.
0:04:01.029,0:04:04.519
When we do all three of these, we've created a conditioned crawlspace
0:04:04.519,0:04:06.729
that will be dry and healthy.
0:04:06.729,0:04:11.940
And, as an added benefit, you can actually pick up added storage space under your crawlspace
0:04:11.940,0:04:14.939
because you have a condition that you can store your belongings in.
0:04:14.939,0:04:17.249
So it's a great idea, not only for the health of your home,
0:04:17.249,0:04:21.439
but for the integrity of your crawlspace itself to keep any type of moisture
0:04:21.439,0:04:22.819
Out.
0:04:22.819,0:04:27.159
