00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.380
 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.890
Now I'm making Pineapple pie!

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.719
it'll be great because I've already eaten it, actually

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.620
yeah, no I don't mean time travel, I
just

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.279
film this after way well whatever it
these are the pineapple chunks I made from

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.529
my cutting up a pineapple video. they
soaked

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.019
overnight with half a cup of sugar
per pineapple

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.300
and I drained them and added

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.660
3 apples cut up in another bowl

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
I'm putting half a cup of sugar and half
a cup of flour.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.870
do you wonder why... well that's because

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.090
all the pineapple juice that I saved
that from the pineapple

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.270
yeah it's all too gooey to put into a pie

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.320
It would mess up the pie crust, so I add the flour to this...

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.449
and cook it and thicken it up, that way I
save

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.050
all the good taste. In the meantime put some
nutmeg on the fruit.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.250
and also add a teaspoon of cinnamon to
the flour.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.850
kind of like a custard mixture now mix
it in with the fruit.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.070
I've made pie crust you can see my video
on that...

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.619
and I'm showing you how I rolled it out
and super super fast mode because

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.619
I really like this fast photography thatr my camera does.

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.240
It is really fun and there it is. Awesome!

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.610
I'm puttingthe pie filling into the pie crust

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.659
dotting it with butter...I guess I've got
probably

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.759
2 tablespoons of butter, I'm spreading there on top of the fruit.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.950
roll out the other pie crust

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.280
hmm the pie top I guess

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.740
as opposed to the pie bottom it looks
almost the same, doesn't it?

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.780
looks like it'll fit that's what I'm
doing seeing if it would fit.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.689
It fits perfectly

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.579
I mean how could it not... it's a circle and
its pie

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.649
fold the edges

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.420
over and then make your beautiful
decoration here's how I do it with

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.069
pinching with one hand in sticking a
finger in with the other

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.349
get about 30, 31 little

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.270
little picks there, and looks like lace
doesn't it...

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.230
beautiful!  making some air holes for the 
steam to come out while it cooks

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.560
fruit pies

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.670
have to cook about an hour, so to protect
the crust

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.099
at the edges I put a crust protector over it
and the temperature is up

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.660
really pretty high about 200 centigrade

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.080
400 farenheit. when you see that some
of the juice is bubbling through

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.610
and the crust looks brown after about an
hour

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.780
then it's done and there it is! Awesome!

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.569
It looks good! it's really hot right now
when I'm cutting it

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.750
So, it's kind of difficult to cut it but we
were

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.690
anxious to have some after dinner...
that's because we're kind of pigs...

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.739
I didn't say that.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.040
but, ooh, that was good... see the pineapple in there with the Apple

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.620
mmm and some of my homemade chocolate
ice cream you can see that video too.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.620
ooh, I could put links there couldn't I
what a good idea!

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.030
well that's so great, that was so tasty

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.180
mmmm..pineapple pie with apple. Awesome!

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.470
course could make it without apples...
and have just pineapple pie

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.640
mmm...good stuff! Awesome!
