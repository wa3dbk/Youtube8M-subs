00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.970
Now today, what we're going to do, is to look for that web [geo] cache there.

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:14.129
And we're mostly going to be using the web, the, Google maps on the web and we have the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.830
[Samsung Wave] 533 here, so we're going to be showing you DondeLite.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:23.320
And what I'm going to be doing, I'm going to show you a trick with this map,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.109
because this map is actually a web browser, and it has a cache, and if we don't cause

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.230
the map to be reloaded, then there is no data access.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.640
So you'll see we have no Sim card in here, we're currently on Wi-fi. What I'm going to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.829
do is turn off Wi-fi and we're going to use this map for most of the way, and then for

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.390
the last bit, use the compass... that's some sort of park or some sort of square. I don't

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.890
know yet, we'll find it. OK?

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.799
Turn off Wi-fi, now lets go find this.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:59.689
We're making progress, I don't quite have a GPS signal.

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:00.960
[WALKS]

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.960
As you can see,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:11.959
816 metres, it says, don't have a direction yet, oh, straight ahead. OK.

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:22.329
That's is very typical of this, it gets a GPS direction [signal], you walk a little,

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.700
then it knows which, which direction you're heading.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.189
As you can see we're still using the map, and we're still not on Wi-fi or data and we

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.019
don't even have a Sim Card in there.

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.310
Now we've turned off the map, no streets here, we're in some sort of park.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.310
Erm, and we're going to use this direction screen, and I can show you there's no data

00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:50.929
connection. Nope, turn on Wi-fi? no. And you can see there's

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.409
no map being pulled down. This is quite useful though, we can see our

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.909
relative position, relative to the waypoint, even on this screen.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.909
But we're going to use the direction screen. It wants us to walk, lets get the direction.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:36.159
150 metres, straight ahead somewhere.

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.620
[WALKING]

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.860
[SOUND OF WALKING]

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.270
[WALKING]

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.500
[SOUND OF WALKING]

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.500
Somewhere over here it says,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.379
115 metres

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.609
13, straight ahead.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.989
Notice the arrows turning flatter, as we get closer.

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.322
A little to the right, a little to the left sorry.

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:36.169
95 metres, 93... left... 80 metres.... 76

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.199
A little to the right

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:57.899
57, 55, somewhere in those trees

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:14.900
Erm, at this point, 25...

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.310
We're at the edge of where GPS accuracy starts to be a problem.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:26.469
So what we're going to do, lets have a look at where we are, not on the map, but we see

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.470
we're more or less pointing in the right direction. You'll see there's our position,

00:04:35.168 --> 00:04:40.279
you can't see that, and the yellow dot is our waypoint.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.279
Somewhere here.

00:04:58.728 --> 00:04:59.928
I'm going to go find it.

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.429
And there's a fairly easy one to find, a really huge cache.
