Porcupine Little Cakes Recipe by Heghineh

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Something sweet from my childhood : Little Cakes called porcupines :"перожные ежик", in Russian or "Ոզնի" in Armenian.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'd say these little cakes were quite popular back in 1970's -80's and these days are only a sweet childhood dessert reminders for many born in Armenia or Russia

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
These little cakes are really fun to make,plus so delicious in taste .

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
These can be made both : vanilla and chocolate flavors at the same time

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
by simply adding cocoa powder or melted chocolate to the cake batter.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I like making these with poppy seeds and lemon zest, tastes absolutely delicious !

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This recipe will be the classic version.
