00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.600
We're here in really one of the most outstanding schools in the country and the reason it's so

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.359
good is because an individual
headteacher took a grip of what was happening

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.289
here and concentrated on improving the quality of teaching.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.969
Now that meant some tough decisions:

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.189
it meant that some underperforming teachers had to move on, find another job, but it also

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.960
meant that space was cleared for some
amazing teachers who've helped really

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.980
improved the status of the profession

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.419
and improve the lives of the young
people who are here.

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.369
There have been lots of schools that have gone through that process

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.769
but there are lots of heads who say to me
that it's too difficult to move on

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.670
underperforming teachers, too bureaucratic,
sometimes too confrontational.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.660
Now it was always the case that the majority of teachers have also said to me that um... just one or two

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.720
underperforming teachers can make life
more difficult for everyone else in thestaffroom.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.390
So I felt it was write to shorten the procedure,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.400
to make it less confrontational, to make it more direct so that those teachers who

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.020
can improve with support and help uh... who, for whatever reason, have been underperforming

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.860
can be supported to improve

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.800
um... and then those teachers who do

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.730
need to be moved on, they can be moved on with a minimum of fuss and bother for

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.070
everyone so that we can then concentrate on children getting the best possible 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.010
teaching and the most out of their time in
school.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.300
When I came here the school was one of the
worst performing schools in the country

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.270
and had been for up to ten years.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.000
The local authority had attempted to use
various different

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.790
processes and strategies to improve the
performance of the school but nothing

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.049
had been sustainable.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.329
Children were being exposed to inadequate teaching on a day-to-day basis.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.090
So we had to start off being able to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.439
... for the head teacher to be able to lead and say

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.460
"My most important task is to improve
teaching. I'm going to show you

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.660
how to teach a good lessen everyday".

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.839
So we implemented a teaching rubric
that allows

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.450
and enables people who can step up to the
plate to be able to deliver

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.820
effective lessons.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.299
What the government is done today
is to remove some of the

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.839
complexities of the original
procedure.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.690
So I think the simplification allows
people,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.920
with their governing bodies and with their
human resources advisors, to be able to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.960
structure a much clearer and quicker process

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.990
that allows headteachers to believe that
they can

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.639
start the process and get through to the end

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:34.999
in what is not just a sympathetic but a
professional management of that inadequate teaching.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.879
When Amanda arrived, she made it very clear that teaching and learning was a priority

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.219
and that standards had to improve.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.959
She introduced a rubric
which we had to follow.

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.249
so any previous teaching strategies
were not to be used and we had to follow this clear format

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.629
based on less teacher talk but more
child participation,

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.229
where the teacher models and then the child practices. And you repeat that

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:07.629
and you're assessing throughout the whole lesson with the children being more

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.719
active participants and active leraners and that's what we really want.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.900
Because when the children are active and not
passive, they learn far more and you can

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.899
actually see progress throughout the whole lesson.
Nothing is more important

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:24.539
than the interaction between students
and teachers we knew from academic

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:29.879
studies that the quality of a teacher
can make an enormous amount of difference

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.869
to a child's progress.

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:33.669
Nothing matters more!

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.269
But we also know that there are some
teachers who are not adding value, who are

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.679
not inspiring, who for whatever reason
are not in the right profession

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.559
and we need to tackle that issue.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:50.319
Because the reputation of the teaching
profession overall is not enhanced if

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.169
we don't concentrate on making sure that we
continue to retain and recruit the very best.
