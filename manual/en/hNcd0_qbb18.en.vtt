00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.910
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, had a lot
of capillariessss!

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:14.460
Because #science!

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.240
Reindeer are inextricably tied to the Christmas
holiday in the United States.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.270
Santa and his eight reindeer shoot across
the sky like a comet delivering prezzies to

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.590
all the good little girls and boys, right?

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.920
Well, I don't want to be the donner party
at this show, but reindeer's noses aren't

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.600
red OR glowy -- except on the Island of Misfit
Toys, that place is cray.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.589
But, there is some truth to the Rudolph tale,
there's more red in their nose than in cupid's

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:38.589
arrows.

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.539
Rudolph was created in 1939 for a children's
book, but a certain species of reindeer, found

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.180
in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Russia and Scandinavia,
REALLY HAVE RED NOSES!

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.269
And now research from the journal BMJ explains
WHY!

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.989
Those saucy vixens have lots of blood vessels
in there!

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.859
Reindeer, on average, have a 25-percent high
concentration of blood vessels in their noses

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.179
[25% compared to what?].

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.390
Reindeer noses are exposed to the frigid air
of the arctic, and unlike a human dancer,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.780
or dasher who might jump around or run to
get warm -- reindeer need to conserve their

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.780
energy.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.759
This species of reindeer uses their nose to
help regulate internal temperatures and to

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.390
keep their nose from freezing when they're
rooting around in the frozen tundra looking

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.210
for a piece of scrub grass for food.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.509
They discovered this by examining the noses
of reindeer and human volunteers, and then

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.830
exercising the reindeer on treadmills.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.109
During exercise their noses and legs shed
lots of heat -- indicating their body was

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:36.460
using all these capillaries to cool themselves,
and, in reverse, to keep their nose warm as

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.460
well.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.570
But it's not just the noses of reindeer that
react to the cold, Prancer, oh no.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.829
Reindeer eyes change color as the temperature
falls.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.479
Research out of universities in England and
Norway looked at the eyes of arctic reindeer

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:57.439
and found the tapetum lucidum changes color
depending on the amount of daylight.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.920
The TL is the reflective layer behind the
retina that many animals have to see better

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.210
at night -- think cats or dogs when the camera
flash goes off.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.990
In the summer, the reindeer's TL is gold colored,
allowing for the MOST reflection when the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.860
light in the arctic is brightest.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.920
In the winter, when it's FAR darker, the TL
changes color to a deep-blue.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.890
This reflects less light out of the eye and
allows the reindeer to see better!

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.550
Scientists believe the color change comes
from the pressure within the eyeball itself.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.300
A properly drained and pressurized reindeer
eyeball is gold, but when darkness persists,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.610
the pupil dilates more.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.450
That perma-dilation increases the pressure
in the eyeball which keeps it from draining

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.450
properly.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.400
That presses on the collagen connecting the
TL to the back of the eyeball shifting the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.390
wavelengths reflected by the layer and it
turns a deep blue.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.290
That blue reflection also allows the reindeer
to see ultraviolet light, which humans cannot

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.660
see.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:09.200
That is extra valuable in the darkness of
the arctic winter.
