India's Magic Masala Crisps.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:10.340
Where chips for you America [xx] Taste the
blend of life and spice and Lay's Magic Masala

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.120
and feel your heart go duck, duck and be a
little deologocal.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.409
I don't know what that means.

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.939
This is the best poetic bag of chips I've
ever seen.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.899
Here we go guys, some advice for you at home
be a little diological, we don't know what

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.400
that means, these guys are very happy being
deologial.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.720
Indeed, here we you have two of the India's
top packers on the even that they are top

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.670
actors because I'm very unfamiliar of the
Indian movie industry but then we have one

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.400
dude that very much looks like he is absolutely
enjoying the crisps and then the other dude

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.490
who looks like he is pretty much asking the
director, "Hey, so you want me to hold the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.710
chip, like this? " [xx] let's take a test
shot.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.890
And then they just decided to go with that
shot for the advertising campaign.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.939
The little taste of India.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:23.939
Good like buddy, good luck you really envy
it.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.539
[xx] it's like a distinct [xx].

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:36.569
It tastes like curry put on a barbecued flavored
chip.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:45.439
This is really strong in terms of being basically
spicing and in terms of also having spices.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.439
Yeah.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.039
Very many spices, which I mean you know, typically
Indian food typically known for.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:02:03.280
They even show like the different spices they're
going to in the packet red, yellow and [xx]

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.420
green If I'm not mistaken this is chilli,
tumeric, coriander and a couple of the black

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.420
mustard seed.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.420
Could be wrong.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.170
You color recognition is pretty good [xx].

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.080
&nbsp;Although one thing I know is that this one
has [xx] as you can see.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080
Yeah.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.940
And the state usually ruffles up [xx].

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.030
That's true.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:39.950
[xx] I can taste [xx] I can taste the green
slightly [xx] and the black.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.230
new culture and education improved.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.470
Joe, I'm going to say for flavor I'll say
one per authenticity, for Indian replicas

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:58.390
[xx], I'll give it a 2, I think flavor I'll
give one thumb up, and for packaging and dudes

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:11.770
being deological in the back, I'll give two
thumbs up.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:20.890
I probably [xx], it's pretty bad.
