00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.840
H e l l o  !

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.900
In this video I would like to show how to reset ...

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.640
... the purge counter of any Brother MFC ...

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.340
( here a MFC-235C )

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.820
... if your machine asks for an (intensive) "cleaning"

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.600
First turn on your Brother as usual

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.080
Enter the maintenance mode ...

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.840
by pressing these buttons within 2 seconds ...

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.360
"Menu"   "*"   "2"   "8"   "6"   "4"

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.880
Let's do that now

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.200
All these four buttons are flashing now

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.080
Now enter "8" "0" into the numeric keyboard

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.400
We have activated the maintenance mode

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.940
Navigate through the menu with "Arrow Up" or "Down"

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.020
Your find different options to reset different counters

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.100
But we go for the "purge counter"

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:29.480
The purge counter tells you how often the printer performed an automatic purge, f.e. at power up

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.880
To reset that counter just enter  "2"  "7"  "8"  "3"

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.460
You hear some beep sounds approving the reset

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.340
The counter was resetted to zero

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.600
In that menu you can also adjust other printer options

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:17.640
You can also reset these counters by  "2"  "7"  "8"  "3"

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.600
To exit the maintenance mode press ...

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:38.920
...  "STOP" and "9"  "9"

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.020
Now the machine is back in normal mode !
