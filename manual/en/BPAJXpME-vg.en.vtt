It's that time again when we play that game
that we play once in a while where I ask you

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.560
guys on twitter to ask me questions, I look
at them for the first time while I'm filming,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.110
and I answer them! Joe Joe Yoh says, "If Lil
Sebastian was human, what actor would play

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.079
him in his biopic?" For those of you who don't
know, he's referring to the miniature horse

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:26.079
from Parks and Recreation. Um... I'm gonna
go ahead and say... Edward Snowden. Sydney

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.019
says, "If you could create your own girl band,
who would it be comprised of and what would

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.609
the band's name be?" I love this. Um, I cannot
tell you why, but Marcia Brady is the first

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:44.519
one who came to mind, so she's in the lineup.
Um, then we're gonna have to throw to Claire

00:00:44.519 --> 00:01:02.299
Huxtable. Um, Mrs. Camden, Michelle Obama,
and... um, me. We would be called Moms &amp; Co.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.500
I guess the three moms are the moms and Marcia
and I are the co. Rachel says, "Favorite fiveawesomegirls

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.299
memory? Or best YouTube memory in general?"
My favorite fiveawesomegirls memory is definitely

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.399
Lauren's rap, which still gets stuck in my
head to this day. "I really suck at rapping!

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:26.399
Please don't hate me 'cause I'm rapping."
And my favorite YouTube memory is actually

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.829
a Twitter memory, but my Twitter's related
to my YouTube so it counts. I once tweeted,

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.500
"The watched cheese never grills," which is
borderline nonsense, and then someone showed

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.170
me that that quote is written on the wall
at a grilled cheese restaurant. I don't know!

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.259
I have never felt so famous and I will never
feel that famous again. Katie asks, "If a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.039
movie were made about your life, who would
they cast as you?" Edward Snowden. Jenna asks,

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.770
"My friends who are in their mid twenties
say being an adult sucks. Is it worse than

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.939
being a stressed out university student?"
I'm gonna go ahead and give a nonconventional

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:10.090
answer. I love being an adult. You get more
respect, you can get away with saying things

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.069
like "nonconventional" when you forget that
"unconventional" is a word. The future can

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.500
be bright, kids. You and your perfect eyebrows
just cheer up, alright? Mary says, 'Did you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.930
really mean it that time you said my friend's
yogurt comment was perfect? We still talk

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.440
about that." I have no idea what yogurt comment
you're talking about, but I'm sure I stand

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.390
by what I said at the time, and you should
really take it from me. As someone who is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.870
very important in the world of grilled cheese,
I'm also an authority on yogurt comments.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:51.070
Katie says, "KITTY." Correct. That is an accurate
statement. Dylan says, 'Fave song on 1989?"

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.690
It's kind of like making me choose between
my vital organs, but I'm gonna go with New

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.690
Romantics. Baby we're the new romantics, come
and come along with me. Lucy P says, "RANK

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.000
THE TWILIGHT MOVIES!" Breaking Dawn Part 1,
Breaking Dawn Part 2, Twilight, Eclipse, New

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.200
Moon. I think that's gonna do us for today.
As always, if you have questions for me that

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.269
you want to maybe get featured in a video
whenever I happen to make a video like this,

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.790
leave them in the comments for me. Or send
me a tweet! Okay. How do people end videos?

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.229
Let's end a video. Bye, guys. Ugh, what is
this?
