00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.529
let us study the magnification for refraction
at spherical surfaces.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.849
here say if we are given with a spherical
surface with its optic axis and the centre

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:20.840
of curvature. and say an object is placed
at a distance u from, the pole of this medium

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.840
boundary.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.360
we consider, the object side medium as medium-1
with refractive index mu-1 and, image side

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.350
medium, as medium-2. with refractive index
mu-2. more precisely we should write mu-1

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.760
is the side where incident ray exist and mu-2
is the side.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.980
where refracted ray will exist.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.910
now in this situation.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.909
to locate the image of this object.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.289
which is placed over here and say h-o is the.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:58.969
object height.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.379
above optic axis. then in this situation.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.930
for this object if we wish to locate the image
image location can be obtained by using refraction

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.320
formula.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.159
using refraction formula in this situation
we can write mu-2 by v minus mu-1 by u. is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.031
equal to mu-2 minus mu-1 by r. and solving
this we’ll get the value of v. say this

00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:30.659
is the point where image is obtained.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.740
then obviously image will be obtained on the
other side only when.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.430
image is real. and for real object when a
real image is obtained it must always be on

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.619
the other side of optic axis or it is inverted.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.509
so here say this is the point where image
is obtained at a height h-i. which is located

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.939
at a distance v. so in this situation here
we define.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.539
magnification, produce due to, refraction
at spherical surface, m, and the value of

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:10.420
m here is given as magnitude of mu-1 v upon
mu-2 u. you can recall that in case of.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.209
reflection by spherical mirror is the value
of magnification was given as v by u. so here

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.800
we write it mu-1 v by mu-2 u and i am taking
modulus because i don’t need the sign of

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.030
magnification. as here we are.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.190
obtaining the orientation of image by using
the nature of object and image.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.510
which we already studied, whenever for a real
object, a real image is produced it is inverted

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.310
and if virtual image is produced it is always
erected.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.150
so in this situation the magnification can
be further written as.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.040
height of, image.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.430
above optic axis. divided by.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.830
height of object.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.140
above optic axis this is the way how magnification
is define so in this situation height of image

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.489
we can write.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.840
m times the height of object this is the way
how magnification is used in various problems.
