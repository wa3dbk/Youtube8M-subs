Hi! This is Roger Hicks for Expert Village
and today we're going to be talking about

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:14.269
the Musty Lite Rider. This is actually a pretty
snazzy stroller. Kind of comparable to the

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:22.600
Stokke Xplory to a certain degree. If you
notice, this particular stroller, it comes

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.390
with a bassinet and it comes with the older
kids seat, which I will show you. If you notice,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.510
the bassinet is nice and high. You don't have
to do a lot of bending over to reach your

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.309
kid. It makes it a lot easier for you to interact
with your baby. That's what I meant by sort

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.510
of somewhat like the Stokke Xplory. Nice height
adjustable handle, which makes it very easy

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.739
to adjust for your comfort. Bassinet comes
with the canopy. You can pop this unit out

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:05.070
of the base. Simply popping there, picking
up, set it to the side. You use your bassinet

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.920
for like 3 months, 4 months max. I'll show
you real quick how this folds without the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.619
seat on. What's nice about this particular
stroller, it will fold with the bassinet seat

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.890
on there, and it will fold with the toddler
kids seat. Unlike a lot of strollers that

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.420
look like the Musty, none of them fold with
both seats. They have a step on the competition

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.590
by doing something like that. Open basket,
not the largest, but it's better than nothing.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.399
It is open so it makes it a little easier
to get to. To fold the stroller, I'll simply

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.189
show you like this because there's nothing
on it, then I'll show you the other way. You

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:50.240
just pull up and push in and it simply drops.
It locks automatically and this is basically

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.969
your aluminum frame, very lightweight. There
is a release lever over here you pull up,

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:03.420
pick up on it, opens to stroller. I'll raise
the handle up, now I'll show you the older

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:13.900
kids seat, which is here. You can go ahead
and put this on like so, lock it down and

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.540
there you go.
