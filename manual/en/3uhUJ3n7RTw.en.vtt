00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.200
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.260
Hi, welcome to this edition

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.460
of the Daily Spin. I'm Steve, the owner of inlineskates.com

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.600
and with me is Steve Charrier, the president of Rollerblade. Thanks for joining us today, Steve.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.690
Thank you for having me.
So, we're going to talk about the Bladerunner, the Rollerblade

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.770
Bladerunner...that was hard for me to say. The Rollerblade Bladerunner

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.990
Pro 80. You've got the men's version, I've got the women's version but other than it's pretty much the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.050
same skate, correct?
It is.
So, this is sort of the beginner model

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.110
in the Rollerblade line. This is the first price and...
Entry price-point adult skate.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.170
Yep. So, pretty basic skate but can you go through the features with us?

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.400
Yeah. Well, first of all, it's a supportive skate, Steve. 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.500
It's got a cuff here with a buckle at the top for closure. It has a Velcro closure

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.900
across here to hold you back in the skate to keep you secure. It has

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.080
a lace system here to secure the front of the skate.
And that's really the key to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.140
a first time skater is having really good support, right? So, that's why you use three different systems to do that.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.200
Keep you locked down in the skate.
As oppose to just a lace or something like that.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.400
The wheels and bearings are important on a skate. Tell us about those.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.500
Well this has a 80mm wheel and an ABEC 5 bearing...
So, that's a pretty

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.700
good wheel and bearing for a beginner skate.
Yeah, it's going to roll nicely for someone who's getting started. It's a great

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.870
skate to learn how to skate on. We find we sell this 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.040
to a lot of younger kids with big feet as well.
It comes with a brake for stopping,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.130
correct?
On the right skate only.
Okay. So, who would be the ideal

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.240
customer for one of these skates?
It's ideal for kids that 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.410
have outgrown the kid's skates or for adults that are just going to skate occasionally.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.560
Like they're going to go out and skate with the kids in the yard or something like that.
Exactly. Good beginner skate.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.680
Yep. Great. All right, so there you have it: 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.850
the Bladerunner Pro 80 men's and women's. Thanks for joining us on this edition of the Daily Spin.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.970
 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.034
