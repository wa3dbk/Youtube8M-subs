00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:13.440
- Hi, this is Jay P. Morgan. Today on The

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.500
Slanted Lens Product Review, we're going
to talk about Spider holsters

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.250
single-camera belt system. I've used this
for now over a year and a half. I love

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.140
this system. It's great, because on the
bottom of your camera, you've got a great

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.900
plate. It screws onto the camera, that pin
allows you to just simply drop this into

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.930
the groove. It falls with the lens away
from you, so the camera's sticking out,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.040
lens is back, just a very convenient place
to get it. It's easy to pull it up to go

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.920
into shoot mode, drop it right back down
when you don't need it any longer. It does

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.810
have a clip here, you can push that clip
down, so that it won't come out and it's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.740
locked into place or if you're going to be
going in and out, in and out, you can

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.860
click it up like this, which allows it to
come in and out, quickly. Or when you push

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.630
it all the way down, now all you have to
do is push it down, pull it up like that,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.280
and it lets it come out, but it locks back
into place when it comes up. So just an

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.580
easy system to go in and out. I usually
use it in this mode here, where I'm

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.940
locked, then I just kind of push it up, as
I pull it out, but then I know it's locked

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.710
back into place when I go and I don't have
to worry about it coming back out.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.040
On the belt also, I have a 200 millimeter
pouch, which is a really great system.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.530
It's got a rain cover for it. You can
detach the rain cover, if you're not going

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.460
to be using it, and just let it sit with
the velcro in the back and rolling it up

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.690
and getting it out of the way, or you can
completely take it off if you want to just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.080
get it out of your way, and I'm going to
just set it aside for just right now. In

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.660
this system, I love it, you've got a zip
pocket, that allows it to expose your 200

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.890
millimeter lens, there's a lens cap that
has a velcro piece on it, so that you can

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.290
take your lens cap on and off and you
don't lose it, then you can just leave

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.840
that, fall to the side. Now what I do is I
just flip the camera up like this, so that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.250
my camera is up. It makes it easy for me
to take this lens off, pull this lens out,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:04.880
drop this one in, and then I simply drop
this one on top, flip it back around, and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.510
I'm ready to go with the 200 millimeter
lens. I can now cap this back off here,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.170
zip it up, then I can go back to shooting,
now with my 200 millimeter lens.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.410
You get faster at making that change after
you use this quite a bit, but it just

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.120
gives you a decent place so your lens is
not getting, you don't have to sit it down

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.820
on the ground and search for it. The cap
is always there because it's on the velcro

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.420
It just makes it easy to switch this back
and forth. So I find this a very

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.450
successful system for using and I think
it's something you'd really enjoy using if

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.190
you're doing weddings and things, this is
a great piece of equipment, because you

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.770
can have a single or a double camera
setup, so you can go back and forth with

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.050
two different lenses on your hip, you
don't have them banging around, I mean

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.620
obviously, they're at your hip and you've
got to watch them as you hit on things,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.920
but it's not as kind of cumbersome as on
straps, as they kind of fly around as you

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.640
move them. I find this really nice,
they're contained, they're held tight to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.510
your body and I just know where they're
at, it's much easier to use. So check it

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.440
out, it's called the Spider holster pro
belt system. It's got a little thing

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.540
called the Spider Monkey also that it has
on the side of both the pouch and I've got

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.330
a couple on my belt here, but those are so
you can put a piece of equipment, a piece

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.640
of velcro goes on your equipment, it just
snaps on there, you can use it for light

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.790
meters, or you can use it for a small
flash, just a great to haul just a few

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.590
extra things on your belt, take it on and
off using that Spider Monkey system.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.830
This has been Jay P. Morgan for The
Slanted Lens Product Review, so keep those

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.426
