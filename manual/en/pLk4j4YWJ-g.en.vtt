00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.600
Here!

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:19.276
Run.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.425
Move!

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.200
There's no way.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.600
Make one.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.600
How long do we have?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.204
Less than a minute.

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:21.077
Give me your crossbow.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.480
You can't kill them all.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.055
It's not for them.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.020
It's not for them.

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:34.452
What about you?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Don't let them take you alive.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.091
No, wait!

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.400
So what now?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
What do you mean?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.600
What are you going to do?
18
00:03:22,100 --&gt; 00:03:22,000
Same. Survive.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
You don't have a plan?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.464
Do you?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.950
I want to head out west.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
They say that's where it started.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.360
The black center.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.500
Center of what? 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.500
The thing. That ended everything.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.800
Do you think we can bring it all back?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.600
Do you think it will change anything?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.174
No.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.100
But I want to know.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.400
Before I die, I want to know what happened.

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.400
Don't you?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.100
It's the last thing I want to know.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
How can you say that?

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.600
What if the cause of it, what if it was us?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.500
What if humanity is just a time bomb ...

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.100
and we got what we deserved?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.100
If you really believe that...

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.800
How come you've lasted this long?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.100
West.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.100
