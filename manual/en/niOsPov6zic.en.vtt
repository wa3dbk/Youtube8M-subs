00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.410
Hi.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.980
Let us rationalize the
denominator in the given

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.460
radical expression.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.150
To rationalize the denominator
is to rewrite the radical

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.350
expression as an equivalent
expression in which the

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.210
denominator no longer contains
any radicals.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.650
So in the given problem, to
remove the radical from the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.520
denominator, we have to see what
we need to multiply the

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.430
denominator by.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.890
Obviously, the index is 3,
and so we multiply by

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.140
another cube root.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.120
We want to figure out what would
be the radicand here.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.150
When we combine these two
radicals, we need to get a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.890
perfect cube in the radicand
of the denominator.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.350
Right now, we have 4y.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.160
Now, 4y can be written
as 2 times 2 times y.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.340
To get the radicand as a perfect
cube, we need one more

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.120
2 and two more ys.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.250
So we take one more
2 and two more ys.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.010
Now, in order to keep the given
expression just the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.140
same, what we do to the
denominator we should do to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.460
the numerator also.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.370
So we multiply the numerator
also by that cube root, 2

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.220
times y times y.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:03.640
That now becomes cube root of
x squared times 2y squared

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.180
divided by the cube root of--

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:19.490
4 times 2 is 8, and y times y
times y would be y cubed.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.060
So the given radical
expression is

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.960
now seen this way.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.740
Let us try to simplify
that further.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.080
Consider the denominator.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.700
It is cube root of 8 times y
cubed, which can be cube root

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.680
of 8 times the cube
root of y cubed.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.590
And we know 8 is a perfect cube
of 2, so cube root of 2

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.060
cubed would give
just 2 outside.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:10.120
And same way, cube root of y
cubed will become just y.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.270
And on the numerator,
we have cube root of

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.980
2x squared, y squared.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.180
Now, 2 is prime.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.000
It's not a perfect cube.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.810
X squared is not a perfect
cube, and the power 2

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.050
is less than 3.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.310
Y squared is not a perfect
cube, and the power 2

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.020
is less than 3.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.490
So we cannot do anything
beyond just

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.370
keeping it as it is.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.370
So the numerator just stays as
cube root of 2x squared, y

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.630
squared, whereas the
denominator is 2y.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.860
We have taken the radical aways
in the denominator, so

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.400
we have rationalized the
denominator of the given

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.650
radical expression.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.020
I hope this helps.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.270
Thank you.
