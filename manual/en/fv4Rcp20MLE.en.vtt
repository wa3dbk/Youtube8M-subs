00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.689
I'm Master Luca Zama

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:15.992
I'm going to show you a new Muay Thai technique I created. 

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:21.218
I've already demonstrated it to Master Mario Zanotti...

00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:23.506
...who will require the Federation's approval for it.

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:27.126
This IS NOT A MAWASHI GERI or a
 SNAP KICK but a double shin kick...

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.680
...where we don't put down our foot between  the first and second strike.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:36.252
This is a shin kick, but we aren't going to 
 put down our foot in order to kick again.

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:42.051
We are used to shin kick,
put out foot down...

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.006
...and kick again with the same leg.

00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:52.040
As I do it, instead,
after the first shin kick the leg stays up...

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:54.239
...in order to kick again...

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.752
...so after my opponent parries my first kick... 

00:00:57.752 --> 00:01:03.233
...he lowers his guard so the second shin kick hits the target.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:09.987
Today is September 23rd, this kicking technique...

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.696
...will be introduced to the Federation next Sunday, September 26th...

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:22.582
...by Master Mario Zanotti, who's working with me to promote this new technique.

00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:30.402
As I said it's a double shin kick with no 
 putting down the foot between the two kicks.

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:34.102
We are used to a sequence of shin kick -- support -- shin kick...

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.208
...but in this new kind of kick the sequence will be...

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.030
...just shin-kick -- shin-kick. No putting down the foot,

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:47.820
so naturally the opponent parries the first kick...

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.230
...but then then he must put down his foot;

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:56.830
this is a very effective technique to hit the opponent on the rebound.

00:01:56.831 --> 00:02:03.010
So the double kick is going to be a sequence of...

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.230
...shin-kick -- shin-kick again 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.810
...and not as before shin-kick - (support foot) -- shin kick.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:18.760
In short a double kick without putting our foot down mid-action.
