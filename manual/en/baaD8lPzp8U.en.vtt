00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.480
You will now get a red card

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.240
and you'll now serve two hours of detention and a day of Saturday school.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440
Paper planes in class?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.700

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.120
and very sassy.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.760
Go to the principal's office.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.300

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.440
Scotty and Kelly were rude, disrespectful, and sassy.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.620
OMG

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.280
Don't tell him about the bad words.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.120
Oh yeah.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.160
He called me a sneak dude and threw a plane in class.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.580
How disapointing.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.460
I shouldn't have to see you in my office multiple times.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.620
I'll get the other secretary.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.520
Yes Ericson.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.100
Scotty and Kelly are in my office.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.220
I need you to talk to them.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.460
Well guess what?

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.480
I know what it is.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.580
I know exactly what they did.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.880
I will definitely talk to them right now.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.920
Scotty and Kelly,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.300
I am very furious at you.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.260
Mr Ericson told me everything.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.420
He said you threw planes in class,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.800

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.640
and etc.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.760
He also told me this is the tenth time you're late

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.980
One more mishap and you're in here.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.160
You're already in here. Let's discuss consequences.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.900
Two hours of detention,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.940
Saturday school, and you are here by suspended for four days.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.840
*barks

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.360
I'll talk to your parents now.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.820
Steven, I'm very sorry to interrupt your week off,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.140
but your brother and sister are in my office.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.320
I need you and your parents to come

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.120
because they have Saturday school

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.660
suspended for four days,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.320
and two hours of detention

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.820
Your parents and brother are going to be here any minute,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.740
So prepare to get used to yelling

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.740
Scotty, Kelly, what the heck is wrong with you.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.540
Lets talk about there behavior

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.160
As you know, Scotty and Kelly have been misbehaving today.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.620
They threw planes in class,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.560
talked non-stop today,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.580
and said bad words.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.400
I think they should apologize to the entire school

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.220
That would be great. Report all of the students to the gym.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.860
(DFW Skylink tone plays)

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.600
Attention all staff and students,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.820
We need all of you to report to the gym immediately.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.720
Ladies and gentlemen, as you can tell, I'm very angry

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.120
But Scotty and Kelly would like to apologize for their rude behavior

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.900
Go up there Scotty and Kelly.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.100
We're too scared.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.900
Go

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.900
Hello everyone,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.860
I would like to say we are extremely sorry to everyone here today.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.160
We have disrespected our friends, teachers, and principal,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.620
We will be punished for our actions. We're sorry.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.620
(crowd laughs)

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.280
(crowd laughs) (Caleb laughs) What a loser.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.500
Scotty and Kelly,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.900
I can't believe you got suspended.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.760
Your grounded, grounded, grounded until your suspension has ended

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.440
Go to your room now.
