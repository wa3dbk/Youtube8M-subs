-Hi, I??m Jenna Helwig, personal chef and
Parents contributor. I??m

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.460
going to show you how to make a cake that
looks as good as it tastes. The secret is

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.309
all
in the prep. The first thing you wanna do

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.240
is
make your cake layer level. You??ll notice

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.440
when you bake
the cake, it domes. So, I??m going to use

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.320
a
serrated knife and just slice through the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.569
cake to make
it as flat as I can. Now, do not throw

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.319
away these cake tops because they are delicious.
Freeze them.

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.460
Save them for later. You can use them for
trifle

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030
or put them over ice cream. Everyone will
love them.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.090
So now, I??m going to put this on to my
cake plate and I??m going to level the second

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.149
one.
The first thing we??re going to do to start

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.040
frosting
our cake is to use some regular frosting and

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.261
make
our filling. Just get a nice layer where you

00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.989
can
always add more. So now, I??m going to put

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.861
this
layer on top of this cake. Now, here??s a

00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:03.030
little
trick. Very carefully flip it over and put

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.780
what was
the bottom of the cake on top. That will make

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.760
your cake perfectly flat. And so what yu wanna
do

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.580
is take a pastry brush, or a paper towel,
or

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.970
your fingers and just brush off any crumbs.
And then

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.980
if you have time, pop it in the freezer for
about 15 minutes. So, this next step is the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.610
most
important. It is called the crumb coat, and

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.370
the crumb
coat is not meant to look pretty, but what

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.900
it
does is it will trap any wayward crumbs so

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.960
they
don??t get into your beautiful layer of frosting

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.380
that you??ll
put on later. I??ve got some frosting here

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.120
that I
thinned out with a little bit of water. I??m

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.540
just
gonna pour some on and make a thin layer over

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:52.930
the entire cake. Great. There you have a messy
yet

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.250
crumb coated cake. So now, you??re ready to
put the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.530
cake into the fridge or freezer for about
15 minutes.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.450
It will firm up some more and you can put
on your regular frosting.
