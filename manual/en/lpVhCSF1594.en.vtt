Lets run a Surface Scan on a drive to see

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:05.399
if there's any bad blocks on there.\
\

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.820
Bad blocks are areas of the media, that cannot
reliably store data. A surface scan reads

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.309
data from every block on a drive, and identifies
any bad blocks that may effect the integrity

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.110
of your data. \
\

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.200
Bad blocks aren't uncommon, however, they
are mapped out by drive manufacturers before

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.249
leaving the plant, so that no data can be
stored on that defective area of a drive.\

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.449
\
Blocks can occasionally go bad, and if those

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.200
blocks are holding your data, such as an important
file, that data may be corrupted. \

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.161
\
So its important to identify bad blocks to

00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:39.610
see if any data is residing there, so you
can restore those files later, with valid

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.090
copies from a backup.\
\

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.030
Here, we'll run a Surface Scan on this 1 TB
drive.\

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.020
\
To run a Surface Scan, select the Surface

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.990
Scan test here,\
-then choose the device you want to test,\

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.100
--then click Run Surface Scan here.\
\

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.260
While this Scan is running, \
-you can see the total number of blocks on

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.760
the drive, \
--the number of blocks processed, \

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.400
---and the estimated time to complete this
test. \

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.000
\
You can always cancel your scan at any time,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
by clicking here.\
\

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.440
Ok, we're picking the scan back up now since
its almost completed.\

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.460
\
The scan to check almost 2 billions blocks

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.490
on this 1 TB device, took over 6 hours. And
don't worry, you can operate your Mac while

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550
running a surface scan.\
\

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.390
In this case, no bad blocks were identified.\
\

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.210
If bad blocks had been found, the blocks and
names of files written there would be indicated

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.710
here, and you would want to restore valid
copies of any files listed.\

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.409
\
If you run a Surface Scan multiple times and

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.940
continue to find new bad blocks, that would
identify a failing drive, which should be

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.940
replaced. \
\

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.010
Your drives controller would normally map
out bad blocks as they are encountered, however

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.520
there are various reasons why they may not
be. \

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.890
\
To map out bad blocks yourself, first back

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.259
up your data, then reinitialize your drive
with Apple's Disk Utility.\

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.860
\
Remember, to prevent losing data due to bad

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.450
blocks or for any other reason, make sure
your drive is backed up frequently. \

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.460
\
Thanks for viewing, I hope this video was

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.109
informative for you.}
