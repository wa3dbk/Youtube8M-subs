Dustin: What's up fish tank people? Fishtanktv.com
Dustin's Fish Tanks bringing it to you from

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.830
Steve's house. Going to talk to you about
Steve's fish tank. Excited to show us his

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.940
tank. Excited to be making videos again because
I felt like complete death for like 4 days.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.179
Both daughters got sick, mama got sick, cleaning
up puke. Getting sick myself missing a couple

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.249
days of work. Awful, awful, awful. Wash your
hands. If you got kids, wash their hands before

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:27.149
you feed them. It's nasty. Anyway lets talk
about some tanks. Have to say what's up Steve

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:27.279
dude.

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.789
Steve: Man I hope you left that funk at home.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.160
Dustin: I got the funk, I'll bring the funk
to your house baby. The 55, say goodbye to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.840
the 55. Oh man, the people are going to be
so pissed. It's a sad day dude. He called

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.670
me the other day, had this sad tone in his
voice like dude, I got a plan. I thought he

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.589
was going to move to like Zimbabwe or something.
I didn't know where you were going with that

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.469
conversation. He was like "I got a plan" I
was like oh no, something big. Then he was

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.300
like "I'm tearing down the 55" Which was just
as painful for me to hear. He's telling me

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.460
to zoom in. I'll zoom in brother. So here's
what's up man. Saying good-bye to the 55.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.070
how long you had this thing on man.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.040
Steve: Years ... Years

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.470
Dustin: Got it when you moved in?

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.360
Steve: Yeah it's been about 3 years

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.580
Dustin: About 3 years.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.950
Steve: Maybe 2 years

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.890
Dustin: Lets just go ahead and do it though.
You got your Crypts, they are just balling

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.170
over there, those Crypts over there. And then
you got Ludblu Cortinalis, which is just awesome.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.520
And then the Anubius all up in the mix.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.600
Steve: Java Fern

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.030
Dustin: Java Fern. Vendelov. Then you got
the Rotella that I always get beautiful cuttings

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.030
of. Anubius: same deal. A bunch of beautiful
rainbows. Many give me your theory. I know

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.910
you read some articles about it, it's just
a change thing. Tell us why are you tearing

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.580
this tank down, what's your theory about taking
tanks down, and we'll talk about what's going

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.530
on next.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.100
Steve: Well honestly my theory about tearing
this tank down is because I really want to

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.390
play in the Discus tank and it's not big enough.
I'm upgrading, going with the 72 bowfront.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.960
You know it's also good to switch it up every
now and again. You know its been going for

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.030
a few years, its time for a change. When I
first got this tank, it was all about the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.650
big piece of drift wood so covered with Anubius
now that you can hardly tell that its there.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.420
But you know it was time for a change. Switch
it up, keep it interesting. Get something

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.410
else pretty going on in my house and have
more fun figuring out how to plant it.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.060
Dustin: People hate when I cut you off, so
I'm just going to not talk.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.600
Steve: That's all I got for it.
Dustin: That's all you got? Alright. Yeah

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.890
dude so the driftwood I have to talk about
it because I straight up had it in my pond,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.140
you can't even see it now. I didn't think
you could pull it off. It just really pops,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.260
it really works. It was in a 55 and it's just
a real big piece. When this is ripped out,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.870
I don't know if you are going to use it again
but I would like to show that piece at some

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.160
point. We will get a video of it. That's a
Bryan Campbell special. Yeah man the rainbows

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.160
have been good to you. He's got this beautiful
sucker right here. Oh man she's gorgeous,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.490
just beautiful fish. You got to love it. We
are probably, we were wanting to put this

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.480
tank out in the green house. Oh by the way
people are like rest in piece Steve's Ludwigia.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.610
Messed up orders, they were pissed. They were
like you said you weren't going to touch it

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.380
dude. Someone needed some Ludwigia. It will
grow back, it will be fine you all. So yeah,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.590
tearing it down going to the 72 bowfront we
decided. A lot of good stuff going on in this

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.290
tank man. A lot of fish in there.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.380
Steve: Thing about tanks, tanks never stay
the same and all tanks just get so over grown

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.180
that you are tired of hacking stuff, sometimes
its better to just start off fresh. Amano

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.349
wrote an article about that and sometimes
you just get tired of trimming

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.670
Dustin: Tired of trimming

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.819
Steve: Just have to start from scratch, clear
the palette.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.819
Dustin: Clearing the canvas here. This is
the last video. Moment of silence for the

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.910
55. That's it folks. Quick update a lot of
people have been doing a lot of signing up

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.500
for the newsletter I got over at Aquatic Jungles.
I've been going through all my old video,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.010
putting in comments, and looping them on there
so you definitely want to check that out,

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.919
a lot of good advice. Going through old videos,
pulling out old times. As well as some stuff

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.809
that you guys have been telling me. Its really
good stuff there: go to aquatic jungle, download

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:29.110
the top 10 tank tips to your left. People
have been giving me some good feedback on

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.379
that so I want to totally plug that. And again
was your hands folks this flu is fowl. So

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.969
that's what's up! Steve is bringing the discus
down and we're excited. Later
