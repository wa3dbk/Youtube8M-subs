00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.160
Beautiful but doomed: the Nokia N9.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.039
The Nokia N9 makes us sad. Not because it
isn't a good handset, because everything that

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.439
we have seen about it indicates that the N9
is very good indeed, but because the N9 is

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.430
essentially doomed.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.590
The main problem is that the N9 runs MeeGo,
a comparatively new operating system that

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.300
has essentially been dumped by Nokia in favour
of Windows Mobile. A cut in both funding and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.730
personnel for Nokia's MeeGo division means
that there will be very little resources - if

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.780
any - dedicate to future MeeGo handsets. And
that means that the N9 could be both Nokia's

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.719
first and last MeeGo devices

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.019
This handset has been stuck in a sort of development
hell that makes clear some of the truly awful

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.710
business decisions that Nokia has made in
the past. Consider this - the N9 is the follow

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.750
up to the N900, but it has taken nearly two
years for Nokia to come up with it.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.030
The N900 was launched at a point just before
Android devices started to take off in a really

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.039
big way, but Nokia made the mistake of hinting
that there was a better device around the

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.509
corner. There wasn't, but some possible early
adopters of the N900 chose to wait and this

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.130
damaged sales. Not that there was much wrong
with the N900 - running version 5 of the Maemo

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.619
operating system, the N900 was certainly a
step forward and a pretty competitive device.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:44.469
A few months after the N900 started shipping,
the annual Mobile World Congress event came

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.609
up. There was a lot of speculation that the
next Maemo powered device would be announced

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.880
during MWC. Indeed, there was an announcement
about Maemo - but not the announcement that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.759
people were expecting. Instead of showing
how Maemo would be going forward, Nokia effectively

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.850
killed it by announcing that they were merging
Maemo with Intel's Moblin platform to come

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.179
up with a new operating system called MeeGo.

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:16.690
In retrospect, MeeGo was a complete disaster
for Nokia. Just at the point that their Maemo

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.450
line was beginning to show promise, the whole
line was killed and Nokia basically went back

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.670
to square one. In effect, Nokia withdrew from
the high-end smartphone market and left the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.170
N900 to wither and die. Nokia's attempts to
reposition Symbian devices such as the E7

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.140
as iPhone and Android competitors were not
successful, and Nokia's market share started

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.340
to collapse.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.000
Back in 2009 it was just possible for a non-Android
non-Apple operating system like Maemo to make

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.260
an impact. In 2011, the world really doesn't
need another mobile phone OS and MeeGo is

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.340
just another such OS which will have to fight
it out for the scraps along with Windows Phone

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.510
7, BlackBerry, Samsung's Bada and HP's WebOS
platforms. As as result, it wasn't surprising

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.120
when Nokia's new CEO, Stephen Elop, announced
a shift to Windows as a last-ditch attempt

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.430
to find a viable long-term platform for Nokia's
smartphones.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.290
Presumably the N9 was too far along in development
to be cancelled, so Nokia finally got around

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.430
to announcing it in mid 2011. Although this
is the most powerful device ever to come out

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.600
of Nokia, the specification seems to be more
2010 than 2011 and it is likely that it will

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.480
be even more dated by the time that it ships.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.280
By the time the N9 actually does hit the shops,
there is a good chance that Nokia will have

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.860
announced its first Windows Mobile handsets.
This will only serve to underline the fact

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.170
that MeeGo is a dead-end platform and we can't
imagine that it will help sales at all.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.680
The Nokia N9 is certainly a powerful, beautiful
and esoteric device. It's the sort of thing

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.090
that you might buy if you own an esoteric
and rare car such as a Renault Avantime, but

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.870
like the Avantime we suspect that the N9 will
only sell in very small numbers and won't

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.910
be really appreciated until some time after
Nokia have stopped making it.
