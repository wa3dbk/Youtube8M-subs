Alright, so after your long hard surf lesson,
you want to make sure your boards stay nice

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.191
and protected so you can buy a surf bag at
your local surf store. What you do is you

00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:17.619
just slide your bag in in your car like that,
pull your board bag up, slide it in. The zipper

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.189
is broken. An FCS doesn't make a really good
board bag. It kind of gets caroded. The zipper

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.140
is broken. Once again, you have your board
protected. These are great when you're flying.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.449
You take your 6-0 board and put it right back
in your car just like that, and then it's

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.620
safe and sound. Then when it comes to your
9-6 long board you're going to need another

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.550
bag. Here you are with your one giant long
board bag. You're going to take it like this,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:56.360
lay on the street,
grab your long board. Preferably thrown in

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:07.530
your bag like that. Wrap up the lease. These
bags cost about 60-100 bucks. I'm just going

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:31.250
to take it and zip it. Push the fin through
just like that, grab it, and secure it to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.479
your roof rack. Always put your fin forward
in case the wind pushes your board off, the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:53.039
fin will catch it.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.070
Board bags keep your board from getting dinged,
from turning yellow, from birds pooping on

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.500
them. That's your roof rack with your board
safely secure. I hope you guys had a great

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.190
day today while you're visiting us in Malibu,
California in county line beach. As you can

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.480
see, Sean is now a hooked surfer, so he'll
be back many times to come surfing. Thanks

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.069
for tuning. I'm Howard Lefstein and this is
