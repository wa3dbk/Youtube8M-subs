00:00:02.437 --> 00:00:05.094
You think we crashed on 
 this place by coincidence?

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:09.225
Each one of us was 
 brought here for a reason.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.297
And who brought us here John?

00:00:11.827 --> 00:00:12.747
The Island.

00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:17.102
I've looked into the eye of this island 
 and what I saw....

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:23.032
was beautiful.

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:26.184
Why do you find it so hard to believe? 
 - Why do you find it so easy?

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:27.787
It's never been easy!

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.971
Despite you loyal service to this island....

00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:34.151
you had to watch your own daughter gunned down 
 right in front of you.

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:36.451
And your reward? 
 You were banished.

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:40.690
And you did all this in the name 
 of a man you never even met.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.722
A man named Jacob.

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:45.412
I'm gonna go and see Jacob.

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:55.744
You have any idea how badly i wanna kill you?

00:00:56.304 --> 00:00:57.134
Yes.

00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.646
One of these day I'm going to find 
 a loophole my friend.

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:02.856
Why are we going to Jacob? 
 - So I can kill him.

00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:04.686
You found your loophole.

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:06.538
Indeed I did.

00:01:08.887 --> 00:01:10.168
If this is Locke...

00:01:12.348 --> 00:01:13.289
who's in there?

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.031
Don't you leave me.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.700
I love you James. 
 - No.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.020
I love you so much. 
 - No!

00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:27.551
Juliet! No!

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.433
Come on you son of a bitch!

00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:35.290
They're coming.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.510
We're still on the Island.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.640
Where is Jacob? 
 - Jacob is dead.

00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:56.863
What are you?

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:00.323
You were wrong!

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:14.046
Don't tell me what i can't do!

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:16.348
What does he want from me? 
 - I don't know!

00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:20.122
I promise, I'll tell you everything.
