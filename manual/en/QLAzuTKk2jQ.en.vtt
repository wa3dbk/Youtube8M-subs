Hi I'm Matthew from Creative. You probably heard of the Sound Blaster Roar.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But now, the Sound Blaster team is back with the Sound Blaster Roar 2.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's smaller, it's lighter, and it's sexier.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's do a Top 5 countdown of the five main features and why you

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
should buy the Sound Blaster Roar 2. Number 5. 5 premium speaker drivers.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We've got five drivers in the Sound Blaster Roar 2

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in a compact enclosure that's 20% smaller than the classic Roar.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There are 3 top-firing drivers that deliver room filling audio,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And 2 passive radiators, so you can not only hear the bass,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but see and feel it too. Number 4.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
4 ways to play. We’ve got 4 ways to play your music on the Roar 2.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Firstly, there’s Bluetooth®. If your device has NFC,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you can simply tap and pair. Secondly, there’s USB audio.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
music

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
with the Sound Blaster Control Panel, our free downloadable software.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You can use a simple AUX cable and plug it into any device with an audio input.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Finally, you can load up a micro SD card

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
3 kickass audio features. The Roar 2 has 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
3 audio features. Well, some speakers have just one amplifier,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We have two dedicated amps – one to bring you clarity in all the highs,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and the other for the mids and lows, giving you well-balanced audio.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Addicted to bass? Press the ROAR button once and you activate TeraBass,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
When you’re having a party and you need more sound, simply press the ROAR button twice,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and you activate the ROAR function which gives you no holds barred audio, 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Number 1. One speaker that does it all.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
