Hi! My name is Shawna on behalf of Expert
Village. In this clip, we are going to talk

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.690
about needles. There are two types of needles
that you will definitely have to have. You

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.110
will have to have sewing machine needles and
some type of hand needle, just for finishing

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:26.080
work and things like that. The needles that
I use most are Schmetz needles, and they are

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.559
just kind of a universal needle, so they fit
in most machines. A 7010 is a little bit lighter

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:39.620
weight to use on little bit lighter weight
fabric, such as silks and chiffons. 8012 is

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.920
the medium needle. It is the one that use
for everything, and then there is the 90 size

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:53.609
and the 100 size, and it goes on from there.
But if you have a nice range of 70 to 100,

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.860
just in the normal needle, then you will have
a needle for almost everything. There are

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.640
specialty needles, like a Zwing needle that
has a wing needle and a straight needle. A

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.940
twin needle has 2 needles coming off the tip
for doing pin tucking and different things

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.500
like that. There are topstitching needles.
They are a stronger needle and they have a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:28.630
bigger hole for the topstitching thread. Jeans
needles, which help a lot when you are doing

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.890
a hem on jeans. It is just a stronger needle
and it helps to finish that stitch. Leather

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.350
needles, microtex needles, embroidery needles,
quilting needles. There are lots and lots

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.960
of needles, but your basic is your 7010, 8012
and 9014, which is the universal size. In

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.070
hem needles, there are lots of different needles,
and in that also there is quilting, there’s

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.770
betweens, which are the same type of needle,
darners which are a long needle with a larger

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:09.450
hole, and you can use those in embroidery
if you want to. There are embroidery needles,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.280
tapestry needles, sharp needles. The ones
I usually have around though are a quilting

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.319
needle, a sharps needle, just because it is
a nice size and doesn’t have a huge eye,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.390
but it has a good eye. And then darners for
bigger things that I may be taking through

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:38.430
a hole, so bigger threads. So needles are
a must and you just have to both, hand needles

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.540
and sewing machine needles.
