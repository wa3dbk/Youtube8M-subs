An asparagus pile is a great way
to hide a cake.

Vsauce, Kevin here—
this is Mind Blow.

00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:14.391
This stainless steel mechanical ring clock
is a concept

00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:16.411
that tells the time
down to the second,

00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:20.753
with the current time being highlighted
along the individually-rotating rings.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:23.864
And it will probably fit well
on this bionic hand.

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:26.348
Matthew James sent a letter
asking for a new hand,

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:28.415
and Mercedes said, "Okay."

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:30.594
It has two electrodes
inside the socket

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:34.495
that detect electrical impulses
made by the muscles of his lower arm.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:37.645
The signals are then beamed
to a mini-computer in the palm,

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:40.199
which translates the messages
into movements.

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.586
The movements of this robot head
are dependent

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:44.586
upon the music
that it reads.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.905
The cameras in the eyes
read sheet music,

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:49.250
then an algorithm translates
the pitch

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.965
and the vocalizer sings it,
like this.

with a four-sided glass enclosure,
which displays the four sides of the object.

It scans the object on a turntable
and reproduces it

00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:51.738
with four projectors,
so you can physically walk around it

00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:53.738
