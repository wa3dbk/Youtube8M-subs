00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.140
Hi, how are you? My name is Sucker!

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.120
And do you have an idea about what happened to this little note here from 1994 to 2015?!

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.900
Then, prepares...

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.210
According to the IBGE, the IPCA inflation closed the year of 2014 at 6.41%.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.890
Recalling that the inflation target for that year was 4.5% (and the ceiling of 6.5%).

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.890
Needless to say, this value only not gone beyond this ceiling due to much manipulation

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.960
artificial prices by the government ...

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.180
such as gas, electricity, water, public transport and so on ...

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.100
otherwise, these values ​​were already above the 6.5% too long!

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.080
Inflation is simply eroding the purchasing power of Brazilians

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.940
which they need to basically do magic to survive.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.420
To you get an idea, even in the food sector

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.860
which is usually less sensitive to variations in purchasing capabilities

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.600
it is possible to feel the impact of inflation.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.220
And to worse, the expectation for 2015 is not encouraging.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.020
According to the last minutes of the Copom meeting,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.670
inflation will continue to increase this year ...

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.820
What in clear Portuguese, it means the following ...

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.060
Fo.. deu! (Brazilian slang to Fuck)

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.080
Analyzing the evolution of some basic food prices between July 1994,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.640
that was the beginning of the Real Plan,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.680
and January 2015, we can see that the prices of products had increased

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.000
Much above the official inflation calculated by IPCA

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.920
In this graph, we can see the variation of the IPCA (represented by the red line)

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.510
compared to other staple foods, such as French bread, beef, rice, beans and others.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.740
If we compare the price of beef (in kg)

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.840
the variation was more than 600%.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.080
Already cassava flour, rose more than 650%

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.450
and our bread of every day, rose more than 700%!

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.240
To us have an idea of ​​these values, a kg of beef, which cost on average

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.090
less than 3 reais (2.86) in 1994, in 2015 is costing more than 20 reais (20.15)!

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.890
The French bread cost in real average 1 to 20 cents per kg

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.150
now costs about 10 reais a kg!

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.220
Milk (type B) cost about 63 cents a liter

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.000
now it costs more than 3 reais and 50 cents (R$3.57)

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.140
What?! Still can not understand the size of the trowel that the government shoved up your ass?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.920
So let's take a look at what you can buy with 100 reais today, and what was possible

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.200
buy with that same 100 reais in 1994?

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.740
According to the Institute of Agricultural Economics, in January 2015 it was possible to buy the following items

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.560
1 kg of beef

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.560
2 kg of French bread

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.700
6 liters of milk type B

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.560
7 kg of rice

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.040
and 4 kg of beans

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.040
Totaling 20 kg of food

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.480
So...? are you curious to see what we could buy in 1994 ?!

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.000
So, let's go!

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.040
In July 1994 it was possible to buy

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040
5 kg of beef

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.040
16 kg of French bread

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.140
30 liters of milk type B

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.760
30 kg of rice

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.280
And 15 kg of beans

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.840
Amounting to almost 100 kg of feed

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.780
Yeah ... it was even difficult to put everything on the screen.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.400
So...?! Will the REAL inflation (which is the one we really feel in our pocket)

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.819
It is not much greater than that calculated by the government ?!

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:37.740
Ah, but what matters is that the minimum wage in 1994 was  64.79 reais and is now (2015) 788.00 reais

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.060
Ooooh that's coool!

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.580
Oh, oh ... come here, come closer, let me tell you something ...

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.700
Minimum wage does not mean ANY PIECE OF SHIT!

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.480
BTW, in 1994 Brazilian earned on average 6 minimum wages per month.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.670
Does the Brazilian worker continues to earn, on average, 6 minimum wages today?

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.230
Does a retired who received 10 minimum wages in 1994 continues to gain 10 minum wages in 2015 ?!

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.420
So FUCK YOU with this minimum wage history, back off.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.640
Don't you see that is a "blablabla" of the government

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.690
to make suckers of Brazilians think they are gaining more ?!

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.240
Don't fuck with me, damn it!
