00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.550
We can go online in the space of ten seconds

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.240
we have 20 tabs with amazing initiatives

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.520
and amazing people all around the world.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.310
It naturally raises my standards and raises

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.800
my expectations in terms of what I can achieve.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.230
And when I see all this stuff,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.480
it's sort of this feeling of overwhelming

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.260
what the hell would I do with this?!

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.450
On the other hand, when I'm clear,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.930
it's just this complete bliss and ecstasy

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.380
that there's just so much richness

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.100
and if you talk about wealth

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.900
I feel like I have the world's

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.740
collective consciousness at my fingertips

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.650
and I just feel so rich!

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.840
Alot of us had parents that were baby boomers

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.320
and potentialy disillusioned hippies.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.150
They supported our creative side

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.400
and somehow we caught their idealism.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.070
and now we're interested

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.630
in the structure of money.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.960
I think it's going to be really incumbent upon

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.670
those of us for whom digital technology is more natural

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.890
to invent the systems of the future.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.490
I can't imagine how many great ideas out there

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.510
are buried in the backs of the minds of people

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.770
-- of young students, with a lot of debt --

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.940
who just don't have the ability to pursue them.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.230
It's like shackling our innovators.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.500
When you base lending and credit on things like

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.370
financial history or cosigners,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.380
those things exclude millions of people

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.090
around the world that don't have them.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.340
However everyone has potential,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.940
and if you can base credit on future potential,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.660
that brings a lot more people into financial inclusion.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.670
It's actually not a question that you pay

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.670
for what you already got,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.700
you actually pay for what you will get.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.760
The things that can be made because you paid.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.920
I think one of the things that's going on right now is

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.200
a re-examination of value,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.640
and of wealth,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.420
and of assets,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.530
and of a lot of words

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.780
that have a lot to do with money

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.270
but really aren't about money.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.380
Money itself seems to be a mystery

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.630
for most people.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.470
It is just so shockingly alien to you

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.860
if you compare it for how many

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.650
 decades you are using it until you are questioning

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.240
yourself for the frist time what it really is.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.170
We've given money the properties of the divine.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.520
You know money is not wealth,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.470
money is potential wealth.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.350
But we give it such power that it influences

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.700
the way we feel about ourselves.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.440
By experiencing a complimentary system,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.600
I changed my notion of wealth.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.430
People need to see themselves more as producers.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.100
And if they see themselves as producers

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.670
they can also see that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.530
they create the value and that there's probably

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.110
someone out there can benefit from that value.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.400
There is actually a direct link between the kind of

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.530
new social habits we are learning online

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.500
and the social movement which is created

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.290
we're more willing to connect with someone who

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.130
we've only seen a profile of online,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.300
and to trust them, in real space or with our time

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.500
I would share almost all of my information

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.270
with complete strangers because I feel

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.330
there's an integrity to the way I live,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.270
and it's fine for other people to know about that.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.100
As we work together

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.740
creating these collective projects

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.970
then trust naturally comes from that

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.060
and out of that trust we then seek to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.240
organize new forms of social life

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.430
so trust is at the basis of the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.960
re-creation of real communities

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.800
which are no longer bounded by place,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.070
but are bounded by shared values.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.400
You put yourself in a more vulnerable state

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.760
when you express what you need.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.510
We go out and we buy it

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.710
from people we don't know,

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.050
but we don't turn to our community.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.520
Putting all that information into one database

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.170
creates an enormous amount of potential energy.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.940
When you know what a community needs

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.450
you know what the market demand is.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.040
If there was a kind of bank that allowed me to

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.900
convert my money to a local currency right now,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.840
I would do that.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.370
Successful businesses and other

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.570
non-business organizations of the future

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.500
will have to be more transparent and more human,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.210
and the ones that succeed in the long run

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.560
I think are going to come back

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.880
more as peers in our society

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.640
so they can behave in trustworthy ways,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.470
rather than trying to tell us over and over again

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.540
to trust them.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.170
Banks are going to have to evolve

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.450
to meet the new business models around

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.770
mediating trust and communities

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.020
and the ones that do are going survive

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.830
and take on a very different role,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.360
and the ones that don't I think are just

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.570
going to go out of business.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.580
Try to start and think in new ways

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.080
join the discussion, like this discussion,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.630
on what's to come and what is value,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.730
what could replace money.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.160
It's more about creating an atmosphere

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.360
within a company or organization that allows

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.010
the people who work there to speak out

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.630
crazy ideas without being fired right away.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.670
Think about the first days of aviation.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.430
The Wright brothers would say,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.320
"OK, let's make this thing fly!"

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.240
But they wouldn't think about huge infrastructure that is needed;

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.660
airports and embassies and people and security

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.120
and you know all these are huge opportunities.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.700
The bank again is not an external entity to the community

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.920
but is an expression of the community itself.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.200
What are the kinds of flows that we want to see?

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.900
What is that we want to shape? 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.600
What is that we want to measure?

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.340
And then try to design currencies for them.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.510
Think about currency as

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.100
open to the principles of the free market.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.900
Just as corporations are free to compete for

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.170
various value-creating opportunities,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.940
currencies should be free to compete.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.740
Different currency models competing

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.700
against one another for their ability to

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.540
serve different purposes.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.030
We're starting to reconsider how

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.530
the commercial economy

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.930
intersects with gift exchange and the commons.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.770
And no business likes to hear that

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.770
something of what they're doing

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.070
might fall into the commons, might be a gift,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.170
might be very cheap to do, or easy to do 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.880
but they are, it is.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.000
and if you actually have your eyes open and look 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.530
at those forces and understand them deeply,

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.700
you will see new business opportunities

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.500
around the commons,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.270
contributing to the commons,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.140
being in a symbiotic relationship

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.480
with the commons that are different

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.600
from the way we used to do business.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.870
And I do think there is a great

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.800
money making opportunity

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.040
in currency innovation

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.340
so that rather than simply innovating

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.790
in terms of the financial instruments built on top

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.540
of the current currency system

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.040
you go underneath 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.160
and actually develop new operating systems.
