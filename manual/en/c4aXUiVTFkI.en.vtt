00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.620
I look at each of you, and I see the marks
of this long and terrible war.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.540
I mean look at the scars
on that guy's face. He's hideous!

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.480
If we die tonight,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.380
that would be unfortunate,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.260
cos the battle's not till next week.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.840
The machines sent a Terminator
back to the time before the war

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.140
to kill my mother.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.440
Sarah Connor.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.720
- With an "S".
- Ah, cold!

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.640
Sir, let me save her.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.760
I've been studying the photo of her you gave me
for roughly five minutes every night

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.080
so I have a pretty good idea what
ninety percent of her looks like.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.960
What you're doing right now -

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.560
this is the end of the war.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.440
You realise you're holding my dick?

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.579
My hand is right here.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.240
I thought your grip was a little weak.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.060
Oh, of all the places!

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.700
[LION ROAR, DISTANT SCREAM]

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.120
The time you're going back to,
she'll be scared and weak and horny.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.780
Take care of her for me, Kyle.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.660
Come with me if you want to live!

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.580
Now, soldier!

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.840
OK, I'm coming!

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.440
You didn't have to shoot my legs.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.740
The time John sent you to no longer exists.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.920
Everything's changed.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.360
For example, I'm no longer attracted to men.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.420
Oh, this timeline sucks balls!

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.840
Yeah, well, I don't.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.840
I've been waiting for you.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.400
You think you are better than me just because
you are thirty years younger?

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.860
Get ready to feel the folly of youth!

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.800
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.780
Ugh! Ugh! Uuuuuugh!

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.940
[GASPS]

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.300
If you wish to beg for my mercy,

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.480
now would be a good time!

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.540
- John?
- Hi, mom.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.060
How can you be here?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.660
Well, the thing is , I'm actually a Terminator.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.060
Spoiler alert.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.780
Don't be embarrassed, John.
I'm a Terminator too.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.520
"Judgment day."

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.520
Well this is kinda awkward, because...

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.460
I am Chappie. I am alive.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Isn't anyone here a real person?

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.620
What the hell was the point of all this?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.940
I'm a real person.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.760
I'll be back.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.820
What?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.780
Why didn't anyone tell me there was
another chopper down there?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.040
Now I know why they call them choppers.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.160
Get it? Because it chopped me up?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.740
I... have other jokes.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.920
What do you call a Terminator
who lives under the sea?

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.920
A "Mer-minator."

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.900
Mer-man?
[BEEP]

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.580
Uh-oh! I used up all my reserve power
coming up with that joke!

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.620
It wasn't even funny.
