Has this ever happened to you?

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.000
You get sucked into hell to marry Satan’s daughter? 
Then you need… Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell.

Use dozens upon dozens of Hell related weaponry, neat-o super powers, and brutal takedowns inspired by real martial art moves.

Warning, the use of takedowns may result in the following…

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.000
I think you might be skipping some details.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.540
But that’s not all!  We also have another game you absolutely need to buy before anything else in your life.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:36.000
Extra graphics.  Enhanced nut kicks.  Voice commands.  Sharing and live streaming.  Extra polygons.  Six hundred and sixty-six times the colors.  One Million-P more resolution.  More English speaking aliens.  More obscure pop culture references.  More!  More!  More!  More of everything!  Sort of… but, twice the ass kicking.  Three times the nut kicking.  And infinity more Zynyak skull crushing potential.
