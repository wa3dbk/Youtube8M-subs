00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.680
-Nice to meet you.
-Me too.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.160
-Where do you want to go, Roberto?
-I think we have to go back to the court.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.440
-Where is your home?
-In Castellon.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.520
It's a beautiful place,
we have a beautiful weather

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.600
and we have some days at 20Â° in December.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.400
-I think I'll move over there...
-Yes!

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.280
-I have also two horses at home.
-Two horses?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.720
The first one's name is Baguira, the other one is  Janto.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.480
-So you're kind of a cowboy...
-No!

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.440
Last year, I went with Higueras
to Indian Wells.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.280
I went there with Ferrer and Giraldo.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.720
Is Ferrer a good horse driver?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.640
Not so good...

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.520
Because I heard
you're a big fan of David Ferrer.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.320
Yes, I'm a big fan of him.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.640
You may be ready to beat him, this year?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.320
Maybe this year I'm fitter.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.880
-Cool!
-And more confident. We will see!

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.360
David, be careful!

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.240
We're going to pick up a friend of mine.
He's a DJ, his name is Adriano.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.200
And he's working on the original soundtrack
of "Road to Roland Garros"

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.480
with the help of all the players.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200
Hello, guys. I'm Adriano.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.400
I try to find in the car
some ways to make sounds.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.840
What's fantastic is that every little sound
is part of a music something. Amazing!

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.280
If I put one effect on the click...

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.240
-Nice, no?
-Yes!

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.120
-Cool or not cool?
-Very cool!

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.360
Ready?
