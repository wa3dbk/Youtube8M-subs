00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.240
 This is Part 2 of the fork seal and oil
replacement for dual chamber style forks.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.060
Please refer to Part 1 for
disassembly.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.780
K, now we're done with the outer fork tube,
we're gonna concentrate on the inner cartridge assembly.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.040
And now we're going to remove that inner fork cap from the outer. Use the other part of our Tusk Cap Wrench.  

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.260
Just go ahead and separate those.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.560
Thread that off.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.100
It's a little easier to push down on the rod a
little bit, down on the damping rod a little bit and pull that fork, inner fork assembly out.  

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.600
Now we're going to dump the oil out of the inner part. 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.140
Go ahead and pump the damper rod a little bit. Get all the oil out.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.970
Now's a great time to refer to your
service manual one more time for the correct volume of oil and kind of oil for your inner cartridge.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.860
And we'll go ahead and fill that up.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.980
We're going to start pumping it. Get all the air out.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.940
You want to do it carefully so you don't squirt oil everywhere.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.560
Just run that back and forth a couple times,
get rid of all the air.   

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.840
With the damper rod extended, let's go
ahead and install the inner fork cap assembly. 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.160
You need to push down kinda hard to get it started on the threads.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.200
We're going to use our for cap tools and we're going to tighten that up. 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.370
Make sure its good and tight.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.450
Now we're gonna pump that damper rod in and out a couple more times.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.980
Make sure it extends all the way fully by itself.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.160
Make sure the action is smooth, there's no
air bubbles.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.560
If there is, we'll need to go ahead and redo
that last step.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.650
There might be some oil that comes back
out on those holes if you over filled it a little bit. 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.080
Go ahead and dump that out at this time.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.970
Now we're going to install the cartridge.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.990
We're going to install the spring.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.760
The spring guide if equipped. 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.600
The inner cartridge assembly.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.670
Any time you working with your fork of course, you always want to be careful so you're not scratching the sides of anything.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.260
It's always good to be careful.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.380
And we'll go ahead and slide the outer tube up, and screw it onto that outer fork cap.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.680
And we're going to put our fork back in the vice.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.960
We're going to need our fork tool again.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.969
We're going to push on the upper part of the fork.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.420
Push out the lock nut and slide our wrench into place.

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.629
Put our push rod back inside. 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.500
Thread our center bolt all the
way down.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.200
Make sure that that lock nut is threaded all the way back onto the threads.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:51.860
And when you tighten this up you can actually feel it after the lock nut bottoms out. It will actually start to thread the center bolt onto it. 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:55.609
Make sure it's good and tight.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.440
Then we need to push out on the upper fork tube.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.160
Remove our tool. Make sure that carefully slides back in there. You might need to guide it.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.500
You're going to go ahead and tighten this up.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.070
Go ahead and set your rebound back to where it was.

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.169
Now it's time to put oil in the outer fork chamber.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.060
And of course we've referred back to our owners
manual again, our service manual.

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:50.349
We know exactly what our volume is going to be, how much we are going to put in.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.760
A Ratio Rite works great for this, you can tell exactly how much oil you need to put in.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.730
Now we need to take that fork cap back off again, the outer one. 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.780
Slide it down a bit, slide that outer tube
down a bit.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.170
Pour in our measured amount of oil.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.180
It makes it a little easier to lay it to the side a little bit so you can get the oil in there.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.600
We're going to go ahead and slide the outer tube back up.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.820
Thread the outer cap back onto it.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.160
We're going to go ahead and tighten that up.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.840
Now it's time to get it back on the bike
and go ride!
