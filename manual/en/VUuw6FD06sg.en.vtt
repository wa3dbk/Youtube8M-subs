00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.940
I do not want to go to prison.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.940
Relax, I got this.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.600
There's no point in losing the cops if i'm dead in the back seat.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.140
Let's go, Michael.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.300
Don't worry, I know what i'm doing.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.000
Lemme get the keys to those cuffs.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.960
There you go. You remember those. don't ya?

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.880
From the old days, when you used to do the  girl cop routine?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.580
Really? Now? You're a pig.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.120
Don't say it! What?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.840
That I have everthing I want, so why am I strealing?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.740
Oh, my lips are sealed.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.420
Cause if you say that, I'll say the same to you.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.140
I'm not saying anything...

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.300
I'm just doing my best to keep us out of jail.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.020
I mean, who are you to judge me?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.800
Oh, I'm not judging. No, not at all.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.540
You're loving this, aren't you?

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.200
Oh yeah, Risking prison. Getting shot at.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.920
Love, love, big love.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.160
So, this is what it's like to be you.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.880
Ah not really, honey. See, I'm a semi-successful crook.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.900
You're a bit of a failure. But, hey, kudos for trying...

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.880
Not that successful if you're in witness protection

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.500
Well, I've got an idea. Why don't we see what Agent Dave and the FIB think or this lover on the run act?

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.560
Get rid of the car, Michael. It can't stay in the driveaway.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.960
Oh and, yeah, thank you,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.220
