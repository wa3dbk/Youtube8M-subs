00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.480
Comix is just going to straight up charge into Gauvain here and that is a nice...

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.800
that is a nice... that is some roadkill!

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.800
Commentator 1: Ok, let's watch. Will they track him?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.520
Commentator 2: But he should be able to escape!

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.320
Commentator 1: Will they... Wow! He fled!

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.120
Commentator 2: Can he slow down? No! He is falling! He breaks! *screams*

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.680
He's owning it, owning it!

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.160
Each tank in Team Profit has everything it needs...

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.160
Kill! Kill! Kill! KILL!!!

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.160
Now, T1 went in to capture the base.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.280
Oh my god! What is this?!

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.440
Look at this! What incredible mobility!

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.000
What I'm so surprised about this game is...

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.720
They only need two tanks to hold the enemy and run down the clock to win the game.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.880
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's over!

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.640
Can he do it 1v1, he's done the job but quickly now as Xinef comes through looking to try

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.680
and even the odds here he's going to be in that 1v1 with Ssensei soon enough

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.000
as Jackou3k takes him low this could mean trouble... Xinef!

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.320
He gets a lot of damage! Xinef could fall here! Finally lands the shot

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.800
but Ssensei is hot on his heals now.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.640
Here we go 13 90 against 13 90, Xinef the veteran could be outdone

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.600
by one of the newcomers and Ssensei's done it!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.360
Commentator 1: They should be attacking LeBwa. LeBwa 100 hp.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.760
Angel got hit twice! Thrice!

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.680
Commentator 2: Thrice! They got him!

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.360
Commentator 1: They got Angel_Killer, they got JaredJIeto.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.280
But their enemies killed LeBwa and now POWESL1DE will have a problem.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.840
They killed POWERSL1DE! Ecl1pse will not get away...

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.560
but he has great support from Straik.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.600
Commentator 2: Straik is at full hp... at full hp!

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.800
But NOnick got fire.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.480
Oh, wait! It is shots from Ecl1pse.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.480
Commentator 1: That is Ecl1pse

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.880
Commentator 2: Yeah. Straik got one and now it's 2 versus 2.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.480
*ahhhhhhh* if he can get the shot on Batman it's all going to come down to this shot...

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.400
*ooooohhhh* is it going to hit? He's in a bush! He connects!!!!!! *screams*

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.920
It's a 2v4 but they're just numbers...

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.880
but now Ruster is left with a world of trouble he's got YZne_ low:

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.240
HE'S ON FIRE! Yzne_ could go down here!

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.240
Ruster might win this one out, maybe?

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.560
A couple more shells, one more maybe, two DrTur's coming round.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.520
Can Ruster hold on?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.400
And wow this is going to come down to the final sections, can Ruster do the job?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.520
Can they pull this off? If they manage to take him down...

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.200
1 second left, it's not going to be enough time.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.600
LittleMac!!! One! He's going round first.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.880
He's missed the first shot at Tanaka.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.440
Maybe can he make the 2nd one?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.080
Exactly! *screams* No no no no! *Screams*

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.320
LittleMac trying to get that other shot to fire *screams*

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.640
OK, Pushed back immediately from Tanaka.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.800
LittleMac making big progress right now... OH! The amount! *Laughter*

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.520
He lost 378 hp, this could get pushed in the other direction , 253!

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.560
Tanak goes boom and LittleMac gets the kill. Nice!

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.920
Commentator 1: Both of the T69s are reloading and now their opponents should use the situation.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.040
Torin23 has only 2 shells.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.800
Commentator 2: But look...

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.320
Commentator 1: That's it! Minus one T69, they got the first one.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.040
Commentator 2: They're attacking tanks that are on reload now...

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.960
But look at Maliw. Maliw making miracles!

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.840
Commentator 1: Yeah!

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.360
Commentator 2: Maliw just rammed negat1vekoo. Killed him!

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.440
Commentator 1: Wow! 38_Jevis is pushing Daniel_Blond.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.640
And Jevis has two shots! But the T1 is hitting him from the back

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760
Commentator 2: Minus Forevich.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880
Commentator 1: Maliw jumps down

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.960
Commentator 2: Minus Javis.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.200
Commentator 1: And here it's the last one

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.560
Commentator 2: Vinnypushok's jump of faith! Do not crash! Oh, well... He crashed.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.440
Oh he can do that, he can do that! He's got 20 seconds, NO! *screams* Oh my god!

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.280
That was the most clutch save of my life!

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.480
Can he stay alive? OH MY GOD No! *screams*

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.800
Can he do that? Maybe, but he's super exposed and a nice little shot coming out of Djuice,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.120
and oh my god Amazona following up from behind, he's focusing down Djuice as well!

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.120
And he's down to the last sliver of HP he'll be the first to fall for his team but not,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.080
before his opponent, oh my god.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.560
Deksta trying to get the crush here, what is going on here?

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.800
God, is the T1 Cunningham just about to take him out of the game?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.440
No, Unicum is...

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.960
Ah!!! This is amazing!
