So where we left off was I was just basically
filling in the circles. Let's finish this

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:19.331
up. Basically we've got our muscles up top,
the shoulder muscles, and muscles that go

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:35.340
into the arm.
Just start drawing, start practicing and you'll

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.499
get it fastly. Basically just kind of throwing
skin on top of these circles just to get an

00:00:42.499 --> 00:01:04.960
idea of what I'm dealing with here. Remember,
your using your circles and filling them out.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:14.070
Here's where your elbow would be so draw the
tricep in coming down to the elbow. I started

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.859
these down here. It's like the same thing
with these guys up here. This part of the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:27.219
muscle is like a circle and these are just
lines that kind of walk into the hand. Usually

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:39.670
with the knees, you draw half-circles and
then lines that go down. Because you've got

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.330
that weird thing in the front that runs down
the front of your leg that goes all the way

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.810
down. With the muscles in here, it's same
thing with how all these flow into each other.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.341
Same with this, you've got muscles here running
into each other. The best thing you could

00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:11.020
do is just grab an anatomy book or something.
A book, I do recommend, is How To Draw Marvel

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:19.510
Comic Heroes. It's a good book. It's really
old, but it's got the core values in there.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.970
They show you everything I'm pretty much talking
about. You can always reference it. It's a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:37.330
great book. That's kind of what taught me
how to draw first. Drawing hands, thumbs,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:47.620
or whatever. Basically, I'm just going to
darken it in so you get a better idea of how

00:02:47.620 --> 00:03:06.010
this all comes together. It all just gets
kind of connected. That's the good thing about

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.840
sketching light, cause then you could fix
errors.
