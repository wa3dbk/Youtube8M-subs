00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.189
(Techno Music)

00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.143
(Loud Thud)

00:00:03.143 --> 00:00:04.183
- [Brent Voiceover] Hi, I'm Brent.

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:05.133
- [Rick Voiceover] And I'm Rick.

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.230
And this is the commentary track

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.174
for going on an internet date.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.007
Well, this is petrifying.

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.583
I have no idea, which of
these girls is my girl.

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:14.444
Every new person who
walks in could be my date.

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:15.482
- [Brent Voiceover] Well,
at least you have hope.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.616
My date cancelled last minute
so I'm just standing here now.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:18.611
- [Rick Voiceover] Last minute cancel.

00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:20.768
It's one of the traditions
in online dating.

00:00:20.768 --> 00:00:22.518
Here we go.

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:24.254
- [Brent Voiceover]
(Laughs) In your dreams.

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.352
- [Rick Voiceover] Ugh, I
know, that guy looks so good.

00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:27.329
- [Brent Voiceover] Ugh,
well look at that hair.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.166
It's like John Stamos good.
And look at those arms.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.198
- [Rick Voiceover] He
has a man's body. Period.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.026
I mean look at his shoulders.
He looks like a superhero

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:35.975
and I look like a dumb Jewish pencil.

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:37.517
- That girl's too feminine for you.

00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:38.505
- What are you talking about?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.059
- Well, you like like jacked girls.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.669
- Well, first of all, I
don't only like jacked girls.

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:43.898
And secondly, yeah, I want
a girl who's ripped. Sorry.

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:45.739
Give me a girl with good
arms and a six pack.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.027
I want a, a Lebron body,
you know, but with tits.

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:49.817
I want a girl with a nice
ass, because she squats

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:50.985
not just because she's gifted.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.369
She's not a guy, but, you know, is she?

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:53.202
Type of thing.

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:55.121
- So, you're telling me
you don't like that girl.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.082
- I think she's fine.

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:58.065
- [Rick Voiceover] Ugh,
holy sh**, look at her abs.

00:00:58.065 --> 00:00:59.923
- [Brent Voiceover] You know
a lot about strong girls.

00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:01.423
- [Rick Voiceover] I find
them to be an acquired taste,

00:01:01.423 --> 00:01:04.137
like you find a girl that
could bench 250 and she's hot.

00:01:04.137 --> 00:01:04.970
Next thing you know,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.306
I'm jerking off to girls
that can bench 600.

00:01:07.306 --> 00:01:09.434
- [Brent Voiceover] And,
back to meeting girls online.

00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:10.497
- [Rick Voiceover] I know, it's crazy.

00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:13.321
And I had a date coming,
but that's the thing Brent.

00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:15.593
It's like a 24 hour
nightclub and you know what?

00:01:15.593 --> 00:01:16.809
I'm always at the party.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.010
- [Brent Voiceover] I know.
I wake up at eight AM.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.185
Next thing I know. I'm hitting
on girls from my toilet.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:21.210
- [Rick Voiceover] Hold on a second.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.065
Why don't we just step back a little bit.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:24.697
Look around you. She's single.

00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:26.850
Single. Single girl. Single.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.425
Hard to meet women when
you're on your phone, Brent.

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:30.345
- [Brent Voiceover] I know. I'm addicted.

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:31.366
Ooh, here comes your girl now.

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.520
- Hey, Rick. Hi.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.577
- [Rick Voiceover] Holy sh**.

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:36.213
I still can't believe
she's actually really hot.

00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:37.497
- I'm Brent, though.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.370
- [Rick Voiceover] Well, that sucked.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.203
- Yeah, I'm Rick.

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:40.036
- That's Rick.

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:41.786
- Oh. Rick. Agh. Hi.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.742
Why are you the cute one
in all these pictures?

00:01:45.742 --> 00:01:46.901
- You don't have to say he's the cute one.

00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:47.734
You could just say-
- Well, you could say it.

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:48.636
- [Rick Voiceover] That implies

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:49.788
that you're cute and I'm not.

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:51.333
Now I know that you're cute which,

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.797
let me tell you something, I already knew.

00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:54.085
And now I know I'm not cute and,

00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:55.652
let me tell you something, I already knew.

00:01:55.652 --> 00:01:56.485
I'm sorry.

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:58.023
- [Brent Voiceover] Does
this app have a rude filter?

00:01:58.023 --> 00:01:58.856
- [Ross Voiceover] I don't know, if it did

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:00.533
I'll tell you one thing, I
would never have met this c***.

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.264
- Uh, listen, I should probably go.

00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:04.486
You just don't look
anything like your pictures.

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:05.690
- Well, I apologize.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.908
- But is Brent single?

00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:07.741
- No.

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:09.559
- What'd she say?

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.183
- He asked, she asked if you were hungry.

00:02:11.183 --> 00:02:12.215
We just ate.
- No, we just ate.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.498
- We just ate. Thank you.
- There's barbecue. So we ate.

00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:15.331
- [Rick Voiceover] I'm sorry I told her

00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:16.164
you weren't single, bro.

00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:17.013
- [Brent Voiceover] Eh, it's all good.

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:18.509
I got her number right after this ends.

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.002
- [Rick Voiceover] I know. Watch this.

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.176
- I think you're really pretty

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:24.232
and I would love if you would,

00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:26.448
I would love to have the
opportunity for you to like

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:28.036
for you to hold me. Pick me up.

00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:28.869
- Okay.

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:31.351
- [Rick Voiceover] Abs are the new tits.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.184
And you know what's better?

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:33.017
- [Brent Voiceover] What?

00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:33.850
- [Rick Voiceover] There's eight of them.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.100
(Techno Music)

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.600

00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:56.681
