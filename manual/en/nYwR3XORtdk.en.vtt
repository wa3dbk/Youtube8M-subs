00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
- Hi guys, today I have
another Halloween costume

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:07.303
DIY for you, but this costume
is a little bit different.

00:00:07.303 --> 00:00:11.870
It's part of the DIY Minimalist
Halloween Costume Challenge,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.087
which I set up with a
few of my other friends

00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:16.352
who also run DIY channels,

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:19.069
and I am also challenging all of you.

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:22.307
The idea is to make a
costume using very limited

00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:24.768
materials to really
force you to be creative

00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:26.147
with form and texture.

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:28.826
This was inspired by a
similar project that we did

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:31.624
while I was at RISD and
I thought it was so fun

00:00:31.624 --> 00:00:34.261
so I just wanted to bring it to YouTube.

00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:36.699
So, the materials you're allowed to use.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.308
You can use brown cardboard,
black and white paper,

00:00:40.308 --> 00:00:43.780
black and white tissue paper,
black and white trash bags

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.638
and black and white paint.

00:00:45.638 --> 00:00:47.366
And that is it.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.886
You're also allowed to
use any sort of adhesives

00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:52.045
that you want so long
as they don't become a

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:54.100
decorative part of the costume.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.981
So clear packing tape is fine

00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:58.699
but maybe not neon green duct tape.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.041
You can also use any sort of
crafting tools that you want

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.548
like scissors and paper
punches and rulers, etc.

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:07.858
So now that you know the
rules, let me show you

00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:10.121
the costume that I came up with.

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:12.700
I actually spent so long
brainstorming what type

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.079
of costume I wanted to
make that I didn't end up

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.255
having a lot of time to make anything

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:19.496
as elaborate as I had hoped.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.110
But I still think it came
out pretty well and so,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.973
my costume is, a DIY
ampersand letterpress block.

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:28.657
Let me show you how I made it.

00:01:28.657 --> 00:01:31.176
So I started with a box
that was about the size

00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:32.628
of my upper body.

00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:35.216
The first step was to
remove any stickers or tape

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:37.154
so I had a nice flat surface.

00:01:37.154 --> 00:01:39.768
After that, I taped up
the flaps of the box

00:01:39.768 --> 00:01:42.053
so that it was a little bit wider.

00:01:42.053 --> 00:01:44.712
And then I drew holes for my head and arms

00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:45.932
and cut those out.

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:48.973
I was trying it on while expanding
and adjusting those holes

00:01:48.973 --> 00:01:51.365
but it was a lot of wriggling around and

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:54.731
not very attractive so you
guys don't get to see that.

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:56.867
And I also cut out the bottom of the box

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:58.887
so I would be able to wear it.

00:01:58.887 --> 00:02:01.569
At this point, you could
stop and use it as a

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.367
Boxtroll's cosplay but I have

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:06.027
a little more work I wanna do.

00:02:06.027 --> 00:02:08.606
So once the arm and the head
holes were fully cut out,

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:11.008
I measured the front
of the box and cut out

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.374
two pieces of cardboard that
were the exact same size.

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:17.452
One was to cover up the front
so that it has a smoother

00:02:17.452 --> 00:02:21.085
surface while the other will
become the back of the box.

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:23.452
I also then made a pattern of an ampersand

00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:25.845
that fit the proportions of my box.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.808
I ended going with the font DIN,

00:02:27.808 --> 00:02:30.105
but if you make this
costume you can obviously

00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:32.864
use any character and
any font that you like.

00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:34.880
Oh, and before anyone gets on my case,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.392
the ampersand is supposed to be backwards

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:39.413
because, once you print from it,

00:02:39.413 --> 00:02:42.245
then the print is the right side around,

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.811
so yes, supposed to be backwards.

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:46.564
So I made the pattern in the same way

00:02:46.564 --> 00:02:48.792
that I showed you in this video

00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:51.010
and then I traced it and cut it out

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.904
from another piece of cardboard.

00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:55.793
Not once, not twice, but three times.

00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:58.464
My hand was very sore
by the end of that day,

00:02:58.464 --> 00:03:00.124
but I wanted three of them so that I could

00:03:00.124 --> 00:03:02.109
really get the height that I wanted to

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.245
mimic a wooden letterpress block.

00:03:04.245 --> 00:03:06.230
So once all three ampersands were cut out,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.086
I chose which one I wanted
to be on top and then

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:11.570
I hot glued that and
the second one together.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.509
And then I used a sharp X-Acto knife

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.528
to trim down any areas where
they didn't quite line up

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:18.908
and then I glued on the third ampersand

00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:20.186
and did the same thing.

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:22.612
After that, it was just
time to sand down the edges

00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:24.864
so it really felt like one piece.

00:03:24.864 --> 00:03:27.511
Now it's time for the fun part, painting.

00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:30.622
I used the black paint to
do a dry brush technique

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:33.907
on the cardboard to try to
build up a lot of layers

00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:36.241
to make it look like old weathered wood.

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:39.270
This did take quite a while
but I think it was worth it.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.128
And then on the main body of the box,

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:44.043
I just painted it black
along with the back piece.

00:03:44.043 --> 00:03:46.888
Once all of that paint was
dry, I hot glued the ampersand

00:03:46.888 --> 00:03:49.384
onto the front piece of cardboard and then

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:51.903
hot glued that onto the front of the box.

00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:54.364
And then I used packing tape
to attach the back piece

00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:56.663
of the box so it could
swing open and closed

00:03:56.663 --> 00:03:59.425
to make getting into
the box a little easier.

00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:02.246
So I just put it on, closed
the back with some more

00:04:02.246 --> 00:04:04.986
packing tape and now I have the nerdiest

00:04:04.986 --> 00:04:07.982
Halloween costume in
the history of mankind,

00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:10.907
a life size ampersand letterpress block.

00:04:10.907 --> 00:04:12.659
So the main parts of the costume are

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.608
just cardboard and black
paint, which fall under

00:04:15.608 --> 00:04:17.350
the constraints of the challenge.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.542
However, to really finish
it off, I cheated a little

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:22.899
by wearing an ampersand shirt from

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.430
the House Industries line at UNIQLO.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.100
And I carried an ink roller and an actual

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.422
wooden letterpress block in case anyone

00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:32.883
didn't really know what
I was supposed to be.

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:35.124
I kind of wish I was still as RISD

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:37.967
so that I could rock
this costume in studio

00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:40.546
on Halloween or an artist ball.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.867
So if any of you guys
are currently in school,

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:45.224
please make this, please wear it to class

00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:47.418
and let me know how everyone likes it.

00:04:47.418 --> 00:04:50.461
So that was my costume
for the DIY Minimalist

00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:52.700
Halloween Costume Challenge.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.082
A bit of a mouthful.

00:04:54.082 --> 00:04:55.859
I had so much fun putting it together

00:04:55.859 --> 00:04:58.505
and I really wanna make even more DIYs

00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:00.687
with limited materials like this.

00:05:00.687 --> 00:05:02.348
So make sure you go check out all of

00:05:02.348 --> 00:05:04.623
the other videos in this collaboration.

00:05:04.623 --> 00:05:07.177
They're from Lauren
Fairweather and Studio Knit

00:05:07.177 --> 00:05:09.720
and Sea Lemon and Debi's Design Diary.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.227
All of their DIY videos are so great

00:05:12.227 --> 00:05:13.957
and in just a second, you'll be able to

00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:15.444
click on them to watch them.

00:05:15.444 --> 00:05:19.065
So I definitely recommend
clicking through to all of them.

00:05:19.065 --> 00:05:22.560
Or, if any of you guys want
to take on this challenge

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.323
as well, I would love
to see what you make.

00:05:25.323 --> 00:05:27.761
So thank you guys so much
for watching my videos

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.141
and I will see you all next time.

00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:31.279
Bye everyone.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:36.178
