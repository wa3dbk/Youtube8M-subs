00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.069
I am nearing the end of a two year transition,
so I'm new to the natural hair scene and I

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.400
had to experiment just a little bit to figure
out the perfect twist out combo and ladies,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.650
I think I've nailed it.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.210
This combination never lets me down.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.800
So first I use a liquid moisturizer or spray
followed by a curl holding moisturizer and

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.890
then I seal with Jamaican Black Castor Oil.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.820
My personal preference is to lightly blow
dry my hair y ou can see that it's not extremely

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.359
straight and then if you are going to wear
a part, that's the only area of your hair

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.820
that you're going to use a comb to place a
hard part.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.769
For the rest of the sections, use your fingers
to separate them because you don't want the

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.449
rest of the parts to be really defined.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.149
I am using the Bee Mine Juicy Daily Spritz,
love this stuff.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.640
You can also use water or another spray or
leave in if you like but Bee Mine always gives

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.579
me consistently great results so that's pretty
much what I stick with.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.590
The curly butter is another favorite of mine,
I've been using it for about six years.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.250
A little bit goes a very long way you can
see I only used like a finger dab full to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.440
distribute that product throughout my hair.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.550
It's going to give really soft hold and good
definition with moisture.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.880
And the secret key ingredient or whatever
is this Jamaican black castor oil food.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.180
I love this one because it is Jamaican Black
Castor Oil but it's already diluted so its

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.080
thin enough to use directly on your hair and
a little bit just seals the moisture in, gets

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.700
the hair really soft, love that stuff and
of course, links to everything will be down

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.930
in the description box for those who are interested
in purchasing.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:55.050
So you can see, I have a really um neat flat
twist and then once I get to the end because

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.690
I am transitioning, I leave my relaxed ends
loose, add a little bit more product and then

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.560
wind it around a small perm rod.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.539
When you flat twist, you have to make sure
to take your time and pull your fingers all

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.120
the way through and that's pretty much the
key to flat twisting is being patient and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.079
getting it nice and uniform.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:25.060
And off camera, I did add a bit of edge control
product and covered with a scarf and um I

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:36.010
slept in it overnight, made sure the hair
was dry.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.170
And then because I used that combination of
products, the hair is so soft and defined,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.870
I don't even really have to separate.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.270
So I make sure that I untwist rather than
pull at the hair as I'm taking the twists

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.270
down.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.689
I don't separate, I don't run my fingers through,
I try to keep it as defined as possible and

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.569
you can see it is giving really really good
spirals.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.189
So you can see me um unraveling the hair in
the opposite direction that I twisted it and

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.840
again I'm untwisting rather than pulling um
the hair apart and that ya know fights the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.560
frizz and keeps it really defined.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.760
For those who are curious and haven't seen
any of my previous videos, my natural hair

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.370
type is 4 c.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.860
So these products work really really well
for my hair.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.260
And you can see, I didn't even separate or
fluff or anything and this is pretty much

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.790
the basic shape.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.169
I just kind of um, hide the parts and fluff
it into place and the shape and everything

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.510
is just about there.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.530
Super easy, fast and like I said, this is
a fool proof method.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.779
These products always give me amazing results.

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:59.170
So I hope you guys enjoyed, I was feeling
my self this day and you guys just don't know.
