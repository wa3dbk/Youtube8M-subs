00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.970
So now we’ve cut in our paint and we’re
ready to roll our ceilings, which we’re

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.639
going to do first. Since we’re doing both,
it’s not as big of a deal, but if you have

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.990
a different color ceiling than you do wall,
you always want to start with your ceiling.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.070
I’m wearing a bandanna because it’ll protect
my hair from paint drips. I have a 9-inch

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.570
roller and it’s very thick so it’ll put
the paint on and give it really good coverage.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.000
Go ahead and spend 4 or 5 bucks for a roller.
Also, you want to make sure that you keep

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.730
a damp rag near you for mistakes; I have that
in my back pocket. So, when you get your paint

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:47.829
on your roller brush, you want to make sure
that you get a lot of paint on there and then

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:58.100
roll it out. Start at the edge. Beautiful.
I just love a good roller brush; it gives

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.800
you the coverage possible. Okay, so now we
have cut in our walls and we’re ready to

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:15.760
roll. I’m going to get a lot of paint on
my brush and just start from the inside. This

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.820
is great because I don’t have to worry about
my trim. I can get great coverage because

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:36.230
I have a good roller brush. You want to make
sure that you don’t have any drips. If you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.890
do have a drip, you can use your wet cloth
or you can go back over it with your paintbrush.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.370
I’m going to go ahead and finish up my walls,
and then when I’m done with my walls I’m

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.840
going to do a second coat and maybe even a
third since we are painting over this Grey

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.300
color without using a primer. But I’m okay
with that because the ceilings will end up

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.200
being a little bit lighter than the walls,
and I think that’s going to be really nice

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.509
and lift the view up. Also, you want to make
sure that you have no lines showing when you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.260
paint. Generally, a second and a third coat
that’s going to take care of those lines.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.170
Even in your first one, you just want to make
sure that there’s no distinguishing marks

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.700
between your edges.
