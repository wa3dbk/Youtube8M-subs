Hi! My name is Sam Fox

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.360
I am an acting major from Phoenix, Airzona

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.140
Welcome to the Historic Northwest area of campus!

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.980
Here at the Yuma Honors Hall

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.600
Yuma is near the Student Union

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.820
The Honors College

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.960
And the engineering buildings

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.840
In order to apply for the Yuma residence hall

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.840
You must be admitted to the Honors College!

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.020
Yuma is on the national registrar of historic buildings

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800
It is home to 184 students

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.320
On single gender wings

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.720
And was remodeled in 2004

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.020
All of the rooms contain 80 inch bunk beds

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.440
And some of the furniture is built-in

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.860
They are all double rooms

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.480
With a sink in every room

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.780
Let's scope out this hall, but don't forget your CatCard!

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.980
You need it to get in

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.340
Hello! My name is Leo

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.900
And I'm from Glendale, California

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.140
I'm an honors student here at the U of A

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.760
Pursuing a major in pre-business

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.600
With minors in Theater Arts and Spanish

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.340
Welcome to Yuma Hall!

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.060
Here we are at the front desk

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.440
At the front desk

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.360
You can check out anything you need

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.080
Like game equipment, cooking equipment, vacuum cleaners

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.860
If you're locked out of your room

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.020
You can come down here

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.320
Or you can come down just for a friendly chat

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.640
With our lovely desk assistants

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.820
When your checking things out, dont forget your CatCard!

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.580
This is our first floor common area

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.800
Where we have all our hall council meetings

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.800
We also have a wide variety of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.740
Hall-wide programs where residents can come

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.240
And meet tons of other students that live in the hall

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.360
Right outside the living room is our outside courtyard

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.340
Where we have hall-wide barbeques

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.940
And also have our bike racks

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.000
So, here we have our Faculty Fellow, Judy Temple

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.200
Judy, why don't you tell us a little about what you do here in Yuma

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.000
I visit every week

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.540
I love to have students come in talk to me

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.960
About their concerns and what their passions are

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.120
To have a faculty member who isn't your professor to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.560
Get to know

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.680
Great, thank you!

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.660
Hey Scott, what's up?

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.440
Hey Leo!

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.460
I'm just looking at photos from last year's Haunted Dungeon

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.900
Oh! tell me about Haunted Dungeon?

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.680
It's a lot of fun! Everybody gets dressed up

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.660
It's a great community activity and a lot of fun!

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.400
Cool! Are you in any of these pictures?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.940
Yeah!

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.060
I'm right there!

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.160
Sounds good! Well, I got to run but I'll see you later!

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.160
See ya!

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.200
Yuma is one of the honors halls on campus

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.120
All of the studetns are highly motivated

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.740
And must maintain a 3.5 GPA

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.680
Yuma is home to 184 honors students

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.020
Living on three floors

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.300
Each floor is divided into two wings

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.080
A male wing and a female wing

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.000
Each wing has its own individual theme

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.460
Here we have our 2nd floor study lounge

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.540
It has 2 sound-proof glass rooms where groups can study

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.820
It also has other areas where students can come together

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.760
And bond over common classes that they have

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.920
Another inviting area of Yuma is our 2nd floor library

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.100
Where you can check out books

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.140
Or you can study

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.080
Or sometimes it's nice to just relax!

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.960
The bathrooms in Yuma are single gender

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.660
Community style bathrooms

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.280
There is more than enough showers, tiolets, and sinks

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.840
So you never have to wait

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.460
The best part of the bathrooms is that they are cleaned daily

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.860
By our custodial staff

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.220
We are here with Emily and Julietta

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.620
I really like how you guys have arranged your room!

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.740
Your closets are really well organized

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.240
Oh thanks! Yeah, We left the drawers in there because

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.520
It conserves space

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.440
And it also opens up the room a lot

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.040
For us to just hang out in here

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.760
We have our beds bunked in here

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.860
And I really like it

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.700
They are very comfortable, sturdy

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.480
And they give us so much extra space in our room

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.040
Mhmm!

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.360
So, what is your favorite part of your room?

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.260
Well, I love the sink

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.560
It's just so convenient for us

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.980
You don't have to go outside your room to brush your teeth

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.100
Or wash your hands

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.020
Or even wash your dishes

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.280
You can just do that in here

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.780
Mhmm!

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.140
So how about you Emily, what's your favorite part of the room?

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.740
My favorite part is the window

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.220
It's really big and lets in lots of light

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.560
When it gets hot, we open it up

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.920
And we get a breeze in here

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.460
And that there is a great view of the trees

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.000
And the Fine Arts buildings

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.800
Very nice!

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.580
Well thanks so much for showing us your room!

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.300
Yeah, sure

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.020
Thank you!

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.400
See you later!

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.620
So that was a pretty nice room

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.480
But now it's time to see my room!

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.360
So, welcome to my room

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.100
As you can see

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.060
The rooms come with everything you need

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.360
It comes with a mini fridge

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.240
It comes with two desks

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.380
Two dressers

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.680
The amenities in the room include a local phone line

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.820
Free wifi

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.480
And also cable television

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.060
It's a good idea over the summer to get in touch with your roommate

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.040
And coordinate who's going to bring the TV

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.540
Who's going to bring the microwave

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.720
And who's going to bring the phone

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.080
Oh look! There's my roommate now

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.960
Dolton and I were randomly assigned to live together

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.480
In Yuma

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.860
It's gone really well

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.060
We've had no problems

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.160
We get along great!

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.080
We're both honors students

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.600
Dolton has one of the most intense majors I've ever heard of

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.480
I can't even remember all of it!

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.560
What was it again?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.180
I'm actually going for two degrees

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.660
The first degree would be in Material Science and Engineering

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.100
And the second degree is in Math

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.140
Woah!

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.580
Well, it's time to see more of Yuma

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.440
I'll see you later Dolton

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.880
Leo, can you show me how?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.860
Oh! Yeah, sure

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.120
You just kinda want to curl your fingers

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.000
There you go!

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.740
So Norantha, how come you wanted to live in Yuma?

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.480
I wanted to live in a honors dorm

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.060
That has a bunch of really nice people

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.460
And we have fun events all the time!

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.460
Yeah that's awesome!

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.100
Nice shot!

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.160
Here we have our 3rd floor TV lounge

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.440
Where you can come in, kick back, relax

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.320
Watch some TV

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.460
What are you guys up to tonight?

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.700
Oh, nothing much, just heading out to spring fling

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.460
Oh cool, what's spring fling?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.940
Well, it's one of the biggest student-run carnivals in the U.S.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.280
That sounds awesome!

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.640
You guys have a time!

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.920
See you guys later

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:30.660
*piano playing*

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.500
We have a very limited duet!

00:06:33.900 --> 00:07:04.840
*piano playing*

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.860
Well, that about wraps it up!

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.540
Thanks so much for stopping by Yuma!

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.860
If you have any more questions

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.860
There's a ton of info on the website!
