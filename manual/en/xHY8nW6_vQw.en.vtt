WALK THROUGH A WEDDING
with Justin &amp; Mary

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.060
The Night Shot

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.030
Hey, we're Justin &amp; Mary and today we're gonna talk
about how we photograph a night shot of the venue.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.360
This is a shot we really like to get,
especially for the couple's album,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.160
but also for the venue.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.000
The way we approach it is inspired by
a project that we used to do at RIT.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
With my professors Bill DuBois and Michael Perez

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.000
we used to do a architectural scene
photographed at night with a long exposure.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
Now, all the lighting from that scene,
to light up the building,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.360
would come from hundreds or thousands of people
with hand-held flashes or flash lights.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.000
To start we get a base exposure to see what's
happening with the ambient light.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.060
Once we have that base exposure, then it's time to play.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.000
In this case we brought out two B1 heads, one with a
Magnum Reflector an one with a Zoom Reflector.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.460
Now during our exposure, which is about 30 seconds
long, we are continuously firing the flash.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.360
And in this case we are just using the
test button on the back of the head.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.060
And so during the exposure,
the entire time the shutter is open,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.260
it is really important to keep moving.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.060
We probably fire the flash about
30 times during that exposure.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
We're gonna make sure we are heading
up top about three or four times more

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.160
than we are heading lower on the building,
because that light up top has to travel further.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.060
During that 30 second exposure, Mary and I probably
fired each of our flashes 30 to 50 times.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.300
