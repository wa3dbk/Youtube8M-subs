Welcome to week 10. We are in week 10 of this pregnancy. Baby number four

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.160
That's crazy, so today you guys get the real me. I'm just kind of sick

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.540
pregnancy sick and so I didn't do my makeup, I'm just wearing like clothes that are not just fancy or anything

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.140
So that's what you get. I'm sorry

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.100
Next week I'll dress up and look how beautiful and whatnot but today

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.420
you just get the real me. So here are some clips from last week

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.180
I went to Disney World last week so the the vlog before this, I was pretty nervous

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.050
I was like so stressed out and no idea what to expect. It was awesome. It was

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.600
so amazing. Here are some clips from then. So after a lot of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:57.360
transportation, I finally got on the Disney magical Express and let me tell you it was so

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.200
magical and I ruined it all

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.600
So I got really really carsick cause' like I couldn't see the front of the road, I couldn't see anything

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.900
I don't know, sometimes I just get really carsick, and I got so

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.799
carsick that I was like okay

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.459
I think I'm gonna throw up, but I don't want to. I was just like taking deep breaths

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.440
and I'm like no, I'm gonna calm myself down. I'm gonna have self control, and then I'm like -

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.040
I threw up everywhere like a little kid. I didn't even like ask for anything to throw up with and I tried to catch it with my hand

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.520
I got it everywhere and then i'm like, don't stop here, stop over, sorry

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.980
That was embarrassing

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:54.520
Throwing up on the magical express, that's because i'm pregnant! And I couldn't tell you guys, yet. I ruined the magic. This week i'm really

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.920
excited because I get to make my first doctor's appointment

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.860
I will get to find out if the baby is growing and if everything is good

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.960
It always, always brings peace of mind to me, to have my first doctor visit because I'm like okay

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.160
yes, I really am pregnant. Okay yes, there really is a baby in me, I'm not just getting that. Okay yes

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.599
It's alive and everything as well

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.260
you know and it just brings me peace of mind

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.180
So I'm excited about that. So as you know from the clip that we already showed you, I did throw up

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.100
one time this week, and I got very close another time, but I just like the second time I used mind control

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.560
and I just laid down and I was like I am not sick

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.200
I am not going to throw up, everything is going to be fine. I will not be sick

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.040
It was good, but it was hard. It's so hard, I don't like throwing up. I really hate it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.240
Even though that was the only time that I've thrown up in this entire pregnancy, which is amazing. It's absolutely

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.768
amazing, I don't want to like dog on anybody that is having a rough pregnancy. I, if I were you and I were having a

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.940
really hard time pregnancy

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.850
and you were watching my videos, and I'm having like this great pregnancy, and I've always thrown up once. I would probably be mad

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.739
honestly, I'd probably be mad because I've been there. Here are some pictures from when I was the most sick

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.479
I've ever been, not that there gonna be any pictures of me throwing up, but it was with my first pregnancy

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.720
James, my oldest boy, so here's a picture of James - and here's a picture of me being pregnant with James - and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.960
boom

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.320
So those are some of them, but I have to tell you that was probably the most miserable time of my entire life

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.200
And I'm not just saying that, I just got to thinking about this pregnancy vlog today, and I was like you know what? Yes

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.180
I'm having an amazing pregnancy, I really am even though i'm not necessarily feeling my best

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.720
This is a great pregnancy

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.540
I cannot complain, Really, I cannot complain because it's amazing

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.940
but I just want you guys to know, it's not been like this always. I haven't always had this amazing

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.540
pregnancy. I had a terrible one with James. It was really hard

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.980
It was just miserable

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.300
Throwing up multiple, multiple times a day and wondering how I would ever gain weight

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.300
Being alone because we had just gotten married had a honeymoon, baby, and we moved away from my family

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.720
So I'm like, just barely married, and I'm like my husband has to work

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.260
Nobody's here to take care of me, and my sickness. It was so hard

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.640
But I'm not here to complain about that because I'm, I'm also grateful to have that experience so I can be so much more grateful

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.459
for this pregnancy because it's amazing and I'm not gonna lie

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.940
it's amazing. So anyways the point is I understand if you're going through a really hard pregnancy. I honestly

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.200
the only reason I feel like I'm doing better right now is because fourth time's the charm

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.389
and I'm finally getting the hang of things and

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.820
realizing what my body needs and just kind of learning to listen to my body so I feel ya

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.180
I feel ya, and I'm sorry if you're having a terrible pregnancy

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.440
So baby news this week, the baby's toes are formed and the baby's ears are

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.120
formed. Basically all of the major organs should be formed or

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.549
almost complete at this point and the baby is one and a half inches long and four grams

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:24.320
and if you don't know what 4 grams is, it's like four, it's like holding little four little baby paper clips

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.540
Okay not really baby paper clips, normal paper clips, so that's very light

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.520
Imagine

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.540
So cute. Might be a paper clip baby

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.480
One and a half inches long,

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.980
is exciting. The baby is getting bigger every week

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.500
I feel like I'm just hitting a huge milestone in getting the baby bigger

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.980
It's exciting to me. In preparation for going on my Disney trip, I went and got some new clothes, which I'm not wearing right now, ofcourse

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.020
But it's helped a lot in my sickness actually. The new clothes that I got are like a lot

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.220
looser on me and because of that

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.020
I have no pressure on my belly. Sometimes even just the slightest bit of pressure will make me nauseous

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.880
so that's super helpful if you didn't know that already and this week in going to Disney I

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.420
realized something that I just can't go without and it's vitamins

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.920
I don't know why I'm such a rebel, but I've always wanted to just not take vitamins

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.000
And I think it started because I'm just really bad at swallowing pills, and so it makes me gag

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.150
even the thought of it

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.000
So, so I've just been like I don't even want to take them and then I feel horrible

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.100
In not taking them and then starting to take them just in the past week or so I have started feeling so much better

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.019
It's like a night and day difference not taking my pill, my vitamins versus taking them

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.130
Now it's peanut butter belly time, peanut butter belly time

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:02.740
Belly time. Here's my belly week 10, I'm a fourth of the way through, i'm so excited

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.100
Almost through my first trimester

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.300
