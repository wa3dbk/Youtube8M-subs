00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.129
Okay, now we're talking about the shutter
priority creative zone mode on the Canon 40D.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:14.210
In order to set your camera into shutter priority
mode, you need to turn the dial on the top

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.170
side of your camera on the left side, when
you're facing the camera from the back. It

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:28.310
is indicated with a upper case T, lower case
v, so there my camera is lined up with the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:39.710
white line on the body, with the Tv on the
mode dial. So I'm now in a shutter priority

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.680
mode. What I can do now is manually set and
control the shutter setting, but the aperture

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.190
will automatically be set to compensate for
my shutter setting. If I hold down the shutter

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:05.260
button, I can use the main control dial to
increase or decrease my shutter settings.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:14.120
So right now I'm increasing it, and I can
go all the way to 1/4000th of a second. Now

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:24.010
you can see right now my aperture is blinking,
which means that, that's going to be not enough

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:32.780
light. Even at the whitest aperture 1/4000th
of a second is really, really, fast so I need

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:43.700
to scroll back down here to find a shutter
speed that will work. Now the aperture stops

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.890
blinking at 1/1250th of a second, and it looks
like that will give me an appropriate exposure.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.650
If I wanted to scroll back down the other
way, toward bold setting, I can go so far

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:14.570
as to, let's see here, looks like thirty seconds.
Thirty seconds is the longest shutter speed

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:22.530
I can manually program without putting the
camera into a bold mode. But you can see again

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:33.350
that the aperture is blinking on the camera,
letting me know that the exposure with thirty

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.090
seconds will be way too much. The picture
in this case, is just going to be totally

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.010
blown out, there's too much light. So I'm
going to scroll back the other way, slow it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.601
down, let's speed up the shutter speed here
a little bit until two seconds, two and a

00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:58.530
half seconds, and it looks like at the smallest
aperture, two and a half seconds will give

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.260
me an appropriate exposure. So again, shutter
priority mode is mainly to give you control

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.069
over the sharpness of your picture, a faster
shutter speed will give you a sharper image,

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.560
a slower shutter speed will give you the sense
of movement a sense of action. So, take some

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.000
time to mess around with it, get some experience
and be creative.
