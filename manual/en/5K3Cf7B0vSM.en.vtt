Hey, guys,
Chef Mark here.

00:00:02.067 --> 00:00:06.233
Today I'm gonna show you how
to get a meal on the table really quick,

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.367
everything done
at the same time.

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.033
We get a lot of questions
about that.

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:10.167
I'm here in the meat department,

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:12.367
there's a lot of
ready to cook options here.

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.333
I'm gonna grab chicken parm,

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.000
I've already been to seafood,
so I've grabbed a piece of salmon

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.467
with our cracked pepper blend
with a little bit of brown sugar.

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:22.733
While I was there, just grabbed
a horseradish cream sauce.

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.733
This technique
is really easy to do.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.133
We'll combine it, everything's
gonna be hot at the same time.

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:30.367
Let's go grab our veg.

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:32.533
All right, so welcome to
the fresh-cut veggies section

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.367
on our produce department.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.800
This whole section
is really geared

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.300
around helping you
make great meals easy.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.533
And what could be easier than
grabbing a package of asparagus

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.267
and maybe a package
of Brussels sprouts here,

00:00:45.267 --> 00:00:46.767
putting maybe
a little bit of basting oil

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:48.867
and throwing it in the same oven
as our other stuff

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:51.667
and it's all gonna come out
the same time, nice and hot.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:54.100
How easy is that?

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.633
When you get these items home,
it's real easy to put together.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:59.333
You just need to account
for the amount of time

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.233
that these things
go in the oven.

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:03.533
350, same oven
we're gonna do it.

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.200
If I were doing chicken parm
and asparagus,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.367
I would put the chicken parm in first.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.467
Usually proteins I keep
towards the top of the oven

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:13.000
and my veg keep
towards the bottom.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.300
Because these take about 25 minutes,
a half an hour or so,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.867
whereas the asparagus,
10-12 minutes, that's all you need.

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:23.500
So once this is in the oven
for 18 minutes or so,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.400
I'm gonna throw my asparagus in.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.000
They're gonna come out
at the same time,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.633
plate 'em up,
they're both nice and hot.

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:30.700
Today we're gonna do the salmon
and the Brussels sprouts.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.567
So, my Brussels sprouts
are gonna go in first

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:38.367
because these take about 25 minutes
or a half an hour or so in the oven.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:41.233
So, bring 'em home and I just do
a little bit of basting oil,

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:43.200
salt and pepper on these.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.367
And they go into the oven
on a sheet pan,

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:50.600
which I covered
with parchment.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.867
So here, just a little bit of a toss.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:54.833
Make sure you get 'em
nice and coated.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.000
Right onto the sheet pan.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600
And when you put 'em on here,
spread 'em all out.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.200
The nice thing
about roasting a vegetable

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.133
is if I spread it out
in the oven,

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.767
we've got a big amount
of surface area

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:07.600
which is gonna brown real nice.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.233
So that goes in the oven.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:12.300
It's gonna go for
about 15 minutes or so.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.100
Then I put my salmon in the oven.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.267
These come with a little bit
of our brown sugar

00:02:16.267 --> 00:02:17.733
and our cracked pepper blend.

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:23.400
So all I gotta do for these is put
a little of this on the top, coat it over,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.833
and now all we have to do
is put our Brussels sprouts in.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.100
15 minutes later,
we put our salmon in.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.000
It's just that easy.

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:41.267
All right, so here's
the Brussels sprouts.

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:45.033
Now I got my salmon.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.100
Looks gorgeous.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.567
But here's one more thing.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.833
I want to make sure that you have
one of these and you're using it.

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.400
We're gonna
give you a time

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.500
and it's gonna say about 25 minutes
or whatever the time is.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.100
However, I want you to make sure
that that thing is right at,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.600
for the salmon,
it's gonna be right at 130 degrees.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.367
Two minutes go by,
it's gonna be right at 140.

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:07.100
So, all that's left to do
is plate this thing

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.400
'cause they're both nice and hot.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.033
Put a little bit of Brussels sprouts
on the bottom.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:15.033
I like some of those
crispy little leaves in there.

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:19.767
And this, our salmon,
with that brown sugar that's melted,

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:23.333
made a nice glaze,
a little peppery mix in it.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:25.867
And for me,
you pair it up with a little sauce.

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:28.633
We've got our horseradish cream.

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:30.833
Find this in the seafood department.

00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:32.200
Right over the top.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.800
Nice horseradish contrast
to that nice sweetness.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.000
A real simple paring, done,
both hot at the same time.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.367
This meal is real easy
to put together.
