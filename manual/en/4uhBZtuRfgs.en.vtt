00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.800
NORBERG: Isn’t there a lack of credibility
right now for the Commission? It began with

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.249
a fiscal pact on debts and deficits, and just
one year later several countries broke those

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:26.809
rules. But at least you would never bail out
countries that broke the rules. And in 2010

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:31.740
you did- but at least you wouldn’t buy their
sovereign government bonds, but then you did.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.940
And now we have this new fiscal pact, and
you have new targets for Spain’s deficit

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.140
and you have already renegotiated that, that
deficit rule. So the question is: Why should

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.799
we take your word for granted this time?

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.600
ALGIRDAS SEMETA: It’s very important to
differentiate very clearly, the political

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.559
decisions which are based on statistics, and
statistics itself. And I think that in cases

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:08.779
which you mentioned statistics was published
correctly, of course with that problem was

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:19.660
Greek deficit figures for 2009, and actually
our experts helped to solve these problems.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.840
BOLKESTIEN: By letting Italy in when it was
not satisfying the criteria, they could later

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.619
not very well refuse Greece. That is the true
reason why Greece was let in- not because

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.469
they falsified their statistics, which they
did of course, but because the European Council-

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.530
which is the heads of states and governments,
thought that they could not refuse Greece,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.590
what they had allowed Italy, so there you
have the curse of the evil deed.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:58.610
SEMETA: So, it means that statistics already
produces a good quality basis for sound decision

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.590
making, but what we wanted to do to go further
and to ensure that never in the future we

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:16.960
will have, you know, any political interference
into statistics- and this is what we proposed

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.560
was our regulation.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.160
NORBERG:This lack of guts among politicians, what’s the reason for this? 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.380
What part of human nature explains this?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.980
BOLKESTEIN: Well, (laughter) that’s a big
question. I’m not really used to talking

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:41.120
about human nature. But what I do know is
that not many people like standing alone;

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:52.340
most go with the herd…although people who
stand alone are not necessarily incorrect.
