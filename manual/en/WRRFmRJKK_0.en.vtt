george Zimmerman will participate in a
boxing match that will be on

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.819
pay-per-view and also online on March
1st

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.219
I we don't know exactly who he's going
to fight against but he says that the

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.799
proceeds from the boxing match will go
to charity

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.670
we don't know what what percentage up
the proceeds will go toward the charity

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.890
and he refuses to name what the charity
is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.029
he didn't speak to the press to talk
about what I want to do this boxing

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.099
matches that boxing is a new to me it's
something I picked up well before

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.810
the incident and it's something that I
like to have courses referring to the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.720
Trayvon Martin

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.030
incident I enjoyed and I kept up with it
and I was able to lose a tremendous

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.500
amount of weight and get healthy
lifestyle

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.850
now he's talking about how you use
boxing way before the Trayvon Martin

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.000
incident and you know it's something you
really enjoy something you really like

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.039
remember during this trial has MMA
instructor went up to talk about how

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:48.579
friggin

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.800
terrible he was if you remember take a
look he made

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.559
train two to three days a week at the
most time

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.280
and how many how long with a response
from and how long the normal training

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.989
sessions

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.180
don't ring sessions are two hours long
are you on a scale of one to 10 and when

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.450
tourism in Prescott to you want number
would you sign the disabilities

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.020
.5 national one yes

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.390
so jury had a price per year give or
take a few months that he was involved

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.220
with

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.490
your facility in grappling d

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.610
ya McQueen up 0.5

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.060
21 really would you give him on your
skin 0

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.619
you 1 new why I'm so much progress

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.630
was not that he made such little
progress is a tremendous amount of work

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.140
alright so he's not exactly the bath I
mean I was his defense right but he was

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.380
so weak that he had to use is gone
against Juan Martin

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.659
now keep that in mind because the game
who is a rapper

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.509
an artist i has decided he wants to be
the person who fights george Zimmerman

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.590

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.900
yeah i i don't know that there was on
live in apparently his

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.159
you will have an aggressive guy yeah I
hear yours truly stumbling into a bush

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.670
is like

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.930
well here we go here man I'm gonna but
now they don't allow guns in the rain so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.590
I don't know how it's going to work out
for george but the game did release a

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.970
statement he said the following:

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.879
I'll be the fuck out of him I boxing for
me I would be boxing for the legacy of

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.860
Trayvon Martin and for his family

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.420
I would block him to knock him out I
would definitely take pleasure in it

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.580
it's legal and I want to show him you
can solve their disputes without a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.159
weapon

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.470
you know the game has a tad too trail on
Martin on is like

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.580
yeah it's that's amazing and there it is
that's

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.590
it's on his leg okay so I mean I guess
that's fitting

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.000
I now look back to the main event

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.690
george Zimmerman comes out so he wants
to box durian struck me

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.879
to do just had a trial is going to show
you were in New argued

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.159
your the weakest person in america
you're the worst

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.580
fighter you went from 0.5 to 1 added in
scale

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.159
any you had and you got in his whole
defense was I got my ass kicked by

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.540
17-year-old

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.450
that I jumped now he claims of course he
jumped the Brier iraq

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.819
the one that you followed with a gun and
him according to you

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.330
he mold you to appoint you were afraid
for your life

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.090
and had to shoot him in the chest and
then now you can come out and say

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.919
on I've been boxing a long time and I
got good skills so I liked it

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.780
how can you say that after call like
just after the trial how could you say

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.410
that

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.270
it's because he sighed he loves the
spotlight he loves it loves loves it

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.610
and of course he was bullshitting I mean
he treats me

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.540
look think about it this way to be
trained to be an MMA fighter

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.620
even if he's back he can't wait for the
fight right

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.290
so he walks in a tree by Martin point
committee peaks is produced by jill

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.400
I guarantee to god that weapon yes he
didn't get his head bashed in all that

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.080
is now

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.680
for all that time to the point where you
but all I am about to die

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.729
be the minute he lost opera and he
pulled the weapon

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.620
dasher george Zimmerman is so even
though there's a bullshit published City

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.680
ever think warm and he's gonna make
money out of it I gotta be honest

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.240
i'm looking forward to right kinda wanna
go see it live

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.180
yeah I'm not gonna lie so I was saying
he says know he'll take any comments

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.590
right

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.020
he he's and his promoters like I you
could be a black eye

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.389
that's fine I could be anybody rate okay
great and I thought for a second like

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.389
of man wanna be great if I got in there

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.750
just kicked the shit out of him right
but then I thought

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.750
I'm not trained that would be the

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.039
can you imagine losing the 20 min you
know all right now

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.300
I don't know her like I had a little bit
apparently oh i know i know: get to know

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.090
what we believe that we have nothing to
do

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.979
we have a hike that would be literally
the most embarrassing thing that has

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:44.919
ever happened

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:50.120
anyone in the history the United States
Arran burn is gray would be like well I

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.680
know I got shot in a duel but

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.960
I wasn't as bad as what happened to go
would reserve it okay

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.430
I P so but now that I saw the video the
game

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.250
you got a brother I you got a man you
gotta go for go over with the game in

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.130
there let's see what happens okay

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.190
and you tell me to be plucked I i hated

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.259
but at the same time I get it you tell
me you not gonna watch

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.430
somebody kicked the shit outta george
Zimmerman about that states brought you

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.630

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.669
be literally im gonna make a lot of
money

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.009
of killing someone right that's the
fuckin problem it's like

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.449
are the No and so now it hits and that's
why wrestling works right they set up a

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.120
bad guy you want to watch the back I get
his ass kicked

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.270
