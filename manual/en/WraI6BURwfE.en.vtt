00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.300
Eugh, finally managed to cough up that bug...along with

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.540
some other questionable things I don’t remember.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.220
How did I manage to swallow

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.280
an entire lightbulb in one piece?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.920
Well, I’d better find someone to team up with

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.100
before Ruby catches up.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.120
I wonder where Jaune is.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.900
He seems like an easy person to push around.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.240
Nah, he’s probably dead.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.960
Come out, whoever you are.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.680
Unless you’re Ruby, then just stay there―

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.740
UWOT?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.060
Hey, come on, guys! I don’t like killing animals!

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.780
Let’s talk about this like civilized...

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.760
Okay. Guess I’ll let these do the talking.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.900
I hope she’s talking about her―

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.100
She’s not.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.020
Bollocks.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.200
Alright mate, you got me! I can negotiate―

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.560
Please don’t be Ruby.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.020
Please don’t be Weiss.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.900
Oh good, you’re not the annoying one.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.420
Mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine―

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.480
Hey, I'm back!

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.440
―NEIN!

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.160
Goddammit!

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.280
Hey! What did that tree ever do to you?

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.740
The tree―what the―are you―are you ****ing serious?!!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.020
The Beowolves are over there, you know!

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.560
I know that, you idiot!

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.180
Maybe if you didn’t jump in front of me like that―

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.520
Uhhhh, do you two need a minute?

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.060
Ugh, maybe I should have set you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.640
on fire instead of the trees.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.860
Get a room!

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.360
We should be safe here.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.400
You just can’t help yourself, can you?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.040
What?

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.040
I can deal with the slave trading.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.900
I can deal with the Faunus-hunting.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.980
I can even deal with the fact that you burn

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.140
every living being that defies you.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.480
But not the trees!

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.580
It’s not their fault you have a drug problem!

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.260
That’s it. I’m going to team up with Jaune.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.380
Did that make you happy, Weiss? Do I fit in now?!!

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.540
Ruby, why?!!

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.500
I’m so glad you decided to come with me.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.960
I was passed out!

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.400
You didn’t even let me suffocate like you promised...

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.420
You sure looked nice when you were unconscious.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.220
Well, at least nothing else can hurt me while you’re ar―

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.220
Ow!

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.380
Oh, whoops!

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.740
Uh here, let me help you up so I can touch you.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.680
No, I’m fine! See? All better!

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.440
Did you hurt your rear end too? Here, let me check.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.560
Take off your pants.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.420
Really, I’m fine!

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.160
Trust me...just close your eyes...

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.520
Uh...okay.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.580
Your skin is so soft...

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.340
Uhh, Pyrrha?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.340
Huh?

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.340
We should really find our artifacts now.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.240
I think I just did.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.640
Hey, sweetie! Are you lost?

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.460
Ohh, those are, like, so fetch!

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.020
Did you make them yours―

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.380
OW!

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.520
What did you do that for?

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.520
I was just trying to be nice!

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.400
Hey, stop attacking my friend!

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.520
So, like, now I’m gonna have to eat you.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.480
Not if I have him first!

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.040
Hon, no offence, love you lots,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.840
but you’ve been, like, seriously putting on weight lately.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.900
Oh! Well, you ain’t no slim figure yourself, sweetie.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.080
Like, you ate all those beeping shadows earlier.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.920
Let me have some of that man-meat!

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.940
Oh my God, you are such a fatty.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.160
Yeah...I’m just gonna kill you both now.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.400
Come on, hon, I’m sure you’re delish.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.660
Oh, you slut.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.660
Snake. Snake? SNAAAAAAAAA―

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.740
Professor Ozpin,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.600
all the students have survived the landing.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.940
Even Jaune Arc?

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.340
Even Jaune Arc.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.440
Well, this just got boring. I’m going back to the school.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.400
Also, Miss Schnee has set the forest

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.300
on fire about five minutes ago.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.100
And now it’s interesting again.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.080
We should really put out that fire

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.160
before it spreads any further.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.340
You’d think Miss Schnee would have done it herself

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.120
with all the ice glyphs she has...

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.600
Well, I did tell them to destroy everything in their path.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.820
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.800
What relics did you use this year for them to find?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.720
Hm, I didn’t expect them to actually get this far.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.280
I sure hope they don’t find those cursed chess pieces

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.220
I’ve been trying to destroy for years.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.360
Blake, what’s your favourite colour?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.860
I’ll give you one guess.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.180
Yellow!

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.260
You know what, why not.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.640
Hey, want to hear a joke?

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.280
No.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.440
What do you get when a horse

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.360
and a human have a baby at night?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.540
A Faunus?

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.060
No, a night-mare!

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.400
That was terrible.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.380
Okay, okay, okay, I got another one.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.160
What would Faunus have if we stopped hunting them?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.900
What?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.900
A “stable” population!

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.420
That’s not funny...

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.920
Alright, last one.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.600
Don’t you dare...

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.740
What’s the difference between a horse and a Faunus?

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.220
It’s illegal to kill horses!

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.760
Motherfu―!

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.260
So why did we come in here again?

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.180
Oh, I thought that maybe this dark creepy cave

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.260
where no one can see us will be

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.800
a likely place to find the relics.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.040
Um...okay.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.280
Listen, I’m sorry I overreacted

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.340
when you came to help me down.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.020
Blood loss does funny things to your head.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.840
But I think we can overlook this

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.100
and become good friends.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.400
You look really good in dim lighting...

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.520
Ooh, even better.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.060
Oh, no. Hey, help me find the torch, will ya?

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.020
No problem.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.400
Um, Pyrrha? That’s not the torch.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.200
Shh, shh shh...

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.620
Okay. Getting weird now. Please don’t touch me there.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.760
Huh? Wait, that’s actually not me.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.840
I’ll have what she’s having.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.160
Hey, I found him first!

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.640
Too bad, this one is mine now!

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.120
Jaune, tell this oversized arachnid who you really want!

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.860
I don’t know who to pick!

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.480
Let’s make a bet.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.560
I’ll throw him over there and whoever

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.680
reaches him first gets to keep him!

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.220
WHAT?!!

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.960
You’re on!

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.500
Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait, don’t I get a say in―

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.160
Hey Ren!

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.720
And you didn’t help me out...why?

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.360
Boop!
