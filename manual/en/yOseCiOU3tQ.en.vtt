00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
chef buck here and today

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.069
we're going to cook us up a quinoa

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.799
pudding you know this is a great

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.300
variation on a rice pudding you know is

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.679
it healthier than rice pudding I don't

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.110
know I'm not a scientist you know but

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.000
quinoa makes a great substitute here

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.820
we're going to cook it up just like we

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.350
would rice you know one part quinoa the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.960
two parts water and we're going to throw

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.269
a cinnamon stick in here too for flavor

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.240
you know bring it up to a boil then

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.580
reduce the heat down to a simmer then

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.410
cover it up and let it cook away for

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.640
about 12 or 15 minutes you know you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.559
don't want to mess with it while it's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.809
cooking you know treat it just like you

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.280
would rice and then afterwards we're

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.920
going to go ahead and fluff it up a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.750
little bit you can see all the water has

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.100
been absorbed you know we're going to go

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.020
ahead and get the cinnamon stick out of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.700
here because we don't need that anymore

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.590
and then we'll go ahead and set this

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.960
aside and work on the creamy part of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.780
this dish in a small saucepan we're

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.949
going to take one can of coconut milk

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.010
we're going to add some minced ginger

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
and then a little bit of brown sugar you

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.039

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.320
heat you know maybe on medium heat you

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.729
know slowly cuz it's milk you know you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.080
don't want to burn it this is about as

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.360
much as you want it to bubble right here

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.369
you know get it heated through then

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.020
reduce the heat and we're gonna gotta

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.850
stir it around a little bit you know for

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.920
about five minutes and then we'll go

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.030
ahead and get it off the heat and go

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.520
back to our quinoa

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.340
we'll add some raisins you know a little

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.170
bit of a minced orange peel you know a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.420
heaping teaspoon and this is a great

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.950
flavor you know so definitely use the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.259
orange peeled and then we're going to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.970
put some cardamom in there about a 1/2 a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.100
teaspoon but if you don't have cardamom

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.560
you know use nutmeg because we did that

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.700
and it tasted fantastic a user cardamon

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.380
if you got it you know because the guy

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.840
kind of gives it a little Indian flavor

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.820
there you know your quinoa still warm

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.890
you know your milk still hot you know go

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.360
ahead and pour that in there stir it

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.799
around and then that's pretty much it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.380
you know you can cover it set it aside

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.180
you know let it thicken up a little bit

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.250
you know and then you can eat it warm

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.590
you can throw it in a bowl and put it in

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.780
the fridge and have it later cold you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.640
know it tastes fantastic oh when it's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.619
cold we usually eat a little bit of it

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.510
while it's hot and then finish it off

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.489
later if it's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.780
