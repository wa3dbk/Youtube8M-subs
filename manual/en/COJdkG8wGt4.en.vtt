00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:11.059
I really like playing soccer and
baseball and playing a ping-pong with my

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:22.220
family's Elsa really fun and I also like
playing the guitar he was five years old

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.420
when I actually found the lump just
thought you know maybe he got sick and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.830
it was a lymph node that was just
enlarged and it would go away for about

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.490
a year it stayed and got bigger and so
we finally decided we need to get look

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.880
into getting it checked up we get this
call from this pediatric surgeon who

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.080
it's after hours but he called and said
the biopsy came back and I have some

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.950
terrible news and at that moment I think
it was just complete and utter shock

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.180
what I can tell you as I remember him
saying you're going up to Doernbecher on

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.630
Monday morning if the clinic was open
right now you would be up there right

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.360
now when we got off the phone we just we
talked and cried and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.440
try to figure out what was the next step
we decided that our closet in our master

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.340
bedroom that we went in we would go in
there when we couldn't handle it and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.930
just go cry or take the phone and call
somebody he was on chemotherapy for

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.150
three and a half years and he still goes
you know to get checkups so we know the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.040
nurses we know the doctors so definitely
they feel like part of our family now

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.400
I think the compassion that was shown to
us is so essential to healing if you're

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.470
gonna go through something that is so
traumatizing life and death that's the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.510
place you want to be yeah it kind of
just became like every month or so I

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.210
just go up there and get my treatment
but yeah I just became part of my life

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.720
really

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.510
it was an early rapid responder so he
was in remission within the first few

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.330
weeks of treatment the outlook for grant
is as positive we just live every day I

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.500
certainly don't think about the future
about what it holds it's really taught

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.870
me that live every day and love your
kids and tell them you love them

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.970
so I was looking this animal book and
there's this view different bird it had

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.580
like purple red and all these different
colors so some of the colors on the shoe

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.010
are from that makes me feel very cool it
was just the awesome if someone at my

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.880
school that I know just showed up
putting my shoe and I could say hey I've

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.720
made that shoe

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.569
I have a couple of ideas thing might
want to be maybe a doctor that would be

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:06.310
awesome fun or a pilot or an architect
we could not have felt more welcomed and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.440
more loved by the staff at Doernbecher
and by the people

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.670
I cannot say thank you enough for anyone
or any organization that gives money to

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.239
Doernbecher because we owe grants life
to the treatment and the research that

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.340
goes on there I'm feeling great
