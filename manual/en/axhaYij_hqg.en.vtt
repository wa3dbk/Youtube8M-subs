00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.300
Oh no, it's so scary.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.420
Oooooooooooooh--!

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.960
Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror indie game released in 2014.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.060
You play as a security guard who has to survive through the night

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.220
by tracking a bunch of manic sentient robot animals using

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.220
security cameras and by closing doors and flicking on lights

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.420
which are powered by an ever draining power meter.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.040
Because video game, I guess.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.520
It really is as simple as that.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.100
There's no player movement, so the entire experience is pretty much

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.840
based around managing your power while tracking the machines.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.380
The goal being to survive from midnight till 6 a.m. in-game for,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.180
you guessed it,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.400
five nights,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.640
which takes about ten minutes of real time per day.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.960
And I do admit, it's quite a novel idea.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.860
It's not a typical horror setting, like a haunted mansion or an abandoned hospital.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.620
And being forced to look at and track your potential killers

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.420
in a similar way to Slender or SCP-Containment Breach

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.340
while also being completely powerless

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.220
is an awesome setup for a game like this.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.540
The visual and audio design is all pretty stellar,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.040
and the fact that the entire game was built by only one guy is pretty impressive.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.200
But things quickly start to fall apart for me as the game adds more and more to this conceit

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.420
While the fan theories and the underlying plot is pretty interesting,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.380
the reason as to why everything is happening seems so contrived to me.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.580
I know it seems kind of petty to pick apart things like this,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.340
but context is what makes me care about the whole situation.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.080
It's pretty much the deciding factor as to whether I will want to keep playing the game or not,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.620
especially when it comes to horror.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.500
It's just the little things like, "Why does keeping a door closed use energy?",

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.160
or, "If the guy on the phone knew about this whole killer robot thing, why has no one done anything about it?"

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.400
PHONE: "There's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll be fine!

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.080
PHONE: "Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.560
They'll probably try to... forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit."

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.960
But you know what? I can kind of forgive this picky shit.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.920
If I can almost forgive nonsensical bollocks like the star child in Mass Effect 3, why should this be any exception?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.500
But the thing that gets me most about this game is how... utterly boring it is.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.560
I admit there's a certain level of tension and buildup the first time you sit down and play the game

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.980
because the unknown is always what's most scary in anything horror-based.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520
You don't know what's gonna happen when these creatures get you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.340
and that makes it all the more tense the closer and closer they get

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.920
to grabbing you and shoving you in an empty animal suit.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.540
Then you do find out what happens.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.680
Yeah, it's a jump scare. The easiest, laziest way to scare someone.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.500
The jump scare is nothing more than a primal response.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.520
You don't really have a choice how you react to it.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.720
A sudden loud noise, of course, is gonna make you jump out of your skin.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.400
Remember those screamers people used to email and post around when they thought it was cool?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.100
Yeah, it's the same thing.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.940
You have that initial hit of adrenaline, but it's quickly followed by a,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.580
"Oh, fuck you."

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.400
Horror shouldn't be about throwing loud noises and spinning flashy shapes in your face randomly,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.100
it should be built around something more.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.580
But again, this is just me.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.980
I know plenty of people are happy with how predictable and stagnant the majority of the horror genre is today.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.460
Personally, I find fucked up imagery and intelligent use of sound much more effective than any tired jump scare.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.080
And there was something about the way the animatronic creatures were animated that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.820
gradually made me think of them as more comical than scary.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.160
"Hello!"

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.560
Oh, you cheeky rascals! You come back here.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.420
I swear those gosh darn munchkins really like to play mean tricks on me! Ha ha

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.140
"Woah!"

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.360
It just pisses me off how people can be so complacent with the horror genre,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.200
thinking themselves up to just accept that a chair moving a little bit is enough to warrant their hard-earned money.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.680
But I'm getting distracted, back to the bear game thing.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.140
I am very picky when it comes to horror. It really needs to be something special to impress me,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.280
which makes the ultimate failure of Five Nights even more upsetting.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.800
It was so close to being something truly special, but it's the execution that lets is down.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.260
You know, it's now even a problem that this game alone has.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.840
I'm struggling to think of any horror property that can maintain the scare momentum after

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.800
showing you everything it has up its sleeve,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.360
because the more you play Five Nights at Freddy's, the more you get into a rhythm,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.280
and the more you get into that rhythm of power management and the like,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.120
the less you think about the atmosphere and the immediate threat.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.120
And by then, the scares are gone.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.140
Failing becomes more of a chore than a scary experience

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.820
because you don't want to hear that stupid asshole go through the same bit of boring dialogue again.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.220
Speaking of that guy, what's the deal with him?

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.360
[phone ringing]

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.020
[phone ringing]

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.000
PHONE: "He-hello, oh, uh, sorry. I haven't spoken to you in a while.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.320
I was just finishing my recording session for the next How to Train Your Dragon movie.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.640
So, uh, yeah, keep pressing the lights or whatever and do the thing,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.840
and try not to be killed by the manic, demonic, murderous animatronic robots or whatever.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.320
So yeah, you do that.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.180
Okay, cool. Have a good one, man.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.280
He-hello?"

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.040
At one point, I was playing and the game totally cheated me as well.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.600
Look at this, I can see that bird fucker right there!

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.040
But because I turn off the lights for half a second, I instantly fail,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.520
and it's super telegraphed when the game decides that you're fucked.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.180
It makes it so you can't close the doors or do anything, so it's just a case of,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.000
"Well, I guess I'd better open and close the camera to get this shit over with."

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.660
So I guess now's the part where I have no choice but to at least mention the horrible fandom this game

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.120
has miraciously spawned purely from existing and getting the coverage that it has.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.220
It's what happens when an army of immensely popular

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.820
YouTubers introduce an indie game to the stupid masses.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.480
It's like the fandoms need to play catch up for only just gaining the exposure.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.480
I won't harp on about this for too long—seeing as there will be a future video coming up that fits in

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.000
perfectly with this topic in a more general way, so I don't want to repeat myself—

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.700
but I'll summarise everything you need to know about what this fandom can be like

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.420
with this one simple picture.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.060
Five Nights at Freddy's is another classic case of the fan reaction and exposure being

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.200
much more interesting than the game itself.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.540
And while there are pockets of cool ideas and story beats here and there,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.220
when it comes down to it, the end product just isn't quite worth the fuss.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.460
To me, it ends up being something that's more entertaining to watch other people play

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.620
in highly edited little ten-minute segments,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.060
than it is to actually sit down and play myself.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.480
And while there will be people who

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.100
-- Boo!

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.060
R-roar!

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.720
S-scary scream noises.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.500
What was I saying?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.740
Oh, who cares?

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.120
"Five Nights at Freddy's"? More like...

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.560
"Five Nights of using YouTube culture to gain exposure," am I right?!

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.580
Eh... yeah...

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.840
So what do you think?

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.640
Was I a little too harsh on that gosh darn bear freak,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.920
or was I not harsh enough?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.660
What do you like or dislike about the game?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.800
Whatever it is, feel free to start a discussion in the comments below.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.980
I'll be watching.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.300
Like a bear, or -- or a bird, or a -- a rabbit, or a -- a fox thing, yeah.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.740
Anyways, thanks for watching.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.560
All comments and ratings are appreciated,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.420
make sure to check out some of my other videos,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.780
I'll see ya next time,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.720
Bye!

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.620
AQUAMAN: Well, I thought game was pretty scary and cool.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.300
Fuck you, your opinion's wrong.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.340
ALEX: You drew that picture that I showed earlier, didn't you?

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.160
AQUAMAN: No.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.840
Maybe.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.840
Yeah.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.580
ALEX: Why am I not even surprised?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.440
Oh n--,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.700
Oh no! It --

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.700
It's so scary,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.880
Oooooooh-- [laughs]
