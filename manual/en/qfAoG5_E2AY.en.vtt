Hey everybody. My name's Matt and I'm speaking
to you on behalf of Expert Village. As I said

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.270
earlier you can also animate with Maya. You
can animate pretty much anything that you

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.240
can select and a lot of cases even more. Down
here at the bottom is your time-line. You

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.180
can click and drag your cursor through there
and if you come down you can also zoom in

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.390
and out on your time-line using this bar right
here. And you can, over here, select how many

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.860
frames are in your animation. I'm going to
select 90. So there's, I have 3 seconds worth

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.720
of animation. To actually animate, all you
have to do is select and object you want to

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.870
animate. I'll select the box with the cat
on it. Make sure that this key over here is

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.680
lit. That's your Auto Key Frame Toggle. Make
sure that, that's red. I'm going to select

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.260
my box and hit the S key on my keyboard that
sets a key. Then I'm going to move to where

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:12.451
I want my box to be. I'm going to go to 90,
that's the 90th frame and I'm going to select

00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:20.970
the box and move it. That automatically sets
a key frame. As I scroll you can see the box

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.460
move along through space. You can also do
this for rotation as well as scale. And like

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.520
I said you can animate pretty much anything.
I'm going to select my light there, set a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:39.910
key frame and rotate that around. As you can
see they both animate now. Another thing you

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.200
can do to get greater control over your animation
is; go up to Window and Animation Editor and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.810
there is a couple of different views you can
use. I'm going to select Graph Editor and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.659
you can see kind of a graph of your animation
for each object. I have my spotlight selected

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.400
right now and you can select the different
end points and you can edit the curves by

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.740
selecting a point on the curve. Make sure
you use your middle mouse button and you can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410
adjust the curves accordingly.
