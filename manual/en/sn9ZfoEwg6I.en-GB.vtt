00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:12.125
Hello, my name is Pablo Romero Barrios and I am a scientist at EFSA,

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:14.626
working in the field of biological hazards.

00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:20.626
Today I am going to talk about EFSA’s work in helping to modernise meat inspection methods.

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:25.083
The main purpose of meat inspection is to make sure that meat is safe.

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:31.375
The most significant public health hazards are foodborne pathogens such as campylobacter,

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:33.501
salmonella or E.coli,

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:38.667
and chemical contaminants and residues, such as veterinary drug residues.

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:44.167
Meat inspection also plays a vital role in monitoring some animal diseases

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:48.334
and ensuring that animal welfare standards are being observed.

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:52.000
So what is EFSA’s role in meat inspection?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.999
Since 2004 EFSA has been providing independent scientific advice

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.626
on the health hazards that can arise in meat production

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.501
and how to best detect or control them.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.375
Our findings are used by risk managers in the EU and Member States

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:13.876
to improve meat inspection methods and ultimately protect consumers’ health by making food safe.

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:20.334
Traditional inspection methods use physical checks such as visual inspections,

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:25.334
palpation and incisions to examine meat for lesions or flaws,

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:27.834
such as bruising or broken bones.

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:31.999
However, such manual practices often date back decades

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:36.334
and are not always adequate to detect the main public health hazards.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:42.459
In 2010 EU authorities asked EFSA to help update these inspection methods

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.209
by developing a more rigorous science-based system.

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.334
EFSA was tasked with introducing a risk-based approach to meat inspection

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:55.709
for each stage of meat production -  for example on farms,

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.209
during the slaughter or further processing of meat.

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.250
EFSA’s scientific advice covered the different meat producing animals in the EU:

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.709
cattle, sheep and goats, poultry, farmed game, horses and swine.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.751
This was a complex task.

00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:19.125
To complete it, EFSA called on its experts from a number of different fields.

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:26.250
These include biological hazards, chemical contaminants, data collection and animal health and welfare.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.792
EFSA identified foodborne biological and chemical hazards that are present in meat

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:36.000
and ranked them according to the risk they pose to public health.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.918
Based on these findings, EFSA’s scientific experts recommended changes  to existing meat inspection methods.

00:02:42.918 --> 00:02:47.834
For example, they recommended to avoid palpation and incision techniques

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:53.459
in post-mortem inspection because they do not help to detect the main hazards.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.083
EFSA’s experts also considered the implications of these changes for surveillance of animal health and welfare.

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:03.125
The aim of this innovative work by EFSA

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:07.042
is to develop a meat inspection framework that is fit for purpose.

00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:13.083
It’s about applying 21st century science to help ensure the food on your plate remains safe.
