Hi I'm Richard Duerr, and i'm from the fifth generation of 
 Duerr's, the oldest family owned jam manufacturer in England. 

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.443
And together today with my partner in crime Paul Dineen 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.519
Aye

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.180
Who's something of a master baker

00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:20.503
We're going to bring you the best in traditional hearty puddings in 
 the first of our online mini series baking for boys

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:39.756
Today we're going to be doing a beautiful Jam Roly 
 Poly and the ingredients we need are as follows;

00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:47.348
Fairly simple this recipe, firstly we need some self-raising 
 flour, so i'll pass it over to Richard

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.640
tip that into the processor

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.292
Butter. Now bare in mind it's hugely important this butter comes straight 
 from the fridge and its cold because we're going 

00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:02.822
to make a lovely crumb so Richard you take that and chop 
 it into a small a piece as possible for me

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:06.783
So just whilst you're doing that I'm going to 
 take this vanilla out of the vanilla pod.

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:10.263
there's nothing quite as good as the seeds from a nice piece of vanilla

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:14.090
Ok, we can pulse that, that would be great

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:19.013
Great, you want to keep this running until all the butter has disappeared 

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.691
ok nearly there now, let's have a look

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:24.567
Looks pretty good to me, thank you

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:31.020
ok, so we're going to make this into a dough now. 
 What we're looking for is a kind of scone consistency

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.745
for those that are used to it. It's very important 
 that you get a nice moist 'oof' roly poly

00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:39.592
 and so we need to bake in steam 
 to do that and Richard just explain

00:01:41.337 --> 00:01:46.780
We've got the oven pre-heated to 200ÂºC and on the bottom shelf we've got a 
 little baking tray that I've filled a third full with boiling water 

00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:56.280
Ok, so into our flour and butter mix we're going to add the syrup, 
 just blend that in and now we'll start to add the milk

00:01:59.638 --> 00:02:01.670
It's quite a wet, quite a damp dough

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:03.400
Bit like a scone dough would you say?

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:14.090
When it gets to that stage, a little bit of flour on your 
 work surface, a little bit of flour on your rolling pin

00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:19.910
that's the kind of thickness that you're looking for

00:02:20.614 --> 00:02:23.850
About a quarter of an inch for those 
 who still work in old money 

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:32.790
This is the best bit now, we get a nice jam. I've got a nice 
 raspberry jam here made with beautiful raspberries. Get it all spread out beautifully.

00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.110
ooh look at that

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:34.780
How we doing there chef?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.540
beautiful

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.530
I've over-jammed it! Now we've go here a bit of tin foil 
 and a bit of baking paper that we've greased already 

00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:51.480
Bring the top and bottom together and crease. Get a nice line 
 and crease it to make the beginnings of the parcel

00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.760
You don't want it tight, you do not want it tight to the dough

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:57.900
It'll increase in size while it's cooking

00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:59.900
We're going to do exactly the same with the tin foil

00:03:00.028 --> 00:03:04.170
Ok Richard, I think that's ready to go in the 
 oven if you want to put the oven on.

00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:11.090
Perfect, so in to a preheated oven, as I said, in here we've 
 got a little tray which is filled two thirds with boiling water.

00:03:12.094 --> 00:03:16.400
This is 180 for a conventional oven, 160 for 
 a fan oven. In for an hour

00:03:19.314 --> 00:03:23.950
Well, something smells good, perhaps it's time to check on the jam roly poly

00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:25.600
let's have a look, see how it's looking

00:03:25.603 --> 00:03:27.600
Careful of the steam

00:03:28.264 --> 00:03:30.720
blimey, glasses have steamed up

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:38.360
Now as expected it's expanded somewhat in there

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:38.360
Now as expected it's expanded somewhat in there

00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:43.760
So there's some custard or some cream there Richard if you'd like

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.760
Cream for me

00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:48.240
And I'll go with the traditional custard

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:57.270
beautiful! And there we are, Raspberry Jam roly poly
