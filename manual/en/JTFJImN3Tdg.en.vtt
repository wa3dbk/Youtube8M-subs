00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:36.270
Alright, we all know that this is one of the
weirdest game franchises around, but the Katamari

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.190
games brought more to the industry than just
weird characters and innuendo like “Touch

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.710
my Katamari”.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.350
The gameplay mechanics were some of the most
unique anyone had ever seen, and the music

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.970
is still one of the best soundtracks in the
past 10 years, but there’s been a ton of

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.360
these games released.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.630
What once was surprising is now expected,
but Namco delivered again with this title.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:11.900
It’s Beautiful Katamari for the Xbox 360.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.929
Beautiful Katamari’s story revolves around
the King playing a game of tennis and accidentally

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.700
ripping a hole that sucks every planet, with
the exception of Earth, into it.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.840
It’s your job to create brand new planets
like Mercury, Venus, ok…I’m not giving

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.399
an astronomy lesson, but you get the idea.

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.500
There’s a real sense of progression as you
create new planets for the galaxy.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.729
Like other Katamari games, it can also get
really uncomfortable.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.979
The writers had a pretty weird sense of humor.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.929
Having the words “We Love Uranus” during
the loading screen is pretty creepy.

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.470
As far as gameplay goes, you’ll know what
to expect if you’ve played a previous Katamari

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.470
game.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.819
You start off with your plain Katamari and
roll up small objects until it grows in size

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.289
and allows you to pick up larger objects,
and it keeps growing in size until you can

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.130
pick up even larger objects.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.509
Your goal for each level is to have it grow
to a certain size and pick up specific types

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.969
of items in a limited amount of time.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:13.890
The game is controlled almost entirely with
the two control sticks, and unfortunately,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.020
it can get a little bit sloppy.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.080
Now, I do kind of suck at this game, but it
can be needlessly frustrating trying to turn

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.400
in a direction you want to.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.080
The dash move is particularly tough to execute
because of this.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:34.300
Still, gameplay is a blast, and the physics
of the game are brilliant.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:42.300
The great thing about Beautiful Katamari is
that each level feels so different from the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.300
last.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.730
Items are placed in really interesting ways,
so you’ll be thinking a little bit more

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.830
about the best way to handle each situation.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.420
Running into a bunch of bars of metal, for
instance, causes them all to tumble to the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.370
ground for you to roll up, and slamming into
a stack of casino chips lets you pick them

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.370
all up.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.870
The game also does a pretty good job of letting
you know when you can’t pick something up,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.440
as the camera will keep zooming out to put
everything in perspective.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.340
It’s a lot of fun to go back to previous
areas after your Katamari has grown in size

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.170
to get stuff you couldn’t before.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.980
Picking up live animals is especially fun.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:24.010
I hope they don’t die when the planet gets
created.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.920
Beautiful Katamari does look almost identical
to previous games in the series, with its

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.780
classic cartoony look that can’t be mistaken
for anything else.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.760
Now, that also means that it doesn’t really
show off the power of the 360 all that much,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.920
but this isn’t really the type of game to
do that.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.390
The music is as good as ever, with a superb
collection of songs.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:53.120
It just puts you in a much better mood by
the time you’re done playing it.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.780
Beautiful Katamari may not innovate all that
much, and it does feature a few gameplay flaws,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.120
but it shows why the series has been so well
received over the years.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:11.710
A few little gripes shouldn’t keep you from
giving this one 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:19.680
a try.
