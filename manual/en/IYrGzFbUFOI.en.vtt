00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.236
The President:
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.739
Today, as part of an
international coalition

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:09.342
of some 60 nations --
including Arab countries --

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.177
our men and women in
uniform continue

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:15.281
the fight against ISIL in
Iraq and in Syria.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.650
More than 2,000 coalition
airstrikes have

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.853
pounded these terrorists.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.955
We're disrupting their
command and control

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:25.525
and supply lines, making it
harder for them to move.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.961
We're destroying their
fighting positions,

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.698
their tanks, their vehicles,
their barracks, their

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.834
training camps, and the
oil and gas facilities

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.704
and infrastructure that
fund their operations.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.673
We're taking out their
commanders, their fighters,

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.542
and their leaders.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.011
In Iraq, local forces have
largely held the line

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:48.214
and in some places have
pushed ISIL back.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:52.986
In Syria, ISIL failed in its
major push to take the town

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.756
of Kobani, losing countless
fighters in the process --

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.392
fighters who will never again
threaten innocent civilians.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:03.163
And we've seen reports of
sinking morale among ISIL

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.867
fighters as they realize the
futility of their cause.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.303
Now, make no mistake --
this is a difficult mission,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.000
and it will remain
difficult for some time.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.143
It's going to take time to
dislodge these terrorists,

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.778
especially from urban areas.

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:23.750
But our coalition
is on the offensive,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.619
ISIL is on the defensive,
and ISIL is going to lose.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.090
Its barbaric murders
of so many people,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.461
including American hostages,
are a desperate and revolting

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.030
attempt to strike fear in the
hearts of people it can

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.566
never possibly win over
by its ideas or its

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.302
ideology -- because it
offers nothing but misery

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.636
and death and destruction.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.908
With vile groups like this,
there is only one option:

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:50.944
With our allies and partners,
we are going to degrade

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:54.300
and ultimately destroy
this terrorist group.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.584
And when I announced our
strategy against ISIL in

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.720
September, I said that we
are strongest as a nation

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.057
when the President and
Congress work together.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.893
Today, my administration
submitted a draft resolution

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:10.830
to Congress to authorize the
use of force against ISIL.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.333
I want to be very clear
about what it does

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.436
and what it does not do.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:21.000
This resolution reflects our
core objective to destroy ISIL.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.543
It supports the comprehensive
strategy that we have been

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:27.213
pursuing with our allies
and partners: A systemic

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.249
and sustained campaign
of airstrikes against

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.384
ISIL in Iraq and Syria.

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:34.020
Support and training for
local forces on the ground,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.323
including the moderate
Syrian opposition.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:40.260
Preventing ISIL attacks,
in the region and beyond,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.096
including by foreign
terrorist fighters who try

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.431
to threaten our countries.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.934
Regional and international
support for an inclusive

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.670
Iraqi government that
unites the Iraqi people

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.773
and strengthens Iraqi
forces against ISIL.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:56.943
Humanitarian assistance
for the innocent civilians

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.879
of Iraq and Syria, who
are suffering so terribly

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.247
under ISIL's
reign of horror.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.118
I want to thank Vice
President Biden,

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:08.354
Secretaries Kerry and Hagel,
and General Marty Dempsey

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.524
for their leadership in
advancing our strategy.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.127
Even as we meet this
challenge in Iraq and Syria,

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:18.031
we all agree that one of our
weapons against terrorists

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:22.235
like ISIL -- a critical
part of our strategy --

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.237
is the values we
live here at home.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:28.141
One of the best antidotes to the
hateful ideologies that try

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.878
to recruit and radicalize
people to violent extremism

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.348
is our own example as diverse
and tolerant societies

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.350
that welcome the
contributions of all people,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.453
including people
of all faiths.

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:44.157
The resolution we've
submitted today does not call

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:46.659
for the deployment of
U.S. ground combat forces

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.127
to Iraq or Syria.

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:52.832
It is not the authorization
of another ground war,

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:55.935
like Afghanistan or Iraq.

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:59.205
The 2,600 American troops in
Iraq today largely serve

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.709
on bases -- and, yes, they
face the risks that come

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.044
with service in any
dangerous environment.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.647
But they do not have
a combat mission.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:10.083
They are focused on
training Iraqi forces,

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.085
including Kurdish forces.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:15.555
As I've said before, I'm
convinced that the United States

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:18.257
should not get dragged
back into another

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:21.127
prolonged ground war
in the Middle East.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:23.129
That's not in our national
security interest

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.833
and it's not necessary
for us to defeat ISIL.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:29.902
Local forces on the ground who
know their countries best

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:32.105
are best positioned to
take the ground fight

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:36.309
to ISIL -- and that's
what they're doing.

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.612
At the same time, this
resolution strikes the necessary

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.682
balance by giving us the
flexibility we need for

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:45.718
unforeseen circumstances.

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:48.621
For example, if we had
actionable intelligence about

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.925
a gathering of ISIL leaders,
and our partners didn't have

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:57.096
the capacity to get them, I
would be prepared to order

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.899
our Special Forces to take
action, because I will not

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:03.703
allow these terrorists to
have a safe haven.

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.705
So we need flexibility,
but we also have

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:06.706
to be careful
and deliberate.

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:09.676
And there is no heavier
decision than asking our men

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.279
and women in uniform to risk
their lives on our behalf.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.548
As Commander in Chief, I
will only send our troops

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:18.284
into harm's way when it
is absolutely necessary

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:20.053
for our national security.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.260
Finally, this resolution
repeals the 2002 authorization

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.296
of force for the invasion
of Iraq and limits

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:32.865
this new authorization
to three years.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.103
I do not believe America's
interests are served by endless

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:40.940
war, or by remaining on
a perpetual war footing.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.877
As a nation, we need to ask
the difficult and necessary

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:48.648
questions about when, why and
how we use military force.

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:52.151
After all, it is our
troops who bear the costs

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:54.921
of our decisions, and we
owe them a clear strategy

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.857
and the support they need
to get the job done.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.859
So this resolution will
give our armed forces

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.762
and our coalition the
continuity we need for

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.964
the next three years.

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.466
It is not a timetable.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:12.371
It is not announcing that the
mission is completed

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:13.372
at any given period.

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:18.144
What it is saying is that
Congress should revisit the

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:23.750
issue at the beginning of
the next President's term.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.354
It's conceivable that the
mission is completed earlier.

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:31.457
It's conceivable that
after deliberation,

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.993
debate and evaluation,
that there are additional

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:37.530
tasks to be carried
out in this area.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.633
And the people's
representatives,

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:42.635
with a new President,
should be able

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:43.770
to have that discussion.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.207
In closing, I want to say
that in crafting this

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:51.778
resolution we have consulted
with, and listened to,

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:53.880
both Republicans and
Democrats in Congress.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.083
We have made a sincere
effort to address difficult

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.252
issues that we've
discussed together.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:02.522
In the days and weeks ahead,
we'll continue to work closely

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:04.924
with leaders and members
of Congress on both sides

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:05.925
of the aisle.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.928
I believe this resolution can
grow even stronger with the

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:13.032
thoughtful and dignified debate
that this moment demands.

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:15.568
I'm optimistic that it can win
strong bipartisan support,

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:19.005
and that we can show our
troops and the world

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:23.176
that Americans are
united in this mission.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:25.278
Today, our men and women in
uniform continue the fight

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.214
against ISIL, and we
salute them for their

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:29.882
courageous service.

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.018
We pray for their safety.

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:35.755
We stand with their families
who miss them and who are

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:38.257
sacrificing here at home.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.860
But know this: Our
coalition is strong,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.362
our cause is just, and our
mission will succeed.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:47.066
And long after the terrorists
we face today are destroyed

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:50.236
and forgotten, America will
continue to stand free

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.338
and tall and strong.

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:54.373
May God bless our troops,
and may God bless

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:56.108
the United States
of America.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.176
Thank you very
much, everybody.
