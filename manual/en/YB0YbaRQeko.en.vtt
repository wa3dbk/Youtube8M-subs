00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.360
Whenever we're fighting with any kind of weapon,
whether it be a sword or with our own hands,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.580
we always have to find the proper distance,
so we don't hurt each other. Now, my friend

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.000
Liz here is going to be assisting me today.
If I just, if we just start fighting and we

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.410
don't find distance or our stance, haaaaa,
I'm just going to cut her up a little. It's

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.670
not going to be fun. It's too dangerous to
fight really close. So what we're going to

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.230
do is we're going to get into our stances,
our nice low centers, and then we're going

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.850
to find our distance. So what I'm going to
do is I'm going to walk into Liz, and she's

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:44.460
going to check distance, I went in too close.
It's all right; by simply parrying. So she's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.430
going to, you know, parry four, parry three,
make sure that it all works, so that now if

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.050
she moves her blade I can't touch her, at
all. No matter what happens I'm not going

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.949
to kill her, which is what we want to go for.
And so that is how we find distance. Now something

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.950
that's going to be tricky as we do our fight
is learning how to maintain your distance.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.790
That's something that's going to come with
practice and it's going to come with a lot

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.159
of repetition. You always have to make sure
that you're at a safe distance with your partner,

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.430
and if for some reason you're fighting, you're
in the middle of your fight, and you realize

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.079
you're too close, good partnering is all about
knowing when to stop. So what you want to

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.899
do is if we start off this way, we do a few
fight moves, and then somehow we end up like

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:38.140
this, should be keep going? No, we shouldn't
because now I can hit her, and this is real

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.260
dangerous. I mean, it's a blunt weapon right
now because we're not going to actually use

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.770
sharp ones because that would just be interesting,
but it could still hurt. I could still poke

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.219
an eye out; I can still bruise her really
badly. So we want to make sure that we're

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.201
practicing proper safety at all times. And
that's how we're going to find our distance

00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.490
so that we can begin our fight.
