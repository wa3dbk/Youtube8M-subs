00:00:01.404 --> 00:00:07.230
"Hibiscus Tea vs. Plant-Based Diets 
for Hypertension "

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.844
The latest research pitted 
hibiscus against obesity, 

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:15.470
giving hibiscus to overweight individuals, 
and showed reduced body weight, 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.238
but after 12 weeks on hibiscus 
they only lost like 3 pounds, 

00:00:18.238 --> 00:00:21.151
and really only one and 
a half pounds over placebo—

00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:24.103
clearly no magic fix.

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:27.203
The purported cholesterol-lowering
property of hibiscus tea 

00:00:27.203 --> 00:00:28.938
had looked a bit 
more promising. 

00:00:28.938 --> 00:00:31.418
Some older studies suggested 
as much as an 8% reduction 

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:33.570
drinking two cups 
a day for a month,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.479
but when all the studies are put together 
the results were pretty much a wash. 

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.749
This may be because only about 
50% of people respond at all 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.137
to drinking the equivalent of 
between 2 to 5 cups a day, 

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:50.568
though those that do respond may get a 
respectable 12 or so percent drop in cholesterol,

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:53.862
but nothing like the 
30% drop one can get 

00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:58.028
within weeks of eating a 
healthy enough plant-based diet.

00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:01.497
High blood pressure is where 
hibiscus may really shine,

00:01:01.497 --> 00:01:04.765
a disease affecting a billion 
people, killing millions. 

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:08.924
Up until 2010, there wasn’t sufficient 
high quality research out there

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:11.096
to support the use of 
hibiscus tea to treat it,

00:01:11.096 --> 00:01:14.630
but there are now randomized double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.196
where hibiscus tea is compared to 
artificially colored and flavored water 

00:01:19.196 --> 00:01:24.280
that looks and tastes like hibiscus tea, 
and the tea did significantly better.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.031
We’re still not 
sure why it works, 

00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:30.033
but hibiscus does appear to 
boost nitric oxide production, 

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:32.997
which could help our arteries 
relax and dilate better. 

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:37.583
Regardless, an updated review acknowledged
that the daily consumption of hibiscus tea 

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:40.960
may indeed significantly lower blood 
pressures in people with hypertension, 

00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:43.800
but by how much? 

00:01:43.797 --> 00:01:48.000
How does this drop in blood pressure 
compare to other interventions? 

00:01:48.998 --> 00:01:52.100
Well, the premier clinical trial when 
it comes to comprehensive lifestyle modification 

00:01:52.197 --> 00:01:56.000
for blood pressure control is 
the Premier Clinical Trial. 

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.960
Realizing that 9 out of 10 Americans 
are going to develop hypertension, 

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:05.260
they randomized 800 men and women with 
high blood pressure into one of three groups. 

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:08.280
One was the control group, 
the so-called advice only group, 

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:11.310
where patients were just told 
to lose weight, cut down on salt, 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.360
increase exercise and eat healthier...
here’s a  brochure.

00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:17.400
In the two behavioral intervention 
groups they got serious. 

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.400
18 face-to-face sessions, 
groups meetings, food diaries, 

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:23.560
monitored physical activity, 
calorie and sodium intake. 

00:02:23.564 --> 00:02:26.400
Now, one intervention group 
just concentrated on exercise 

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:28.860
and the other one included 
exercise and diet.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.600
They pushed the DASH diet, 
high in fruits, and vegetables, 

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:33.760
and low in full-fat 
dairy products and meat.

00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:40.760
And in six months achieved a 4.3 point 
drop in systolic blood pressure, 

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:45.530
compared to the control, slightly better than 
the lifestyle intervention without the diet.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.430
Now, a few points might 
not sound like a lot—

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.970
that’s like someone going from a blood pressure 
of 150 over 90 to a blood pressure of 146 over 90—

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.400
but on a population scale a 5 point 
drop in the total number 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:09.000
could result in a 14% fewer stroke deaths, 
9% fewer fatal heart attacks, and 7% fewer deaths every year overall.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.946
But a cup of hibiscus tea with each meal didn’t 
just lower blood pressure by 3, 4 or 5 points 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.550
but by 7 points, 129 down to 122. 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.690
And in fact tested head-to-head against a 
leading blood-pressure drug, called Captopril, 

00:03:24.696 --> 00:03:27.810
two cups of strong 
hibiscus tea every morning, 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.770
using a total of 5 tea bags 
for those 2 cups, 

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:32.700
was as effective in 
lowering blood pressure 

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:36.720
as a starting dose of 25 mg of 
Captopril taken twice a day. 

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:40.290
So as good as drugs, 
without the drug side-effects, 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.490
and better than 
diet and exercise? 

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:48.160
Well, the lifestyle interventions 
were pretty whimpy.

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:51.330
As public health experts noted, 
the Premier study 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.290
was only asking for 30 minutes 
of exercise a day,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.560
whereas the World Health Organization 
is more like an hour a day minimum. 
 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.940
And diet-wise, the lower 
the animal fat intake, 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.210
and the more plant sources of protein 
the Premier participants were eating, 

00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:10.990
the better the diet
appeared to work, 

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:15.390
which may explain why vegetarian diets 
appear to work even better,

00:04:15.397 --> 00:04:20.220
and the more plant-based the lower 
the prevalence of hypertension. 

00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:23.890
On the DASH diet, they were 
told to cut down on meat,

00:04:23.892 --> 00:04:25.590
but were still eating 
meat every day, 

00:04:25.592 --> 00:04:28.880
so would qualify as the non-vegetarians 
here in the Adventist 2 study, 

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:30.920
which looked at 
89,000 Californians 

00:04:30.923 --> 00:04:34.360
and found that those who instead only 
ate meat on more like a weekly basis

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.020
had 23% lower rates 
of high blood pressure. 

00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:40.690
Cut out all meat except fish 
and the rate is 38% lower. 

00:04:40.692 --> 00:04:44.130
Cut out all meat period—the vegetarians 
have less than half the rate 

00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:46.960
and the vegans—cutting out 
all animal protein and fat—

00:04:46.962 --> 00:04:53.060
appeared to have thrown three quarters of their 
risk of this major killer out the window.

00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:56.990
One sees the same kind of step-wise 
drop in diabetes rates

00:04:56.994 --> 00:05:01.930
as one’s diet gets more and more plant-based 
and a drop in excess body weight 

00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:07.360
such that only those eating completely 
plant-based diets fell into the ideal weight category. 

00:05:07.364 --> 00:05:11.860
But could that be why  those eating 
plant-based have such great blood pressure? 

00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:14.330
Maybe it’s just because they’re 
so skinny on average.

00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:17.100
I’ve shown previously how those 
eating plant based diets

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.700
have just a fraction of the diabetes 
risk even at the same weight, 

00:05:20.702 --> 00:05:22.700
even after controlling for BMI.

00:05:22.703 --> 00:05:24.970
But what about hypertension?

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.590
The average American has 
what’s called prehypertension, 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.040
which means the top number of your blood 
pressure is between 120 and 139. 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.240
Not yet hypertension, 
which starts at 140, 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.540
but it means we may 
be well on our way.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.540
Compare that to the blood pressure of those 
eating whole food plant-based diets. 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.290
Not 3 points lower, 4 points lower, or even 
7 points lower, but 28 points lower. 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.070
Now, but the group here eating the 
standard American diet was, on average,

00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:57.840
overweight with a BMI over 26, 
still better than most Americans,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:06.640
but while the vegans were a trim 21 
over here—that's 36 pounds lighter. 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.400
So maybe the only reason those eating meat, 
eggs, dairy, and processed junk 

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:13.200
had such higher blood pressure 
was because they were overweight, 

00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:15.790
maybe the diet per se 
had nothing to do with it.

00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:18.100
To solve that riddle we 
would have to find a group 

00:06:18.103 --> 00:06:21.440
still eating the standard American diet 
but as slim as a vegan.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.970
To find a group that fit and trim, they 
had to use long-distance endurance athletes, 

00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:28.140
who ate the same 
crappy American diet — 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.600
but ran an average of 48 miles 
a week for 21 years. 

00:06:32.602 --> 00:06:35.990
They ran almost two marathons 
a week for 20 years. 

00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:43.140
So, if you do that, you know, anyone can be  
 slim as a vegan—no matter what they eat.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.650
So where did they 
fall on this graph? 

00:06:45.654 --> 00:06:48.650
Both the vegans and the conventional 
diet group were sedentary—

00:06:48.652 --> 00:06:50.340
less than an hour 
of exercise a week. 

00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:54.290
The endurance runners were here. 

00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:58.790
So it appears if you run about 
a thousand miles every year 

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:01.720
you can start to rival 
some couch potato vegans. 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.890
Doesn’t mean you can’t do both, 
but it may be easier to just eat plants.
