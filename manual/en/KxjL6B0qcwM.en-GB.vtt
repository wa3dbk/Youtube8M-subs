Hi I'm Kelsea Brennan-Wessels
and you are watching Earth from Space on the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.609
European Space Agency Web TV.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.260
This image acquired by Japan’s ALOS satellite
on June 28th 2009

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.470
shows Finland’s capital and largest city,
Helsinki, in the upper right,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.140
on the shores of the Gulf of Finland.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.290
The gulf is the eastern arm of the Baltic
sea,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.579
stretching all the way to St Petersburg in
Russia.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.440
The waters are relatively shallow, with an
average depth of about 38 m

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.120
and maximum depth of about 100 m.
During winter and usually in January, the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.420
waters freeze
and stay frozen until about April.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.700
Satellites play an important role during this
season for shipping,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.700
providing imagery that helps icebreaker boats
navigate through these frozen waters.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.470
Situated on the tip of a peninsula and on
more than 300 islands,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.429
Helsinki is sparsely populated compared to
other European capitals

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.500
and has many green areas.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.240
Running north to south through the centre
of the city is a 10 km-long forested park

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.130
that offers opportunities for outdoor sports
and activities to Helsinki’s residents.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.070
This year, the park celebrates its 100-year
anniversary,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.100
marked by various activities including nature
walks,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.689
a photo competition and other events.

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.759
North of the city we can see the runways of
the Helsinki airport,

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.759
while farther west, the large, dark green
area of Nuuksio National Park is evident.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.780
And that brings us to the end of this edition
of Earth from Space

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.370
Remember that we broadcast online every Friday
at ten o'clock Central European Summer Time

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.400

App on your mobile device
