Hi, I'm Jennifer Cail. On behalf of Expert
Village I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:10.040
this rich espresso fudge. Now that our fudge
has cooled down nicely in the refrigerator

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.949
it's time to take it out of the pan and cut
it into pieces. Unfortunately with the foil

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.410
it comes out of the pan really really easily.
So we are going to peel back the edges of

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.499
the foil and you want to make sure to place
it on a cutting board because we are now going

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:36.130
to be cutting it up with a rather sharp knife.
You just want to peel that back and you see

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.110
the edges of the fudge if you are going to
give this as a gift or you want to make a

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.920
nice presentation then you can even out all
of the edges. But for our purposes we don't

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.770
need to be quite that exact so you want to
cut it up into about 30 pieces. You are going

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:04.100
to start probably about an inch apart, then
using a nice strong heavy knife you want to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.570
cut off nice large chunks of fudge. It's probably
going to stick a little bit so you want to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.300
be careful, this is why you want a heavy knife
cause it's going to cut through the fudge

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:26.620
a little bit more easily. You want to continue
cutting until you have all of your incisions

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:35.370
lengthwise being very careful when cutting
it and removing the knife. You want to do

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.530
this while the fudge is still nice and cool
so that it doesn't get sticky and warm as

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.950
it comes to room temperature. Once you have
it cut one direction then you want to cut

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.030
slightly smaller amounts in the opposite direction.
You don't want to have huge pieces of fudge

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.370
but you don't want them to be tiny either.
You want to cut all the way across until we

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.840
have all of our fudge cut up.
