00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:14.959
The Goddess is consciousness herself and without
consciousness there is no understanding.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.980
So she is in other words, Intelligence.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.480
She is not only intelligence but she is also
energy that’s why the other name for the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480
Goddess is Shakti.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.550
Shakti is energy.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.050
She is energy and she is the killer of demons
that’s why she is called Shakti.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.609
This is something that is very relevant at
this point of time because in the upcoming

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:48.489
Golden Age, the Goddess is going to be prominent
and when she becomes prominent the human females

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.449
also will become prominent.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.569
In fact, there is a relationship between the
human female and the divine female.

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.969
So all this are going to happen.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:09.869
The first three nights of the Goddess are
dedicated to this particular archetype called

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:10.969
Durga.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.500
She is depicted as a ferocious Goddess.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:24.329
Within this Indian tradition, when the God
is not able to accomplish the task, not able

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:32.020
to kill a demon because the demon is very
powerful, it is the Goddess who rose and kills

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.899
the demon; particularly Durga represents ultimate
power to kill demons.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.760
The demons mean several things.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.710
Negativity in general, disease is a demon,
ignorance is a demon and Goddess Durga has

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:00.189
the power to kill this demon and she is represented
in many ways like with multiple hands, eight

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:08.310
hands, sixteen hands and in all this sixteen
hands or eight hands, she carries weapons

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.260
and these are not human weapons but divine
weapons driven with the help of Mantras who

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.670
could destroy the most powerful demons with
this weapons.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:33.879
She often rides on wild animals like tiger
and lion and She is frightening Kali, Durga,

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.879
Chandi.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:44.480
These are all Goddesses of power who are very
active during these first three nights of

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.349
Navaratri.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:55.720
Especially when you are confronted with ignorance,
inability to understand things it is because

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.290
of a demonic influence that our mind is clouded
or when you are depressed or when you are

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:12.129
sick, this is the time when Durga the Goddess
is very powerful and destroys evil.
