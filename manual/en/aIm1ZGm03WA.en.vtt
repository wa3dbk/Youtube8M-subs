00:00:00.515 --> 00:00:03.183
I know the proposal only
scratches the surface,

00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:04.284
But it's the least
we can do.

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:05.652
We'll let harold
take a look at this.

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:06.686
We'll revisit it.

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:08.188
Jerry, say hello
to linda for me.

00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:09.690
If we don't see you
before thanksgiving,

00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:10.757
Have a good holiday.

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:12.893
Thank you,
mr. President.

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.628
So, how are we doing?

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:16.263
You're running 4 minutes
ahead of schedule.

00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:17.431
Ahead?
Yes, sir.

00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:18.465
Gee, that's unprecedented.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.934
I don't know
what to do with myself.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.268
Mr. Macinerny
asked me to remind you

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:22.602
To pop in on the--

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.071
Oh, right,
the gdc meeting. Yeah.

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:25.272
Rest assured,
your concerns

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.074
Are not falling
on deaf ears.

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:28.408
The environmental lobby

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:29.977
Has known no greater
ally in the white house

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:31.178
Than president shepherd.

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:34.348
Hardly an impressive
distinction, a.J.

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:36.984
Sydney, we should leave
mr. Macinerny alone now.

00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:38.385
He's already
given us more time--

00:00:38.453 --> 00:00:40.154
Mr. Macinerny doesn't
want us to leave him alone

00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:41.889
Because mr. Macinerny's
not yet done

00:00:41.957 --> 00:00:43.924
What he needs to do today.

00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:47.494
Susan: Sir, uh, ms. Wade's
been thrown into the deep end

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:49.830
Of the pool on her first day.

00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:52.133
She hasn't even had
a chance to read the report

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.234
Of the quebec conference.

00:00:54.302 --> 00:00:56.303
You're right.
I haven't read it.

00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:57.671
If someone had
asked me yesterday,

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.206
I would have told them
that the quebec conference

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:02.209
Was made up of
6 professional hockey teams.

00:01:02.277 --> 00:01:04.811
But what I do know is that
it's time for the president

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.147
To run for president again.

00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:08.748
Leon kodak is
as good as it gets

00:01:08.816 --> 00:01:10.250
When it comes to
electoral strategy,

00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:11.551
And I'm certain he's
told the president

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:12.719
Exactly what I'd tell him.

00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:14.388
You got to nail down
michigan and california

00:01:14.455 --> 00:01:15.655
Where they make cars
and airplanes

00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:17.057
And they burn plenty
of fossil fuels,

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:19.593
But if I'd read these 800 pages,
I would have discovered

00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:21.094
That it's the burning
of fossil fuels

00:01:21.163 --> 00:01:23.531
Which is mostly responsible
for global warming

00:01:23.598 --> 00:01:25.999
And that the 20% reduction
recommended by the gdc

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:28.035
Is a necessary first step
toward arresting

00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:29.836
The catastrophic
greenhouse effect

00:01:29.904 --> 00:01:31.772
Which has gone unchecked
by this administration.

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:32.973
It's really time
for us--

00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:34.975
Susan, I promise you,
the white house chief of staff

00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:38.195
Will not let us leave here
until he's broken the bad news.

00:01:41.232 --> 00:01:42.766
I'm afraid
sydney's right,

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:45.602
Although not about
michigan and california.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.604
The president has asked
me to convey to you

00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:49.639
That he's sending his
energy bill to the floor

00:01:49.707 --> 00:01:53.143
With a call
for a 10% reduction.

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:55.813
The president is willing
to go it alone on this,

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.348
But he's asking for,
and frankly,

00:01:57.415 --> 00:01:59.516
He's expecting the full
support of the gdc.

00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:01.385
The president's expecting
our full support?

00:02:01.452 --> 00:02:02.519
Yes, he is,
sydney.

00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:04.054
The president's
dreaming, a.J.

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:05.155
Sydney!

00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:06.957
The president has critically
misjudged reality.

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:08.959
If he honestly thinks that
the environmental community

00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:10.460
Is going to whistle
a happy tune

00:02:10.528 --> 00:02:13.530
While rallying support around
this pitifully lame mockery

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:16.400
Of environmental leadership
just because he's a nice guy

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:18.402
And he's done better
than his predecessors,

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.071
Then your boss is the chief
executive of fantasy land.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.407
Let's take him out back and
beat the shit out of him.

00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:25.342
Good morning.
How are you today?

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.444
Couldn't be better. My apologies
for the interruption.

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:30.331
A.J. Suggested I come by
and say hello.

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:32.399
You wouldn't be
sydney ellen wade

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:33.800
By any chance,
would you?

00:02:33.868 --> 00:02:38.388
Mr. President, I'm, uh...
Don't know what to say.

00:02:38.456 --> 00:02:40.423
I'm speechless.

00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:43.327
All evidence
to the contrary.

00:02:43.394 --> 00:02:45.195
We haven't met.
I'm susan sloan.
