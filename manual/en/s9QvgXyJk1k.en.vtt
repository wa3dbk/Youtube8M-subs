Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now we
are going to make a long snake and we just

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:29.190
shape it into a pretzel shape.
This dough does not even if it has yeast inside

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.730
it does not need to rise. We are going to
bake it right away not letting it sit and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.600
rise.
You can see I'm making a pretzel shape and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:01:17.390
I'm just pressing both ends so it would not
open during baking.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.740
After we finish shaping them, we are going
to put them in the tray. We don't need to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.890
leave big space between each other cause they
don't really rise too much. You don't want

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.740
to put them too close cause you don't want
them to stick together but you don't need

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.540
a big space. There is different toppings that
you can put on them one you have them in the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.740
pan. If you like this then sweet instead of
the coarse, salt brush it with egg and put

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.570
sugar on top. You can put sesame seed on top,
you can leave it plain only brush it with

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.049
the egg and put nothing on top.
