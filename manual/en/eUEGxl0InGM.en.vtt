00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.900
Here are all my children I hosted.

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:12.001
This is the first one there, Luna, Italian.

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.002
There is Brock, the Canadian.

00:00:14.503 --> 00:00:16.503
Sophia, the German.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:19.500
Daniela, Brazil.

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:22.800
Ana, Spain.

00:00:24.306 --> 00:00:26.300
Then... Who's missing?

00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:34.400
My name is George
and I live in the United States.

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:40.000
My car represents 1,200 ambulances
given by the Americans,

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:45.001
and driven by young American volunteers

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:49.200
during the first three years of the First World War.

00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:52.100
We have 750 active volunteers,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.700
and we have more than 2,000 members.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.100
That's huge!

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:57.906
One of my colleagues told me:

00:00:57.907 --> 00:01:02.507
"My neighbor is in an organization,
I'll tell him to visit you."

00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:04.508
The same evening he was in my home,

00:01:04.508 --> 00:01:08.100
he presented me AFS and I was starting this adventure.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.800
We start with a home visit, then we do another one,

00:01:12.812 --> 00:01:16.500
then we do one on our own, then we should maybe organize something,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.002
then there is a young one having difficulties
and we should do some mediation,

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:23.200
one thing leading to another we start to get involved.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.300
When we talk about it outside of the organization, a lot of people don't understand this experience.

00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:32.200
Because I know I'm French, but I have ways of thinking that are Japanese,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.000
I have friends from many countries, I'm not just French,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.010
in a way I have no longer borders.

00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:42.011
I like this idea at least!

00:01:42.112 --> 00:01:46.012
I think that's the reason we're involved in AFS.

00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:49.500
It's really to allow young ones to live experiences like that.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.200
I am very concerned that the story isn't told enough. And this is my mission.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.001
That's AFS' strength,
our network of volunteers.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.500
As an AFS volunteer we get to live
the experience we offer, actually.

00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:08.300
AFS gave me a lot. Starting with being able to identify myself.
