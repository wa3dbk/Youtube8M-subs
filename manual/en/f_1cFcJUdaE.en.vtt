00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.060
Today on this 2009 Subaru Forester we are
going to be installing Draw-Tite hitch part

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.929
number 75650 and this installation will also
apply for Hidden Hitch part number 87493.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.919
The first thing we need to do is lower the
exhaust down.

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.800
There are four main hangers and then there
is one forward hanger that we need to lower

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800
the exhaust off of.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.779
00:20
Before we remove all five of the hangers we

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.789
want to put a support strap up at the forward
side of the exhaust system.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.220
We are just going to be using a basic ratchet
strap to support it.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.290
To remove the exhaust off of its hangers we
are just going to take a spray lubricant like

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.100
WD-40 and we just want to spray down the studs
of the hanger.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.850
Then we can just take a pair of pliers or
a pry bar and then we can separate the two

00:00:46.850 --> 00:01:18.930
pieces.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:59.630
We 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:18.659
want 
to repeat that for 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:53.700
the four rear hangers and 
the one at 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:37.220
the forward side as well.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:04:16.259
