00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.160
The directorial debut from "The Hangover"
writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, this debauchery-themed

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.280
comedy filmed was released on March 1, 2013
- and is on pace to more than double its modest

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280
13-million dollar budget.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.830
Moore and Scott's influences are painfully
obviously: as this entire experience plays

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.010
out like a tamer, more juvenile version of
the hugely successfully aforementioned film.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.029
The practically unknown cast features Skylar
Astin, and Miles Teller as three college students

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.259
who get themselves in one bizarre, disgusting,
and hilariously unbelievable situation after

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.140
another, during a night of heavy drinking
for Justin Chon's twenty-first birthday - even

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.199
though the actor is 31 in real life.

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.210
Sarah Wright is moral bedrock of this picture,
as her beauty and reserved affection for Astin

00:00:42.210 --> 00:01:13.250
holds this picture together between bouts
of childish nonsense.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.330
Occasionally flirting with serious themes,
like maturity and growing apart - this 93

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.370
minute picture feels uneven with its approach:
one minute a drunk guy is attempting to eat

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.850
a tampon, and the next someone is professing
regret over faded friendships.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.960
Tackled with greater poignancy is 2012's "American
Reunion", the scenes here only work well individually

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.390
(especially if you're into gross-out humor),
failing to mesh with any cohesion.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.200
Astin and Teller have a great bro-relationship
together, and their relatable personas make

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.030
it easy to relate to some of the sticky situations
they find themselves in -- even if their annoying

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.189
persistent makes it impossible to have any
sympathy for their antics.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.499
Obnoxiously crude and stupid, but still pretty
funny, this R-rated adventure feels like a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:52.180
low-rent "Animal House" for the 21st century,
with one character remarking, "We have to

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.450
do as much crazy stuff as we can!".

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.799
Some messy editing and camera decisions are
distracting - and little else in the technical

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.619
realm of sound and vision is particularly
decent or noteworthy.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.530
The quick pacing works well, but only because
of the uninspired progression of the plot...

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.920
which just stacks one thing after another,
rather than truly advancing or elevating the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.200
story in any way.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.850
One minute the drunk duo is outrunning a gang
of angry Latina sorority sisters, and the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.240
next they're dropping their unconscious friend
out of a window: with no cohesive link between

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240
any of it.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.850
Likewise, a tacked-on is a cheap ploy at a
happy ending, and fails to be effective.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.080
Filled with contrived and awkward life-lessons
from mostly immoral individuals, it's best

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.760
not to examine this picture with any lasting
scrutiny - one viewing is enough.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.970
"21 &amp; Over", "Guiltily amusing.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.970
Hammy and disjointed".

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:46.560
Now let's here what the Movie Night audience
had to say.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.380
Our scores for "21 &amp; Over"... a double FIVE.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.410
Citing it as unoriginal, vulgar, and over
ambitious, you thought it was just ALRIGHT.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.630
Brimming with bad taste, this is a raunchy,
mostly deplorable experience with few redeeming

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.260
elements: but when the jokes work, this can
be fun time if you're not expecting much.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.670
I also would rate it ALRIGHT.
