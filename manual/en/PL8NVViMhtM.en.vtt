00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.660
In this clip, I will show you how to author
a DVD. I will use PowerProducer 2 Gold. PowerProducer

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.880
2 Gold is a registered trademark of CyberLink,
a company of which I have no affiliation with,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.699
whatsoever. Now, I'm using this software.
You can use whatever software you can. There

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.951
are free trials for many different types of
software. You can find those on-line. They

00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:28.480
are usually fully functional trials for 30
days. So, I suggest that you look around try

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.230
different ones out and see whichever one fits
you. Use the one which works best for you,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.690
basically. The tough thing, about this or
explaining this, is that they are all different.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.610
They'll have different methods on how you
create the menus, that is, if you can create

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.210
menus. How you create the extra content, how
you import footage, actually render it and

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.460
choose your options will be different. So
they are very different, all of the pieces

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.510
of software. I'll show you this one and just
the basics of making a DVD with a very basic

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.710
menu. OK, I'm here in PowerProducer 2 Gold.
I am at the Import/Capture Content page. What

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.450
I am doing here is, just basically, selecting
what goes on to my DVD. For me, I already

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.920
have some video files that are not edited,
but I'm just going to put the video files

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.400
on it. You can do whatever you'd like. You
may already have video files that are ready

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.500
or have this piece where you can actually
capture directly to the DVD though a PC camera.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.250
So, it depends on what piece of software that
you have, but for me I am going to import

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:43.110
a couple of video clips here. They should
pop-up down here. So, I'll put another one

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.950
on here and you'll see this little bar down
here go up. That's the size of these files.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:02.470
This is a single layer DVD that I am trying
to make. It can only fit 4,700 MB on it, so

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.380
I am already over that limit. However, I am
going to continue anyway, because I am actually

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.479
not going to go through the entire process.
This is just to show you that you have to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.900
watch this bar. Be aware of it and try to
shoot under it, or else you can't make your

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.980
DVD. You may need to use a dual layer disc.
Here's my two clips and I can use this to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.690
play them and see what they are. It has a
little bit of a header here, blank stuff and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:35.050
then it goes into it. So, there it is. I'll
go on to the next step. Now, we have our 'Preview'

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.940
menu. There are all of these items on it,
like 'Adjust color', ?Set Chapter Marks' within

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.849
the video clips , the 'Customize' menu and
all of that, as well as, the menu heading.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.030
That might be something that you'll want to
do. Like, I'll just do DVD and you'll see

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.451
a change, up here. I'm sure that there's a
bunch of stuff in here. It shows how you can

00:02:58.451 --> 00:03:05.930
change the text color, the font and size and
all of that fun stuff. Then there is the background,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.760
which you can just pick, it depends on the
software, again. Sometimes they'll let you

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.570
make a moving background, a video background.
With that, you are actually adding another

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.269
video file which plays in the background,
but for here, it's just a picture and they

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.720
have a default one. The same is true with
the menu, 'Audio'. That would have a little

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.710
song that would be on loop in the menu. So,
what pretty much all applications do include,

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:38.100
as well though, is this little virtual remote.
As you can see, that if this was my menu and

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.180
these were my two clips, I can go back and
forth with my remote and see them. Then, we?ll

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.920
say, "Play that one" and it goes right into
it. It takes a little while to start, but

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.349
that is just the clip. So now, it's playing
and I want to go back the to the menu, I hit

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:03.819
the menu button and I'm back on to the menu.
So, yeah, it depends on what software that

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.230
you're using, but that's the gist of the menu.
This is pretty simplistic software. They can

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.190
get really complex. You can add all of these
fancy moving paths and everything. So, I am

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.470
going to move on to the next step. This is
when we are actually making the DVD or 'burning'

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:32.090
it. It has new volume as a default and I'll
just title it, 'Family Videos'. Now that will

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.560
be the label that you'll see, if you popped
it into a computer. It will come up as that.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.210
You can select how many copies that you want.
You can always make more copies later, because

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.660
it will save your files. That's pretty much
it. Then, you'll go and you would 'burn' it.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:53.880
Pretty much, you have to feel out what the
piece of software that you are using can do.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.150
For the most part, you are just going to import
footage, make a menu and then 'burn' it. It

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.820
should do the rest.
