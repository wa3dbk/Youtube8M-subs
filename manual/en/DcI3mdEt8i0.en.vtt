Welcome to a new video of the maemo Games: series!

00:00:12.318 --> 00:00:29.588
This video is about Burger Face, the first game, that uses the frontcamera to recognize and track your face.

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:51.617
Starting the game it tries to find you. The light conditions should be good.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:01:12.707
Now by moving your head, your character in the game is moving, too.

00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:23.124
The aim is to grab all burgers and avoid the knifes.

00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:38.212
More burgers means more points. By getting a hit by a knife you will loose one life.

00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:48.624
And later everything will be faster and faster.

00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:02.794
It works VERY well in good light conditions.

00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:14.886
And it is funny, too. Especially with friends.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.980
Okay, lets make suicide^^

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:51.452
Here you can see your score, and take part in a survey to improve the game and technology.
