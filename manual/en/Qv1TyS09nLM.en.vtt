Welcome to our Epic Failures in Evolution
series.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.899
I am your host Rich Deem of GodAndScience.org.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.900
Our third epic failure in evolution is on
Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.880
In my 1968 high school biology course, we
were taught that this concept was true; that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.680
the ontogeny or developmental process went
through stages of a species phylogeny or the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.779
pathway by which the species had evolved.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.470
The modern version of the theory comes from
a concept first developed by Karl von Baer

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.790
in 1828.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.750
According to this theory embryos go through
a kind of evolutionary hourglass, in which

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.550
different species pass through a common, phylotypic
stage, before going on to differentiate into

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.380
their respective species.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.170
This idea was made famous by Ernst Haeckel,
whose drawings of embryos probably made it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.219
into the textbook you studied in high school.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.960
These are the species supposedly depicted
by these drawings.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.159
In the tailbud stage, all the embryos were
supposed to look alike.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.180
There are contemporary scientists and textbooks
that promote this idea.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.270
Butler and Juurlink say, "Embryos of different
species [of vertebrate] pass through identical

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.020
embryonic stages before acquiring their specific
features."

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.620
However, even in the 19th century Haeckel
had his critics.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.170
Adam Sedgwick said that a blind man could
distinguish between vertebrate embryos.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.630
Despite criticisms, no scientists really looked
closely at the idea until this paper was published

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.810
in 1997.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.520
The following slides look at embryonic development
of different classes of vertebrates as shown

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.840
in this paper.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.090
These are comparisons of different fish embryos,
all photographed at the same scale at the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.060
tailbud stage of development.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.439
As you can see, there is quite a bit of variability
even within different species of fish.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.899
And these are different species of amphibia.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.430
And here we have different species of reptiles.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.749
And here are several species of birds.

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:26.069
And finally, we have different species of
mammalian embryos.

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.879
And this is a comparison of Haeckel's drawings
to photographs of what the respective species

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.510
really look like.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.870
Obviously, Ernst Haeckel fudged his drawings
just a little.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.310
So, in conclusion, there is no common phylotypic
stage for vertebrate embryos and Ernst Haeckel

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.680
"Photoshopped" his drawings.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.409
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny is an evolutionary
epic failure!

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.249
