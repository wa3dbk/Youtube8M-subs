00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.080
Hey you it's a brand new day, everybody's
here to laugh and play

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.659
Everybody sing Humf

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.000
Everybody sing Humf!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.680
Wallace and Loon, Uncle Hairy too

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.320
my mum and my dad are all there with me, and you

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.280
Everybody sing Humf

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.340
Humf and the Big Boots

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.860
One day, Humf found his dad's boots by the
door on the newspaper.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.040
Mum? Why are dad's boots on the newspaper?

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.610
He put them there to dry. He was out in the
rain and his boots got all wet.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.220
Humf looked at his dad's boots.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.260
They didn't look wet now, they didn't feel
wet now either

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.440
He decided to put them on.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.580
Look! Mum!

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.760
I wonder if your old boots still fit you.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.480
Dad's boot fits me.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.970
Humf's mum went to look for his old boots

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.360
Humf liked his old boots but they didn't look
as big as they used to be.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.320
He tried to put them on, but it wasn't easy.
His feet didn't go in all the way.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.110
I think you need some new boots Humf.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.470
But I like my old boots.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.710
You've been growing, Humf.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.150
Your old boots don't fit you anymore.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.500
So Mum took Humf to buy some new boots.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.800
The man in the shoe shop measured Humf's feet.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.769
And he found Humf some very nice big boots
and Humf's feet fitted all the way in.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.640
Shall we put them back in the box now Humf?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.020
But I like my big boots.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.640
So Humf wore his big boots all the way home!

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.079
And he wore his big boots in the flat too.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.959
They were nearly as big as dad's big boots.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.939
Shall we take them off now?

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:01.319
But I like wearing my big boots, I want to
show them to Loon

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.840
So Humf's mum took Humf downstairs to see
Loon.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.040
Hello Humf!

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.180
Hello Loon! I've got big boots. They're new!

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.310
Oh, I've got boots too, come and see!

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.720
My boots have flowers on them.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.979
And I have an umbrella with flowers on it
too.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.409
Humf and Loon were ready to go out in the
rain.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.800
They looked out the front window, it was a
very sunny day.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.330
I wish it was raining, then we could go outside
and not get wet.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.280
And we could splash in the puddles too! Splash,
splash, splash, splish, splosh, splash.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.320
What are you two up to?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.260
I'm pretending I'm jumping in puddles!

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.680
I'm pretending to jump in puddles too!

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.700
Splash, splash!

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.719
Maybe it will rain later.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.999
Maybe it's raining in the garden.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.720
But it wasn't raining in the garden, either.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.170
It was even sunnier than it was out the front
window.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.690
Silly sun.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.200
I wish there were puddles to splash in.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.060
Rain, rain, I want rain! Rain on my head and
my tummy. Rain!

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.760
That's a good rain song!

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.580
Thank you

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.640
Rain, rain, I want rain! Rain on my head and
on my tummy. Rain!

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.860
Humf and Loon sang a rain song but there was
still no clouds in the sky and it didn't rain.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.640
Humf didn't mind, it was fun to be in Loon's
garden anyway.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.840
He liked watering the flowers because it looked
like it was raining on them.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.400
And then Humf had an idea.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.060
Look, loon! It's raining on my boots!

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.650
Make it rain on my boots too!

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.050
My turn!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.360
Loon filled up her watering can all the way
to the top

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.040
Come on Humf! Sit down!

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.020
So I can water you!

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.900
Loon watered Humf, just like it was raining.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.660
My turn. I'm going to water you now!

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.980
What are you two up to?

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:12.120
We're making it rain but we're not getting
wet cos I have my umbrella!

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.220
And big boots! And big boots!

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.300
Splash, splash, splash, splash!

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:33.840
When Loon's mum bought Humf home again, Humf
put his wet boots on the newspaper to dry.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.460
Humf's mum was very surprised, I thought it
was sunny today.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.080
Not in Loon's garden, it was raining.
