Ok Kim what easy tutorial are you going to
show us today?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.820
Today I want to show you how to resize a 8
by 10 template.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.640
Many of our templates come in a 8 by 10 and
sometimes it's nice to be able to change it

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.510
to a 5 by 7 or 4 by 6.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.750
Some of our magazine covers make nice invitations
for parties.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.940
The one we are going to be working with today
is the cheerleading template.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.960
You can purchase that template at EASYdigitals.com
and it is magazine covers, volume 2.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800
Go to magazine covers, volume 2.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.680
Let's get started on our resizing.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.689
I have the template up, the cheerleading template.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.939
The first thing we want to do is click on
move tool and we are going to make sure that

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.110
auto select layers is on and show transform
controls.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.560
Now I have my history and my layers up.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.779
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to come to image, image size and if I wanted

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:36.220
this to be for internet I would change this
to 72.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.009
Most internet images are 72.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.380
So it would look like it was an 8 by 10 72.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.429
If I wanted it to be smaller for the internet,
I would just change it to 8 or 7 and as long

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:56.590
as I have constrain proportions check marked
it's going to resize it and keep the aspect

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.939
ratio.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.189
But for right now we are going to change this
back to 300 and we do want this to be a 5

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:10.299
by 7 so we are going to keep the height at
7, the width for right now keep at 5.6, it's

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.830
a little bit too wide but we're going to work
on that next.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.590
So I'm going to go ahead and click ok.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.379
And I'm going to get my zoom tool and zoom
this in a little bit.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:27.650
Now we know the height is 7 and the width
is 5.6 so we need to get this down to 5, so

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.750
we are going to come over to here to width
and we are going to put in 5 I-N and for height

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.110
we are going to put in 7 I-N.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.040
We are going to leave resolution blank so
that it won't change that.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.500
I'm going to come up here to my corner and
I'm just going to drag down and it's going

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.420
to show the marching ants and I'm not going
to press enter I'm just going to drag a guide

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.150
out to that spot, then right click and press
cancel.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.510
So now I have my guide so I know that I want
all this information to be scooted over here

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.859
and made smaller so that it shows up.

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.629
I'm going to go ahead click on my move tool.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.879
Make this window a little bit bigger and I'm
just going to come up to this corner and going

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.970
to drag over everything so that everything
is highlighted and I'm going to come to my

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.970
zoom.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.260
I'm going to press alt and that changes the
zoom to a minus and then I'm coming back to

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.900
my move tool so that I can see everything
here and grab this little corner and I press

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.969
shift to keep the aspect ratio and I'm zooming
it in so that all of the important layers

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.879
will be inside this guide here.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.700
And then I'm going to press enter.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.719
Now I'm going to zoom back in.

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:59.599
Now my crop is still set to 5 by 7 so now
I come in and I press enter.

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.420
Some of this information just needs to be
scooted around so that it looks right.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.400
These layers on the bottom here just need
to scoot down so I'm going to again drag over

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.830
them to highlight them all and I'm just going
to arrow them down.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.250
Now you can modify this and just scoot things
around until they look right.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.370
That's it!

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.229
So now let's say that I wanted this for the
internet, before you press save or anything

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.449
the first thing you want to do is save a copy
so I just click save as and I'm going to change

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.940
this to 5 by 7 so that I have it saved as
a 5 by 7.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.220
Delete this.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.960
And I press save.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.250
It asks me if I want to maximize my compatibility
and I'll say yes.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.620
There it is, 5 by 7.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.630
It works the exact same way for 4 by 6.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.090
You are going to take a little bit more off
the edge and you are going to put 4 by 6 in

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.750
the boxes but it's the same thing.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.500
Let's go ahead and change this just so you
can see for internet.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.340
I'm going to change this to 72 and I'm going
to press ok.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.460
Now it looks like it got really small but
if I come up here to view and I click print

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.080
size then you'll see that this is what it
would look like on the internet.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.150
Then you can go ahead and drag your picture
in, resize.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.870
We have other tutorials that show you how
to do that.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:35.039
So I hope this helped you if you need to change
any of these templates they made really awesome

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.490
invitations for parties so you can have a
lot of fun with it.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.461
Thanks a lot!

00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:42.629
Hey that was easy.

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:43.780
