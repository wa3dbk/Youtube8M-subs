up to 7 pounds, the edible flesh of the durian

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.700
emits a distinctive odor which some people
have compared to raw sewage or rotten onions.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.870
The smell is so bad, the fruit has been banned
from certain hotels and on public transportation

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.890
in some areas. Even with a smell that could
clear a room, the Durian is a delightful delicacy

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.510

it’s seen as a mixed blessing as it can

cause Jamaican Vomiting Sickness. Unripe ackee
contains a poison called hypoglyclin which

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.579

to wait until the fruit is ripe before it’s
