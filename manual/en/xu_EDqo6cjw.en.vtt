00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.840
Trying to untangle the weaved mess that is
the birth and growth of certain sub-genres

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.320
of games can be a daunting task, especially
when popular casual titles take to mixing

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.750
RTS, Strategy and Puzzle elements (along with
a dash of luck) in order to create their addicting

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.480
gameplay. Things get even more complicated
when you begin to ponder a game like Jack

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.160
of All Tribes by G5 Entertainment and Divo
Games as it could easily be considered a casual

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.930
RTS in the style of games like The Settlers,
but familiar casual gaming tropes like manually

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.770
harvesting food and resources gives it an
edge that could all-too-easily be mistaken

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.870
for a 'free' Facebook game.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.460
Thankfully players won't be waiting 2 minutes
for their strawberries to ripen as this game

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.190
is all about efficiency and working against
the clock to make each tribe you visit happy

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.180
and self-dependent. Orders are carried out
intelligently and automatically by the various

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.110
tribesman at your disposal, requiring only
a tap on an object to provide an order such

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.420
as harvesting wood, carrying gold or riding
the pet dinosaur that protects the village.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.250
More workers can be earned by creating huts
in the predetermined slots available in each

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.850
level, though you'll need to balance the increase
in mouths with the resources you have available

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.560
as each tribesman will need food to stay active.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.719
Each level presents a small series of challenges,
be it to upgrade some of the houses to beautify

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.579
the landscape or to pay off a greedy shaman
holding you to ransom for some much-needed

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.670
rain. Occasionally this leads to unlocking
hidden areas where you'll have to play a quick

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.700
hidden-object challenge to earn special items
that boost the abilities of your tribesman

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.749
(reducing their need for food, speeding them
up as they run around, etc.). Later levels

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:32.329
can seriously test your ability to quickly
manage all the small tasks that need to be

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.220
covered, but at worst a slower player will
simply find themselves missing out on getting

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.060
a star on completion.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.609
Watching the little tribesman perform their
various duties while constantly changing their

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.729
outfits to suit the occasion is amusing and
while there aren't a lot of fancy effects,

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.639
the 2D sprites do a good job of conveying
important information as quickly as possible.

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:53.590
There are some overlapping issues on busier
stages that can cause you to cancel or start

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.439
an upgrade when you don't require it, but
this rarely, if ever, affects the outcome

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.439
of a level.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.619
Jack of All Tribes is an entertaining distraction
that may test your multitasking skills, but

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.249
despite invoking RTS elements it lacks any
real strategic elements to the gameplay. There's

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.630
something addictive about quickly and methodically
clearing each stage despite the lack of challenge,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:20.400
making it a great choice for those after a
light title to eat up those choice spare moments

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.750
in their day.
