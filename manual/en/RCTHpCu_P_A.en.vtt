00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Music]

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.249
Welcome to Boston University's Commencement
exercises.

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.759
We gather here to celebrate the accomplishments

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.230
of the young men and women who are the 2012
graduates of Boston University.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.390
[Cheers]

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.750
Great celebrations are often tinged with contradictory,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.370
underlying emotions.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.370
We have been stunned by the loss of four young
lives, one to violence in our city, three

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.329
to a dreadful automobile accident in New Zealand.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.039
All had gone into the world to learn, explore
and realize dreams and hopes.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.300
I ask that all you rise to join me in a moment

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.969
of silence to honor the four dead students
who lost their lives this spring.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.770
Thank you.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.600
I now present Leila Belmahi.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.760
She will speak on behalf of the Class of 2012.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.000
When we were freshmen, we thought the seniors
had all the answers.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.080
I'm here to tell you the senior secret.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.680
And it is.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.870
That there is no secret.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.860
Now I'm sorry if that disappointed you.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.550
But I wanted to show you that in that phrase

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.460
lies something deeper.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.840
The fact that there is no secret, means that
the illusion that someone has all the answers

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.950
is false.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.960
The truth is, no one has all the answers.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.580
And knowing that, we can start to clean up
this world together.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.040
Because it gives us the permission to trust ourselves,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.490
take chances, and do something different.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.770
[Cheers]

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.630
I now call upon Eric Schmidt to deliver the
139th Commencement address of Boston University.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.000
Thank you.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.360
No graduating class gets to choose the world

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.230
they graduate into.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.800
Just as you can't choose your siblings and
your parents.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.810
What is different, though, is the chance that

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.080
each generation has to make history.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.989
And on that score, your generation's opportunities
are greater than any generation's in modern history.

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.239
In the past, it's always been the older generations
standing up on high, trying to teach the next

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.560
generations the ways of the world.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.689
You know how it goes.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.709
Well graduates, I think it's different today.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.799
You are teaching us.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.099
This generation. 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.379
Your generation is the first fully-connected
generation the world has ever known.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.290
What's the first thing that you guys do when

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.480
you wake up?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.319
Right? 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.740
Check your phone, your laptop, read some email,
comb through your social networks.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.659
I'm awake. 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.970
Here I am.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.569
Some of you are probably texting right now,

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.099
or tweeting the speech, changing your status.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.980
[Laughs]

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.810
People bemoan this generation that's growing
up, living life in front of screens, always

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.989
connected to something or someone.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.049
These people are wrong.

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.790
Connectivity will revolutionize every aspect
of society: politically, socially, economically.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.189
To connect the world is to free the world.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.459
Technology doesn't work on its own.

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.300
It's a tool.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.440
You are the ones who will harness that power.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.569
And that requires innovation and entrepreneurship.

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.189
Don't just be a shepherd, following someone

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.989
else's vision and ideas. 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.419
New models, new forms, new thinking, that's
what we need from you.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.260
But you cannot let technology rule you.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.529
Take your eyes off that screen, and look into

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.650
the eyes of that person you love.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.609
Don't push a button saying, "I like something."
Actually tell them.

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.319
For those who say that you're thinking too big,

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.319
be smart enough not to listen.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.609
For those who say that the odds are too small,
be dumb enough to give it a shot.

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.439
You will give our future a heartbeat.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.090
And that beat will beat stronger because of

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.510
you, and the things that you care about, 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.289
and your values, and the things you're going
to do.

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.069
I want to thank you all for listening to me.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.070
And my sincere congratulations to every single

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.139
one of you, your families.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.590
It's a great day.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.000
Thank you so much.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
[Cheers]

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
[Singing]

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:36.000
"Our alma matter ever more, hail BU."
