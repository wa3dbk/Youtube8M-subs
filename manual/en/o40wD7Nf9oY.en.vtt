00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.520
Spider-man has some pretty sweet abilities,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.610
but let us take a scientific look to see how well this superhero
stacks up to reality.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.750
For spider-man to become genetically modified, the spider that
bit him would have to release a retrovirus into his body.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.900
Retrovirus carry genetic information which
gets inserted into the DNA of cells.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.740
The cell then reads the new DNA to create specific
functions and proteins for that cell.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.730
But this retrovirus would have to make its way to nearly every cell

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.510
and have the ability to code for new
and different functions in each cell.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.110
So while it is theoretically possible,
it would also be pretty "amazing".

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.300
Silk, it is actually proportionately stronger
and more flexible than steel.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.050
Spiderwebs 1/10th the size of a piece of hair
are able to catch insects flying upwards of 15 miles an hour.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.590
And, believe it or not, if a web were an inch thick in diameter
it could actually stop a fighter jet.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.746
Strength, some spiders can lift up to 50 times their body weight, this muscle strength
is directly related to size.

00:00:56.746 --> 00:01:01.390
Think about your biceps, when you work out it increases
in height and width, but not length.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.240
In this way, the strength of an organism increases
as a square, or by 2 on the scale factor.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.835
But as organisms get bigger, their volume increases by
height, width and length,

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.131
as a cube, or a 3 on the scale factor.

00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:18.823
This creates a ratio of 2:3,
meaning the bigger the organism, the smaller its proportional strength.

00:01:18.838 --> 00:01:21.123
But because Spider-man is human shaped and sized,

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:25.982
the retorvirus would have to encode for the creation of more
actin and myosin proteins.

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:31.112
These proteins effect the contraction abilities of muscles,
and in effect could make a human stronger.

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:33.534
Climbing walls? Not a problem for spiders,

00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:35.182
they have tiny hairs on each leg

00:01:35.182 --> 00:01:38.759
and these hairs have tons of even smaller
hairs with triangular ends

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.921
which interact within nanometers of the atoms on the surface.

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:48.057
This creates electrostatic forces, allowing them to stick with 
strength of 170 times their own weight.

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:52.177
Too capture this ability, Spider-man would need permanently
hairy hands and feet,

00:01:52.177 --> 00:01:55.027
which may not overly impress his damsels in distress.

00:01:55.027 --> 00:01:57.148
And finally, what about the Spidey Sense?

00:01:57.148 --> 00:02:01.418
Well, spider hairs are extremely sensitive
to vibration and air pressure changes.

00:02:01.418 --> 00:02:06.060
But this means that spider-man could
only perceive things that are near him, and not events at a distance.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.203
Got a burning question you want answered?
