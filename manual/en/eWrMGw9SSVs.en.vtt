00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.410
This K&amp;N air intake system is designed to
increase power and acceleration by reducing

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.960
restriction in the intake path.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:36.430
K&amp;N’s 63-3079 air intake fits 2012 and 2013
Chevy Camaro ZL1 with a 6.2 liter engine.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.980
The 63-3079 air intake is not legal for highway
use in California or other states adopting

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.330
California emission standards.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.010
Check KNFilters.com for an up to date list
of models this air intake fits and for a list

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.220
of other CARB adoption states.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:58.900
K&amp;N power testing showed an estimated power
gain of 31.7 horsepower at 4300 RPM with the

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:06.190
63-3079 air intake installed on a 2012 Chevy
Camaro ZL1 with a 6.2 liter engine.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.000
Actual results will vary depending on the
condition of the vehicle, mileage, weather

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.290
and other variables.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.000
With the air intake installed we ran the vehicle
on the dyno to test the sound comparison verses

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:42.409
the stock intake.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.870
The intake system includes components that
have been designed or matched to the needs

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.600
of these vehicles to produce a safe horsepower
increase.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.770

18.

00:03:55.059 --> 00:04:01.040
Install the K&amp;N® intake tube assembly into
the silicone hose at the throttle body and

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.430

into the K&amp;N® intake tube in the previous
step.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.030
It may be helpful to warm up the fitting to
tube connection with hot water or a hair drier

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.910
set on low heat to ease the rotation of the
fitting.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.710

vehicle.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.199
It will be necessary for all K&amp;N high flow
air intake systems to be checked periodically

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.659
for realignment, clearance and tightening
of all connections.

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.409
Failure to follow the above instructions or
proper maintenance may void warranty.

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.949
