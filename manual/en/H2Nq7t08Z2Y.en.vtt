Hi, I'm Melina and welcome to Expert Village.
Today, I'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.630
screen print design on a t-shirt. In this
next step, we're going to cut out our drawing.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.290
Once your drawing is on your wax paper, and
you?re sure where you want paint to show.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:27.760
Take an exacto-knife and cut where you want
the paint. Since what I'm trying to do is

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:39.519
to draw the outline of the whale, I'm going
to take my knife and cut everywhere that there

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:53.059
is a line. What I'm doing as I'm cutting out
my whale, I have the mouth right here. If

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.980
I were to connect the mouth, then this center
piece would come loose. Then every time that

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.860
I print, I would have to put it down and position
it and try to make sure it doesn't move. Since

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.119
I don't want to go through that hassle, I'm
going to leave this little strip right here

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:21.520
just so it holds this into place. You?re going
to want to be very careful with your edges.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.430
If you?re cutting out and it's not even you
want to go over it and take your knife and

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:35.360
round out anywhere that you want to be nice
and round. There's a tendency for things to

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.210
come out choppy and squarish. You want to
go ahead and round out each edge after your

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.590
done or square it out or whatever it is that
you want. If you?re going for something round

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.469
it is going to be difficult. Once you've cut
out your design, you can place it on top of

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.420
a table, or anything that has a different
color underneath. This is going to give you

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.020
an idea of what your print is going to look
like when it's done. This is a good way to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.179
tell if you need to cut a little bit more
or cut a little bit less or even out the lines,

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.220
whatever it is that you want to do. This is
basically what your print is going to look

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.300
like.
