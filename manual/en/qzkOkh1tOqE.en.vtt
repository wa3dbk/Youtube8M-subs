00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.270
We always thought alien life would come from space.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.020
We were wrong.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.080
It came from the ocean,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.610
which is technically in space if you think about everythings in space really,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.870
But that's not the important issue!

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.650
Anyway,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.750
Giant monsters came from the ocean,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210
and started destroying everything in their path.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.510
And after the UN apparently watched a ton of anime

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.110
they decided the only way to fight monsters,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.270
was to build monsters of our own.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.710
I say we nuke the Kaiju as soon as one as detected!

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.180
I say we build giant robots as big as Kaiju!

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.060
So we can watch them fight!

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.160
YEAH! Fantastic Idea! Please make this happen!

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.980
Pshh.  Nukes.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.780
So we built the robots, named them Jaegers.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.570
And now we're all kinds of famous and the earths last hope...

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.700
You know... I could just keep going with this intro,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.210
but I mean who really thinks a 20 minute lead in to a title card makes sense?

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.320
Right?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.050
I mean that's too long!

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
Okay, here's the title.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
How Pacific Rim Should Have Ended

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.770
"RAWR!"

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.280
We're running out of oxygen!

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.830
We're gonna die!

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.930
We've got NOTHING left!

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.940
There is still ONE thing left!

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.470
For my family!

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.650
Wow!  This sword was really effective!

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.610
Why didn't we open with that?

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.940
Because it's too messy?

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.170
I guess...

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640
Still, this gives me an idea.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.180
Okay Gypsy, we got movement.  Two Kaiju coming your way.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.600
RAWR!

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.970
Analog Chop!

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.240
That's one!

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.210
RAWR!

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.370
Analog CHOP!!

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.940
And that's two!

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.750
Wow!  This is so much easier!

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850
Make way for the cleanup crew!

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.670
Okay gang, It's clean up time!

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.630
RIGHT!!

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.730
Go Go Power Vacuum!

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.310
Power Vacuum!

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.420
Heads up third signature emerging from the breach!

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.370
It's a...

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.470
It's a CAT 5!

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.310
Whew!  Thanks Voltron!

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.100
No Problem!  Great job team!

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.210
YEAH!

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.430
Yeah I'd say fighting them here is much better than waiting for them to come to us.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330
It doesn't look as cool though.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.130
Meh.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.110
Hello Boys!

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.210
I'm BAAAAAaaaaaack!

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.710
Where's my gosh dern subscribe button?!

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.050
Oh.  It's right there.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
Thanks for watching!
