00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.450
Hi my friends, look: Today we will talk about cal. Lime bath or

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.480
kitchen.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.659
Lime is embedded everywhere

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.499
and it gives us a lot of grief head cleaning.

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:15.999
The system will use a
ecological system

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.570
and very cheap,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.890
and just as good glass basin, which is what I do

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.739
because I was more comfortable to do it in
screen.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.949
It can
perfectly use

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.350
for tiles to the screen for the shower,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.180
for faucets ...

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.240
for any surface non-
porous

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.229
it is not too

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.030
delicate,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.740
a normal

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.440
bathroom or kitchen.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.160
What we will do is this:
let's drink

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.900
a little vinegar

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.720
(Which we like

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.320
which give you the win. I use wine vinegar

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.960
Red wine

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.520
because it is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.170
from my point of view

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.620
the best,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.830
but

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.430
It need not be of high quality: One serving cheap. The

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.560
We heat it until it is about to
boil

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.720
and then we put it in a bottle

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.670
having

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.570
spray. A bottle

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
we can use as a spray.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.770
So hot, because the trick is
in use

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.510
hot well, we go to the bathroom.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.410
Here you see how my sink. Almost not
It is seen through the glass:

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.530
has traces of lime, has remains

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.810
soap .. finally: I have had no
know how many days

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.150
so that they could see well without cleaning result.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.860
We put a little vinegar in spray

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.540
and let stand for how long?
for nothing: a couple of minutes or so.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.040
As you put vinegar again for

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.219
the toilet, on the screen

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.980
or else you're going to clean
It's enough.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.589
A couple of minutes

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.789
rest,

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.189
and once it is well

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.329
with a cloth
moist, well, well wrung

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.759
we will rub.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:27.809
Rub it well, but needless
too because the truth is that the

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.419
hot vinegar starts

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.489
lime, starts it all.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.469
What we clarify a little to remove most of the remains

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.309
and then a

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.929
dry cloth, paper

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.719
Cooking

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.609
dry it.

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.719
You see the brightness stays and what
very fast disappearing throughout the product.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.049
I preferred to do it in this basin is glass

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.110
because they look good how to clean.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.419
If you realize

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.459
I'm drying. In this case I have to do inside and out.

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.209
Look the difference: this is before,

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.579
before

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.339
cleaning. It's been a little minute.

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.799
Here it is ready

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.089
and as I said ... Look that remains bright.

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.889
I wanted to make this decision

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.789
because that is not so reflexes
&nbsp;lights.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.819
You can use it for any
thing.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.329
I hope you liked it, you serve, and

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.779
if you want you see these
other videos that I put here and

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.929
Tell me please as always

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.669
as you do,

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.859
if you have some trick or remedy and
share it with our friends.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.489
Come: see you in the next video. A kiss.
