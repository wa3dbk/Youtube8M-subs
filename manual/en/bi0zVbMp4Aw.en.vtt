00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.510
Hey guys, today I want

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.480
to share with all of you an

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.670
amazing hair product that

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.620
I've been using on my hair

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.640
for awhile now. And the

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.860
product I'm talking about is

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.530
this anti-fungal shampoo and

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.890
conditioner. The amazing

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.020
thing about this product is

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.950
that it can be used for

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.270
many, many things, not just fungus, bacteria, but

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.880
also scalp pimples which

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.380
is one of the things that I suffer from.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.680
So, let me start off

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.930
by first of all mentioning

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.530
the benefits of this product, so in

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.570
other words, who exactly is a good candidate for this?

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.660
First of all, before I

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.520
even mention who is a

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.610
good candidate, I do want

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.260
to mention that I personally think

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.320
this product is great for everyone.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.080
It doesn't matter if you suffer

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.820
from scalp fungus, bacteria, scalp pimples. 
I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.710
recommend this product, and the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.100
reason why I think that

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.210
is because when I first started

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.000
using this product, I was

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.480
a little bit hesitant. I was like, okay what I am going do.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.430
Once I heal my scalp pimples do I throw it away?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.040
Do I stop using it?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.980
Absolutely not.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.380
Although this product is going

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.040
to help you heal any issues

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.520
you might have related to fungus and

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.210
bacteria, I recommend

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.640
that you continue using it because,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.040
one of the things that

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.120
I notice when I use this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.460
product is that it

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.740
leaves my hair extremely silky and soft.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.020
I really do not know which

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.240
one of them is the one

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.640
that does that to my hair,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.930
but if I had to

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.110
guess I would say it's the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.090
conditioner, because as soon as I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.380
apply this conditioner on my

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.530
hair in the shower, it feels

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.640
like pure silk. And, as

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.580
soon as I blow dry my

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.820
hair even before I'm done

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.340
drying my hair, I notice how

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.500
healthy and silky my hair feels.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.410
I mean, I do notice other benefits

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.080
but the silkiness is the main

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.960
one that I notice, and I love that.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.620
But the main benefit, just, you know, to be more

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.030
specific, the main benefit of

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.040
this product is that it is

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.560
a great anti-fungal treatment,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.870
because it contains one of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.430
the strongest formulas available in the market.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.350
So if you suffer from scalp

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.490
fungus, this product is

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.010
definitely the one that I would recommend.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.860
Another benefit of this product

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.460
is that it's going to help sooth

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.420
your scalp while at the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.290
same time healing any

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.430
sort of inflammation that you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.020
might have on your scalp. Also if you suffer from

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.740
scalp bumps or pimples, which

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.190
is one of the things that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.050
I suffered from for a while now,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.890
then this is something that's really going to help deal with that.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.580
I've been using this product for

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.270
a few days now and I touch

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.750
my scalp and I barely

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.340
have any of the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.390
pimples that I used to have.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.020
And the ones that I do have left feel

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.840
dry. I can feel that

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.430
any day now they are

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.160
about to completely vanish, and

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.690
I am very excited about that.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.240
Now the next thing that I want

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.850
to talk about is about one

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.630
of the ingredients of this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.100
anti-fungal shampoo and conditioner and

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.500
that is emu oil. And what

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.450
emu oil does, is

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.510
that it's a natural anti-inflammatory.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.300
And if you suffer from bacteria, scalp

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.290
fungus or scalp pimples, the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.900
emu oil is going to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.870
act as a natural anti-inflammatory

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.150
in order to heal and soothe

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.860
your scalp, and eventually

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.880
cure any issues that you

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.640
might have on your scalp.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.860
So, one of the reasons why

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.710
I do notice such extreme

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.850
silkiness and smoothness on my

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.720
hair is because of

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.170
the emu oil and because of

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.200
many of the other beneficial ingredients in this product.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.280
Another benefit of this product

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.390
is that it helps to reduce itchiness.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.510
So, if you suffer from an

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.570
itchy scalp, and you're constantly

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.900
scratching your scalp in public

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.530
or just constantly having all this flakiness

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.740
all over your hair because of the itchiness and the scratching,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.610
this is one of the parts

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.860
that is going to help heal that issue.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.700
Now, emu oil is not

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.120
the only beneficial ingredient in this product.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.670
This anti-fungal shampoo/conditioner is

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.550
also loaded with proteins,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.690
amino acids, and vitamins which

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.500
are, you know, very, very beneficial for your hair.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.010
So, that means that this

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.270
product is not only going to

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.700
help you solve any issues that you might have,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.700
but at the same time, it

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.950
will help with your hair growth

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.590
and healthy hair growth

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.630
because of the amino acids, the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.350
vitamins and the emu oil in it.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.470
And, I know that I've been

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.900
raving about how silky

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.130
this product makes my hair that

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.400
I've completely ignored the other

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.590
benefits of using this shampoo and conditioner on my hair.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.840
I don't know if you guys

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.160
can notice, but one of

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.730
the second benefits of using

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.610
this product is how shiny my hair looks.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.300
I mean, just from here, looking

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.850
in the mirror and I see

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.280
how shiny my hair looks

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.950
and I think that

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.780
has to do with the silkiness of my hair.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.200
When your hair is smooth

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.500
and the cuticles are just nice and silky,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.680
that is going to help your

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.510
hair reflect more light, therefore making your hair a lot shinier.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.240
Anyways, this is all for this review.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.690
I hope all of you have

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.200
enjoyed learning a little bit about this wonderful product.
