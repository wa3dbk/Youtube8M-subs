Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to show you

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.349
how to cook a ham. Okay, here we are with
our sufficiently relaxed piece of ham. You

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.030
can see what's happened as it cooked is a
lot of the ham pulled back from the bone.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.000
And what happened is you melted a lot of the
fat inside which is the reason the cooking

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.760
time was so long. You can also see that I
already nibbled a bit off right here cause

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.690
it was, really it fell off. It looked delicious.
Now you can see on the back side, we're still

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.180
going to have some of the fat back here. You
can take a second just to, this will pretty

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.410
much just come right off. You want to take
a knife to it and pull it off or you can just

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.440
use your hand like I'm using right now. You
can also sit there and take a fork or something

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.989
and scrape it off. If you look over here,
there's a whole lot more, so you can just

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.649
grab this like that. Some people like this
part though and if you're one of those people,

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.100
like me, you wouldn't dare remove all of the
skin and fat off the ham. You want to leave

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.770
it on there and from this point you have a
couple of options. You can let your ham cool.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.770
You can do the whole pineapple glaze thing
which I think is a little gross but that is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.950
a personal preference. You can also do the
brown sugar thing which is basically you take

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.979
a couple of ways to do it. One way is you
can take it and rub it lightly with honey

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.319
and then stick the brown sugar over the outside
and then throw it in the oven till the brown

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.659
sugar melts. When you do that though make
sure you put a cup of hot water in the bottom

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.240
of the pan because if the brown sugar slides
off the ham and hits the bottom of the pan

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:44.639
and it'll start to burn unless there's water
down there.

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:50.619
Another popular option is you can take and
it's a real southern thing. You take and you

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.700
smear a very thin layer of Dijon mustard all
over the outside of the ham and then you put

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.709
brown sugar over that and then you put it
in the oven too. Same rules apply. A little

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.599
water in the bottom to keep the brown sugar
from burning in the bottom. Something else

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:12.200
you can do is, you can, I've also seen it
done where you cover it you basically put

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.909
a can of soda, cola flavored soda, not like
lemon-lime cause that would be kind of gross.

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.750
You put this in a pan and you put that in
the bottom, you put the lid on top and you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.760
cook it for a while and it is supposed to
infuse it with flavor. One of my favorites

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.130
is you just take a couple of cups of water
and bring it to a boil. Throw about a cup

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.611
and a half or two cups of brown sugar in there
and make like a syrup out of it. Throw in

00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:40.700
a cinnamon stick and some cloves, let it come
to a nice thick where it's almost like a coating.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.764
And then just drizzle that over the top of
the ham. That's actually what I'm going to

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:47.020
show you next. So we'll do that real quick
to this ham and we will move right along.
