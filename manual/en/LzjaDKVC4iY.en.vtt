00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.890
ROGER BOWLEY: The number is
1,729, which is known as a

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.540
Hardy-Ramanujan number.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.860
JAMES GRIME: In mathematical
circles,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.620
this is a famous number.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.590
So there was a famous
mathematician, an Indian

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.580
mathematician called
Ramanujan.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.970
Now, he started life
quite humbly.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.350
He was a clerk in India, and he
had no formal training in

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.510
mathematics.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.610
However, he worked as
a mathematician

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.620
in his spare time.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.800
He had proven some things.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.670
He sent these proofs
to Cambridge.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.790
A lot of the Cambridge
mathematicians just ignored

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.120
it, but one Cambridge
mathematician, Geoffrey Hardy,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.010
recognized something in this.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.510
Now, the proofs that he did were
actually things that were

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.960
already well known.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.190
But he invited Ramanujan over
to England and started

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.320
to work with him.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.480
And Ramanujan is now famous
for being one of the great

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.870
number theorists.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.470
Unfortunately, the English
weather and the English food

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.580
did not agree with Ramanujan.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.670
This is round about the
First World War.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.700
England is on rationing,
it's cold, it's wet.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.770
He got quite ill.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.500
Geoffrey Hardy visited Ramanujan
in hospital.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.180
To make small talk, he said, the
taxi number that brought

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.270
me here was quite
a boring number.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.520
It's 1,729.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.490
ROGER BOWLEY: He couldn't think
of anything to say about

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.833
this number.

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:32.920
And he apologized to Ramanujan,
saying I can't--

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.660
this is not a very interesting
number.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.140
I'm sorry about this number.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.090
It might be an ill portent.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.580
JAMES GRIME: There's nothing
interesting about that.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.720
Ramanujan said no, there is.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.690
ROGER BOWLEY: It's the smallest
number that can be

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.240
represented as a sum of two
cubes in two different ways.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.710
JAMES GRIME: 1,729--

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.570
it is 12 cubed plus 1 cubed.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.100
ROGER BOWLEY: Or you could write
it as 10 cubed plus 9

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.620
cubed equals 1,729.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.460
JAMES GRIME: Now, these sort
of numbers are now known as

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.180
taxicab numbers for
this reason.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.230
ROGER BOWLEY: Now, there was one
thing in the story which

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.580
is slightly wrong.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.060
He should've said the sum of two
cubes of positive numbers,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.930
positive integers.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.560
Because you can find another
solution to this if you allow

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.570
negative numbers in there.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.740
JAMES GRIME: So Geoffrey
Hardy told this story.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.500
And I think people tell this
story to show how brilliant

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.070
Ramanujan was.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.900
He could just come up with that
off the top of his head.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.520
I think the point Geoffrey Hardy
was trying to make is

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.350
no, he wasn't a genius.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.970
Ramanujan had come up with
this fact already in his

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.905
previous research.

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:46.940
This is something he'd studied,
something he knew.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.040
So he wasn't a genius.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.875
He hadn't just come
up with that.

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:54.140
And I think that's the point
he was trying to make.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.920
ROGER BOWLEY: If you allow
negative numbers, then I could

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:05.850
write down 6 cubed plus minus 5
cubed is the same as 4 cubed

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.920
plus 3 cubed, which is 91.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.130
So this is the smallest number
which is the sum of two cubes

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.350
in two different ways, if you
allow negative numbers.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.580
And Ramanujan thought it was
that because he only allowed

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.760
for positive numbers.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.030
And you'll forgive him, because
he was at death's door

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.280
at the time.
