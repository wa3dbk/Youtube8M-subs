00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.090
Electric cars might save the plant, but they
certainly won't save you money until now.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.610
This is the Renault Twizy at 6 and a half
thousand pounds is the UK's cheapest new car.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.770
except it's not really a car at all. Check
out these crazy beetle wing doors. We'll be

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.050
taking the Twizy out onto the streets of central
London, it's natural environment to see if

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.050
it really is the future of urban transport
The Twizy is about 2 1/2 meters long.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.109
And it's not much wider than a motor to bike
and the seats are arranged one behind the

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.469
other, you can probably just about see our
cameraman Matt there in the back. The Twizy

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.129
uses a 17 brake horsepower electric motor
give a top speed of 50 miles an hour and a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.129
claimed range of 62 miles. However, in our
tests, we found that a range between 37 and

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.470
50 miles is more realistic.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.920
Driving the Twizy feels quite strange at first.
This versions actually got the optional £550

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.410
doors, but there are still no windows so,
you're quite exposed to the elements and you

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.050
need to be prepared for plenty of attention.
Luckily, the controls are really simple. There

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.120
are no gears so just accelerate, brake and
steer.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.070
And you see me zipping in and out of traffic
really easily. Electric motors produce all

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.370
that torque or pulling power from a stand
still, so The Twizy actually feels quite quick

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.990
up to about 30 miles an hour. And, it's brilliant
fun. The steering is really direct so you

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.900
can dart around around corners like a go-kart.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.430
Unfortunately the ride quality isn't such
a strong point, it's very firm. And there

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.480
is almost no padding in the seat. So it's
lucky you'll only be using for short journeys.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.630
The Twizy's also too wide to filter through
traffic like a motorbike, and although here

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.480
in central London you escape the congestion
charge you can't use the motorbike lanes,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.810
so it's not really that much quicker than
a normal car across town, and certainly slower

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.480
than taking the tube.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.020
You'll need to wrap warm in winter, too. But,
think twice about leaving your coat in the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.060
car. The 31 litre compartment behind the rear
seat is barely big enough for a hat and gloves.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.220
as for carrying a passenger, they'll have
to sit with their legs splayed around the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.569
front seat like this, which isn't very dignified,
especially for ladies.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.700
on the plus side you do have seatbelt and
it's quite enclosed back here so it certainly

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.700
feel safe when riding pillion on the motorbike
In the front there's a 3 point seat belt plus

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.610
a second shoulder strap to hold you in. And,
the steering wheel even has an air bag. You

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.950
can recharge it's batteries from a normal
household socket.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.670
A full charge takes around 3 1/2 hours and
should cost less than 1 pound. Now, I know

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.970
what you're thinking. This is all very well
on a hot, sunny day like this, but what happens

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.970
if it rains, well the short answer is, you
get wet. For such a small maneuverable car,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.050
visibility isn't as good as you might expect.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.190
Not least because there is no rear window.
You can specify parking senses as optional

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.540
extra though along with the Bluetooth kit,
coloured body work wraps for the exterior,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.640
and even a weatherproof blanket. No amount
of accessories though can upstage the radical

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.750
design of the Twizy itself it's a style statement
and it turns more heads than supercars costing

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.130
twenty times as much.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:49.130
cost, of course, is the other main reason
to consider a Twizy over normal car, especially

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:56.209
for younger drivers. A start price of less
than £7,000 is impressively low, but there

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.739
is a caveat. You have to lease the batteries
from Renault which costs £45 a month or more,

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.129
depending on your mile age you can sell your
Twizy and stop paying the lease at any time,

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.310
but that's still a minimum extra £500 a year
to consider.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.810
Insurance isn't especially cheap either.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.039
In Britain, the Twizy's lack of weather protection
could be more of an issue than it's limited

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.760
range. This video would look really different
after all if filmed January rather than July.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.350
Despite our reservations though it's hard
not to fall for the Twizy, it can be a huge

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.620
hit or monumental miss, but it is so radical
and so fun to drive that it might just catch

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.020
on
