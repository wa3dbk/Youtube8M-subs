00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.549
Hi, I'm Sean.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.889
Today I will introduce you to the TC20
 automated cell counter and show

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.979
you many of its innovative features.

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.460
If you work with mammalian cells you
know how tedious it is to count cells with

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.119
a hemocytometer before splitting them or
before running an experiment.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.149
The process is time-consuming, sometimes
taking several minutes per sample, and

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.349
you often have to recount samples to
have confidence in the result.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.859
If you count multiple cell lines a few
times per week, your time at the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.070
microscope rapidly adds up.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.740
There is now a better, more accurate, and
much easier way to count mammalian

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.110
cells using the Bio-Rad TC20
automated cell counter.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.560
The TC20 is truly automated with
innovative auto-focus technology that

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.250
increases accuracy and reproducibility
by eliminating a subjective manual 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.270
focus step.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.360
The TC20 cell counter is very easy
to use. Simply load the counting slide

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.530
with 10 µl of cell suspension
and insert it into the instrument.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.610
The TC20 cell counter provides a cell
count in less than 30 seconds.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.270
The TC20 cell counter also gives
you the flexibility of using the trypan

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.619
blue only when you want cell viability
information.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.020
The TC20 automatically detects the
slide

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.380
and checks whether the sample contains
trypan blue. The auto-focus then

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.460
identifies the best focal plane to
discriminate cells from background.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.690
If trypan blue is detected in the sample
the TC20 counter uses multifocal

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.340
plane analysis in which each cell is scored
on multiple focal planes to determine if

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.300
it is live.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.260
This prevents undercounting of live cells

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.970
that can happen when a single focal
plane is used for analysis.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.520
For more complex samples such as primary
cells, you can turn on the user-defined

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.759
counting mode and select the cells to
be counted by adjusting the position of

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.420
cell size gates.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.560
If you frequently work with similar
samples, the TC20 can save you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.500
time by remembering the position of the
gates.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.700
When done, you can export the cell count
results as well as the cell image to a USB

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.580
flash drive. You can also set up the 
TC20 to automatically export cell

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.240
images with cell count information to
a USB flash drive.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.759
For easier sample traceability, you can
name your samples with custom 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.720
sample names.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.000
You can also print your results using a
thermal printer directly from 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.260
the instrument.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.049
For further post-count analysis

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.819
you can use the TC20 data analyzer
software on your PC.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.329
This software will allow you to analyze
single JPEG files, compare multiple

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.080
files — for example, for a time course
study — 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.349
and prepare reports.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.989
The Bio-Rad TC20 cell counter is
truly automated, providing accurate,

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.859
reproducible, and reliable cell counting
in one simple step.

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.879
The TC20 will change the way you
work with mammalian cells and accelerate

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.989
your research in the process.

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.139
I hope you found this demonstration
helpful.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.430
