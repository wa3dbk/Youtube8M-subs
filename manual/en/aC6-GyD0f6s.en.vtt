Hey! It's Vanessa from craftygemini.com and
I post weekly crafting and cooking videos

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.800
here on YouTube. Ever since I was selected
as one of the YouTube's NextUp winners I now

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.490
have all the resources in place to make my
channel bigger and better. So, I've been working

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.020
hard for the last couple of months to bring
you the best tutorials that I know how. If

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.269
you haven't been to my channel in a while
I definitely recommend that you head on over

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.449
and check out the different tutorials I have.
There's pretty much something there for everybody.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.869
I have a new video posted every Monday and
we alternate the video content on a weekly

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.940
basis. So we'll do sewing, then quilting,
then the next week will be cooking or baking

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.760
and then what I call my wildcard videos. If
you check out last week's wildcard video tutorial

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.940
you'll see I taught you all how to make your
own soap from scratch. My tutorials are also

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.120
now being offered fully captioned for the
hearing impaired. This week we're ready for

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.949
a new quilting tutorial so I'm going to show
you all how to make some really easy fabric

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:11.680
postcards that you can actually send off in
the mail. 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.790
The scrap fabric I'm using today is these
little 5 inch by 5 inch squares. They're called

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.670
charms and they work perfect for this type
of project because what you want to make sure

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.990
is that your scraps measure at least 4 inches
in one direction. So notice I chopped these

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.310
up really narrowly here but here I know it's
5 inches. So, you want it to measure at least

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
4… and if not, a little bit more because
we're going to trim it down to 4 inches by

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.560
6 inches which is the postcard size. So, first
thing we are going to do to get something

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.289
like a design like this…very abstract, is
grab the pieces of scrap fabric that you think

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.140
go together or that you want to use. And what
you're going to do is just take your ruler

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.100
and your rotary cutter…and you can do these
one by one or you can stack them up. And I'm

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.829
just going to do random angle cuts. It doesn't
matter what it is just cut a straight line.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.950
Now you just want to line them up kind of
like in the random order that you want. And

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.670
you're just going to sew these next to each
other regardless of whether or not it lines

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:29.640
up straight or not. After you've sewn all
your pieces together you want to make sure

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.569
that it's bigger than the 4 inch by 6 inch
that we'll be cutting out. So you can see

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.129
from this one, it is bigger. I like to take
it over to my pressing surface and just give

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.980
it a nice press to get all those seams on
the backside to lay flat. Now you take your

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.450
scrap piece of batting and you're going to
lay this on top. And I like to take my fabric

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.530
glue stick at this point and just dab it on
the back of the fabric itself. And you're

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.340
going to lay it on one side of your batting
and press it down. Now this is a great time

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.409
to go over to your sewing machine and play
around with the different decorative stitches

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:15.769
that your machine may have. Now you want to
cut your sheet of paper so it measures 4 inches

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.000
by 6 inches. And now is when we're going to
cut our fabric quilt piece here to size. So,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.670
I do this after I quilt it because as you
can see from the quilting the fabric kinda

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.970
pulls in and shrinks a little. So you want
to make sure you don't trim it before you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.049
stitch. So, stitch your quilting first and
then you're going to take your 4 inch by 6

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.300
inch piece of paper and place it wherever
you want your postcard to be. I just place

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.900
it on there lightly and I hold it down with
my ruler and I'm going to trim this to the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.730
size of the paper. After you cut your paper
out you want to go ahead and write your address

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.640
and who it's going to now that you can actually
put it down on a stiff surface. And then what

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.299
I did here was just take my fabric glue stick
and put some around the edges just to get

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.060
that paper to adhere nicely to it. And then
after you've written what you what on here

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.051
and who you're going to send it to, that's
when you want to place the ugly side of the

00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:15.120
paper to the batting side of your postcard.
Ok? And you can see that it sticks nicely

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.860
with that fabric glue. Now all we have to
do is stitch around the edges with a tight

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.860
little zig zag stitch to secure all the ends
like you see on this one. If you're planning

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.470
on mailing your fabric postcards in the U.S.
mail you shouldn't have a problem. They will

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.080
generally charge you just a little bit extra
because they have to sort these by hand and

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.190
can't run them through the machine because
of the fabric. But otherwise, they are good

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.980
to go. I hope you all will consider making
your own fabric postcards this summer to mail

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.070
off to your friends and family. And don't
