00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760
Rawr!

00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:03.134
Hello, contrasting colours.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.640
Orange, blue?

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.234
This week in my house, we have no heating, no hot water (and limited water),

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:10.454
limited electricity and internet.

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:11.854
I don't know how we're coping!

00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:14.454
It's alright for my parents, cause they're out of the house all day,

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:16.660
but for me, oh my gosh it's terrible!

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.180
I am so cold.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.980
I should be wearing a dressing gown!

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.840
But living without power has had some positives.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.314
The last two days, I have been responding to as many letters as I possibly can.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.140
I have opened about 60/70

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.513
and I've responded to just under 50.

00:00:32.513 --> 00:00:34.716
Most of which is behind me, horray.

00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:39.461
This box doesn't look like much, but in here I've counted there 64 letters.

00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:41.380
And I have a couple of boxes just like that.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.320
I do feel quite overwhelmed.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.653
I need to do a video on this, I'm not a popular YouTuber...

00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:49.293
In the sense I haven't got millions and millions of followers.

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:51.933
But because I have certain videos that are very popular,

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.714
I am receiving lots of mail.

00:00:53.714 --> 00:00:56.114
I have something like 300 letters under my bed.

00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:57.200
I have lost count!

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.908
My ask box on tumblr never stops,

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:00.648
my other inbox on facebook...

00:01:00.648 --> 00:01:02.694
I'm getting messages every couple of minutes.

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:04.014
Oh my goodness.

00:01:04.014 --> 00:01:06.323
Another reason why I'm finding it so hard to reply,

00:01:06.323 --> 00:01:10.014
is that lots of the letters contain a very strong subject matter.

00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:12.440
People tend to write to me about things like suicide,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.367
and depression, and various other disorders.

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:15.834
And Trichotillomania.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.300
I receive quite alot.

00:01:17.474 --> 00:01:18.754
Which is very hard!

00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:21.334
I'm trying my best to reply where I can.

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:23.375
I feel like I'm talking about letters too much,

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:26.100
well it is related to my hair on some level.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.573
Right lets change talk about hair.

00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:30.734
I haven't had a shower for about two/three days.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:33.560
I'm going to have a shower at my Grandads tomorrow, I can't wait.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.040
Today though, I was so desperate to wash my hair, it was disgusting...

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.733
So I went to my sink and I managed to wash my hair on half a bottle of water.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:43.834
I can't believe it.

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:47.520
I have a new product from Lush that I'm ranting and raving about: I love it.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.300
It's the Godiva bar that is shampoo and conditioner.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.934
So I washed my hair with that...

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:57.294
I managed to, with the same water in the bottle, I managed to wash my hands with a special soap,

00:01:57.294 --> 00:01:59.037
also from Lush, which I love.

00:01:59.037 --> 00:02:00.734
I managed to brush my teeth...

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.760
and I also managed to wash my face.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.314
All with that much water.

00:02:04.314 --> 00:02:06.600
I just felt I needed to tell you that.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.114
It is amazing how much water we actually need to do the things we need to do.

00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:12.935
Problem though is, my hair's now gone static.

00:02:12.935 --> 00:02:15.920
My hair hasn't been static, static, for a long time.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.054
This is my hair in static action.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:21.389
Looks like I've sprayed it with hair spray but no, this is my natural hair.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.033
Okay lets change topic,

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:25.501
I had a company send me a hat this week.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.100
Zaini hats sent me this.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.660
And it put a huge smile on my face.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.157
Because my favourite colours are pink and blue.

00:02:34.157 --> 00:02:35.474
It's an interesting hat.

00:02:35.474 --> 00:02:38.014
You can wear it like this, like your typical bobble hat.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.560
But

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:42.468
I think the main way you're supposed to wear it is this. Hold on.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.980
Like that.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.540
It's like a really weird santa hat.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.874
It's been keeping my head lovely a warm.

00:02:48.874 --> 00:02:50.334
...the last couple of days.

00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:52.994
I also think wearing this has stopped me pulling. So horray.

00:02:52.994 --> 00:02:55.480
Shortly I will be going somewhere very cold.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.880
And I will need a lovely warm hat, so this is perfect.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.353
Once again this isn't quite Trich but I had to do a little shoutout for this because it's made me very happy. So thank you.

00:03:05.353 --> 00:03:09.140
I'm actually starting to receive lots of hair accessories now!

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.094
It sort of feels like people are rewarding me, they're sending me hair accessories.

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:14.734
Lots of these are pink.

00:03:14.914 --> 00:03:15.474
Horray.

00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:17.347
This is like a halo, this one.

00:03:17.347 --> 00:03:22.994
But one lovely girl called "Freya" from Australia sent me something this week that made my eyes go wide.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.300
HAIR CHALK!

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.680
Now I have seen other YouTubers demonstrate this,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.741
other YouTubers with lovely long hair.

00:03:28.994 --> 00:03:30.674
And I have considered it.

00:03:30.674 --> 00:03:32.374
Don't know if I have to make my hair wet first.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.300
Erm...

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.720
Have I got a purple bit now.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.500
So yes,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760
that made me smile, thank you.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.120
The last thing I have to talk about is painting.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.194
I have been painting a bit more recently

00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:44.874
and this is one of the things I'm currently painting.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.280
This is me, these are my wigs.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.954
It's not finished, it's a work in progres.

00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:52.954
Additionally, this is in a medium that I don't like.

00:03:52.954 --> 00:03:54.309
This is in acrylics.

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.094
But I want to build up my confidence before I go back to oils, 

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:58.447
it's been so long.

00:03:58.447 --> 00:03:59.940
That was a happy accident,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.277
I have a brown wig like that,

00:04:01.277 --> 00:04:04.994
and with acrylic I tend to do the base colour, so I was doing red as the base colour.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.900
And I thought it looked like the Little Mermaid,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.514
So I left it.

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:10.754
When my brother saw that he said to me: "Why have you painted a Sia wig?"

00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:13.360
No, that's not a Sia wig, that's one of my own wigs!

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.760
I hope to do more paintings like this. Hope to get better.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.380
Okay well that's all I have to talk about today.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.777
I've tried putting some blue in my hair.

00:04:21.777 --> 00:04:26.040
Whilst I'm here, I'm just going to say a thank you for all the letters and the gifts...

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.700
Thank you for the hair chalk.

00:04:27.787 --> 00:04:29.547
I hope you can see the blue.

00:04:29.547 --> 00:04:33.674
Right I'm now going to go and wrap up, and get inside my duvet because I'm so cold.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.840
And I will see you guys soon.

00:04:36.194 --> 00:04:36.814
Au revoir!

00:04:37.354 --> 00:04:40.254
Can't get my arm out! There we go, bye!
