00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.490
Welcome back to my channel, in this week's
episode I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.630
a Cucumber Roll.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.470
What you need to slice cucumber?

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.550
Is a piece of cucumber, some water, and a
knife.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.050
The water is to lubricate the knife so that
as you're cutting the cucumber then it allows

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.750
you to slide through instead of not getting
bogged down.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.820
Now what I've done here is I have already
taken the skin off of the cucumber with a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.820
cheese knife.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.840
Cutting the cucumber.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:41.809
Keep the blade wet and then just simply move
into it with the knife, and you want to keep

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:49.850
an eye on the blade, you can just see it through
the cucumber, so you want to keep it so it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.719
not too thick and not too thin.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.769
If you lift up the blade like so then you
dig deeper into the cucumber making the slices

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:57.769
thicker.

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:05.570
Now when you move the blade down like so you
will actually come more to the surface and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.340
you'll cut thinner slices.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.780
The right thickness would be about a quarter
centimeter which is a tenth of an inch.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.780
Once in a while just take the blade out of
the cucumber, wet it again so that you have

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.450
more lubrication and then just continue cutting.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:37.170
I am not using pressure here, just let the
knife do the work and you just guide the cucumber,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.950
now between cuts you push it up and then when
you cut you bring it down, so you're always

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.950
cutting in one direction.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.240
This gives you a lot of control, if you start
sawing both ways in cutting then you're going

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.299
to miscalculate and slip up.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.649
Now this does take a little bit of practice
and don't worry too much, just buy a bunch

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.740
of cucumbers, try it out, I mean these things
are pretty cheap anyway.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.229
Okay now you start getting towards the seeds
is when you stop, so there we go.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.340
Cutting some Tuna slices.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.000
Alright so now we just roll this up and put
it to one side for later, take a little piece

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.340
of tuna.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.280
With cutting the tuna just simply put the
heel at the corner of the fish, so you want

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.659
to end the cut with the tip on the board.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:43.500
It should be one fluid motion, not too thin,
you want it quite thick, about a quarter centimeter

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.959
to a half centimeter which is one tenth of
an inch to one fifth of an inch.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.110
Rolling the Sushi Roll.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.099
Start at one end and you just cover about
one third of your sheet of cucumber, okay,

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.790
and that should more or less do.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.310
Now you add your avocado, a couple slices
should do, don't overdo it.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:15.530
And a little dab of wasabi.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.620
Now you begin rolling, no need for anything
like a rolling mat, simply try to keep it

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.860
compressed and keep rolling.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.799
When you start to reach the end -- now here
you could add some mayo or some mascarpone

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.180
cheese, anything that will keep it stuck together.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.400
It doesn't need to be that, it could be also
yogurt if you want, keep it healthy.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.599
Just something to make sure that it sort of
stays together otherwise it might unwrap easily.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:55.010
Okay, so there we go, and now cutting it,
you want to keep the seal on the bottom and

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:11.270
simply just cut the ends off.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.020
Now these are the throw away, throw away.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:28.540
And you just simply want to cut the slices,
pretty thin, about one centimeter, that's

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:40.300
two fifths of an inch -- 
and that is your cucumber roll.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.160
How to plate the Sushi Roll.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:59.640
Simply place your cucumber rolls on the plate
-- there we go, okay.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:11.710
Now your Daikon which is placed here in the
middle, a little bit of carrots just to give

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.500
it some color and a couple little greens.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:28.710
Now you add some Salmon Roe, be quite generous.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.520
There we go, beautiful salmon eggs.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:57.750
And to finish it off, place a little bit of
soy sauce on the plate.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.100
And that's the cucumber roll done.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.470
END
