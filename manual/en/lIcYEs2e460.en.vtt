Hi, I'm Amanda with Expert Village. In this
clip I'm going to form the falafel mix into

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.799
patties. We would start with oiling my hands
first so when I form the patties that I don't

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:27.010
get the mixture stuck all over my hands. I'm
going to pour a little tiny in there. Now

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.120
if you have a ring it might be good idea as
well to take the jewelry off. Just as you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:48.040
where washing your hands, just oiling your
hands up. Then I would reach in and start

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:58.430
forming the patties. You would be able to
see as well mixtures are nice and have firm.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:08.090
It has a good consistency and depending on
how big you want your patties. You can add

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:29.549
a little bit more if you like. So there is
one and I would make a couple of more here.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.610
So we have our 4 patties and this recipe calls
makes about 4 patties. Fairly big so if you

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.370
want your patties smaller you have a couple
of more. We are going to lightly brush the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:49.680
patties with oil. Not to much since we are
already going to be frying them in oil. Just

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.429
a light brush to add a little bit more flavor.
