00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.410
[Darris McNeely] I'm going to begin with this
BT Daily a series on the book of Ecclesiastes

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.309
in the Old Testament.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.330
Ecclesiastes is one of those books that, quite
frankly, a lot of people are not familiar

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.330
with.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.110
And in fact, sometimes when people read it
they walk away with a rather negative feeling

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.760
because it's not as uplifting perhaps as certain
other sections of the Bible.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.750
In fact, it can be rather depressing and even
discouraging, and leaving some to wonder,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.260
"Why is it in the Bible?"

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.329
I had a friend that, a few years ago, who
didn't like to teach from the book of Ecclesiastes

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.530
because he just felt that it was a real downer.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.810
And I volunteered to say to him, I said, "Well,
you know what, I love to teach it all the

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.810
time.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.030
It is one of my favorite books, one that I
try to read at least once a year and to go

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.070
through, because of what it teaches and what
it says."

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.070
So we're going to start a series on the book
of Ecclesiastes and take a few of these Dailies

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.910
to go through and to talk about exactly what
is in this book, and some of the lessons that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.410
we can apply to our own life.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.890
The book starts off by making a statement
that's rather startling.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.180
It says that everything is meaningless, completely
meaningless – which gives you the idea,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.659
well, it can be a bit depressing, it could
be a bit pointless in that one sense.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.159
It says, "What do people get for all of their
hard work under the sun?

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.640
Generations come, generations go, but the
earth never changes.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.360
The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries
around to rise again.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.110
The wind blows from the south and turns around,
rivers run into the sea and the water returns

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.140
to the rivers, flows out again to the sea."

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.560
Life is rather cyclical.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.210
"Everything is worrisome beyond description."

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.369
He goes on to say that history merely repeats
itself; it's all been done before (Ecclesiastes

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.369
1:1-18).

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.670
This is from chapter 1, and the first few
verses of the book of Ecclesiastes, which

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.390
speaks to really an approach and an observation
that life, if you just look at it for what

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.080
it is at times and what it appears to be,
it might be indeed vanity or meaningless,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.209
or sometimes rather empty and without purpose
and without meaning.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.459
And though the book starts like that, one
of the things to keep in mind is that this

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:33.909
book is really a very realistic approach to
what life often is, not always what we would

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.459
hope and even achieve in our life.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.150
And I think we all have to recognize that
we must deal with life as it comes to us,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.409
life as we see it, and sometimes it may look
a bit futile.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.379
That doesn't mean that it has to end up that
way and it would be for us.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:55.859
It has long been accepted by the Jewish scholars
who put together the Bible that the book of

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:02.889
Ecclesiastes was written by Solomon, son of
David, who is identified within the first

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:09.689
few verses of the book as King David's son,
who ruled in Jerusalem.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.150
Take it for what it says, without a lot of
the other analysis that critics can put upon

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.150
the book.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.900
I think it's best just to look at this book
and take it as it is indeed a book written

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.780
by Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived,
the son of David, who was a king in Jerusalem,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.109
and with what it says it can teach us a great
deal about how a king looked at life in the

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.449
ancient world, but drew lessons that apply
to us in this modern time and in this modern

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:39.729
place.

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:45.889
There's a key to understanding the book of
Solomon – or the book of Ecclesiastes written

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.469
by Solomon, one a very important key.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:54.150
I'm going to come back in part 2 and tell
you what that key is that I think will help

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.040
you and I, and any of us that take the time
to sit down and study the book, to understand

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.099
the wisdom and the application for our own
life that can be found there.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.859
That's BT Daily.
