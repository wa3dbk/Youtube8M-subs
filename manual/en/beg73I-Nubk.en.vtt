Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now we're
going to stuff the head of the hobbyhorse

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:18.250
just take this poly fiber fill, and you want
to stuff it, in little clumps, and first start

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.190
by getting it all the way down to the end
of the nose. It's better to stuff with small

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.490
clumps like this instead of trying to jam
and a whole bunch at once just stuff a little

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.719
clumps one at a time and you can, you have
more control over how compacted it is if you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:49.199
put it in a little bit at a time. So we just
grab a fistful and work it down. You can make

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.199
it very firm, the harder you push down the
firmer it becomes. or you can make it more

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:10.450
squishy. It's totally up to you what texture
you want it to be. If you put less stuffing

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:22.490
in then your heads a little more floppy, more
is going to make it very firm. Just stuff

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:40.370
that right along. And you just want to stuff
it pretty much full. And we might add a little

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.939
more stuffing when we put the stick in. While
we might want to add a little bit more stuffing.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.969
We'll just get stuffed for now. We'll want
to sew are ears on next. so we want to have

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:05.259
a good and firm to be able to sew our ears
on. Okay.
