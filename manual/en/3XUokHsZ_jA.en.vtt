Hi I’m Nathan from Telstra, the product manager for THub 2. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Today I’ll be taking you through how to set up your new device 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
out of the box.  In your box you should find a tablet, a tablet dock, 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a handset, a handset cradle, a decked base station, handset batteries, 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a telephone adapter, a micro-fibre cleaning cloth, a telephone cable, 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
power supplies and an Ethernet cable. Now that you’ve got all your 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
components the first thing you’ll need to do is set up your base 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
station. You‘ll need to connect this to your phone line and your 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Bipond modem using your Ethernet and phone line cables provided. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It’s a good idea to have your base station connected to the modem. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This way you will receive updates from Telstra as we continue to 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
improve the product. The next step is to connect your base station 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to the phone line. It’s important that you have a line filter between 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
your base station and phone line if you are a Bigpond ADSL customer. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This will remove staticy noise that is generated by your modem. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If you do not have a line filter simply call 13 pond to get one sent to you, 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or you can buy one from your local Telstra shop. The next step 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
is to power up your base station. You have 3 power supplies, grab 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the one that fits and connect it to the base station. Once you plug it in 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the lights on the front of the base station will light up. The top light 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is referred to as the page button, this will start flashing blue. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If there is a software update available, it will start to flash red. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Do not turn your base station on or off until the LED has 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
stopped flashing and it’s turned green. If you do you may damage 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it. Now you can get your THub handset ready. Remove the back 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
cover of the handset and place the AAA batteries in the back. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Connect the handset cradle into a power socket and place 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the handset on the cradle to charge. For first use charge it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
overnight. You also have the option to connect the handset 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
cradle to the base station. You can do this by removing the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
cover of the bottom of the base station and connecting 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the handset cradle as so.  To remove simply press down on the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
bottom of the handset cradle. The final piece is to connect up your 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
tablet. All you need to do is grab your tablet, tablet dock 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and remaining power supply and find a place in your home where 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
you would like to use it. For best performance it’s ideal to use 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
your tablet within 10 metres of your modem, although it can be 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
used further away. Now you’ve set up your Telstra Thub 2 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
it’s time to run through the installation wizard on the tablet. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I’ll be there to guide you through this in the next video.  See you there.
