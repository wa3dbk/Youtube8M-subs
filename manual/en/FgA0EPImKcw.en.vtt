hi everyone it's tatiana, back with another craft video for today's

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.300
video I want to show you how to do a
workout shirt because usually I wear

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.900
sports bra

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.040
and some shorts yet if i'm going to work
outside or I'm going to run errands and

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.000
then work out

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.650
I just want to have workout shirts on
this side I can put on and go

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.449
I don't want to waste tank tops out of
10 ways that you make shirts so without

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.920
keep you waiting any longer

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.910
let's get to it i'm using this large
shirt as you can see it doesn't fit well

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.760
baggy and just needs to be cut down and
hopefully it fits

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.540
first thing I'm going to do is cut off
the collar and you can cut it a little

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.550
bit more deeply which I'm going to do
then we're going to focus on the straps

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.230
you can have a skinny or as wide as you
want and all you're going to do is cut

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.710
down towards the chest and swooped out
towards the end of the sleeve

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.660
now if you have a large shirt you want
to stay close to the edge of the sleep

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.520
you don't want to go past that you
should have something that looks like

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.359
this now

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.020
next we want to cut off the hem

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.830
i'm probably going to be cutting a few
inches above just because you saw how

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.310
long the shirt was now the hand portion
is going to be used for tying the back

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.740
of your shirt together to get that
Razorback look so do save this piece if

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.479
you cut it any shorter

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.100
after cutting off the hemline you can
use those pieces for whatever but you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.100
will not need them for this project

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.090
next up my shirt over and I'm going to
cut out this nice big long triangle you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.120
can even cut out a bigger triangle
because you're gonna be putting the two

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.190
straps together and you don't want to
cut out a small triangle to wear your

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.190
back is going to be big or bulky looking

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.930
once that is done i'm going to take my
hem tie it and one not leave a tail

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.560
hanging because we're going to have to
come back and not it again and then

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.569
you're going to start wrapping it down
to about four to six inches

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.640
once I've wrapped it down to my toes are
length I'm just going to wrap it back up

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.190
and then tie it off in a double knot and
cut off the tails

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.110
yeah

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.110
if you have smaller shirt you should be
done

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.730
as you can tell the more deeper you cut
the sleeves the lower they're going to

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.150
be

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.500
I don't find this book I like it but the
only thing left is since this is an

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.020
archer is still pretty big on the side

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.820
so let me show you how I'm going to
tighten this up so it's more fit to make

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.930
my shirt smaller

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:48.550
I'm going to make my strips two inches
long and a half inch wide on both sides

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:08.189
once that is done i'm going to start
cutting the strips out of my shirt

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.379
so we're doing two inches down a half
inch wide

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.430
don't forget to separate your strips by
cutting them in the middle so you will

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.120
have two strips that you will end up
tying together

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:54.290
now the time consuming part but really
easy as you take your two strips you

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.640
time twice and that's it

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.640
you do them on both sides

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.380
now I've tied on my strips together
except the ends you can tie these

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.280
together if you want but I'm simply
going to cut them off at a diagonal

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.280
angle

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.570
in the end i have a nice cute fitted
workout shirt

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.350
so hopefully you guys enjoyed this
tutorial thank you for watching if
