00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:09.066
It’s that time of year again when regardless of whether you celebrate, enjoy, participate

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:16.087
or even care about Christmas you’re constantly inundated with painfully cheery, sappy and repetitive Holiday music,

00:00:16.087 --> 00:00:21.054
everything from the Bing Crosby classics to the latest pop star’s rendition of jingle bells.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.065
Every store you go into, every mall you enter, and all over our television screens and radios

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:30.061
these songs are stuck on repeat for a solid month, if not more!

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:37.056
Those of us who happen to live in the West, probably know all the words by heart and find ourselves unintentionally singing along.

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:40.028
But have you ever really paid attention to what’s going on in these lyrics?

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.020
Some of the messages are just down right creepy

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.003
and they’re passed off as holiday cheer

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.080
with hardly a comment year after year.

00:00:47.093 --> 00:00:51.071
Here is my list of the top 5 creepiest and sexist Holiday songs.

00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:54.086
At number 5 All I want for Christmas Is You

00:00:54.086 --> 00:01:04.026
“Make my wish come true, all I want for Christmas is you”

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:05.090
While it might sound like an old time classic,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.028
it’s actually a contemporary Holiday song, produced for Mariah Carey in the 1990′s.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:15.004
On the surface it may seem cute and romantic but there’s a nasty little message embedded in the lyrics.

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:18.051
It’s the tired old, all women need is a man myth.

00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:21.035
We see this disturbing message embedded in Hollywood movies,

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:26.051
especially in romantic comedies where it essentially serves as the back bone of the entire genre.

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:30.058
In these stories we’re taught that women’s primary goal in life is to find Mr Right

00:01:30.058 --> 00:01:35.028
and without him, apparently our lives are all unfulfilled, boring and meaningless.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:47.005
“I just want you for my own, More than you could ever know, Make my wish come true, All I want for Christmas is you”

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:51.051
With lyrics like: “I just want you for my very own, More than you could ever know

00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.099
Make my wish come true, All I want for Christmas is you”

00:01:54.099 --> 00:02:00.078
the singer expresses no desire, needs or interests in anything other then being gifted a man for Christmas.

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:06.018
While most covers of this song are done by women such as Shania Twain, Miley Cyrus, and Mercedes from Glee,

00:02:06.018 --> 00:02:12.043
it’s not any less creepy when a man sings it because the lyrics could be interpreted as bordering on stalker territory.

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.098
Here are some other things that you might want for christmas in addition to romance:

00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:17.079
quality time with friends and family,

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:19.084
days off for relaxation,

00:02:19.087 --> 00:02:21.058
good homemade food,

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:31.034
or an 11 inch, cast zinc, life size, replica of Buffy’s Slayer Scythe complete with authentic ostrich skin wrapped hand crafted wooden handle…

00:02:32.012 --> 00:02:33.050
...just an idea.

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:38.000
And at number 4 is I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.059
“I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus, underneath the mistletoe last night”

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:54.054
This song was commissioned by Saks Fifth Avenue in 1952 to sell their annual Christmas Card and was originally recorded by Jimmy Boyd.

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:58.015
It’s still a widely popular holiday song, covered by a variety of musicians

00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:01.056
from Amy Winehouse, The Jackson Five to Reba McEntire.

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:06.004
The song starts with “I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus underneath the mistletoe last night,”

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:12.007
and then it goes on to say “I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus underneath his beard so snowy white.”

00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:15.043
The story is about someone’s mom whose cheating on her husband with Santa Claus

00:03:15.043 --> 00:03:17.042
and the poor kid has to watch the whole thing,

00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:21.007
or in the best case scenario it’s his dad dressed up as Santa Claus,

00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:23.029
but either way… bleh.

00:03:24.013 --> 00:03:27.033
Number 3, It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:36.041
“It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go, take a look in the five and ten”

00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:40.092
This Christmas favourite was popularized by Perry Como and Bing Crosby back in 1951.

00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:43.068
And while they sing about candy canes and silver lanes,

00:03:43.068 --> 00:03:48.028
they also celebrate and reinforce harmful gendered stereotypes in children’s toys.

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:56.046
“A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots, Is the wish of Barney and Ben. Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk, Is the hope of Janice and Jen.”

00:03:56.046 --> 00:04:05.053
The lyrics go: “A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots, Is the wish of Barney and Ben. Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk, Is the hope of Janice and Jen.”

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:09.066
Really? Baby Dolls for little girls and guns for little boys?

00:04:09.072 --> 00:04:15.098
Continuing to segregate and advertise toys based on gender just works to perpetuate those nasty sexist stereotypes,

00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:19.087
plus it severely limits the development of all young people.

00:04:19.087 --> 00:04:23.093
You can check out my video Toy Ads and Learning Gender for more on all of that.

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:27.070
Coming in at number 2 is Santa Baby

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:40.005
“Santa baby, a 54 convertible too, Light blue. I’ll wait up for you dear, Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.”

00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:43.047
Santa Baby was originally recorded by Eartha Kitt in 1953

00:04:43.047 --> 00:04:49.040
and has been covered countless times since then by artists such as Shakira, The Pussycat Dolls, Taylor Swift, Madonna.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.078
This song might seems cute, and sweet and some have even tried to make it sexy,

00:04:53.078 --> 00:04:58.054
but it’s just another tired old stereotype about how women are materialistic and shallow.

00:04:58.054 --> 00:05:05.023
This woman is urging Santa to hurry down the chimney and bring her a convertible, a yacht, a duplex, and a ring.

00:05:05.023 --> 00:05:10.044
The Gold Digger trope is sadly still pervasive in our popular media from pop songs to hollywood movies

00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:14.061
and this particular holiday song gets dragged out every year again and again.

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:21.049
And at Number 1 for the most sexist holiday song, Baby It’s Cold Outside.

00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:27.091
“I really can’t stay but Baby it’s cold outside I’ve got to go away but Baby it’s cold outside,

00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:32.008
This evening has been – Been hoping that you’d drop in, So very nice”

00:05:32.008 --> 00:05:38.069
Occasionally referred to as the Christmas Date Rape Song, this duet was written by Frank Loesser in 1936.

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:43.061
While the song has a sweet melody to it, this style of duet is often referred to as mouse and wolf

00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:48.024
where the mouse part is traditionally sung by a woman and the wolf part by a man.

00:05:48.024 --> 00:05:50.096
The predatory style description is amazingly accurate

00:05:50.096 --> 00:05:55.097
given that the man spends the whole song subtly pressuring the woman into staying with him for the night.

00:05:55.097 --> 00:06:01.061
In the first verse the woman sings “I really can’t stay, I must go away, my mother will worry”

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:05.035
and the man responds by saying “baby it’s cold outside”.

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:09.082
“Beautiful, please don’t hurry Well Maybe just a half a drink more – Put some records on while I pour.

00:06:09.082 --> 00:06:16.065
The neighbors might think – Baby, it’s bad out there. Say, what’s in this drink – No cabs to be had out there”

00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:22.040
When she reluctantly agrees to “half a drink more” suspiciously asking “say, what’s in this drink.”

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.071
He responds that she shouldn’t be in a hurry, she wouldn’t be able to get a cab anyway,

00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:29.084
and oh yeah, by the way your lips look delicious.

00:06:29.086 --> 00:06:36.032
He also resorts to the use of guilt, with lines like “What’s the sense in hurting my pride” and “Baby don’t hold out”.

00:06:36.032 --> 00:06:40.019
Throughout the rest of the song he uses deceitful and manipulative techniques

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:43.080
to constantly pressure her into giving in and getting what he wants,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.065
and just in case you aren’t clear on this point, what he wants is to get laid.

00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:53.076
Through his slow and sustained pressure he lowers her defenses by refusing to accept her insistence on leaving.

00:06:53.076 --> 00:06:56.029
And he may have even drugged her.

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:02.037
“I simply must go but Baby, it’s cold outside The answer is no  but baby, it’s cold outside”

00:07:02.037 --> 00:07:08.037
I mean, she literally says, “The answer is no” yet he ignores this and keeps persisting.

00:07:08.037 --> 00:07:14.067
The song concludes with her finally giving in with the shudder inducing line, “well I really shouldn’t…. alright”.

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:22.021
These lyrics are a perfect illustration of the way men pressure women into experiences that they don’t want, aren’t ready for or aren’t interested in.

00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:29.097
Songs like this work to normalize this problematic male behaviour, a behaviour which contributes and perpetuates rape culture in general.

00:07:29.097 --> 00:07:32.062
Yes, most of these songs were written over 50 years ago

00:07:32.062 --> 00:07:38.099
but every year the airwaves are flooded by the old versions as well as new rerecorded ones by the pop star of the hour.

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:41.097
While you probably won’t be able to avoid any of these songs this month,

00:07:41.097 --> 00:07:47.063
maybe you can use them as a way to engage in a conversation about sexism with your friends and families over the holidays.

00:07:47.063 --> 00:07:51.066
It will make for a interesting and lively conversation, I promise.

00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:54.021
Or you could just show them this video…
