00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.774
I do not understand how it is that we have over five sessions and we get an improvement.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
I understand your situation, gentlemen. But we need to progress

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.540
This time we will try something new. I'll ask them to say the reason hates the other. 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.830
Let's start by you Didacta.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.713
I just wanted to plant the seed of truth. Be the ultimate bearer of a new future

00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:57.374
You wanted was to exterminate mankind!

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.750
Chief please let it end, you'll get your turn to speak.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.193
I hate it always gets into what not. And it's true, maybe if I wanted to exterminate mankind 

00:01:07.193 --> 00:01:09.065
But you should see them

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:13.295
Sorry Chief but he is right. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.976
When you see someone take pictures of her coffee, then you know that there is no hope for humanity

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.750
I think is more than clear why their mutual hatred. I'll show you some pictures and tell me what you see

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.780
Clear

00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:33.800
What do you see?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.500
A weapon to kill humans.

00:01:35.647 --> 00:01:37.400
I see a IA

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.800
Okay, the next

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.500
A human suffering

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.000
a blue woman

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100
It's worse than I imagined. Latest image.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.960
humans disintegrated.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.400
Another blue woman.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.242
None of this worked as I expected.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.520
 I will try one last thing, but I want to know if they are ready to talk about it 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.100
I already overcome!

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
Okay, start again with you Didacta. Tell me about the library?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.515
What can I say. She me betrayed me, fully I trusted her. She locked me

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.395
I loved her. Only she did not understand my way of being.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.100
Okay, we progress. Is your turn chief, tell me about Cortana.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:34.948
Once, she told me that soldiers are not machines. And I fail, I could not save her.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Chief, was not your fault. She made it possible for you to get out of there. He did it for you.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.953
Well, we finally a small breakthrough. There is still much work, but we are on track.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.800
Come back cortana. She locked me

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.288
I can no more. I give up!
