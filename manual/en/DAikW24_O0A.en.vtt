00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.070
78 is 15% of what number?

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.060
So there's some unknown number
out there, and if we take 15%

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.000
of that number, we
will get 78.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.079
So let's just call that
unknown number x.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:24.510
And we know that if we take
15% of x, so multiply x by

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.990
15%, we will get 78.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.330
And now we just literally
have to solve for x.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.880
Now, 15% mathematically, you
can deal directly with

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.600
percentages, but it's
much easier if it's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.240
written as a decimal.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.350
And we know that 15% is the
same thing as 15 per 100.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.040
That's literally per cent.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.560
Cent means 100, which is
the same thing as 0.15.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.060
This is literally
15 hundredths.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.600
So we could rewrite this as
0.15 times some unknown

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.510
number, times x,
is equal to 78.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.570
And now we can divide both sides
of this equation by 0.15

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.460
to solve for x.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.130
So you divide the left side
by 0.15, and I'm literally

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.140
picking 0.15 to divide both
sides because that's what I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.030
have out here in
front of the x.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.580
So if I'm multiplying something
by 0.15 and then I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.700
divided by 0.15, I'll just
be left with an x here.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.110
That's the whole motivation.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.680
If I do it to the left-hand
side, I have to do it to the

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.930
right-hand side.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.460
These cancel out, and
I get x is equal to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.600
78 divided by 0.15.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.000
Now, we have to figure
out what that is.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.900
If we had a calculator, pretty
straightforward, but let's

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.860
actually work it out.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.460
So we have 78 divided by,
and it's going to be

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.840
some decimal number.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.870
It's going to be
larger than 78.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.790
But let's figure out what it
ends up being, so let's throw

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.050
some zeroes out there.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.490
It's not going to be
a whole number.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.860
And we're dividing it by 0.15.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.030
Now, to simplify things, let's
multiply both this numerator

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.330
and this denominator by 100,
and that's so that 0.15

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.720
becomes 15.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.530
So 0.15 times 100 is 15.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.220
We're just moving the decimal
to the right.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.500
Let me put that in
a new color.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.470
Right there, that's where
our decimals goes.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.600
Let me erase the other one,
so we don't get confused.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.480
If we did that for the 15,
we also have to do

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.520
that for the 78.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.810
So if you move the decimal two
to the right, one, two, it

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.350
becomes 7,800.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.530
So one way to think about it, 78
divided by 0.15 is the same

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.880
thing as 7,800 divided by 15,
multiplying the numerator and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.240
the denominator by 100.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.890
So let's figure out
what this is.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.140
15 does not go into 7, So you
could do it zero times and you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.920
can do all that, or you can just
say, OK, that's not going

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.960
to give us anything.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.210
So then how many times
does 15 go into 78?

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.040
So let's think about it.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.640
15 goes into 60 four times.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.770
15 times 5 is 75.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.470
That looks about right,
so we say five times.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.550
5 times 15.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.810
5 times 5 is 25.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.150
Put the 2 up there.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.920
5 times 1 is 5, plus 2 is 7.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.040
75, you subtract.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.890
78 minus 75 five is 3.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.260
Bring down a zero.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.220
15 goes into 30 exactly
two times.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.430
2 times 15 is 30.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.310
Subtract.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.480
No remainder.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.040
Bring down the next zero.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.750
We're still to the left
of the decimal point.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.470
The decimal point is
right over here.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.170
If we write it up here, which
we should, it's right over

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.670
there, so we have one
more place to go.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.730
So we bring down
this next zero.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.330
15 goes into 0 zero times.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.520
0 times 15 is 0.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.640
Subtract.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.030
No remainder.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.670
So 78 divided by 0.15
is exactly 520.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.510
So x is equal to 520.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.170
So 78 is 15% of 520.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.500
And if we want to use some of
the terminology that you might

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.945
see in a math class, the 15%
is obviously the percent.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.420
520, or what number before we
figured out it was 520, that's

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.220
what we're taking the
percentage of.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.410
This is sometimes referred
to as the base.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.370
And then when you take some
percentage of the base, you

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.850
get what's sometimes referred
to as the amount.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.350
So in this circumstance,
78 would be the amount.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.160
You could view it as the amount
is the percentage of

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.540
the base, but we were able
to figure that out.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.040
It's nice to know those, if
that's the terminology you use

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.570
in your class.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.790
But the important thing
is to be able

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.960
just answer this question.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.750
And it makes sense, because
15% is a very small

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.350
percentage.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.230
If 78 is a small percentage of
some number, that means that

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.020
number has to be pretty big, and
our answer gels with that.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.530
This looks about right.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.030
78 is exactly 15% of 520.
