00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.510
Don: Each year Bison continues to strive to
do better in the area of safety.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.510
Rob: Each hour, each move, each mile adds
up. Each of these awards is deserving of our

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.360
industry's recognition and appreciation.
Andy: Bison treats me very well. Maybe that's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.989
why I am here for 15 years.
Virk: It's a big company and a very good company.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.809
Laird: Best company to drive for as far as
I'm concerned.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.920
Nigel: Bison has treated me really well and
I don't want to be anywhere else.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.450
Virk: Well yes, I would recommend so many
drivers to come in this company.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.059
Al: This is from my 35 years of driving, I
can't find fault with what they do.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.980
Ester: It's the best company out there. It's
the safest company out there. It cares about

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.070
me. I'm not just a number like at other terminals.
I'm not just a truck number, I am a person

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.909
and they go that extra mile for their drivers.
Rob: I am proud to be an employee of Bison.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.640
Bison has treated me well and treated me right.
Given me the tools to do the job that I do

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.030
and do it as safely as I do.
Nigel: Without safety, you have nothing. You

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.520
can't build a company, you can't have a good
public reputation, you can't have the good

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.690
customer base. You have zero without safety.
Safety is the most important thing that we

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.090
do here.
Al: I've always felt that the number one thing

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.300
that a driver should do is protect the general
public from the equipment. Like, you are an

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.970
80,000 pound load and a car doesn't stand
up to that.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.160
Rob: Safety is very important to me because
I want to be able to get home every night

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.850
or at the end of every trip so that I can
spend the rest of my time with my family.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.570
Al: I want to be able to spend my retirement
with my grandchildren, my wife and be healthy.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.250
And safety is the only way to get there.
Ester: I need to make it home and do to that,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.790
I need to be safe.
Laird: Get as much rest as I need. I wear

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.769
my safety equipment when necessary.
Andy: I try not fade away from what you are

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.310
doing.
Oliver: If you got any questions, the way

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.060
I was always taught and told, "If you got
a question, no question is a dumb question."

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.890
Mark: Always expect the unexpected and don't
put yourself in a situation that you can't

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.620
get yourself out of. If situations are bad,
pull over, stop, wait and then carry on when

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.829
it's safe to do so.
Ester: If I don't feel safe or if I see other

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.319
trucks pull over, and I'll just pull over
in a safe place and Iâ€™ll satellite them

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.819
and say, "I am pulling over." I don't hear
anything back all I get is "Okay, let me know

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.180
when you are good to go" and that's it.
Mark: The maintenance staff here at Bison,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.780
the Winnipeg shop and the Toronto shop I deal
with. They've treated me with respect. I give

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.530
them thumbs up. They've done a good job for
me.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.799
Virginia: I'd really like to just thank the
drivers for being open and honest and coming

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.749
to us so that we can make them as comfortable
and as safe as possible on the road.

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:04.680
Terry: It's always good to hear feed back
from them or the driver's concerns. We are

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.549
always out there to try and make them feel
comfortable.

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:13.549
Chris: It's complying to all the safety standards
and codes. Having people watch out for me

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.900
as I do for them.
Terry: Our role in their safety is making

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.010
sure that the equipment that they're driving
is safe and to their needs.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.090
Virginia: Having the opportunity to work together
to ensure that we are all making Bison Transport

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.769
the safest fleet in North America.
Don: We function together as a team and that

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.719
team is spread throughout our drivers, our
mechanics, our dispatch, our people in operations.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:46.889
It involves everyone in our business. I think
it's important at a time and an evening such

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:53.590
as this that we take time to reflect on what
we've done well. We should be congratulating

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.489
each other. We should be proud of the fact
that we have achieved the status of being

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.430
the safest trucking fleet in North America.
Rob: Many different associations and fleets

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.329
all across North America know who we are because
of what we do. We're recognized as leaders

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.630
and as such, we owe it to ourselves and to
the industry to continue to work hard to remain

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.130
the leaders in this industry and we do that
with the help of everybody who works here.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.250
Don: I want to encourage each of you to continue
to have that as the focus as a key part of

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.349
our culture and as something that distinguishes
us from other trucking companies and keeps

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:39.000
us as number one in that area. We want to
maintain that pride. We want to maintain that

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.160
achievement but most of all, we want to maintain
that level of safety.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.479
Andy: The center line is your life line. What
side are you on?
