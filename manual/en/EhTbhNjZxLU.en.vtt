00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.220
In this clip we're going to talk about how
to mix permanent hair color. Permanent hair

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.090
color lifts color off of the hair and it becomes
permanent. And what we're going to talk about

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.059
here is different types also. We have cream
colors and they're in tubes. And it's usually

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.132
a white cream that you see when their in the
tube. Ok and we're going to show you in a

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:25.720
minute when I mix it. We also have liquid
colors out there that you mix equal parts

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.359
or depending on the company their own instructions
on how to mix it. Usually it's equal parts

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.200
and you mix a liquid in a bottle and you shake
it and then you apply it on the hair. There's

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.690
also different ways to shake the color, the
permanent hair color. We can use mixers like

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.410
this, bowl and brush or we can actually use
like I said a liquid, for liquid use a bottle.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.170
Ok so I'm going to show you right now how
to mix this permanent hair color which is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.489
in a tube and it's creamy. This company has
cc's that you mix in, it's five cc's so it's

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.340
every increment here, every line that you
see here is ten cc's. Ok. I'm going to mix

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.590
thirty cc's which would be about an ounce
of color. Ok. You need your key here to turn

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.700
that and mix it with that brush now in a minute.
After we go ahead and take this some developer

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.920
here and we're going to use twenty volume
developer, you can use any kind of developer.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.840
In this company you can use from five to forty
depending on how much lift you want in your

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.060
hair color, in your permanent hair color.
Usually permanent hair color you need at least

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.560
twenty ok. So let's go ahead and mix here.
It would be also with this company, is actually

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.810
they want you to do the tube here, they want
you to use an ounce but with them they want

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.290
you to use about two ounces of developer.
So you'll see that they, sometimes they'll

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.590
say an ounce to ounce which is equal parts
or they'll say an ounce of color to two ounces

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.110
of developer. Ok. CC's would be thirty cc's
to sixty cc's. We're going to go ahead and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.940
mix the color first really well, nice and
creamy in the bowl. They also have whisks

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.860
now that you can use and you see them, it
looks like in cooking you use but you'll have

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.940
like a whisk. And there you go you mix it,
little bit at a time please. Nice and creamy,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.910
make sure it's not lumpy when you are mixing
it ok cause then it doesn't take well on the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.710
hair or takes different colors on the hair
so you want to go ahead and do that.
