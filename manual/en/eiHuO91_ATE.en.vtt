00:00:14.582 --> 00:00:17.582
Preparation

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:22.855
Polishing a silver plated copper sheet

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:37.861
A plate has to be polished with chamois until perfect 
 mirror. Avoid any scratch and impurity on the surface.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:01:01.088
"No breath on a plate! Dampness affects."

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:09.028
Placing iodine crystal and bromine water in each coating box.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:29.217
"Be careful, bromine is hazardous material.."

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:51.570
Sensitizing a plate

00:01:55.125 --> 00:02:01.120
Takashi uses a metronome to count time.

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:05.760
1st coating with iodine

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:18.500
Checking the subtle change of the color on plate's surface.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:22.470
2nd coating with bromine

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.520
Checking again,

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:36.050
3rd coating with iodine

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:50.670
Setting a plate in film holder

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.240
Exposure

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:03.810
Daguerreotype requires longer exposure.

00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:10.480
A model must stand still for few seconds to  a few minutes.

00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:13.550
"Now, relax!"

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:25.770
Development

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:30.900
Filtering mercury with cheese cloth

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:50.190
Place the exposed plate on the top of a mercury pot.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:19.620
Heating up until approx. 100°C

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.610
Remove a slide and expose the plate to mercury vapor

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.090
After 2 minutes..

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:15.580
Now the image becomes into visible.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.530
Preparing fixing solution

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:59.990
Submerge the developed plate in fixer

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.700
Keep the fixed plate in tap water.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:19.540
Preparing gilding solution

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:38.230
Heat up until 50°C

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:50.770
"Now the image is getting clear and gaining extra tonality."

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.010
"How cool!"

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:26.040
"Look, your expression is brilliant."

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.180
"You can't snap an instant with daguerreotype, but.."

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:32.480
"daguerreotype records the piles of moments."

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:34.720
"So, the expression of a model shows.."

00:07:33.554 --> 00:07:43.550
"her/his fundamental figure that is considered to be the reflection of her/his personality."
