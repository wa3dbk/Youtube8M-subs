00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.200
The Suzuki Swift Sport has been with us for
a couple of years in its current form, and

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.400
in that time it's earnt the respect of many
as a peppy, endearingly old-school hot hatch.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.600
Last year, it gained the option of five-doors,
but that hasn't affected its character, and

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:00.800
instead has only added a little extra practicality
for those that need it - perhaps those with

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.000
a young family who aren't ready to give up
on driving fun just yet. It's still a cheekily-styled

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.200
little box of fun, with its large headlights,
gaping honeycomb grille, finned front fog

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.400
lights, and 17-inch alloy wheels with 45-profile
tyres. The extra doors haven't corrupted the

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:01.600
Swift's basic shape, and it's the same length
as its three-door brother, while the blackened

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:01.800
A- and B-pillars tie the side profile together
nicely. The styling is finished off at the

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.000
rear with a bee-sting antenna, a fairly sizeable
roof spoiler, and a pair of exhausts that

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.200
poke through a grey-coloured diffuser. The
first thing you'll notice on climbing aboard

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.400
is the acres of headroom, and there's loads
of adjustment for both the steering wheel

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.600
and the sports seats that also do an excellent
job of holding you in place. The dashboard

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:02.800
is simply laid out, there's good storage in
the glove box, door bins and centre console,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.000
where there are also charging and USB ports
for your phone. The instruments are clear,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.200
the switchgear is where you'd expect it, and
the chunky steering wheel finishes things

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.400
off nicely. It might not be the last word
in interior design, but there's something

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.600
very honest about it all. There's no fuss
to it. In the back, there's room for a couple

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:03.800
of six-footers - just - but if you're more
likely to be ferrying kids about, there are

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.000
three proper seat-belts and a couple of ISOFIX
mountings. The boot, as you'd expect, isn't

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.200
massive. You're looking at 211 litres of space
back here, and although you can increase that

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.400
to 512 litres, the seats backs fold forward
onto the bases where they still take up quite

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.600
a bit of space, and there's a high sill to
negotiate, too. However, let's get some perspective

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.800
here - this isn't supposed to be an estate
car. Power comes from Suzuki's 1.6-litre four-cylinder

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.000
petrol unit, and it produces a modest 134hp
and 160Nm of torque. In an age of 200hp turbo

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.200
hot hatches, that might sound a little, well...
boring. But Suzuki set out to deliberately

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.400
create an old-school fun-to-drive hot hatch,
and its 8.7 second 0-62mph time shows you

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:05.600
that there's more to the Swift than its horsepower
figures would suggest. On the move, the Swift

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.800
feels a little lethargic if you keep the revs
below 4,000 or so. However, that makes it

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.000
docile around town and it's very forgiving
of being left in the wrong gear. Speaking

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.200
of gears, the six-speed manual box has a light
and easy-going shift action. Peak power is

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.400
developed just below 7,000rpm, and that means
to get the best from it, you need to snick

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.600
down a ratio or two and work the engine harder.
That is kind of what the Swift is all about,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.800
though. You can't just amble along and then
expect the engine to do everything for you

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.000
- you have to engage with the experience in
the way we were used to with hot hatches before

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.200
turbocharging became a thing. It's the same
with the handling - the Swift turns in sharply

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.400
with practically no body-roll, but the ride
is on the sporty side of firm so there's a

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.600
definite purpose to it. It's never annoying,
but there's no forgetting you're in the 'fun'

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.800
version. But then, that's the point. The Swift
Sport is about having fun. It's no point-and-squirt

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.000
machine, it's a sporty little hatch that demands
- and rewards - a little extra driver involvement.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.200
It's just that now it's available as a five-door,
you can bring the family along, too. Owning

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.400
one needn't trouble the family finances, though,
with the five-door coming in at £14,499 with

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.600
a standard spec that includes satnav, climate
control, xenon headlights, keyless entry,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.800
cruise control and other goodies. CO2 emissions
of 147 g/km mean a road tax bill of £140

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.000
a year, with an official economy figure of
44.1mpg - a figure we had no trouble achieving

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.200
during our time with it. So there you go.
If you like your hot hatches pure and unspoilt

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.400
by turbos or gimmicks like stop/start and
fun-killing traction control, you might just

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.600
be exactly who Suzuki's engineers had in mind
when they made the Swift Sport.
