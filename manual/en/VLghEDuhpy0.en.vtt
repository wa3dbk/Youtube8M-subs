00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.042
Hi! Some time ago I made a video in which I talked about this service called OyatsuBox.

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:12.090
And I decided to subscribe this month to receive the box because I wanted to get some new snacks for the Candy Time section.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.230
This was one of the services that I liked the most, I made reviews about other ones but this time I decided to get the OyatsuBox.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.687
This is January’s box as I said and I want to show you what’s inside.

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:28.352
If you want to know more about this service I’ll leave the link to the page and my video on the description box.

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:32.352
This time I’ll only show the box and I’ll try the snacks on different videos.

00:00:33.352 --> 00:00:34.990
So let’s get started.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.960
First thing is the pamphlet which tells what comes in this month box.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.241
They changed it a little bit but it’s really nice.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:47.340
Also they’re adding a gashapon with every box. And basically it’s a capsule toy.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.331
You can find a lot of this type of machines in Japan, when I was younger I used to see a lot of them here too.

00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:58.632
But well I’m going to start to show you the things one by one.

00:00:58.632 --> 00:00:59.965
First is this thing here.

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:04.992
It’s a candy from the brad Meito that I haven’t hear about before and I didn’t see the candy either.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:09.076
Basically it’s a DIY candy to make your own jelly.

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:15.594
I think it’s really funny and I never saw something like this before so I can’t wait to try it and make a video about it.

00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:18.515
Then there’s this huge chips bag.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:23.680
It’s from the brand FritoLay and they’re takoyaki flavored chips for what I see on the picture.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.800
I already tried takoyaki flavored chips but this look really good too so I’ll probably like them.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.983
So when I make the video I can compare them with the other ones that I’ve tried.

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:41.958
Then we have this thing it’s a Don-Koeda chocolate bar it’s chocolate biscuit with rice puffs and almond so it sounds really tasty.

00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:46.910
So it seems like the man on the package is a fashion celebrity in Japan.

00:01:46.912 --> 00:01:54.140
Then we have this box here they’re mini Hi-Chews. And I’ve always wanted to try them so I’m really happy about this.

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:56.960
And they come in different flavors as you see in the package.

00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:04.020
Then we have a thing that I just saw and I’m super excited about because tadaaa, it’s midi strawberry Pocky.

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:10.790
The difference between normal Pocky is that the chocolate cover on these is thicker and the stick is chocolate flavor.

00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:18.070
The packaging is beautiful and I’ve already tried normal strawberry Pocky but I’m sure that I’ll love these too.

00:02:18.073 --> 00:02:20.660
I’m really happy about that.

00:02:20.664 --> 00:02:27.269
Then here we have a Caplico, it’s like an ice-cream.

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.130
In this case they’re advertising Youkai Watch, a really popular anime and this is a limited version.

00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:37.767
And I don’t know if the package is like that or if it’s a bit crashed but well here you can see the ice-cream.

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:42.959
It’s not a real ice-cream obviously because it would be melted, it’s made with wafer and chocolate.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.507
Then this ramune candies in a bottle from the brand Morinaga, they’re pretty famous.

00:02:48.507 --> 00:02:53.080
I think the package is really cute imitating the real ramune bottles.

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:56.930
I love it and I can’t wait to try them because I never tried something ramune flavor.

00:02:56.932 --> 00:03:01.735
Then this gummies called Parikore, they’re grape and peach flavor.

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:07.820
I love peach flavor and grape too so I’m willing to try them because they look really good.

00:03:07.824 --> 00:03:11.498
One thing that made me really happy was finding this here.

00:03:11.498 --> 00:03:18.977
They’re called Tohato Chocobi and they’re Shin-Chan’s cookies, I was super excited about finding them in the box.

00:03:18.977 --> 00:03:24.308
Because I watched this show when I was younger and I loved it, so I always wanted to try the cookies.

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.910
So I can’t wait to make to make a video about them.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.420
And lastly is this package here.

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:33.900
They’re called Puccho and they’re strawberry candies, it comes with two types.

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:37.900
And I was really surprised that they added an entire package of these.

00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:41.430
So really nice and as a strawberry lover I really want to try them.

00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:45.830
And the gashapon that I talked about is this one here so let’s see what I got.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.910
It’s from Naruto as I see.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.198
And I got this character here it’s a rubber keychain.

00:03:57.198 --> 00:04:02.139
I know the character but I don’t remember his name, Jiraiya maybe?

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.158
I don’t know it’s been years since I watched the anime.

00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:09.780
But well that is the one that I got I’m really happy that it was one character that I know more or less.

00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:14.507
And here is the label, it’s a shame that you can’t see what other characters you can get.

00:04:14.507 --> 00:04:17.580
But I think is a nice detail that they add this type of stuff.

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:23.780
And well those were all the things that came in my January OyatsuBox.

00:04:23.782 --> 00:04:27.220
And I’m super happy with this box since I haven’t tried any of the snacks.

00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:34.635
And I can’t wait to try everything. I really like specially the Shin-Chan cookies and the huge strawberry Pocky.

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:37.540
But everything else looks super tasty too.

00:04:37.544 --> 00:04:41.430
And I really recommend this service if you’re interested because it’s totally worth it.

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:45.980
In the description box you have all the information about the service and that’s all.

00:04:45.983 --> 00:04:51.986
Thanks for watching this video hope you liked and tell me which one of the candies do you want to see first on a Candy Time.

00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:55.900
I’ll try to post the videos as you want me to.

00:04:55.903 --> 00:05:05.907
By the way before ending the video I wanted to say that I made an instagram account because some of you asked for it, my username is KawaiiShooter, and I’ll leave the link in the description box.

00:05:05.907 --> 00:05:09.860
That’s all, thanks for watching and see you on the next video, bye!
