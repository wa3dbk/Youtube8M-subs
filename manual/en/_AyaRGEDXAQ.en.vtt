How to Tie a Bow Tie.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.090
Whether you're a distinguished professor,
a fledgling politician, or a James Bond wanna-be,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.300
knowing how to tie a bow tie comes with the
territory.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:22.330
You will need A bow tie A dress shirt or tuxedo
shirt and a mirror.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.330
Step 1.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.369
Lift up the collar of your shirt and drape
the tie around your neck with one end hanging

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.830
1 and a half inches below the other end.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.980
Step 2.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.150
Button the top button of your shirt.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.379
If you want a nice thick knot, use a tie made
of a thick material.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:39.530
Step 3.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.649
Cross the long end in front of the short end.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:43.929
Step 4.

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.370
With your thumb, bring the long end behind
the short end and pass it up through the loop

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.430
so it hangs down on top of the shorter end.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.489
Adjust the tightness of the tie now, as you
won't be able to readjust later.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.739
Step 5.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.449
Push the long end aside, and double the short
end on itself so the narrow portion of the

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.930
end is brought up to the knot and the loop
lays sideways, from one collar point to the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.310
other.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.560
Step 6.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.430
Hold this bow with one hand and don't let
go.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.960
This will stay in place for the rest of the
steps.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.210
Step 7.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.310
Pull the other end straight up behind the
bow, then loop it around the middle of the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.689
bow.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.689
Step 8.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.869
With the end behind the bow again, push the
wide center of the end through the knot, creating

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.399
a new bow facing in the opposite direction
as the first one.

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.630
Step 9.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.180
Pull on both bows at the same time to tighten
the knot.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.270
Step 10.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.009
Gently pull on the ends to return them to
the same length as the bows if necessary,

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.280
straighten the knot.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.640
Quickâ€”do something debonair!

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.200
Did you know Dating to the 18th century, the
bow tie is likely derived from the French

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.520
jabot, a style of frilly cravat.
