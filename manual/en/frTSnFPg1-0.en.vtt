Hi, I'm Travis Willingham and I'm playing
Mecha Superman in Infinite Crisis. I was first

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.189
shown artwork of Mecha Superman walking into
the studio and immediately you recognize the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.540
size and sort of the bulk and strength that's
apparent with the character, and Mecha Superman

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.140
was created in the Mecha universe where Clark
was a sickly kid and kinda built a friend

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.719
with Kryptonian technology. Maybe a playmate,
maybe a protector, but when Clark dies at

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.080
a very young age, Mecha Superman is left there
in his place, kind of with that same child-like

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.080
wonderment. Maybe that youth and pureness
that you see in Clark when he's a kid.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.220
Finding a voice for a character the very first
time is always a merging of the minds. It's

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.670
just a chance to play make-believe and create
something that's never existed before. Especially

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.880
in a character that hasn't really been introduced
to the public before. As far as I know Mecha

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.880
Superman doesn't appear anywhere else except
in this game.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.049
You'll come to the plate with what you think
a great starting for him his and you'll

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.439
take the input from the directors and the
clients and you'll finally find something

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.859
that you think really represents the sound
for that character that you want. The fact

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.639
that he looks like he's built out of massive
amounts of farm equipment, that's- automatically

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:46.310
going to increase the size of the voice. You
know, he needs to have a larger register and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.310
just kind of boom a bit more. As tempted as
I was to kinda make him *high pitched* sound like this,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.950
they... they... won't let me. *sighs*

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.789
I know the drill.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:07.200
It's always a process of patience and just
figuring out what works best for the character

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.660
until you arrive at that thing that you think
hones in and you can kind of lock-in and do

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.190
it in a certain repetitive way.
Infinite Crisis is here to play. Use me, Mecha

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.330
Superman, an instrument for good.
