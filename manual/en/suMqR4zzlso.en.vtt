00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.500
(Chairmain, Voice-over): Dear Director.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.700
Due to your... busy schedule, we have begun interviewing members of your staff.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.700
I'm certain you will let us know if this bothers you.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.780
Our debriefs keep coming back to a single subject at Outpost 17B.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.460
Can you explain to us what this "Meta" is, and what your plans are to deal with it?

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.760
(Blue soldier):  Oh no. Hell no. Excuse me, sir, but no god damn way.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.040
(Washington): You must be Lieutenant Miller.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.180
(Miller): I've got Reds coming out my ass here boss, and you show up and take away one of my men?

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.300
For a... what did you say this was for?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.580
(Soldier on balcony): Secret mission, sir!

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.560
(Miller): Awh, you gotta be, oh, what!

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.780
(Washington): I think you have bigger issues than troop assignment, soldier.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.900
How about getting some of these vehicles back in working order?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.420
(Miller): What the hell do you think I'm talking about?! This is your fault!

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.680
You sent us the new guy, he said he was good with vehicles! All he does is talk to 'em!

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.780
Talk to 'em!

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.740
What the hell is that all about?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.880
And now look at the damn things.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.960
(Washington): I don't have time to discuss your problems.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.560
I have orders, and those orders say that I need Private Caboose, and I need him now.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.520
He has information that is vital to the security of-

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.300
(Miller): Wait a second... Caboose? You're taking Caboose?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.900
And I don't have to pay you or anything like that?

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.240
(Washington): Is that a problem?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.060
(Miller): Problem?! Heh heh, hell no!

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.760
It must be Christmas mornin' and no-one told me!

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.700
You stay right there, I'll get him for ya.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.500
Private Jo-en-es.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.000
JO-EN-ES!

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.400
JO-EN-ES! Where the hell are you?!

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.660
(Jones): Sir, for the millionth time, my name is pronounced "Jones".

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.980
JONES!

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.160
(Miller): Shut up, Jo-en-es

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.960
(Jones): Seriously! Lots of people have the name, it's very common!

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.400
How am I the first guy you've met called Jones?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.220
(Miller): Jo-en-es, I need you to go down to the brig, untie Caboose, and get him up here.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.920
(Jones): Me? Alone?!

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.500
(Miller): Double time, Jo-en-es!

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.060
(Jones): It's pronounced J- [sighs] Never mind. Christ.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.300
(Washington): You keep him in the brig?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.380
(Miller): We keep him tied up in the brig!

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.580
I'm not taking any more chances.  [Gunshot]

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820
(Jones): Ahh, ow! Why?!

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.580
(Caboose): Be careful.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820
(Miller): You'll understand soon enough.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.120
(Caboose): You wanted to see me Principal Miller?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.860
(Miller): Where's the guy I sent to get ya?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.540
(Caboose): Oh, him, yeah...

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.600
Um. He let me out and then somehow shot himself in the back somehow...

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.960
Ah, but we don't think it was anyone's fault...

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.020
Everybody agrees it was an accident.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.300
(Miller): Jesus, would someone go check on him?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.000
Caboose. This here is Special Agent Washington from Blue Command.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
He has something fantastic he needs to talk to you about.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.880
(Caboose): Command? Oh no. They never have good news!

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.640
Did somebody die? Was it my mom?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.180
Is she dead? Or my dad, did my dad die again? Oh no.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.280
(Washington): What is this? I- I don't.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.520
(Miller):  Heheh, you see? He's yours now. No take-backs.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.500
(Caboose): Is it my brother? Was my brother killed?!

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.580
That's it, isn't it? My brother's dead!

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.180
(Washington): What?!

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.560
N- No, nothing like that.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.320
(Caboose): Oh good. Because I don't even have a brother!

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.920
How sad would it be to not have a brother and to lose a brother all in the same day?!

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.600
(Washington): No-one died!

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.160
(Soldier): Jo-en-es is dead sir!

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.980
(Washington): Okay, no-one besides him.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.500
(Caboose): Once again, nobody's fault.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.240
[Loud whisper] Psst! I think the new guy did it!

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.540
(Washington): Private Caboose. You were stationed at Blood Gulch, correct?

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.240
(Caboose): Yeaah... that was fun.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.680
(Washington): And our records indicate that you were infected

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.920
by an aggressive Artificial Intelligence program at one point.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.400
The Omega AI? Is that correct as well?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.660
(Caboose): Yeah... that wasn't as much fun.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.040
(Washington): Okay. Well I need you to come with me. I'm investigating a critical issue,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.980
and you seem to be the only person with the knowledge and experience necessary to help me.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.340
And I just realised how ridiculous that sounded once I said it out loud.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.820
Nonetheless, I need you to come with me.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.780
(Miller): Can I have a word with him first, sir?

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.800
(Washington): Sure, I guess.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.640
(Miller): Now, Caboose, I know we didn't always get along.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.620
(Caboose): I got tied up!

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.460
(Miller): Right. And all these mistakes, I know it's not your fault.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.000
You seem like a good kid. You're just a little... confused.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.120
(Caboose): Yeah...

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.340
He is.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.840
(Miller): But I want to give you a piece of advice.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.860
This guy looks like a tough customer,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.700
and you're bound to get into some situations that maybe you're not prepared for.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.760
(Caboose): Right. Like a rodeo.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.540
(Miller): Now if that happens. If you find yourself in danger,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.840
or in a situation where you think something bad is going to happen to you.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.420
I want you to remember just one thing.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.080
Never, ever, come back here.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.260
(Caboose): Okay.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.560
(Miller): No... I need to know that you understand. I need to hear you say it.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.780
(Caboose): Don't ever go backwards.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.920
(Miller): Okay, I guess that's as close as we're gonna get.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.820
He's all yours!

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.660
(Washington): Great. Let's get going.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.340
(Caboose): Okay.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.180
Are we there yet?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.040
Are we there yet?

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.920
Are we there yet?!
(Washington): Just...

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.020
try to stay quiet.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.980
(Miller): Boys, this is a great day! Things are finally changin' for us, I can feel it!

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.180
(Soldier): Shall we bury Jo-en-es now sir?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.760
(Miller): Fellas, let's just enjoy this moment a little longer.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.760
He's not goin' anywhere.
