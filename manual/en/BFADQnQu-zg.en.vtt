00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.779
If you are planning to undergo gastric sleeve
surgery, it will be better to know the procedures

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.509
and guidelines for maintaining the correct
weight loss even after the surgery.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:15.360
The procedure of gastric surgery will reduce
the weight by a considerable amount for the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.359
first six months after undergoing the procedure.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:25.039
The weight loss during this time will be very
fast and satisfying results are obtained.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.849
After six months the weight loss seems to
stabilize and becomes slow, but it doesn't

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.099
stop.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.820
Weight loss will be there for a whole year
after the surgery, but after about six months

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.630
there will be significant highs and lows in
the process of weight loss.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.630
There are chances that after one year the
patient may start to slowly gain all the weight

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.530
which is lost.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.140
This shows that the patients are taking in
more calories and carbohydrates than allowed

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.510
and is not compensating it with required exercise.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.230
Therefore it will be better for them if they
could stick with the gastric sleeve diet after

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.100
undergoing a gastric surgery.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.190
The primary thing to remember in a sleeve
diet is the consumption of the right amount

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.970
of water that is needed by your body.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.500
It is required that the patients who have
undergone gastric sleeve procedure should

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.190
be drinking a minimum of 2 quarts of water
in a day.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.300
The main ingredient that is to be present
in the diet of a person who has undergone

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.910
gastric surgery is protein.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.870
The right kind of gastric sleeve diet recipes
will be rich in protein.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.100
The main diet should contain about 20 grams
of protein or more.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.930
Meat, fish, poultry and shell fish are good
sources of protein.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.880
One ounce of these items contains nearly 7
grams of protein and therefore we should be

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.550
taking in an average of 3 ounces of these
items on a daily basis.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.540
Other good sources of proteins are egg white
and cheese.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.720
Out of these protein rich foods, it is the
fish and eggs which are easier for making

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.150
great gastric sleeve diet recipes.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.709
The diet plan also says about the timing of
the food consumption.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.769
The patient should be eating food on regular
intervals and munching or snacking between

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.290
the meals is strictly restricted.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.840
Some people will have to take small meals
for five or six times in a day for maintaining

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.849
their bodily needs.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.290
The diet should be less in simple sugars,
candy bars, fruit juice drinks, and sodas.
