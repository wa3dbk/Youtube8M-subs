Hello my friends and welcome to another Tuesday of tutorial!

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.700
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and today we will draw an angel.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.340
We start by measuring the height and width of the figure.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I will also measure an mark the size of the head,

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.040
in this way we will make sure
our drawing will have the right proportions.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.160
I am using a photo as a reference.
Now we draw freely, trying

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.100
to use lose movements all the way from your shoulder.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
The leg goes more or less like this...

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and I will measure the size of the feet.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.500
Good!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I think the knee should be higher. Yes.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The more measurements you have the easier it becomes.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.800
Now let´s draw the face.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.300
The eyes go at about half the height of the head.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.090
For the sketch I’m using a mechanical pencil,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.539
although for the shading I´ll use a sepia pencil.

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.500
In this case the sepia is a dark brown dry pastel.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.109
The full list of materials is in the
information bellow the video.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.100
As you saw I measured the size of the hand as well.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.840
The reason I am using the mechanical pencil and not

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.380
the sepia pencil for the sketch is because is more precise

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.300
and cleaner.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.300
Ok.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.800
At this point let´s erase all
the lines that we don´t need anymore.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.100
And I need to correct the other leg slightly.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.100
Good!

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.500
Ok, great! Now let’s shade with the sepia.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.640
You may find all these materials, practically in any

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.600
art supply store.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.600
And now, with a chamois which is a leather, I smudge it.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.200
I want the light coming from
the left so the right will be darker.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.780
And now that the chamois is dirty
so to speak, I can use it to give

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.700
a tone to the figure.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.870
Nice! I like this effect.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.500
With the kneaded eraser we pull some lights.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.310
Now with a stump which is pretty
impregnated with the sepia as well,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.400
we can shade further.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.400
Or we may draw with the sepia and then smudge.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400
Nice! I like so much doing this.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.000
Follow me on Facebook by clicking on the logo,
it will open on a different window

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
so you don´t lose anything of the tutorial.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.730
You can do the hair in the same manner,
shading with pencil,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.700
smudging with the stump, and pulling lights with the eraser.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.840
I want to thank my beautiful model
Ksenia Guryeva for the inspiration.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.160
She is an angel!

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.920
It is good to always learn
to use new materials and techniques,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.890
and that you enjoy your drawing
and with that enhance your life

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.520
and that of those around you.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.870
After you smudge it with a stump
if you wanted it even more even

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.640
you can go over it with the chamois.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.640
I am very sorry, I missed a shot
when I drew some lines on the clothing

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.659
and smudged them with the stump.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Now let´s darken the ground.

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.100
In the comments please let me know
wether you like this technique or not.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.200
Now the feathers.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.319
Feathers of course are very soft!

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.300
Specially the ones of the angels.

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:54.300
We can give a light tone and then
smudge.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.030
Cool.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.919
At this point we refine some lines
and reinforce some shadows

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:07.900
here and there.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.249
Also to the face and to the hair.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.700
And it´s ready!

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.340
