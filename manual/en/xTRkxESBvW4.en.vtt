00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.600
one, two, three, four!

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.940
Rev up your engines!

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.780
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.020
today I'm going to
show you, how you can take the dash of

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.640
your car apart, to fix any problems
inside like burned out light bulbs, now a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.849
lot of people are afraid of taking the
dash apart, but in most cars it's

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.280
actually pretty simple, because there's
not that many parts to take off, and if

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.100
you look in this Toyota, you'll see
there's two holes here

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.420
they have Phillips screws in them, so you
get Phillips screw driver, and in this case

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.650
you use a stubby Phillips screwdriver, a
short, one so will fit in and won't Jam

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.309
against part of the plastic, then you
just stick it in the hole and take the

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.980
two screws out, and out they come, and
then if you have an adjustable steering

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.840
column like this, pull it out, so you got
the most space possible to get the dash

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.120
piece out, then you get your fingers
under the dash, and pull the little clip

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.360
out, you got to squeeze a little
sometimes, but the whole thing slides

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.770
right out, now we haven't touched
anything electronic yet, so now it's time

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.580
to disconnect one of the battery cables
before we get the electronics, so we

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.420
don't short anything out, we'll just
loosen the positive battery cable then

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.270
wiggle it, take it off and move it out of the
way,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.630
you always want to do that when working
on electrical components, because you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.929
wouldn't believe the amount of people
that have called me and said, oh I took

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.740
my dash apart, but I shorted something
out and now my car won't start,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.800
take that battery cable off, you can't
short anything out while you're working,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.560
now we can just remove the four bolts that
hold the dash unit in place, there's one

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.080
on each corner, then you tilt the dash a
little and start to pull it out, then when

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.200
you get it part of the way out, you see
there's an electrical connection, you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.149
push the tang in the top and pull it out,
then you can remove the whole dash

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.860
assembly out of the way, you can access
the back side to take out light bulbs if

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.580
you need to change light bulbs, or if you
have a bad gauge or something you can

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.360
take the whole thing apart and replace
that, you can see there's little plastic

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.959
tangs and hold them on, they used to have
screws but now they're really cheap, you

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.069
just push the little tangs in, then you
can take it apart in three pieces, first

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.540
you take off the cover, when you push
these tangs you can snap the whole top

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.980
off,
then when you push these black tangs in,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.300
you can take the middle part off, then
the middle part comes apart, so if you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.350
have any broken gauges or parts, you can
just finish taking it all apart, replace

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.060
the part that you need, put it all back
together again, and here's a tip I've

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.130
used for years, say your tachometer 
breaks, these tachometers can cost so

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.630
much money, sometimes five or six hundred
bucks, go to a junkyard and buy a whole used

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.180
dash, I've gotten them as cheap as $80 and I
replace the whole unit then, then when

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.900
you're done it's easier putting it
together, the pieces just snap right on,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.070
first the middle piece, then the top
piece, then you snap the electrical

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.300
connection in the back of the dash, and
then wiggle it in place to get it back

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.260
in it's hole, there's a line up notch on
each side one on the left, and one on the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.860
right, so you get them in the right holes
and lined up, then you put the four

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.030
little bolts back in, then get the
plastic cover and snap that back in

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.500
place, and then put the screws in then
hold it in place and keep it from

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.400
rattling, and of course put the battery
cable back on, make it nice and tight,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.680
otherwise the car won't start you won't
go anywhere, so the next time your car's dash

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.880
starts acting up, why not take it apart
and fix it yourself, and remember if

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.140
you've got any car questions just visit
the Scotty Kilmer channel and I'll

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.750
answer them as soon as I get back from
the twilight zone!
