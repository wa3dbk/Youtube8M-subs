00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.900
- THANKSGIVING
IS LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.000
YOU READY FOR THAT?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.933
[cheers and applause]

00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.333
YOU'RE EXCITED.

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.533
IT SEEMS YOU'RE EXCITED.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.966
DID YOU START DRINKING ALREADY
OR SOMETHING?

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.766
WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT READY
FOR THANKSGIVING--

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.100
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT--

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.800
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE READY
FOR WHAT HAPPENS

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.866
RIGHT AFTER THANKSGIVING.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.000
SAY IT WITH ME.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.266
MY BIRTHDAY
IS IN TWO MONTHS.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.266
OH.

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.866
[laughter]

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.266
WELL, ANYWAY,
BESIDES MY BIRTHDAY

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.533
BEING IN TWO MONTHS,
IT'S ALSO BLACK FRIDAY,

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.066
THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.933
BLACK FRIDAY IS--
IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.666
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE
TO SHOP ONLINE

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.700
BUT LOVE GETTING PUNCHED
IN THE FACE.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.633
[laughter]

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.766
WHAT'S CRAZY
IS THAT STORES ARE EVEN--

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.566
THEY'RE NOT EVEN WAITING
FOR FRIDAY ANYMORE.

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.866
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.466
NOW WALMART IS OPENING
AT 6:00 P.M.

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.666
ON THANKSGIVING DAY.

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:48.966
BEST BUY OPENS AT 5:00.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.366
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S A GOOD THING,

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.033
BECAUSE YOUR PANTS
START OPENING AT 4:00.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.033
[laughter]

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.333
[sighs]

00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.866
AND--OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:03.300
[cheers and applause]

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.033
AND THIS IS A TRUE STORY
RIGHT HERE.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.233
TWO WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.100
ARE ALREADY CAMPED OUT
AT A BEST BUY.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.900
THEY HAVE BEEN THERE
SINCE NOVEMBER 5TH.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.166
TRUE STORY.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.933
THAT'S 22 DAYS
BEFORE THANKSGIVING.

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.733
22 DAYS.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.600
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH IN 22 DAYS?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.600
YOU--YOU CAN HAVE A BABY
IN 22 DAYS.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.966
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S RIGHT,

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.133
BUT THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T JUST
MISSING THANKSGIVING.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.566
THEY'RE MISSING EVERYTHING.

00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.500
I MEAN--"MOM, ARE YOU GONNA COME
HOME FOR MY BIRTHDAY THIS YEAR?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.466
TEN IS A BIG--
TEN IS A BIG YEAR."

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.600
"NO, HONEY,
I NEED A NEW PRINTER."

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.166
[laughter]

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.800
SHE'S DOWN THERE.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.533
LAST YEAR, WE HAD
A REALLY BIG BLACK FRIDAY SALE

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:47.733
IN THE ELLEN SHOP.

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.133
I WILL TELL YOU THIS.

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.333
WHILE YOU'RE HERE, YOU SHOULD
SHOP IN THE ELLEN SHOP

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.366
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
START EARLY--

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.300
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
LAST YEAR.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.933
- OH, GOSH.
- OH!

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.700
- OH, MY GOSH.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
[cheers and applause]

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:14.533
- THAT'S--THAT'S REAL FOOTAGE
OF THE ELLEN SHOP.

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:15.766
NOT DOCTORED.

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.666
THAT IS MY MOTTO:
BE KIND OR SHOP ONLINE.

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:20.033
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THAT I LIKE TO SAY OFTEN,

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:21.800
AND IT'S "LET'S DANCE."
