Hey guys Melissa here from AccessoryGeeks.
What I have with me today is Samsung

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.530
Infuse 4G and this really awesome Samsung
Infuse 4G Vehicle Navigation Mount.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.200
So you don't need that GPS anymore
and you have it right here.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.030
How it works is you dock your
phone into this part.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.520
You literally dock it.
It is down here.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.070
It snaps into place and it is made for
the Infuse so it fits your phone perfectly.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.940
On the back here there is these little
wholes that you pop into this part so I'm

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.890
really cool about this is
it is so adjustable.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.250
I mean loosen this part and then you
can put it anywhere you want.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.890
So you would snap this and move it into
place, tighten it and put it however you want.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.880
So depending on if you want it on
your windshield or dust board, it has a lever

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.810
activated suction cups so say
you want it right here.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.970
You push the lever down
and it is in place.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.310
It is not going anywhere.
Super awesome because say you decided you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.160
wanted somewhere else instead you literally
just undo the lever and totally move.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.340
It doesn't leave any kind of residue or
anything so it really is your choice

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.400
 where you put it and if you change 
your mind you can move it anywhere.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.770
What is really cool is besides that is once
you dock your Infuse in here it has

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.350
some really cool features.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.270
It automatically puts in vehicle mode so
ones it stopped you can use a speaker

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.090
phone you can use a GPS navigation information
hence free with Google voice search.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.610
You can run your favorite apps.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.080
Another cool feature is on the back there
is a micro USB port and a stereo 3.5 mm

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.770
line up for auxiliary output so
they got you covered here.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.470
You don't need any other thing for
navigation, you got it right here.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.410
You know the fitted cradle holds the handset
while you drive so you can check

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.700
out where you need to go without having
a hold of your phone and get hands free ticket.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.720
So this is a really great item to have

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.480
and go get it now it is $44.99
