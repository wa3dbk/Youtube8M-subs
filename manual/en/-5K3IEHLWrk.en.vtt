Hey, I'm Doug Doppler and on behalf of Line 6 I'd like to welcome you

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.030
to the POD HD Connectivity Series. In this video, we're going to be mapping

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.050
tones and tunings from James Tyler Variax to POD HD500 for some pretty

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.070
amazing hands-free control. Then in the next video, we're going to be looking at the pretty amazing

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.090
things you can do with POD HD and DT series amplifiers via the proprietary

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.110
L6 Link. In the third video, we're going to pull all this gear together to create

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.130
some pretty complex sounding rigs that are surprisingly easy to configure. So let's get started.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.150
So this is the brand new JTV-89 and it features

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.170
traditional electronics as well as Variax technology. You activate that by

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.200
pushing and turning the guitar model selector and alternate tuning knobs.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.220
POD HD300 and 400 both receive Variax data over a standard guitar cable

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.250
while the HD500 features a special Variax digital input.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.270
This VDI allows you to call up tunings and models on a preset by preset basis

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.300
from the HD500. So for this first demo, I've dialed up

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.320
a Blackface Lux model with some reverb on the HD500. I've also

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.340
programmed the HD500 to force the Variax to switch to the bridge position

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.350
of the Spank model as soon as I select this preset.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.370
For a translation of model names, you might want to check out the POD HD Model Gallery and

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.390
the James Tyler Variax Pilot's Handbook at line6.com.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.570
So for this one, I copied over the Blackface Lux model with reverb

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.600
that I used in the last demo to a new preset that also incorporates a brand new custom

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.640
preset that I created on the JTV-89 and this preset calls up

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.670
the neck position of the Lester model with a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.700
half-step down tuning preset.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.890
So for this one, I've dialed up the bridge position of the T-Model in combination with

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.930
the Drop D Flat tuning on the JTV-89, and I've dialed up the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.960
P-75 model with some delay and reverb on the POD HD500 for something

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.000
a little bit more rock 'n roll.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.170
So the JTVs also feature some really great acoustic guitar models

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.180
and on this one I've created a custom preset using the Model 1 in combination

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.200
with a baritone altered tuning preset. Now, I've also done something really interesting

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.220
with the POD HD500. I've created an effects loop and the send is actually

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.240
feeding my DI box, in turn going out to my mixer and in turn

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.270
that's going to feed my powered monitors. Although it's off when the preset loads, I've

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.280
integrated reverb into this preset that I can activate by stepping on the FS1

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.300
controller. I've also integrated the Line 6 Mission Expression Pedal

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.320
so that once I've activated the reverb I can actually control how wet I want the signal to be.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.370
So that concludes the first video in the POD HD Connectivity Series.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.390
Next, we're going to be checking out all the cool stuff that we can do with POD HD500

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.410
into the DT series tube amplifiers via Line 6's proprietary

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.430
L6 Link.
