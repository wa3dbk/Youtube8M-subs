00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.500
In 1977.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.620
A signal was received.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.580
It is the only recorded incident of alien contact.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.400
The source of the transmission has never been revealed.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.100
Until now.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.180
Ohhh!!

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.300
Is that it?

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.560
No, it's another spaceship that fell out of the sky, dumbass.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.820
Daddy likes.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.100
What else they got in there?

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.660
There's a trigger in here but it doesn't do anything.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.020
Where's my phone?! I gotta make a vine!

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.540
Conflict is coming.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.800
But we need your help.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.140
I think they gave me amnesia.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.840
Anesthesia.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.120
Shut up dude. Ya'll stupid. I'm outta here.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.200
You expect me to train these idiots!

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.000
Get the hell out of here man. I know what I'm doing.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.480
Let's crank this baby up to a hundred.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.820
Next.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.520
The repulser defensive gauntlet produces an energy shield.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.420
Yeah. I just have a quick question before we begin. How exactly...

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.020
Ohawwgh!

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.040
Your new uniforms.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.900
They are not anti-flammable.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.040
They are flammable.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.960
They will not retard flames.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.600
Are you expecting us to catch on fire?

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.580
Oh!

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.220
I should go.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.780
This alien is gonna be here in two days.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.540
If we're not there to fight it, who's gonna be?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.960
Are you with me?

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.580
Hell no!

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.180
What're you doing?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.640
I'm having a beer.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.300
I just ran for three miles.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.800
Yeah, like a quarter mile at a time.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.520
Woooohoo!

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.720
They're actually working together.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.540
If anything comes at you, I... will... block it.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.440
Why the hell are we Lazer Team anyway?

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.460
Because I have a laser.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.760
Yeah. But the rest of us don't.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.860
Right. You're the team part.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.500
Nobody cares about your stupid name.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.280
The helmet heightens all mental functions.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.760
And other visual enhancements.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.620
Guys.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.720
The hell is your problem?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.900
Oh! Turn it off! Oh God! I wish I was dead!
