Hi, I'm Peter Edwards from Bluetutors.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.370
We teach children of all ages, right from
primary school to degree level and we find

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.670
the highest quality tutors.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.529
And today I'm going to teach you some maths.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.460
We're now going to look at how to change a
decimal into a fraction.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.630
And so we're going to start off with a fairly
simple example and hopefully expand that into

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.190
something a bit more complicated.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.950
So if we look at the first example we have
up here, 0.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.089
12.

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.690
So what you have to think about when you're
converting this to a fraction is how many

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.150
decimal places do we have.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.840
In this case, we have two.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.040
The first decimal place represents tenths
and the second represents hundreds.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.809
So, this in fact is equal to 12/100.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:07.190
And we can simplify that by dividing top and
bottom by four to get 3/25.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.210
So this decimal here, 0.12, is equal to 3/25.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.970
So let's do a similar thing with this decimal
now.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.460
In fact, you can see we have four decimal
places.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.650
So we have tenths, hundredths, thousandths,
and ten thousandths.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:35.750
So this is going to be equal 
to 7524/10000.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.409
And so again we can simplify that.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.530
This might take me a while.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:02:06.940
So we'll divide top and bottom by two first
to give us 3762/5000 which is equal to 1881/2500.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.530
And so that is that fraction simplified.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.440
Now, we're going to look at a more complicated
situation where we have a decimal but these

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.640
two dots here mean that that line of digits
is repeated over and over again.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.600
This is a recurring decimal which never ends
and we're going to try and work out what fraction

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.930
this is.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.820
Now, the way to do that is to take this and
in fact, multiply it so that this decimal

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.170
point comes after this seven here.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.480
So we need the point to jump six times.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.140
So we're going to multiply this by one million.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.209
So we're going to call this number here 'x'
and we're going to say 1,000,000 times x is

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:06.020
equal 
to 142857.142587.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.730
And again this recurs over and over again.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:21.800
Now we have this, what we can do is take our
other x 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.160
and what we're going to do now is take this
bottom line away from this top line.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:38.610
That leaves us with 999999x equal to 142857.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.990
And so x is equal to 142857/999999.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:53.520
And if you put that into your calculator and
work it out, you will see that that is equal

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.330
to 1/7.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.450
And so that is how to work out a fraction
when you have a recurring decimal.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.340
And as long as it is a recurring decimal and
not an irrational number, then you'll always

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.500
be able to that.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.260
And that is how to convert decimals into fractions.
