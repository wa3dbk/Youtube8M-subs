00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.749
Hi this is Lee with Prima Coffee,

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.949
here to show you the 
Hario V60 Fretta Iced Coffee maker.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.609
You have the glass server

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.329
with the measurements here on the side.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.880
This is what will hold your ice,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.489
so you put the ice in there,
to about the top.

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.169
And then put your lid on.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.360
Alright, and then you have a V60 here.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.410
Put that right on top.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.580
Then you can take a filter

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:50.040
and fold the sides, edges,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.070
place that right in there.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.420
Alright, so that is the Fretta set up.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.450
Basically, the Fretta 
takes the whole V60 idea

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.000
and better suits it 
for pour over ice brewing.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.980
You’ll sometimes see people,
you may have tried it at home,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.980
using a V60 
and trying to pour directly over ice

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.200
which can produce great results.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.720
The only problem is that 
as your ice starts to melt,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.510
only some of the brewed coffee 
will drip onto the ice,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.030
making it inconsistent 
throughout the brewing process.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.740
What the Fretta seeks to do

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.150
is to keep all the ice 
above the rest of the coffee,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.820
so every drip is hitting ice first.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.150
And also,
just bring this back out again,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.100
instead of hard drips,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.470
it’s going to use dispersion 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.580
to kind of bring the drips
of coffee out

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.150
and let them fall gently on the ice

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.500
and that’s kind of a nice feature as well.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.990
This is a 600ml 
brewing device and server.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.899
So we recommend using about 300ml of ice

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.000
and you can weigh that as grams.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.950
And then 300ml of water is what you’ll 
actually pour through the coffee grounds.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.329
You want to go 
a little bit finer for iced coffee

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.229
just because you’re probably 
going to be pouring less

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:17.540
and you’re pouring less water and so 
you’re going to want to hold up that water

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.299
a little bit and extend the process.

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.689
And then you would just pour as normal
anywhere from 2 ½ to 3 minutes

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.899
is probably well suited 
for about 36g of coffee.

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:32.909
And after you’re done 
you can remove everything here.

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.749
So, again that is the Hario V60 Fretta

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:37.389
and thanks for watching.
