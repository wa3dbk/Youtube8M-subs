00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.120
NARRATOR &gt;&gt; Turtles are amazing creatures
for many reasons.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.950
They've been swimming the oceans for over
150 million years,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.990
since dinosaurs roamed the earth,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.390
females swim thousands of kilometres to return
to the specific beach

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.189
where they were born to lay their own eggs,

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.480
and, after mating, females store sperm

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.800
and fertilise their own eggs when they're
good and ready.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.880
And the turtles you encounter when swimming
in the ocean are serious survivors.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.980
Green turtles lay approximately 110 eggs per
clutch,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.940
several times per breeding season,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.210
and, due to predation and other threats,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.910
only about one in 1000 hatchlings will live
long enough

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.220
to return to the island in 30 years.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.340
Not great odds.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.990
Making the prospect of a long life even more
dubious

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.710
is the fact that some hatchlings don't even
make it out of the nest.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.180
On Lady Elliot Island, a coral cay in the
southernmost Great Barrier Reef,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.150
hatchlings spend about a week digging their
way out,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.350
but some in nearly every nest become trapped
beneath pieces of coral.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.860
They can survive there for a week in the sun

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.150
and up to four weeks in the shade,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.200
but, after that, they die, without ever embracing
the water.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.570
Thankfully, the Lady Elliot hatchlings have
their own personal turtle angel,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.210
John Meech, a park ranger with over 30 years
experience working with these endangered species.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.860
Most people aren't permitted to touch nesting
turtles, nests, or hatchlings,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.300
but John has a permit from the Australian
Government to work on and handle marine turtles,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.310
and he visits a couple times per month during
hatchling season to rescue those that are trapped.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.659
 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.690
First, he walks around the island,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.479
looking for nests where all other hatchlings
have emerged.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.479
JOHN&gt;&gt; There's a depression that's that deep
compared with the level of the sand and the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.299
only way it could ever get like that without
a build up of sand around it, meaning a bird

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.150
or a crab had scratched it out, is that it
has collapsed.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.210
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; Upon locating these nests, he dons
knee pads,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.090
kneels on the sand, and starts digging.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.090
JOHN&gt;&gt; If I've made a mistake, we'll move
on to the next site.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.400
KARA&gt;&gt; Oh my God, that's awesome. Wow...

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400
OBSERVER&gt;&gt; Can you tell what it is?'

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.600
JOHN&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a green, yep.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.660
 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.950
Now they're in pretty good sand here,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.200
so the chances are I'll dig right down to
the egg and there won't be another hatchling....

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.300
OBSERVER&gt;&gt; It amazes me that they can get
enough oxygen.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.800
JOHN&gt;&gt; They have the capability of breathing
through the crystals of the sand, no problem at all.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.900
OBSERVER&gt;&gt; Oop, there's another one!

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.890
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; John tells us that the majority
of Lady Elliot's hatchlings are male

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.180
due to the cool, 25-27-degree white sand.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.489
Fortunately, only a couple little guys were
trapped in this first nest.

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.450
However, the next nest has quite a few more.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.500
JOHN&gt;&gt; There we are: underneath that.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.260
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; I tag along with John to one more
nest, but it's older and doesn't yield happy results.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.459
 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.400
JOHN&gt;&gt; I think we're too late for this one
guys.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.300
NARRATOR&gt;&gt; The hatchlings John did rescue
today will spend the rest of the afternoon

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.129
in a cool, dark place.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.780
Then, come nightfall, he'll take these eager
swimmers to a beach away from the resort's lighting,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.160
 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.590
and guests will observe as they scamper down
the beach towards their ocean home.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.080
We don't know whether any will survive to
adulthood,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.430
but, thanks to John, at least they'll have
a chance.
