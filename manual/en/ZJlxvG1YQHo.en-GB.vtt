Laura Dennes: My name is Laura Dennes and
I'm in Stage 3 at Randwick TAFE doing dental

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.090
technology. A dental technician is basically
someone who makes any appliance or prosthesis

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.509
in the mouth. So we make dentures, we make
crown and bridge, we make orthodontic appliances,

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.560
anything that the mouth needs we fill the
gap.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.239
I'm waxing up a full on full denture, so a
denture for someone who has no teeth.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:39.250
So what I'm doing now, I'm setting these artificial
teeth in wax. You set the upper on an occlusal

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.160
key like this and then you set the lower teeth
against the upper teeth.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.200
My favourite subject so far has probably been
crown and bridge, just because it's very small

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.790
and detailed and I really enjoy doing the
real nitty-gritty small stuff.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.820
The teachers here, they're all very excellent.
They've all been technicians for many years

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.370
and have a lot of experience and knowledge.
They really do care about how good you become

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.360
because we're the dental technicians of tomorrow.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.830
You usually do end up specialising in something.
You learn everything at TAFE and then you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.690
would go into just being an acrylic technician
or just being a crown and bridge technician,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.820
or orthodontics.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.320
The style of teaching works for me because
it's very practical based. You do learn a

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.830
lot on the job but having both really balances
it out and gives you an overall understanding.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.159
When I learn things at TAFE my boss then takes
what I've learnt and applies it to work and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.690
each individual patient and case.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.310
I really enjoy doing TAFE because it's giving
me the skills to go out into the workforce

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.840
and work as a dental technician. I've always
wanted to do something arty but I never thought

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.359
it would take me in this direction.
