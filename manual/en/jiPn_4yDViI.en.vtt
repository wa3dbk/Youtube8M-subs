How to Choose a Toilet-Training Potty.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.780
Before you can toilet train your toddler,
you'll need to buy them a potty to learn on.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.070
Here's how to pick one that will help guarantee
toilet-training success.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.880
You will need A toddler ready to potty train
A store or web site that sells potty chairs

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.220
A step stool (optional) (optional) (optional)
Stickers (optional) (optional) (optional)

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.580
and markers (optional) (optional) (optional).

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.580
Step 1.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.770
Shop for a potty in person, and take your
child with you.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.840
They're the one who'll be using it, so they
should have a say in which one you bring home.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.000
If you think you'll get a better deal online,
pick out the potty you want at a store, and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.120
then go on the web to order it.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.120
Step 2.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.300
Peruse the store's stock.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.250
There are two types – a portable potty,
and a seat that fits on top of the regular

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.250
toilet.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.100
Let your child sit on any potty they seem
interested in.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.560
Look for ones that fit them comfortably, and
won't tip over.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.010
A high seat back is a plus.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.649
You can opt for an insert for the regular
toilet seat – called a potty ring –that

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.100
will make it small enough for them to sit
on.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.020
Keep a stool in the bathroom so they can safely
climb onto the seat.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.110
Step 3.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.080
Check for features, like a removable bowl
that you can lift out and empty into the regular

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.530
toilet, and a splash guard – a lip on the
front of the seat that will prevent urine

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.000
from hitting the floor.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.290
If you have a boy, you may want to get a potty
with a deflector, which will keep his urine

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.200
from spraying on the floor.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Step 4.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.150
Consider other bells and whistles.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.500
Potties feature everything from toilet paper
holders to sound effects like flushing and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
music.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.020
Avoid potty chairs with large seams or crevices,
which are difficult to clean and can pinch

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.159
the skin.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.729
If you buy a potty ring, run your hand along
the inside before you buy it to check for

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.619
any sharp edges.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:45.720
Step 5.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.420
Bring the potty home, and put it in the bathroom.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.530
If your toddler wants to decorate the seat
with stickers or markers, let them.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.020
The more they can do to make it their own,
the sooner they'll be willing to actually

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.130
use it.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.670
Did you know A watchmaker named Alexander
Cummings invented the first flush toilet in

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.020
1775.
