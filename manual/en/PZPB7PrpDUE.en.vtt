My name is Leonard Kelly from New Jersey,
I came to rightlook.com to learn alloy wheel

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:33.309
repair and had a great time. I learned a lot
and can’t wait to get started. I chose rightlook.com

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.620
because after researching several different
websites for wheel repair, rightlook.com had

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.190
the best reputation and most comprehensive
training and they provided testimonials which

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.809
helped me make my decision.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.350
There were only two of us in the class, that’s
all they allow so we had a lot of one-on-one

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.160
with the trainer. He was always next to us
making sure we were doing everything right.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.070
He did provide us with a lot of real world
knowledge because he’s been in the field

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:11.670
for so long. So not only did we get the basics
of wheel manufacturing, or fixing alloy wheels,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.810
we also got little tips when we would do something
maybe wrong, or something was slowing us down.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.409
He was able to give u some tips and tricks
to help us in the future because of such a

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.520
background. We learned a lot but we also had
a great time.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.130
For me the 2nd day when we got to do a wheel
and make our own colors was great. We could

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.500
mix any of the paint and make our own color;
we came up with some pretty interesting designs.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.360
For me, that was the best part but the whole
class was a great time.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.700
The equipment was great, the wheel right system
really seems like it speeds up the repair.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.720
I’ve known people who’ve tried to do it
without it and you just don’t get the results.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.910
The chemicals weren’t too obnoxious… but
everything was pretty easy, everything was

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.640
covered step-by-step.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.940
I would definitely people that would work
for me in the future come here rather than

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.750
try to teach them myself because you get such
a great background… I feel very confident

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.940
to start our last car here, with a customer’s
car, a Mercedes, and you’re a little nervous

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.330
at first but it came out fine. So yea, I’m
very confident.
