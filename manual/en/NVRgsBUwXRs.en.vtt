00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So have you been practicing much this week?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.000
Yeah I practiced a bit yesterday and went through all my routines.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.000
I was also just out on the stage.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.000
And what about now?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.000
I want to go over a few things but mostly just freestyle. 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.000
Don't you think you're overdoing it?

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.000
No, I am fine. I'll practice tonight and then tomorrow I'll take a break.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.000
So it's just to keep yourself in shape?

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.900
Exactly.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
How do you feel after the training?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.000
Not bad, I am tired and injured myself a little bit but I'll be alright.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.000
But you believe in yourself? You know what you have to do?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.000
Yeah, as always. It's ok. I'll be alright. 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.000
In a competition like this you are out there on your own,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.000
and you represent your crew, your city, your skills. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.000
Exactly, that is so true. 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.000
So who would you like to battle in the first round?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.000
I could picture Neguin as a fitting opponent for you.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.000
With him it's question and answer, but you are better than him at that. 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:44.000
I think it would get really difficult for you if you have to battle someone who only does footwork. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Yeah, the Americans always have loads of footwork &amp; that style doesn't really suit us.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.000
I think it will be really tough to battle someone like Roxrite.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.000
He's been in the game for a long time and has a big reputation. 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.000
With Neguin it will be a question and answer and I'll get into the battle.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.000
Roxrite will just be on stage and do his show. 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.000
His dancing style is more based on the floor and that's not as explosive.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.000
I am explosive, just like you You have explosive moves. 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.000
We jump in all directions. 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.000
With him it's different, that's how you never know how to battle him. 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.000
But never think you need to play to the jury. 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.000
You have to do your own thing and stay true to yourself. 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.000
No matter who I am battling, I'll give it everything. 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.000
This guy, that guy, Neguin, it doesn't matter. 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.000
Korean, American, Japanese...

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.000
We will show them what the French immigrants have to offer!
