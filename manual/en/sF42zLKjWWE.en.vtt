00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.375
What's up guys?

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.060
It is Brian, back with a video.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.674
I know it has been, what's it been, three weeks

00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:07.273
two or three weeks since I've made a video.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.680
I'm sorry!

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.900
That's how I want to start this off.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.654
I apologize for the break,

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:13.214
I apologize for the delay,

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:14.134
whatever you want to call it.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.220
I am here at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.560
You guys worked great with me this summer

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.200
when I was down here.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.234
But now I'm down here for four years.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.180
So that's a little bit different than college

00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:27.022
er, a little bit different than the summer academy. 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.600
I guess what I want to say is there's going to be an adjustment period.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.180
There's going to be some time

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:34.594
and you guys have already noticed

00:00:34.594 --> 00:00:35.595
there has been some time

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.920
for getting used to college.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.274
The problem is:

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.720
I do not have my X-Plane stuff down here.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.380
I've got my iPad

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.714
which I'm currently filming with

00:00:45.714 --> 00:00:47.834
I've got my DSLR camera

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:49.214
which is charging.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.520
I've got a brand new laptop.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.720
Which I'm going to open in just a second

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.913
not in front of you guys 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.920
I don't plan to do an unboxing video.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.020
That leaves us with very few options to make videos.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.775
I want you guys to let me know what you think I should do.

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:09.195
My main ideas are

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:10.294
1. Take a break.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.660
Do no uploads

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.034
Get completely set in my schedule

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:14.913
Take potentially the whole semester off

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.520
Say goodbye to you guys for a little bit.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.060
2. Say goodbye to X-Plane for a little bit.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.900
Do real world every Tuesday.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.080
3. I have my iPad

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.040
I could do more app videos.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.515
I think you guys kind of liked my last one

00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:34.715
"Top Seven Must Have Flight Apps"

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.680
I could add more apps to that,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.680
showcase those.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.680
I could find some weird app and do a Let's Play series

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.100
I know it's not too much of a gaming channel

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.848
but we could do that.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.320
We could also do something like Flight Gear

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.360
a lesser known, lesser used flight sim.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.740
We could also do something

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.740
where I just kind of talk.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.740
I know that doesn't sound great

00:02:03.814 --> 00:02:05.814
because I obviously talk way too much

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.820
It could be something where

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.620
if you're younger than me

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.920
and you want to become an airline pilot

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.280
like I do

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.780
It could be

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.420
these are the steps I'm taking

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.860
how's it working

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.480
do you want to follow in my footsteps?

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:21.754
I'll take your suggestions through the weekend

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.420
and I will find some video to get to you guys

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.315
Help me help you!

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.274
I want to make videos that you guys want to see

00:02:31.228 --> 00:02:33.228
you guys have to tell me what you want to see

00:02:33.228 --> 00:02:34.608
Thank you very much

00:02:34.608 --> 00:02:37.600
for being great through this adjustment period

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.953
and through this college period.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.800
I know it's been a change so far

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.934
and will continue to be a change

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:45.454
but I know you guys will work with me.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.220
I cannot thank you guys enough for that.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.960
A sincere thank you!

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.494
Let's see where college takes us

00:02:53.494 --> 00:02:55.494
We can only go up from here.

00:02:55.494 --> 00:02:56.354
Thanks guys!
