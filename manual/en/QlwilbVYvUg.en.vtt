00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.670
You know, the hot tub is cool now

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.630
But they poisoned it

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.570
I know, right… how? 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.610
Sing me some harmonies!

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.720
It's a small picture in a shop somewhere

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.350
And I know who it is!

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.240
It's Mormon Judy

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.740
And cow people.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.820
A little pitchy

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.730
But mmm

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.770
Good stuff!

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.430
Governor Romney's black

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.620
I mean, uh, I think "black" can be judged—

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.560
How do I do this?

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.610
Dude, I don't have a Jet-Ski…

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.330
Not the kind you're talking about.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.240
Plus everyone can see that I'm not black.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.700
I mean, this isn't scientific stuff!

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.120
I heard there's not going to be a test!

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.480
But I mean, I do want you to support me and be my man…

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.910
That's beautiful!

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.940
I know he's black…

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.310
Ahmed, how did you know about whodunnit in the lounge?

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.630
I didn't know.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.910
Oh, you didn't! Oh, oh, well they started clapping

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.810
for the mad cow!

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.180
Until someone sold him

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.270
And then, and then when he died, they had him stuffed!

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.320
Like that water buffalo…

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.100
Stuffed.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.490
That dude's the sickest. 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.400
We hate him.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.610
Because he had eggs for a bath.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.160
Gonna throw up tonight.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.420
Ahhh, but if you throw up

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.380
Then it's as a jealous woman.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.280
In horrible weather, I sneeze and I just lose the puppets.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.960
I'm thinking, Governor Romney won't do that, ok?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.700
And this has got me thinking…

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.880
I see a purple

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.630
idiot

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.670
Who speaks German

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.550
With a big, spunky, Irish Labradoodle puppy.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.830
Ohh, he got me

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.060
And I want you to feel bad

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.140
'Cause I've got funny radiation coming up on my desk and it's too much

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.890
Ah come on, I'm not a robot, okay.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.180
I wish.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.810
Then I could go higher, and you could rotate my arm 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.890
and send me whooshing into space

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.070
Can you hear me?

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.550
Now Matt, shush, because the sofa bears don't know.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.710
Go ride off, and I'll defeat 17 bears while you're gone

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.670
But first I want you two to turn and look at each other.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.250
Yeah.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.070
Oh, now that's nice.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.770
Just stare deeply into each other's eyes.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.170
Yeah.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.500
Good, now say the first thing that pops into your brain!

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.090
I don't want to touch sandpaper.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.540
I like "The Wiz"!

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.130
Okay, all right

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.830
Now I want to try something

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.800
Why don't we go, "mmmm"

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.340
Just go, "mmmmmmmmm"

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.760
"Mmmmmmmmmmmm…."

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.770
"Mmmmmmm…"

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.980
"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm…"

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.150
Yeah, ok, good, that's what I want you to do.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.350
Now follow my lead.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.670
I'm jumping in a pimento shower.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.660
I wanted the music first.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.150
In the tragic square of the Fresh Prince

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.660
There went a perfect brown baby.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.970
The guards can see we're all out of weapons, no machetes

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.540
Lotion raw bruises

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.450
Lotion raw bruises.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.290
Drink

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.330
Or sip

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.220
A wench

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.290
At our hotel

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.550
Wolf government

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.520
Anchovies

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.750
When they laugh at you, you'll drown

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.300
Eye of the Sparrow

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.020
This girl slipped on my arrow.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.010
I love you two, okay?

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.120
Now I want you to turn and look at me.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.620
[snoring sounds]

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.340
Ahmed?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.320
Yeah

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.840
Uhhh, he's asleep…

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.670
Ah! Oh!

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.420
It's party time, chumps!

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.410
Drink! [Drink!]

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.380
Or sip! [Sip!]

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.260
A wench at our hotel!

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.500
Wolf government!

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.510
Anchovies!

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.040
If they laugh at you, you'll drown!

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.050
Eye of the Sparrow!

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.480
Eye of the Sparrow!

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.310
That girl slipped on my arrow!

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.340
Drink!

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.240
Or sip!

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.460
Anchovies!

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.390
GO!
