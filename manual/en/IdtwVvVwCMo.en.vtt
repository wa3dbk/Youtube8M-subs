Hello, my name is Luis Estrada, and I'm a
software developer. In this video, I'll show

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.330
you how to sell computers online. Most people
start in the online computer business prefer

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.900
to use an intermediary like eBay to sell their
products. You could use eBay to sell just

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.160
one or as many computers as you want. If you
want just a few used computers, then this

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.960
would be the best option for you. Because
it allows you to publish your item in a manner

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.620
of minutes. However, if you want to make a
business out of this, it might be better if

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.799
you create your own online store on this website.
eBay provides all the necessary technology

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:46.730
that makes it easy to create your store without
having to code any html yourself. You will

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.510
be able to choose your own graphics, colors
and font types to give your store any desired

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.780
appearance. You can even insert your own logo
at the top of every page on your online store.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.920
The only disadvantage of using eBay to sell
your articles is that you need to pay fees

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.530
and commissions for every computer that you
sell. When you list an item on eBay, you're

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.050
charged an insertion fee. If the item sells,
you are also charged a final value fee. The

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.120
total cost of selling an item is the insertion
fee plus the final value fee. The basic fee

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.880
structure depends on whether you're selling
the item using an auction style listing or

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.780
selling the item at a fixed price. In the
case of selling computers using an auction

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.390
style, you need to pay an insertion fee of
four dollars for computers that cost more

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.250
than five hundred dollars. Then you pay a
final fee of eight point seven five percent

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.940
of the initial twenty-five dollars plus three
point five percent of the remaining closing

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.890
value balance, if your computer is sold for
less than a thousand dollars. Most new computers

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.280
are sold at a fixed price. In this case, you
pay an insertion fee of thirty five cents

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.380
and a final fee of eight percent of the initial
fifty dollars, plus four point five percent

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.360
of the remaining closing value balance for
articles under a thousand dollars. If the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.390
computer is sold for over a thousand dollars,
then you would add a few of one percent for

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.970
the exceeding value. According to these numbers,
if you sell a one thousand dollar computer,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.650
then you would end up paying a total commission
of about forty-seven dollars, which represents

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.840
about five percent of the sale price. If your
utility percentage is perhaps ten or fifteen

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.400
percent, then a good portion of your earnings
goes to eBay. In the next video we will discuss

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.580
the possibility of creating your own online
store. That way, you do not need to pay fees

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.710
or commissions. I am Luis Estrada, and I've
just showed you how to make money with mere

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.549
websites.
