00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:04.266
ON THE NEW SEASON OF
"DANCING WITH THE STARS,"

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.700
BUT LAST MONTH
THEY MADE HISTORY

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.733
BY WINNING THE UNITED STATES'
FIRST EVER GOLD MEDAL

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.233
IN OLYMPIC ICE DANCING.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:10.233
TAKE A LOOK.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.200
[cheers and applause]

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:28.766
PLEASE WELCOME
OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALISTS

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.466
MERYL DAVIS AND CHARLIE WHITE.

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.266
WELL, HELLO, YOU TWO.
- HELLO.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.100
- HOW'S IT FEEL--
HAS IT SUNK IN YET

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.766
THAT YOU'RE OLYMPIC
GOLD MEDALISTS?

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.866
- YOU KNOW, NOT REALLY.

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:41.166
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY
COUPLE OF WEEKS SINCE WE WON,

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.366
AND WE GOT HOME AND--

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.900
YOU KNOW, WE WENT TO THE RINK--

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.700
WE'RE GONNA BE TRAINING FOR A
TOUR, "STARS ON ICE," COMING UP,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.500
AND WE NEEDED TO COME UP WITH
OUR PROGRAMS.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
AND I'M DRIVING TO THE RINK,
AND IT'S JUST, LIKE,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.800
HITTING ME
THAT THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.833
I WAS SO NERVOUS, GETTING
PREPARED FOR THE OLYMPICS,

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.166
AND READY TO MAKE IT COUNT,

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.533
AND NOW I ACHIEVED THAT GOAL,
AND IT'S JUST--

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.966
IT'S CRAZY.
IT REALLY IS.

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.700
- YOU'RE DRIVING
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT NOW

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.700
WITH A GOLD MEDAL.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.066
- THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.866
- AND NOT ONLY DID YOU MEDAL,
YOU GOLD MEDALED.

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.333
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.233
AND SO YOU'VE BEEN SKATING
TOGETHER FOR 17 YEARS.

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:12.433
- YEAH.
- NOBODY ELSE?

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:13.866
IT'S JUST BEEN YOU TWO
FOR 17 YEARS.

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.900
- JUST THE TWO OF US.
- HOW DID Y'ALL FIND EACH OTHER,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.366
AND HOW DID YOU
START DOING THIS?

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.700
- WELL, WE ACTUALLY GREW UP DOWN
THE STREET FROM ONE ANOTHER,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.200
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
AND WE'RE JUST--

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.033
- I DO.
- WELL, GOOD.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.200
BUT, YEAH, AND SO WE STARTED
SKATING TOGETHER

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.633
WHEN WE WERE EIGHT AND NINE,
AND WE FIT REALLY WELL,

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.800
AND OUR PERSONALITIES
WENT REALLY WELL TOGETHER,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.133
AND 17 YEARS LATER--

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.800
- LOOK AT THAT.
HOW CUTE.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.266
- OH.
- ADORABLE.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.033
- AND WE LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.233
- WE'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME,
EXACTLY, YEAH.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:45.166
- THAT'S REALLY AMAZING,
TO LOOK AT THAT AND SEE THAT

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.933
FROM THAT, THIS IS WHERE
YOU END UP,

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:50.700
TOGETHER 17 YEARS LATER
WINNING A GOLD MEDAL.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.066
- YEAH.
- IT'S INCREDIBLE.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.500
- IT'S CRAZY FOR US TO THINK
TOO, BUT EXCITING.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.633
- AND SO I UNDERSTAND
YOU WENT TO SOME OSCAR PARTIES.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:59.466
IT'S--THERE'S SOME PERKS
WHEN YOU HAVE GOLD MEDALS, HUH?

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:02.500
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE WERE
AT THE VANITY FAIR PARTY,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.566
AND WE HAD HEARD RUMORS
THAT YOU WERE THERE,

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.033
BUT WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO SEE YOU.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.600
- I WAS THERE.
I'M SORRY I MISSED YOU.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.100
- YEAH, WE HAD FUN.
WE HAD A LOT OF FUN.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.933
- YEAH, WE--I MEAN,
THERE WAS SO MANY FAMOUS PEOPLE,

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.266
AS YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.300
JUST ALL OF THE MOST FAMOUS
PEOPLE YOU CAN IMAGINE,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.133
AND SO WE WERE TRYING
TO PLAY IT COOL, YOU KNOW?

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.700
WE'RE LIKE,
WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY--

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.533
THEN I SAW BILL MURRAY,
AND I WAS LIKE,

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.400
"YEAH, I GOT TO TAKE A PICTURE
WITH BILL MURRAY."

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.633
SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE HOLDING
OUR MEDALS AND, YOU KNOW,

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:27.466
TRYING TO, LIKE, FEEL--
MAKE OURSELVES FEEL IMPORTANT,

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.900
AND HE'S LIKE, "OH, I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD BE HOLDING SOMETHING,"

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.600
SO HE GRABS MERYL'S CLUTCH,
AND WAS LIKE--

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.066
[laughter]

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.133
AND IT'S JUST LIKE, OF COURSE,
BILL MURRAY, YOU KNOW?

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:36.133
- YEAH.
- HE'S A GENIUS.

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:37.466
AND IT WAS AWESOME TO MEET HIM.

00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:39.400
- THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I MET HIM TOO, THAT NIGHT.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.266
I HAD NEVER MET HIM BEFORE.
HE'S SUCH A COOL GUY.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.833
- SO FRIENDLY.
- SO DOWN TO EARTH, YEAH.

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.333
- WHO ELSE DID YOU
TALK TO THAT NIGHT?

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.566
- YOU KNOW, I WAS IN--I WAS
WASHING MY HANDS IN THE BATHROOM

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.566
AND I LOOKED UP AND SELENA GOMEZ
WAS STANDING ON MY RIGHT

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:51.366
AND ZOOEY DESCHANEL
WAS STANDING ON MY LEFT,

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:53.566
AND THEY'RE JUST HAVING
A CONVERSATION, AND I WAS LIKE,

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:54.566
"HM, YEAH, THAT'S COOL."

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:55.900
[laughter]

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.400
- OH, AND THEN THE--
WE WALK INTO WHERE--

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.100
WHERE THEY HAVE THE VANITY FAIR
PHOTO SHOOT GOING ON,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.066
- RIGHT.
- AND WE WANT TO GO IN--

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:07.366
- YEAH, AND SO THE PEOPLE
KIND OF ORGANIZING IT SAID,

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.066
"OH, HOLD ON,
HEIDI'S JUST FINISHING UP."

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:10.400
I WENT, "OKAY."

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.266
SO THEY SAID, "COME ON IN.
SHE'S FINISHING UP."

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:14.666
AND SO WE WALK IN AND HEIDI KLUM
IS FINISHING UP HER PHOTO SHOOT

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:16.300
AND THEY SAID,
"OKAY, YOU GUYS ARE NEXT,"

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.333
AND I'M LIKE, THE ONLY THING
MORE TERRIFYING

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.333
THAN THE OLYMPIC GAMES
IS HAVING A PHOTO SHOOT

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.033
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
HEIDI KLUM.

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:24.133
- YEAH, I COULDN'T EVEN LIKE--
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO--

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:26.233
I DIDN'T LOOK AT HER FACE.
I WAS, LIKE, INTIMIDATED.

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:28.233
AND I REGRET THAT NOW.
- YEAH.

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:30.200
- WELL, I'M SURE
YOU'LL SEE EVERYBODY AGAIN.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.933
LET'S TALK ABOUT
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:34.566
SO YOU'RE NOW COMPETITORS.
- YEAH.

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:37.300
- NOW WHO IS GONNA--ARE YOU--
ARE YOU SCARED OF HIM?

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.100
ARE YOU SCARED OF HER?
WHO'S GONNA BE THE TOUGHEST?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.433
- I THINK--I THINK WE'RE BOTH
SCARED OF EACH OTHER,

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:46.400
IF YOU WILL, BUT IN A VERY,
YOU KNOW, ENCOURAGING WAY.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.766
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE
TO PUT THAT.

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:49.366
I MEAN, WE KNOW EACH OTHER
SO WELL.

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:50.966
WE KNOW HOW HARD
THE OTHER PERSON WORKS.

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:53.300
WE KNOW THAT--YOU KNOW, I KNOW
THAT SHE'S A GREAT DANCER,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.233
AND SHE HAS A GREAT PARTNER
IN MAX, AND, YOU KNOW,

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:57.266
I'M VERY FORTUNATE
TO HAVE SHARNA.

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:59.266
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A LOT OF FUN WITH IT.

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:01.300
IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE
THAN THE OLYMPICS.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.800
- BECAUSE, I MEAN, ICE DANCING
IS DIFFERENT THAN DANCING.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.433
I MEAN, IT'S GRACEFUL
AND ATHLETIC AND ALL THAT,

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:07.833
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:09.866
ARE YOU BOTH DANCERS?
ARE YOU GOOD DANCERS?

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:11.266
- NO.
- NOT REALLY.

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:13.200
- YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T REALIZE
QUITE HOW DIFFERENT

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.300
UNTIL WE STARTED DOING THE LATIN
MOVEMENT ON THE FLOOR.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.833
- YEAH.

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:21.433
- AND WE COULD TELL BY THE LOOK
ON OUR PARTNERS' FACES HOW--

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:23.500
HOW DIFFERENT IT REALLY WAS.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.733
- YEAH, THERE'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF THIS...

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:27.966
- I FEEL LIKE THEY HAD REALLY
HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR US,

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:30.033
AND THEN WE TOOK A STEP
AND THEY WERE JUST LIKE...

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.233
- OH.
- OH, I SEE.

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:33.500
- NOPE!

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.566
- BUT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF
THE TECHNIQUE IS DIFFERENT

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.133
FOR SKATING TO BALLROOM...
- SURE.

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:38.866
AND WE'RE FINDING WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO KIND OF

00:04:38.866 --> 00:04:41.433
UNLEARN SOME STUFF BEFORE--BUT,
I MEAN, LIKE, WITH PERFORMANCE,

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:43.866
WE FEEL COMFORTABLE, YOU KNOW,
AND SO THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:44.966
- THAT PART, YOU HAVE DOWN.

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:47.266
NOW, WILL YOU GO
TO THE 2018 OLYMPICS?

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:49.400
- YOU KNOW,
WE HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.233
I THINK, YOU KNOW, CHARLIE AND I
HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT,

00:04:52.233 --> 00:04:55.833
FOR 17 YEARS, KIND OF REGARDLESS
OF THE SUCCESSES WE'VE HAD,

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:59.066
WE'VE REALLY KIND OF IMMEDIATELY
MOVED ON TO OUR NEXT GOAL

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:01.333
AND TRIED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW WE COULD GROW

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:04.166
AND HOW WE COULD MOVE
KIND OF UP THE LADDER,

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.433
AND SO FOR THE FIRST TIME,

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:07.166
I THINK WE'RE REALLY
ALLOWING OURSELVES

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:09.866
TO JUST BE IN THE MOMENT, AND
WE'LL--WE'LL DECIDE LATER ON.

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:11.866
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I HOPE YOU DO.

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:13.733
AND FOR
"DANCING WITH THE STARS,"

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:15.300
I THINK THE HARDEST THING
IS IT'S--

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.266
LIKE, IT'S NOTHING FOR YOU
TO BE ON SKATES.

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:19.800
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT
TO BE IN SHOES AND DO THAT,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.800
SO WE HAD SOMETHING MADE FOR YOU
SPECIALLY THAT'LL HELP YOU OUT.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.266
- OH!

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:29.133
THAT'S AMAZING.
- OH, OH, WOW!

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:30.866
- OH, MY GOSH, THANK YOU.

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:32.700
[cheers and applause]

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.033
- I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S ILLEGAL.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:35.466
- I THINK I COULD GIVE THESE
A WHIRL.

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:36.900
- IT MIGHT BE ILLEGAL.
I'M NOT SURE.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.333
- THAT'S AWESOME.

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:40.266
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S MY COLOR, SO, YOU KNOW.

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:41.500
- MATCHES YOUR EYES.
- YES.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.133
- YOU'RE WELCOME. ALL RIGHT.
- THANK YOU.

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:44.966
- GOOD LUCK, AND HAVE FUN.
- THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:47.266
- "DANCING WITH THE STARS"
PREMIERS TONIGHT AT 8:00 ON ABC.

00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:49.200
I WANT TO THANK HOWIE MANDEL,
BRANDON MCMILLAN,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.833
MERYL DAVIS, CHARLIE WHITE,
AND TWITCH.

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:52.333
HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY,
EVERYBODY.

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.033
BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER.
BYE-BYE.
