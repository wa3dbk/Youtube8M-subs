00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In a previous tutorial we described the
straightforward operation of the screen of playout

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.500
using the automatic playlist of
Hardata.TV

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Now we are going to stop this broadcast

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:28.500
and we will close this screen to see the
second mode of reproduction that Hardata TV has 

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:38.000
which is the instant play mode, to do that
we are going to use the setup wizard,

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:45.000
We going to maintain the language, and
the HD video playback,

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:52.000
the name of the station, and here instead of choosing
playout, we are going to choose the instant play mode,

00:00:53.007 --> 00:01:03.000
We confirm this to the wizard and it automatically uploads a screen with a keyboard.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.008
there are twenty Keys, we can assign them
clips and once we do that  we will be able to emit them instantaneously,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.000
also it has the classic buttons, such as
PLAY, STOP, PAUSE, jump to next clip

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.000
or play in loop. These are the
classical emission keys of any screen.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In order to upload the clips we`ll
open a library window,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.000
Which is where we have access to all our materials.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Let´s set up the windows in order to have the two views

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.500
and then we  simply drag and drop the clip to the key where we want to put it

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Let´s use some advertisings, for example these two

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I can chose the materials, the location where I want them, 
and where do I want them to be broadcast from.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.800
Besides these twenty keys, on the upper part 
we can see several tabs, where we have several pages.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.600
This is the page number 1, this one is the number two,  
I can also assign keys and different materials to each key. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.500
And i can keep choosing different pages so on

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.500
Very well, let´s close the  library window, and maximize this window again,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:52.000
In order to broadcast the clips, previously we must upload them. 
On the first one we can see a green background and now we are ready to broadcast

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:06.000
we just click, and we are ON AIR,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I can also select the next clip which will be broadcast immediately after the first one ends. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
This means that i can be broadcasting a clip and when it ends, the sistem ads the next one

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
There it is, it change it, so now I can add another one

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.500
Otherwise I can broadcast them independently

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
This application is ideal for example, to upload notes on a news program 
and broadcast them when needed
