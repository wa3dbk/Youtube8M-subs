00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.790
What is your opinion of Daikin vs LG air conditioners?

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
LG makes great high end electronics like smart
televisions.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.670
Their appliances like refrigerators and air
conditioners, not so much.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.720
LG is one of the more affordable brands.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.939
Yes, and you have to run them for hours to
cool off a room.

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.390
They have little insulation, so you’ll lose
a lot of cool air to the outside.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.320
And I thought it was just a joke when we said
close the door or window, we do not want to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.250
air condition the whole neighborhood.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.670
LG’s air conditioners come with remote controls,
but you can not turn down the volume on the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.699
noise it puts out.

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.579
Then there’s the fact that they leak so
much the unit can rust in just a year or two.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.339
I wonder what their efficiency is.

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.539
They are not very efficient.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.499
In fact, they sometimes have trouble cooling
off a room they are rated for.

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.769
That makes Daikin sound pretty cool.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.430
Daikin’s price tag leaves a lot of people
cold.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.580
Some of their small air conditioners are a
thousand to two thousand dollars, whereas

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.970
the little LG units are three hundred to four
hundred.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.350
They are rated to 18 SEER.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.360
You’re getting a window AC, not a whole
house HVAC unit.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.980
You won’t save enough on electricity to
offset the extra thousand dollars in cost,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.980
ever.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.380
They are also higher BTU ratings than LG units.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.250
You could buy two LG ACs and still come out
ahead compared to the cheaper Daikin.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.640
LG is not known for their great customer service.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.950
They regularly tell people to bring the unit
back to their authorized repair people, and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.840
that’s assuming they’ll do warranty repairs
at all.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.550
Good luck finding a Daikin repair person at
all.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.160
So you think I should get an LG.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.630
If you’re dead-set on a Korean AC, sure.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.360
But Frigidaire is not bad, either.
