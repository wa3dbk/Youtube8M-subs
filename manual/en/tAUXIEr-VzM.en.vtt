00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:16.835
Have you ever been floating
in a swimming pool,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.525
all comfy and warm, thinking,

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:20.371
"Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut!

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:23.900
You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.082
It'd be so neat!"

00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:26.689
Only that's not how it is at all.

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:29.252
If you are in outer space,
you are orbiting the Earth:

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:31.210
it's called free fall.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:33.240
You're actually falling towards the Earth.

00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:35.952
Think about this for a moment:
that's the feeling you get

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:40.265
if you're going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, "Whoa!"

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.442
Only you're doing this

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.466
the whole time you're orbiting the Earth,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.587
for two, three, four hours, days.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:46.826
Whatever it takes, right?

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.540
So, how does orbiting work?

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.481
Let's take a page from Isaac Newton.

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:52.616
He had this idea,
a little mental experiment:

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.882
You take a cannon,

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:55.265
you put it on top of a hill.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.647
If you shoot the cannonball,

00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:57.956
it goes a little bit away.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.275
But if you shoot it harder,

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.899
it goes far enough so that it lands

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:04.117
a little bit past the curvature of Earth.

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:06.889
Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard,

00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:08.891
it would go all the way around the Earth

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:12.146
and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.664
Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite

00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:16.268
over the North Pole of the Earth

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:17.892
and consider north to be up.

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:19.991
You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:23.923
But you are actually moving
sideways really fast.

00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:25.272
So when you fall down,

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:26.589
you're going to miss.

00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:29.853
You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down,

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:32.600
and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways.

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:34.781
So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down,

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:38.130
and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth.

00:01:38.154 --> 00:01:41.346
The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.292
So you're going to miss the Earth again.

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:46.054
Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward,

00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:47.843
and the Earth's pulling you sideways.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:49.446
So you're going to fall sideways,

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.978
but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss.

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:54.968
Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole,

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:56.713
going sideways and falling down,

00:01:56.737 --> 00:01:58.008
and yep -- you guessed it.

00:01:58.032 --> 00:02:01.035
You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast.

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:03.459
In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth.

00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:05.894
They're always falling towards the Earth,

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:09.475
but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time.

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.534
They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it.

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:16.729
So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped,

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:18.991
you could miss the Earth.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:20.375
But there's a big problem.

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:24.208
First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second.

00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:26.431
That's 18,000 miles an hour,

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:28.217
just over Mach 23!

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.031
The second problem:

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:31.316
If you're going that fast,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.733
yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from,

00:02:34.757 --> 00:02:36.536
but there's a lot of air in the way,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.901
much less people and things.

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:40.219
So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.845
So, I do not recommend this.
