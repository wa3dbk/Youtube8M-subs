Hi, this is Laura Turner. And today we're
going to talk to you about some basic tips

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:12.170
for directing in the theater. First of all,
you want to create a workable space for your

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.500
play to occur in. And then of course, you
want to know exactly what kind of space you're

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.480
in. Are you in a large space, a small space.
What are the requirements there. But when

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.589
you're creating your set, make sure that you
have more than one place for your actors to

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:36.620
go. So for example, if I have a bench which
is up stage. And back here, I have a tree,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.730
right with a little garden underneath it.
I want to have more than one place for my

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.980
actors to go. So that I don't just end up
having a bench on stage. And then having all

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.530
the action take place around that bench. So
create many playing spaces in your set. Next,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.480
have a plan when you first meet with your
actors. So you've got your idea by your set.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.500
You've got your idea by what you want to do
with the play. Make sure you really know what

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.420
you want to do. By the time you finally meet
with your actors. On the first day or through

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.460
the first week, you're going to want to actually
read through the script with your actors.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.229
And work out any problems the actors might
have with the script. Before you get a little

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:27.070
more deep into it. Next, you're going to want
to do the blocking. Blocking is where the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.119
actors go and why. You're going to want to
actually do this with them and nail it down.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.380
And have your stage manger, if you have one,
write it down. So that you can move on to

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.270
other things. So that they know, what they're
doing and when they do it. Next, you're going

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.590
to want to think about practical things like
your costumes, your budget. You might want

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.430
to change these as you go along, through the
play process. You know, what do you really

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.109
need. How much money do you really need to
do this. And then finally be prepared to get

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:08.020
rid of any uncommitted people in your production.
Be prepared to be that person who takes over

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.980
the production. And who really sort of, sticks
it to the people. Who are working on it. Because

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.290
in order for a production to succeed. Everyone
has to be on board and committed. And as a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.879
director you are pretty much the head of that
whole operation. So take those tips and good

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.769
luck directing your play.
