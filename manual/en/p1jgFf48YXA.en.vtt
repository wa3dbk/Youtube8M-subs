00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Stood by your prophecies and cursed at the sun

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Waiting for rain in the middle of summer

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Precious your words you say all has been done

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Our throats are still itching and everythings falling down

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Pray you to the aftermath

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Pray you to the flames

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Pray you to the aftermath

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Pray you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
One by one we fall

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
with each one taking down the other 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
One by one we fall

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
One by one we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Poor little boy looking out at the train tracks

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
waiting for someone to bring it all back to them

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Stolen and sold this life that he leads

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
when will it start to hold when will it start again

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Pray you to the aftermath

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Pray you to the flames

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Pray you to the aftermath

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Pray you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
One by one we fall 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
with each one taking down the other

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
One by one we fall

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:13.000
One by one we

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
One by one we fall

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
we fall

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
One by one we

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
One by one we fall

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we fall

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Tell me what I have to give

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Tell me what I have to
