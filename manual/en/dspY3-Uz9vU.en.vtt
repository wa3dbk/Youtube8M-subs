00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.000
We will cover some of the features of this
rack, starting at the base.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.620
We will talk about the hitch pin or lack there
of, instead of a hitch pin this assembly has

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.710
a bolt that locks it into place.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.781
You screw it in, tighten it down, and essentially
it makes the bike rack one piece for your

00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:28.740
hitch so it does not rattle around, move or
make noise.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.750
Another nice feature about this rack is that
the rack itself tilts in case you need to

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.420
get into the back of your truck, SUV or whatnot.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.559
You simply unclip the pin and let the rack
down so you can get in the back without having

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:49.379
to take the whole assembly off.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.719
Next we will talk about the cradles themselves.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:00.390
They are real nice in the fact that they can
be adjusted front to rear or left to right.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.050
Also the cradles themselves have grooves in
them to keep room for your cables on your

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.370
bike so they do not mash up against the frame.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.130
As an additional note, we will take an outside
measurement of the cradles to see if it is

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.630
compatible with your bicycle frame.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.530
It looks like overall it will be 12-1/4 inches.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.910
Now we will show you how a couple of different
bike frames will fit on the rack.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:40.060
We will start off with the standard frame
bicycle.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.610
As you can see if you look down the line of
the cables, they go right into the grooves

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.110
already made into the cradles so they will
not get pinched against the frame.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:02:03.320
Now we will go ahead and install an alternative
frame bicycle on the rack to show you how

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.800
it mounts up.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.209
As you can see an alternative frame bicycle
fits just nicely on this rack too.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.730
There you have it, part # TH957 from Thule,
their Parkway model.
