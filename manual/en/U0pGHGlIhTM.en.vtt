00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.360
This is Mia, she's the camera girl. This is Daniel, he's the chef. We travelled the world making videos about sustainable food.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.659
When we get home, we cook some of our favorite dishes, inspired by these adventures. 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.009
This is the Perennial Plate

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.189
in the kitchen.

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.109
Welcome to the Daniel Klein cooking show.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.779
[shooting sounds]

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.000
That's a good start.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.439
We just got back from Japan

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.519
everything

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.780
that people make in Japan is like

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.470
totally dedicated to one craft

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.130
Unbelievable! One of the stuff that we made
was that guy who's been been taking

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.160
udon for the last forty five years.
i've made this now

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.080
a dozen times

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.280
Have I made it a dozen times? 
You made it twelve times.
Ok.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.420
You made it twice. 
Wasn't I feeding you udon noodles like every night?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.090
I just don't think you should say 'dozen times'.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.960
That is grossly over exaggerated. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410
I made it a number of times and I'm still not very
good at it.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.760
and I actually have developed my own
udon noodle recipe, because I can't

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.450
quite hack the other udon noodle recipe. The recipe is as simple as it goes.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.299
Two cups of flour

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.890
like a teaspoon of salt

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.290
warm water

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.140
we're going for two-thirds of a cup

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.870
put it around the edges

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.290
try to make it sort of like 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.970
sand.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.900
I can't believe you said that I've only done this two times.
Sorry.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.900
I can't believe you said 'a dozen times'.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.760
I'm actually going to add a little bit more flour. So now at this point,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.330
make it into a ball

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.290
get some plastic

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.619
And then actually stomp...
Hold on!

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.889
I know but it's hard to get the lights down in there. 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:15.889
And stomp on it.
Take that off.

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:23.539
Form it into a ball again, the texture is supposed to be like your ear lobe. 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.649
It could be a little...

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.209
Ok, you need to change your socks,

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.819
it's disgusting

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.719
After all that working that has been done to
it, you have to let it sit

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.179
for half an hour.

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:44.179
Oh my god, uuuh!

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.480
We're going to get our water boiling.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.519
We're going to make

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.839
udon noodles.

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:54.219
Ok, the dish that we're making

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:59.749
I like to call udon....
Japanese mac and cheese.

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:04.590
Miso and cheese. Udon miso and cheese. The idea is to have soft outside

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.989
chewy inside.

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.039
It really should spring back.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:16.039
And now you want to use quite a lot of flour. We're going to fold this over itself. 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:22.189
Most people will tell you that you have to make udon noodles with lots of water. I'm doing

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.459
the opposite.

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.459
It's sort of like making a risotto, we're going to make our sauce using the starch from the noodles.

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.309
We're going to cook these for seven or eight minutes.
It there is still a lot of water, we are 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:40.949
going to pour that off.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.169
Add butter, miso

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:49.169
and parmesan cheese and let it form into creamy deliciousness.

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:56.749
Uh - it looks so good!

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.669
Go ahead! 
You want to grate some parmesan cheese on that?

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.189
I don't think it needs it.

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.599
I might grate a little lemon zest on there though.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.439
This goes great with any salad, something acidic.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.709
I'm going to try this and then you can, ok?
