Hi, I'm Bill with Zoar Outdoor here on behalf
of expertvillage.com. Today we're at Chapel

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.730
Ledges in Ashfield, Massachusetts, Trustees
of the Reservation Property and in this series

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.860
I'm going to be talking about rock climbing
gear. I want to talk about coiling your rope.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.439
Not much good if you show up at the cliff
and your rope is all bunched in knots. So

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.869
there's the classic mountaineer coil that
you've probably seen, big circular coil over

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.640
somebody's shoulder. I like this coil, it's
a butterfly coil or a butterfly coil. It's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.410
neat compacted and it doesn't twist the rope.
Let me show you how to do it, surprisingly

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.820
if you just take your rope and pile it on
the ground, it's quite manageable. So I'm

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:49.019
going to start with the two ends right here
over my shoulders and coil from here without

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:58.579
ever making a circle by just up and back and
making loops and this won't twist the rope.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.430
It's doubled because in tight rope climbing
you're mostly going to keep the rope middle

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:16.210
at the top of the cliff and both ends on the
ground. Get to within 10-15 feet of the middle,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.110
that's good enough, I'm going to take this
off, hold the middle in my hand, grab out

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:34.930
here, wrap it up.
We're almost done, going to take a bite of

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:45.540
this doubled rope, pass it through, cinch
it up, pull the end through, there you go.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.820
One more thing you can do with this, you're
going to stuff it in your backpack, just take

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.160
a half hitch in here so it can't come undone,
good to go.
