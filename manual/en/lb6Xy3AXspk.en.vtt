00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.740
Welcome to Instant Cooking

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.960
Today we are making Gujrati Sev Tamatar

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.400
That's a very famous dish of Gujrat.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.420
So, let's start . Take a frying pan add 1 small tsp of Oil

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.380
Spread all over the pan

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.420
Add 1 tsp of cumin seed let them crackle

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.420
And add 3 finely chopped tomato and toss it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.780
cook it till tomato is soft

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.500
add little bit of salt

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.540
Once your tomato is soft add 1/4 tsp of turmeric powder

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.340
1/2 tsp of black pepper powder

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.500
And approximately 1/2 tsp of red chilli powder. Mix it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.220
And cook it for couple of seconds

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.440
And then 1 bowl of Bhujia Sev or Rajasthani Sev or Gujrati Sev whatever you have

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.220
And mix it well

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.000
And cook for another minute or so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.120
Now, put gas on low flame

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.740
And add 1 cup of milk, you can use low fast milk

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.320
or full cream milk, whatever you want

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.180
Full cream milk gives very creamy texture

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.420
Low fat milk will give little less creamy

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.520
And now cook for another minute

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.240
On high flame continuously stirring

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.920
Till the gravy is thick

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.960
If you want you can use kasoori methi for flavouring

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.700
So, after approximately 1 minute of cooking your gravy is thick and your Gujrati Sev tamatar is ready to serve
