00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Hello, and welcome to the product design show.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.400
I'm Vince Penman.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.919
And I'm Allison Toepperwein.

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.160
Today we're looking at motorcycle design.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.800
This story from dbbp.com is a dream product
for every motorcycle enthusiast.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.920
Mark van der Kwaak started
with this nice looking 1964 Triumph when

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.760
he decided to strip it and hard tail it,
which means getting rid of the rear suspension

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.320
to lower the bike and give it a more old-school look.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.560
Mark  used CAD modeling for various elements of the
project, including the front fork designs.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.000
The bike is still under construction.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.560
You can track the project at dbbp.com.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.600
Now if that all looks like too much work,
Ducati has introduced the Monster Art Project,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.640
which lets you customize your new Ducati 796
in just 10 minutes.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.960
The kit lets you choose from the selection
of official art to change the look of your tank, fairing,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.680
front fender and seat cover

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560
They really do look different.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.920
I wanna give my ride some street cred
with cosmetic bullet holes.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.120
Ducati's custom detailing is a much safer way
to install bullet holes than my other idea.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.319
Stupid ricochet.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.680
Norton Motorcycles has openly shared their recent
engine builds for the new version

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.920
of their legendary Commando motorcycle.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.200
This daring bit of engineering while others watch
took a lot of courage, but the pictures

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200
of the highly polished aluminum clutch parts
and sub-assemblies make

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
their engineering look inspired.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.000
There are 660 parts that go into the engine.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.840
Norton is able to design and keep track
of every version of every perfect part

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.560
by using Creo Parametric, a CAD software
and design environment that helps

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.480
them achieve precision, power and performance.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.680
And now for a truly unique ride, meet the Uno,
an all electric motorcycle that you control not

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.400
with pedals or throttles or even brakes,
but by leaning.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.800
A computer in the console powers the motors
to solve

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.680
a classic control problem, as

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.400
Brad Hargety CEO of BPG Motors recently explained
to me

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.400
One way to think about it is, technically it's called
the inverted pendulum.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.240
But a kinda common man's way to think about it
is if you take a broom and you balance it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.120
on the end of your finger, when that broom starts
to tilt over, you move

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.520
faster underneath it to keep it balanced.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.599
That's very much the principle of this bike.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.599
So, you don't have to do anything as a rider,
but there's pretty clever software

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.881
in there that says where is the center of mass,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.520
where is the person sitting on the wheels relative to the
balance point.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.840
So if the person is in front of that balance point,
it accelerates the wheels underneath it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.560
Of course, you wouldn't want to ride
without a helmet, and French designer Kevin Goupil

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.800
has designed a new bicycle helmet made of cork.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.000
Cork is a renewable resource commonly used,
of course, to seal wine bottles.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.120
Well, now it can protect something more valuable
than a 1787 Chateau Lafite, human brains.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.840
The helmet uses cork because of the superior shock
absorption.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.879
It is fashioned after World War II era French Army
helmets which made up in style what they lost

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.840
in the ability to repel occupying invaders.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.840
Designing motorcycle demands that engineers
collaborate for surfacing, electronics, parts

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.280
and big assemblies.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.719
You can learn more about Creo Parametric,  the collaborative design environment that Norton used in their fearless redesign

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:41.439
at ptc.com/go/creoparametric.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:46.879
That's a wrap for this week. If you have
a suggestion for a product design you would

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.120
like to see on the show, please send it
to productdesignshow@engineering.com.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.680
Next week on the Product Design Show we'll bring
