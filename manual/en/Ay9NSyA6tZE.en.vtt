00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi, everybody,
my name is Dmitry

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:09.490
and I am going to show you the
PEARL RTGX-665 rhythm traveler drum set.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.600
This is a compact drum kit

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.390
that occupies very little space in
a room and has an excellent sound.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.960
The body of the drums is
made from 7 ply poplar,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.320
and this is what it consists of:

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.230
snare - 10" x 5"

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.060
first tom - 8" x 3,5"

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.320
second tom - 10" x 4"

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.280
bass tom - 12" x 5"

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.960
bass drum 16" x 14"

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.470
The set does not include
snare stands and the pedal.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.660
This set looks very nice and
you will enjoy playing it.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.430
Let's listen to each drum separately.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.980
And now let's play it.
