00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:26.066
-A love letter to myself...

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:30.528
-[ Sighs ]

00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:33.561
-[ Clears throat ]
Here we go.

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:43.198
-Dear C.B...
-Dear John...

00:00:43.198 --> 00:00:47.297
-Dear Mr. White...
-Dear Self...

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.759
Why did I agree to this?

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:50.594
-Do you love yourself?

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:52.693
Yes or no?

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:55.693
Yes.
We'll keeping working on it.

00:00:55.693 --> 00:00:59.000
-Dev, I love lots
of things about you.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.759
In fact, every day together
is one giant adventure

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:03.429
of how much love, meaning,

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.462
connecting, and gratitude
you can fit into it.

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.561
-I've known you
for 25 years now.

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.594
Through the long journey
we have had together,

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:14.264
there have been
many ups and downs.

00:01:14.264 --> 00:01:15.396
-But you also --

00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:18.264
always seem to stay calm
and collected.

00:01:18.264 --> 00:01:20.198
That's what I like about you.

00:01:20.198 --> 00:01:22.594
You're always so easygoing.

00:01:22.594 --> 00:01:25.495
-I really have never
been very good to you,

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:27.033
ever really.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:29.363
And I probably owe you
an apology.

00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:31.396
-I must say,
you've been through a lot.

00:01:31.396 --> 00:01:34.066
I'm very proud of you
for how far you've come.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.363
-Um, listen.

00:01:35.363 --> 00:01:37.165
You're pretty great.

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:39.231
I know you say that
to yourself a lot.

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:43.132
But you never really
genuinely believe it.

00:01:43.132 --> 00:01:45.198
Start believing it.

00:01:45.198 --> 00:01:47.297
-I like --
Nope, sorry --

00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:50.165
Love my ability to listen.

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.627
I think
it's a very special trait

00:01:51.627 --> 00:01:54.132
I have to be able
to really understand people

00:01:54.132 --> 00:01:56.231
and just listen
when that's what they need.

00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:58.264
-I don't know
I find it so difficult

00:01:58.264 --> 00:02:01.132
to find a soft, warm place
for you in my heart.

00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:03.264
I'm always getting in your way

00:02:03.264 --> 00:02:06.198
and never thinking
that you're good enough.

00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:08.594
-I know you're still going
through some obstacles in life.

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:11.066
I know you'll get through it.

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.396
You are so awesome.

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:14.000
-Give it time.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.561
And just love yourself.

00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:18.396
You can't just wait
for somebody else with...

00:02:18.396 --> 00:02:22.066
You have to start with you,
Nicole.

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:26.132
-I think we should make a date
to, at least once a week,

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:29.594
have a cup of tea together.

00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:33.396
I want to love you
and embrace you and treat you

00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:36.066
just as I would like
to be treated,

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:38.000
with loving acceptance.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.594
Let's start with tea.

00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.726
-Thanks for being
open with yourself.

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:47.627
And I love you.

00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:50.660
-Passion and grace, Devon.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.726
-Love, Nicole.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.297
