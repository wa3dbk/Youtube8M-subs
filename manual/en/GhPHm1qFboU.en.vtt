My name is Marcelo Coelho and I work in the
intersection of computers and materials.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.320
I like the physicality of the work that I
do.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.900
I’m always building physical things.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.390
Sometimes, I have an idea in my head and having
something physical that you can sort of project

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.579
your thought into and use that as a tool to
experiment and think about the design that

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.349
you’re trying to achieve is really so important
for me.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.870
This is one of the pixels of resolution.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.050
This is a network that I’ve created where
we created a series of individual boxes that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.410
you can interact with, and you can put them
on a wall and create different arrangements.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.719
A good way to think of it is that it’s kind
of a digital graffiti.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.239
In the same way that you can write and create
graffiti with a pen, you can do it in this

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.149
case with pixels.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.109
So there’s a lot that goes into designing
something like this.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.300
On one level, we have the aesthetic interaction
that you have with it.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.430
So we’re trying to get this curve to look
right and we want it to feel right when you

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.380
hold it and feel like you have to grasp with
it.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.979
But there is also a lot of technical stuff
that happens here.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.070
There is a circuit board that goes inside
and that has to fit perfectly.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.310
There are magnets that go underneath that
allow the box or the pixel to stick to the

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.480
metal plate that’s behind me, and there’s
a special diffuser that goes here.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.180
And all those things are very perfectly designed
so they’re super tight; there’s no space

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.180
for error and it would be really impossible
to prototype this in any other way.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.680
It’s great because once we’re done with
the design, we can literally just send it

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.340
to injection mode then.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.490
So we go from a CAD to 3D print injection
mode very fast.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.700
Since I got the Form 1+, it’s been sitting
around the office where anybody who sees it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.460
wants to try it out and use it.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.869
It’s kind of fun to actually see the expectations
and results and ideas that people come up

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:00.840
with when they see the machine.
