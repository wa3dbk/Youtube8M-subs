Hi I'm Angel with Fleecefun.com. Today I'm
going to show you how to make this snow princess

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.940
cape inspired by Princess Anna's cape from
Disney's Frozen. Guess who has two little

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.619
girls and guess what they've been telling
me what they want to be for Halloween every

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:20.619
day for the past 10 months? They can't let
it go, just can't hold it back anymore.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.070
 For this project you will need the following.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.390
For this project you will need: 1 1/2 yards
of fleece in pink or magenta, 1 7/8 yards

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.390
of purple pom poms, 1 7/8 yards of small purple
ric rac, 15 inches of purple decorative trim

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.790
for the collar, in pattern example I used
a flower change rim, 3 yards of large purple

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.230
ric rac, one silver heart clasp, thread, fusible
interfacing, and the free PDF pattern provided

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.079
on Fleecefun.com.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.239
Alright, now that you have all of those items
it's time to get started. Assemble and cut

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.820
out the pattern. You can find the pattern
instructions on Fleecefun.com's channel. Take

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.320
the following measurement. Measure from your
child's base of neck to their ankle or wherever

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.130
you want the cape to fall. Cut a length of
fleece the length you measured. You will need

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.840
to cut down the width of the fleece as well
to match the width of the cape bottom pattern

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.840
doubled because we're placing it on the fold.Unfold
the fabric, place the cape bottom and cut

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.250
off the bottom to make a curve along the bottom.
Place the back of the cape on the fold and

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.250
cut one. 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.250
Then cut two of the front of the
cape pieces.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.250
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.250
Cut out two collar pieces. Be

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.560
sure to place it on the fold when you cut
it. Cut out one neck stay. Again, be sure

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.729
to place it on the fold.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.020
Alright looks good. Next step.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.939
Take the back pattern and the two front pieces
using a 1/2 inch seam allowance sew each of

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:10.939
the front pieces to either side of the back
piece. First, sew the side seams. Then sew

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.090
the shoulders.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.080
Alright that looks good, now let's add some
detail to the cape section.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.080
Sew on the decorative pom poms onto the top
of the cape piece along the bottom. Then sew

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.780
small ric rac along the top to the cape piece.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.930
Alright that looks good. Now let's add some
detail to the lower cape section.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.400
Sew the jumbo ric rac along the bottom cape
piece. Oh and by the way, these details that

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.379
I'm adding are completely optional. It's up
to you if you want to add them and you can

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.459
probably even paint on details if you want
to but this is what I found to be the simplest

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.459
and cleanest solution.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.849
Take one of the collar cut outs and sew the
decorative ribbon or other elements to the

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.410
center of collar if you like, that is optional.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.459
Alright, now it's time to work on the collar.
Take the collar pieces. Take the cut out of

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.459
the interfacing and cut it down so it's 1/4
inch inside the fleece collar. Iron on. With

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.840
right sides together using a 1/2 inch seam
allowance, sew the two collar pieces together,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.760
leaving the inner curve open for turning.
Trim down the seam allowance and snip notches

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.760
onto the outer curve of the collar. Turn right
side out.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.310
Alright looks good. Next step. Sewing a basting
stitch along the top of the cape bottom, the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.599
long piece. Gather to the neckline of the
top cape piece. Place the right side of the

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:07.599
cape to the wrong side or underside of the
top cape piece. Tac or baste down the pieces

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.780
together.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.780
Alright now it's time to start to bring everything
together.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:25.279
Flip the cape over and add the collar to the
top right sides together.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:34.479
 Then place the neck stay on top of the collar sandwiching the
collar between the cape and the collar stay.

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.490
Sew on using a 1/2 seam allowance. Flip the
collar up and fold the collar stay around

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.919
the seam created so it's now touching the
long part of the cape. So it's touching now

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.849
the underside of the cape. Then top stitch
around the collar a 1/4 inch from the seam

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:57.400
around the outside to help it stand up and
have the collar stay cover the bulky seam.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.729
Sew on the clasp and you're finish.

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.430
