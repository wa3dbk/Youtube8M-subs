00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:06.389
This is part 2 of garden soil preparation.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:13.900
I kind of had home organic gardeners in mind
when I set this up, although I wasn’t trying

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.659
to be everything to everyone, but it turns
out that it’s good for professionals too.

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:22.330
Like, I did professional landscaping for 10
years before I knew most of this stuff and

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.920
I sure wish I had known it earlier because
I would have done a lot of things differently.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.109
So, it ends up being pretty good for professionals
but I kind of had home gardeners in mind and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.190
I certainly do start with the basics in the
Academy.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.130
I get a little advanced on some stuff though,
and I do get into some science.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.520
I want to do the science so I can show you
why we’re doing what we’re doing.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.590
Really, I try to be really practical.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.140
Now here is a little bit of my lime.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.289
I talked about how the lime has to come in.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.670
Now, I’m not going to use all of this, just
a touch, just to get a little bit of that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:12.390
calcium in there.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:24.980
And a little bit of rock dust here.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:38.100
That’s good for now.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:47.360
And now I’m going to at least single dig
this in, with a fork.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.600
It’s so useful to have a fork.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.770
I have different kinds.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.630
This one just happened to be close by.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.381
And I’m going to just single dig it in.

00:01:56.381 --> 00:02:03.470
I think I’ll double dig it in when I turn
the camera off.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.050
So I’ll do this all off camera but I really
want to incorporate that compost, that rock

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.480
dust, that lime right into the top at least
12 inches of the garden soil, probably deeper

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.140
if I double dig.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.060
And then I’m going to come back around and
put a good edge on this again.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.260
And I’ll show you that when it’s done
so we can go to the final step, so I’ll

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.370
be right back.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.360
So you can see I’ve incorporated my compost
and my fertilizers in here.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.250
And, when you’re done incorporating that
stuff the soil should go back to looking kind

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.390
of drab compared to when you put that nice
black compost on top - it looks so beautiful

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.480
and you’re like ‘oh I wish I could leave
it on top.’

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.801
But really if you do a good job incorporating
it, it goes back to looking like the old garden

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.710
soil because you want that compost to get
down in there.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.620
And you can see I’ve taken my spade here
and I’ve put an edge back on the bed, like

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.570
this, gone along taken the soil back up.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.740
The soil really gets fluffed up when you double
dig for your garden soil preparation, really

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.070
builds up and it will slowly settle.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.560
And now my next step here, my final step and
the second organic matter component I was

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.190
talking about is to mulch this.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.990
I love leaves for mulching, and I don’t
have any leaves because it’s not quite leaf

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.031
falling time so the next best thing is straw
and it’s not the most beautiful mulch, but

00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:29.230
I’ve been using it this year as kind of
a temporary mulch because it really is beneficial.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.970
Especially nice to have in the vegetable garden
here and it kind of works there.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.400
Of course, in the Smiling Gardener Academy
I discuss all the different kinds of mulches

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.810
and the benefits and disadvantages and all
that.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.180
And speaking of discuss, the one thing I love
about the Academy is that every lesson that

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.560
we have in there, if you want to ask a question
about it there’s a place right below where

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.980
you can ask a question.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.989
Or if someone else has asked a question you
can contribute.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.580
You can answer the question there.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.680
That’s why I’m pretty excited to hopefully
get some people in there who’ve done a little

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.520
bit of organic gardening there to help out
and of course I will answer lots of questions

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520
in there, too.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.510
And, if you’ve ever emailed me before you
may have noticed that I probably emailed you

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.259
back - I try to answer most emails - but I
can’t answer them in much detail because

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.300
I’m pretty busy and I get a lot of emails
and I can’t answer them in much detail so

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.189
you may have noticed it was kind of short.

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:30.620
In the Academy you get more access to me,
I really answer your questions and I’m even

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.879
hoping once this thing gets taking off that
I can get some of my really knowledgeable

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:41.699
organic gardening friends, associates, people
I’ve taught with and worked with to help

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.830
answer questions and really make it a vibrant
community in there.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.319
I’m even going to make it so you can upload
photos of your vegetable garden kind of before

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.770
and after and during.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.300
When we’re all uploading photos and content
and asking and answering questions I l think

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.840
it’s going to be a really amazing part of
the Academy because we’ll just have all

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.229
this knowledge coming in there I think it’s
going to be really cool.

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.759
So this mulching here, some people would do
it after they plant instead of during the

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:10.759
garden soil preparation.

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.009
I like to do it before I plant and you can
kind of figure out what works best for you

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.340
but it can be difficult to put mulch around
existing plants, it’s kind of finicky.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.909
With this, you just plop it on and it’s
pretty easy to plant in there.

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:38.929
So I’ll get all this looking nice now and
then I’ll go onto the next video.
