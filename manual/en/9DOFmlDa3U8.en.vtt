00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.240
Hi Yukky.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.240
Hi Yummy.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Yukky, can I ask you a question?

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.839
Yeah, of course you can.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.450
Tell me, Yukky.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.190
What is the fucking green and white shirt

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.190
you are wearing?

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.450
This green and white shirt

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.450
is a Wo***burg shirt.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.450
A what?

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.450
A Vau Eff Ell Wo***burg shirt.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.560
Weren't you a fucking Sechsen***sick supporter

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.679
when we last met?

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.099
So I was. But I have changed my mind.

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.640
Changed your mind?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.080
Real fans do not change their fucking mind

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.619
about who they support.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.679
No matter if they win or lose

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.740
I will always support Eintracht Braunschweig.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.530
My idea of being a fan is different, Yummy.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.290
I was a Sechsen***sick fan

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.930
but Wo***b*** have now bought Diego.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.090
I'm not happy with the club Sechsen***sick

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.280
any more because Sechsen***sick do not buy

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.320
expensive star players like Diego.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.790
I want to be a fan of a team

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.230
full of expensive star players.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.870
Yukky, this is stupid.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.490
Football is a team sport.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.080
Braunschweig does not have expensive

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.619
star players. But guess what:

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.710
We won three nil at Jahn Regensburg today.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.090
Yummy, guess what I just heard on the radio:

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.690
After half an hour, Wo***b*** are also

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.909
three nil up against Mainz null fünf.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.950
Thanks to our new superstar, Diego.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.659
Yukky, may I ask you a question?

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.929
Sure, Yummy.

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.270
Fucking Wo***b*** are playing now, right?

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.990
And you're a fucking Wob supporter now, right?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.909
Why don't you fucking watch the match

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.689
or listen to it on the radio?

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.359
In Braunschweig we go to the Eintracht Stadion

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.439
when we play at home. And we stay there

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.820
until ninety minutes are over.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.939
Now that I know that Wo***b***

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.139
are three nil up after thirty minutes

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:50.020
it's an easy mathematical operation to work
out

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.139
that we will win nine nil after ninety minutes.

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:57.549
So I don't need to watch the match any longer

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.659
and can watch Wo***b***'s nine goals

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:00.770
on Sportschau later.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.509
Yukky, do all Wo***b*** supporters

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.340
think the way you do?

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.450
They do, Yummy. That's why

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.540
they often leave the Volkswagen Arena

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.090
before the match is over.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.800
Remember, there are so many other nice things

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.230
you can do when you already know,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.980
long before the match is over,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.730
how the match will end.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.440
Like what?

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.350
Well, knowing that Wo***b*** will win

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.130
against Mainz null fünf

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.310
I can now go on a ride

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.710
on my Volkswagen Bobbycar until

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.140
they show Wo***b***'s nine goals on Sportschau.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.300
That's what also many other

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.180
Wo***b*** supporters would do.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.000
You fucking Wo***b*** fans stop watching

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.270
a match before it is over

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.540
because you want to go on a ride

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.470
on your fucking Volkswagen Bobbycars?

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.070
That's what most VW Ultras like to do.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.950
Oops. Of course I meant to say

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.541
That's what most Wob Ultras like to do

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.020
in their free time.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.650
It is a really nice Bobbycar

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.290
which looks like the Derby model

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.520
which Volkswagen sold about thirty years ago.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.790
Yukky, so you do have a Derby?

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.320
Well, I mean a Bobbycar

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.970
which looks like a Volkswagen Derby?

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.790
This is interesting because yesterday,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.330
when our reserve teams played,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.710
the Braunschweig supporters always sang:

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.251
WARUM HABT IHR HUREN KEIN DERBY?

00:03:16.251 --> 00:03:22.010
So there you have it: We do have a Derby.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.430
Wo***b*** Ultras ride Bobbycars

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.860
which look like the Volkswagen Derby.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.930
Yukky, forget about your stupid Bobbycar.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.650
I'll tell you what a real derby is:

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.650
Next year,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.380
when Eintracht Braunschweig have gone up

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.400
and fucking H***over Sechsen***sick are down

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.850
then there will be a real derby.
