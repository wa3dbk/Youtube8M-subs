00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.320
I have built this box, covered with soft textile

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.900
Dogs can use both front and rear paws on this and it's really fun

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.640
My dogs learnt this trick for a whole year

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.500
From time to time they weren't successful, so we did some other tricks

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.500
that they knew better and were more fun for them

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.600
And then we tried again

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.000
And wait!

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.034
And one front paw!

00:00:27.034 --> 00:00:28.000
One rear paw!

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.520
Change!

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.974
And one front paw!

00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:32.929
And change!

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.400
And one front paw!

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.500
And one rear paw!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.600
When you teach yor dog tricks, it's very important that you don't treat them unless they have fully completed the trick

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.995
Otherwise they will never learn to complete the trick correctly

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:55.600
When they have learnt the trick, you can teach them some other, more complicated trick, and it will be challenging for the dog

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.900
We have Ziara here. who has never done this trick before. Come here!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.620
Doesn't seem to come with this... Ahaa!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.320
Let's try to familiarize the dog with the obstacle

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.060
And the dog has two paws on the box, which is really good. You can treat the dog for this

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.700
Now let's try to lure the dog to the opposite side

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.140
Come, come!

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.420
And straight!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.240
Okay

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.200
And now we say: "One paw!"

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:28.400
See, Ziara put on paw on the box

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.500
Now let's lure the dog backwards

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.480
And rear paw on the box. Good, Ziara!

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.300
Put the paw on the box. Well done, good girl!

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.000
Now we have to get the dog to a better position, otherwise she can't put the rear paw on the box

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300
Now we have to lure the dog like this...

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.200
Good Ziara! Good!

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.020
And the rear paw is on the box!

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.040
Now let's bring the hand backwards, so she would put the front paw on the box right away

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.000
Good dog!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.200
Put the paw on the box again

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.800
Well done! Really good!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.800
Good! Really good! Good!

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.020
Let's try the rear paw again

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.200
Here, Ziara!

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.300
Let's try from this side

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.800
Front paw on the box! Front paw!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.200
Good dog!

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.300
No, front paw on the box! No

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.800
Good! Front paw!

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.400
Good!

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.900
No

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.800
Good!

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800
No

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.980
Good dog!

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.814
Okay

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.080
And the rear paw on the box

00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:33.275
Let's lure the dog over the box

00:02:33.374 --> 00:02:35.374
And yes! Good!

00:02:35.374 --> 00:02:36.637
And again

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.280
And from this side, approach from this side, this side. Ziara, this side!

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.640
And the rear paw is on the box. Yeah!

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.374
And the first paw!

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.360
Yeah!

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.860
Good dog!

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.295
The other paw on the floor!

00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:49.075
Again!

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.640
Yeah!
