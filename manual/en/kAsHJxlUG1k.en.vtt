00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:21.021
I'm not even going to tell you who I am 'cause you should already know.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.439
You're welcome B-T-Dubs.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.190
We love you, Greg Belmont!

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.692
*Shreaking and screaming*

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:27.861
I love you, too, Belmonties!

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:28.987
Oh my God. He just talked to us!

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:34.492
I've created quite a life for myself ever since I took out all the emo vampires.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.202
It's pretty much all that populated Earth.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:39.080
You know, I've been living the life. Relaxing.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:43.251
I wrote down all my badassery and kickassness in my new book

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:44.794
Fifty Shades of Greg.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.380
You're welcome.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.051
Greg, tell us the story of how you defeated Englebert the Vampire!

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.469
Please tell us, Greg!

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.345
There's plenty of time in the day for stories.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.307
Jobocop, set up a booby autograph session for one hour from now.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.516
No 48 minutes.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:03.271
Messages for you, sir. They've all been on hold.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:04.689
Thank you, Bronson.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.233
You're a go for Greg Belmont!

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.237
Greg! You have to be our guest of honor at SGC 2013. You gotta!

00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:15.325
Did you start working on the Top 10 Belmont badass moments of all eternity yet?

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.118
No. No I didn't think that...

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.704
I told you, Craig! No Top 10, no dice!

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:23.958
Okay! Get on that, we'll talk. We'll get some boneless wings and margaritas or something.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.128
Whatever you say, man. I will get it started now!

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.671
Hey, send me one of those hats.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:29.881
Go for Greg Belmont.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.508
Greg! It's Squarepainter, man!

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.635
I just gotta show you this new awesome piece of new artwork I did.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:36.096
It's of your ancestor Simon Belmont!

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:38.431
That looks good, bro! Send it to the Louvre!

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:42.435
Tell them to put it next to like Leonardo or Donatello or one of those other two turtles.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.438
I'm not exactly sure they would take it.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.233
They'll do it! I'm Greg Belmont! Saved the world!

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.776
Sure thing Mr. Belmont.

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.528
Go for Belmont!

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.863
What? I thought I was skyping with Roo!

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.032
Who are you? How did you get my number?

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.993
Hey, I don't get numbers. Numbers get me, bro!

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.122
You look a little familiar. Weren't you the guy from Shatterhand?

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.957
No wait! You're the Bionic Commando!

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.126
I'm not the Gigantic Commando!

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.962
Hey, shoot out that mechanical arm of yours! Whish!

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.839
Love that thing! Whish!

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:13.967
I don't need anymore of this.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.136
Hello, Greg.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:18.304
Oh hey, it's you.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.306
Again.

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.891
I see you're having a party.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.018
I wasn't invited.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:27.355
Well, you know. It's kinda of...you were. You were there.

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:30.441
I see how it is. You must've figured out Deborah's Cliff.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:34.112
Resurrected Dracula. Defeated Dracula and done all of that, huh?

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.071
Did you?

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.281
DID YOU!?

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.242
I mean, I'm getting to it. Eventually.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.286
That girl is so mean to him.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.997
Yeah, Greg's so gorgeous.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.333
Damnit, Belmont. There is a great evil coming upon this land.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.335
A greater evil than you would ever know!

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:54.257
And you're spending your time sitting on your ass, sipping mohitos with teenage groupies!?

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.550
We love you, Greg Belmont!

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:56.885
I wanna have your baby!

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.178
Groupies, please.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:02:59.179
Firstly...

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.722
Margaritas!

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.975
Okay and B: Why are you screaming at me?

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:05.810
I should be the one!

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:07.520
Flip it around.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:08.646
And switch it and then...

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.023
I'm you... I yell at you!

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.566
I'm sending an ally to you.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.277
Try not acting like a complete ass to him, too.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.070
Yeah. You know it. Yeah.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.947
Wait, wait, wait! There's more! There's more I have to tell you!

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:18.990
There's not more.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.701
Bronson, disable wifi please.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:23.995
Whatever you wish, sir. Yes.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:27.707
As usual, she was cryptic and a complete waste of my time!

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:30.043
Like, I vanquished the evil that lurks!

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.463
I don't need her. Ah, the world's gonna end!

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.007
Blah, blah, blah, blah. Boyfriend!

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.759
Blah, blah, blah.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.552
*Annoyed grunting*

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.597
So I'm hunting him. He ducks behind a tree thinking he got away.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.599
I jump out and decry stop foul being!

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.517
So scared he almost peed.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.901
So I was like -- Oh my God! What's your deal?

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:57.737
Bronson, why are you letting cosplay chicks in my luau?

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.198
I, Alucard, son of Dracula

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.867
have come to seek out the descendant of Simon Belmont.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:03.910
Dracula had a kid?

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.620
Indeed and it is I.

00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:10.458
So Dracula, the most evil vampire ever who my ancestors have defeated countless times

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:14.754
Got his undead on with some chick, your mom, producing you.

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:17.423
Yeah, you are correct, young Belmont.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:19.050
Let me recap. Let's wind it back!

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.261
You! Your dad is Dracula!

00:04:21.552 --> 00:04:25.807
Who's been killed hundreds of times. He's dead. Nothing in his self works

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:29.852
and he got enough baby juice in his balls to produce you.

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.605
This is getting fairly uncomfortable right now.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.358
You're out in daylight and you're not sparkling? What's up?

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:39.070
As a dhamphir, my human side makes me immune to the effects of sunlight. 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.738
That sounds really dirty.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.824
That means I'm half human, half vampire you sicko!

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:43.950
Whip! Where's my whip?

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:45.702
You can whip me any day, Greg!

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:46.995
Later. Creepy guy first.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.415
I am not here to fight you, young Belmont. I'm here to form an alliance with you.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:56.045
You see, many centuries ago, I assisted in the defeat of my father with your ancestor Trevor Belmont.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.799
Uncle Trevor! I heard he got all kinds of ass. Huh.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.050
*Swooning Sigh*

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.761
After feeling the guilt of defeating my father

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:07.307
As well as the pity I have on the human race in tribute to my mother Lisa.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.601
I went into a deep sleep only to be awoken when a new evil emerges.

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:14.856
I destroyed al the emo vampires. Did nobody read my book?

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.608
But out of the shadows, a new form of vampire will emerge.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:22.780
You see, Dracula's army will reign upon this world until they are vanquished by the morning sun. 

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.115
Including myself.

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.577
I'm sure you were briefed on that Skype call.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.454
Yeah, about that. Umm....

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.458
This new form is more hellbent in using trust funds to pay out their evil deeds.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.587
They reside in metropolitan cities and their leader is  a rather ironic one.

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:38.838
His name is Drawde.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.214
Drawde, what the hell?

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.300
It's Edward spelled backwards.

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:44.719
Like how I'm Dracula spelled backwards.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.262
Your parents were lazy, bro.

00:05:46.387 --> 00:05:47.638
Look, my real name's Adrian!

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.891
Beware, young Belmont.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:53.186
Beware the rise of the Hipster Vampire!
