I’m Joe Marshall with expertvillage.com
and today we’re going to learn about fans

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.370
and spreads. The whole point of using a fan
or spread is to actually do tricks with it

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.330
unless you’re in a contest. Most of the
time you’re going to be in a casual situation

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.279
performing a card trick and this is something
that you can do. You’re going to spread

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.169
the cards out for a ribbon spread and just
have them instead of pick one just tell them

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.539
to touch one and say for example they touched
this and you remove all the cards but that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.390
and you close it up and you show them what
card it is and tell them to look at, you place

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.149
the deck back, from here you can give them
the rest of the pack have them shuffle it,

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.920
put it back in the box, bury it in the back
yard it doesn’t matter because you’re

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.109
always going to tell them what their card
is and in this case it was the Ace of spades.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.340
To do that it’s a technique called calling,
as you’re ribbon spreading, ribbon spreading

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.910
the cards as we explained earlier you’re
calling the bottom card so you want to make

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.140
sure that you don’t start out by showing
them all the cards and then coming down because

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.320
the card that everyone sees is the bottom
card, you’ll just want to cut a card to

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.210
the bottom in this case the card will be the
Queen of spades and you start spreading from

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.480
here and showing them the backs of the cards
and what’s happening is you just tell them

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.820
to touch one instead of pick one and what
happens underneath the secret move is you

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.791
start to spread and at the same time you pull
the bottom card along as you’re spreading

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:31.570
out the pack. So when you come down they can’t
see that you’ve pulled that card from the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.540
bottom and say they touched one say for example
they decide to touch this one, you’re going

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.960
to square up the pack on that card and show
them the Queen of spades but what they think

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.960
is happening is that they touch a card, you
square up and show them what that card is.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.500
Since you called the bottom card during the
ribbon spread whatever card they picked, for

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.950
example that one this is what’s going to
happen underneath, as you square it this card

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.440
that they actually touched will become the
card that you called from the bottom of the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.640
pack and you just have to show it to them.
What’s nice about this you don’t have

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.910
to see it, once you cut a card to the bottom
or shuffle a card to the bottom and you take

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.200
a glance at it and you start to spread out
and you tell them just to touch one of the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.430
cards, whatever card they touch and you cut
the deck at that point to square up you can

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.780
even just turn away to make it more fair for
them or so they think and you just turn away

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.670
and then from there you don’t even have
to look at anything you just set the deck

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.140
down again they can take the cards and just
hold on to them and the sky’s the limit

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.951
from here you can reveal a card anyway you
want, you can draw it on a notepad, you can

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:54.310
just tell it to them mentally or you can kind
of have everybody draw and focus on something,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.140
like I said the sky’s the limit but that’s
calling on a spread so after you spread you

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.620
want to call the bottom card underneath so
that they can’t see what’s happening.
