00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.504
[BUOY BELL CLANGS]

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.856
- IN THIS WATERSHED AND
COTTENEVA CREEK IN PARTICULAR,

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.192
BOTH STEELHEAD AND CHINOOKS
ARE THREATENED,

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.695
SO INCREASING
THEIR HABITAT COMPLEXITY

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.364
AND INCREASING THE AMOUNT
OF HABITAT AVAILABLE TO THEM

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.868
IN THE SUMMER AND THE WINTER
IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.871
WE WERE TALKING ONE DAY,
AND WE SAID,

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.140
"WELL, WHY DON'T WE GET
THE VETERANS INVOLVED IN THIS?

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.642
"I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
THEY SERVED OUR COUNTRY.

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.644
"THIS IS THE LEAST
WE CAN DO FOR THEM

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:47.213
"TO KIND OF GET THEM
OUT HERE AND TRAIN THEM

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.716
"IN CERTAIN SKILLS AND GET THEM
OUT IN THE CREEKS

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.252
AND DOING RESTORATION
AND MONITORING."

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:02.962
- SO IT'S PERFECT FOR PEOPLE WHO
HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED THE CALL

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.965
TO OUR NATION AND ALREADY HAVE
BEEN PEOPLE OF SERVICE,

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.134
SO THEY WERE SERVING OUR
COUNTRY IN ONE CAPACITY,

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.904
AND NOW THEY'RE SERVING
OUR COUNTRY IN ANOTHER CAPACITY.

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.006
- I DID .50 CAL GUNNER,

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.008
A SCOUT TRUCK GUNNER IN IRAQ,

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.011
AND THERE'S JUST NO JOBS HERE
FOR A .50 CAL GUNNER.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.680
THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE
SO BENEFICIAL TO A LOT

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:24.084
OF MILITARY VETERANS WHO ARE
PROBABLY COMING BACK FROM WAR,

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:28.054
SUCH AS MYSELF, AND NOT A LOT
OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:31.725
- IT'S NOT EASY COMING BACK
FROM A DEPLOYMENT.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.328
EVERY DAY I WAS
PUTTING APPLICATIONS IN,
I COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.198
A LOT OF VETERANS WOULD BE VERY
HAPPY FOR THESE KIND OF CHANCES.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.670
- THE VETERANS WILL BE
GETTING SOME PRETTY
IMPORTANT SKILLS HERE

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:48.174
IF FOLKS WANT TO PURSUE JOBS
IN THE RESTORATION FIELD

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.211
OR IN THE FISHERIES/BIOLOGY
FIELD HERE IN THE FUTURE.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:56.683
- THE NATIONAL MARINE
FISHERIES SERVICE HAS
RELEASED RECOVERY PLANS

00:01:56.716 --> 00:02:01.121
THAT DEFINE
RESTORATION PROJECTS
THAT NEED TO HAPPEN

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:04.124
FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS,
AT LEAST.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:08.895
WE WILL NEED PEOPLE
WITH RESTORATION AND
MONITORING SKILL SETS.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.533
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.202
- HERE, I FEEL LIKE
I ACTUALLY GET MY HANDS ON

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:19.372
IN MY OWN COUNTRY, DOING STUFF
TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT,

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:23.543
AND SO I FIRST GET TO PLAY
A PART IN SERVING MY COUNTRY,

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.712
AND NOW I GET
TO SERVE MY STATE.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.081
- WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED
IN THE SERVICE IS THAT

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:30.583
THEIR SPECIFIC SKILLS
MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE,

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.386
BUT THE OVERALL SKILLS
OF HOW TO WORK,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.390
HOW TO WORK HARD,
HOW TO INTEGRATE WITH A TEAM--

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.893
THOSE ARE AS IMPORTANT
IN THIS INDUSTRY

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.895
AS THEY ARE, I THINK,
IN ANY INDUSTRY.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:45.398
- I THINK THE MENTORS HERE
HAVE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:48.735
TO TRY TO SET US UP
FOR SUCCESS, REALLY.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:51.237
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE
A PASSION TO MENTOR US,

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.740
AND WE'RE JUST REALLY LUCKY.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:56.443
WE ARE LUCKY TO BE
IN THIS POSITION.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.045
- AND THESE KIND
OF OPPORTUNITIES

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.481
CAN REALLY PROVIDE
A HOPEFUL CHANCE

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.550
THAT THESE VETERANS CAN BE
EMPLOYED SOMEWHERE,

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.552
THEY CAN BE STABLE.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.054
THE MORE FUNDING
THAT COULD COME UP FOR
THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS,

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:10.557
THE BETTER OFF A LOT
OF PEOPLE WOULD BE.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.692
- AND ONE OF THE VETERANS
ONCE TOLD ME,

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:14.861
"BEFORE, I WAS JUST KIND OF
DESTROYING THINGS,

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.197
AND NOW I'M HEALING
AND FIXING THINGS,"
AND THAT'S REALLY EMPOWERING.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.033
IT'S A GREAT THING TO COME
AFTER AN EXPERIENCE,

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.369
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THEM
MIGHT HAVE HAD OVERSEAS.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.938
- THESE FOLKS HAVE
GIVEN THEIR TIME

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.940
AND THEIR SWEAT AND TEARS
TO OUR COUNTRY.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:29.943
TO BE ABLE TO OFFER
MEANINGFUL WORK TO THEM

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.379
COMING BACK HOME,
IT FEELS GOOD.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.381
IT FEELS GOOD
IN YOUR HEART.
