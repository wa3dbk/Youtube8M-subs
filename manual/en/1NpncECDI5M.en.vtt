The British Museum
has turned to modern devices to try and

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.230
entice

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.340
its visitors the museum has teamed up
with a small technology startup

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.420
in Farringdon to create an app which will enhance the experience,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.740
well for some, Jill McKenzie reports.  Brought over from

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.930
ancient Greece thousands of years ago,
the Elgin Marbles are top of many tourists

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.510
list

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.029
but they're not for everyone.  The
Parthenon Gallery

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.380
is one of The British Museum's most
famous and popular galleries

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.730
but it's not exactly the most
child-friendly.  There are no bright colours

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.450
here or things to engage with

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.530
so the hope is that this app can change that by giving children a fun

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.200
and slightly competitive way to learn
about the sculptures.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.539
So in this game, we simply have to match
the silhouette

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.140
to the correct sculpture.  This is one of
a number of games and challenges which

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.360
guide children around the exhibition

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.719
We simply walk up. We point the
device too,

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.609
and that sculpture comes to life and if we tap,

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.670
just like that then we get some
information.  At the minute we have the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.299
details on the sculptures but it's very

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.580
adult oriented.  With this game we've

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.900
created a child friendly version of that
text and

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.810
obviously with the game now I think
children are more inclined to play

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.330
and to observe what they're looking at to
learn about it than if it's just the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.070
sculptures

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.820
and the normal museum environment
that they've had in the past. We use the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.159
technology that they're really comfortable with,
there's interactions that they're really familiar

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.240
with, which are exciting and engaging and that pulls them in, in a kind of way that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.320
captivates; whilst delivering something 
that they're learning about, at the same

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.869
time.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.170
But could this soon be more than just a
way to keep the kids entertained?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.320
The company behind this want to use their
technology to change the way we

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.909
all interact with our city.  A lot of mobile or tablet games are head down

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.570
into your device and shut off from the
world.  It's quite a new

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.120
experience to have a game that encourages you to put your head up

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.230
to engage sculptures.  It's already eyeing
up other places in London where this

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.060
could work.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.340
Perhaps the days of the audioguide are
numbered.
