Hi this is Vincent Woon from Stressed Out
Stress Free dot com. Welcome! In this video

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.279
I’m going to show you how to prevent upper
back muscle pull.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:20.590
Do you sometimes wake up and you feel like
one of your back muscle is going to pull?

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:29.240
Or sometimes when you are doing certain action
and you feel like your upper back muscle is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.240
going to pull.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.190
What causes muscle pull?
You are probably in a certain position for

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.489
a while or
you have been using the muscle for a long

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.850
time? And
probably use the muscle repetitively like

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.629
you use and use and use the muscle again.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.280
How do you prevent the muscle from pulling
and when you have that feeling how do you

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.559
stop it?
A very simple technique that I’m going to

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:05.649
show you.
As you sitting down, put you hand on the cheek

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:12.529
and I want you to put your elbow on your thigh,
like such.

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:23.329
Put your hand on the cheek like this and move
your shoulder forward ..like such..but you

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:31.740
have to put your hands on the cheek in order
to get a better stretch. Push forward and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:43.909
push backwards. So forward and backwards
Put your hands on the cheek and move your

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.389
shoulder forward and move your shoulder backwards.

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:58.119
What that does is it releases the muscles
around the upper back and loosen it up so

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.609
it will prevent the muscle from pulling. Let
me show you a shot from the back.

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:14.099
Remember to put your hands on your cheek and
you elbows on your thigh. Bend forward a little

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:29.159
and forward and move your shoulder forward
and backwards.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:36.209
Forward and backwards.

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.430
When you do the movement, the forward and
the backward... you are actually loosening

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.629
up the tension of the muscle which was going
to be pulling. So that way you will get a

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.599
relieve and it will definitely, definitely
help loosen up the tension and get rid of

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.829
the pulled muscle.

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.790
