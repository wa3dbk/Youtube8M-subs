00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.140
Power

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.580
Was all I desired

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.500
But all that grew inside me

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.300
Was the darkness I acquired

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.840
When I began to fall

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.820
And I lost the path ahead

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.520
That's when your friendship found me

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.560
And it lifted me instead

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.600
Like a phoenix burning bright

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.740
In the sky

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.900
I'll show there's another side to me

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.320
You can't deny

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.060
I may not know what the future holds

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.380
But hear me when I say

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.120
That my past does not define me

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.720
'Cause my past is not today

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.320
Ambition

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.000
Is what I believed

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.660
Would be the only way

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.200
To set me free

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.540
But when it disappeared

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.700
And I found myself alone

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.100
That's when you came and got me

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.460
And it felt like I was home

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.480
Like a phoenix burning bright

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.440
In the sky

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.640
I'll show there's another side to me

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.220
You can't deny

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.980
I may not know what the future holds

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.220
But hear me when I say

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.980
That my past does not define me

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.060
'Cause my past is not today
