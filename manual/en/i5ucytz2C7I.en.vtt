00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.050
For the past 40 years, astronomers have known that something about the

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.090
cosmos doesn't add up. First in galaxy clusters

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.130
and then within individual galaxies, they found that visible matter

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.180
--stars, gas and dust--cannot account for motions they observe.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.260
No one knows what this missing mass, now

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.280
called "dark matter," actually is, but studies by NASA's

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.290
WMPA spacecraft of the cosmic microwave background--the oldest

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.370
light in the universe--show how much is out there. Dark

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.380
matter outnumbers ordinary matter by 4 to 1.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.410
The WMAP results also hint that dark matter likely takes the form on an

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.420
as-yet-undiscovered subatomic particle. WIMPs

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.440
represent one hypothesized class of these particles. They

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.470
neither absorb nor emit light, and don't interact strongly with other particles.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.500
But when they encounter each other, they annihilate and make gamma rays.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.540
That's where NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.560
Telescope comes in. Two years of scanning the sky with Fermi's

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.600
Large Area Telescope have set the strongest limits yet for WIMP dark 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.630
matter. The best place to look for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.660
The most boring galaxies around, called dwarf spheroidals.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.690
These faint, tiny galaxies possess impressive 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.770
amounts of dark matter, but they contain no gamma-ray-emitting objects,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.820
and little gas or star formation. In the currently accepted

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.890
cosmology, the first structures formed as the gravitation of dark matter

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.970
corralled normal matter. Simulations show that the largest structures

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.090
formed in this way were comparable to the dwarf spheroidal galaxies we see 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.120
today. It's thought that large galaxies like our own were

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.150
built-up from collisions among these dwarfs.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.170
Using two years of data, Fermi scientists explored ten dwarf 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.250
galaxies for an sign of gamma rays from WIMP annihilation. In

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.330
this graph, the dashed line marks the sweet spot where conventional expectations

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.360
for WIMP dark matter align with what we know about our universe.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.390
Even when scientists combine all of the Fermi data from all ten of the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.440
dwarfs, they see no sign of gamma rays. This limit shrinks

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.460
the box where WIMP-based dark matter may be found, and for the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.500
first time, shows that the cosmology we know essentially eliminates some

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.600
WIMP types. The longer Fermi operates, the better

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.650
its ability either to box in the nature of dark matter, or to find actual

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.690
evidence of what it is. And the discovery new dwarf galaxies will

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.760
make this search even more sensitive. Although 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.840
nondescript, dwarf spheroidal galaxies may have been the first large

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.910
structures to form in the universe. Now, they've taken

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.930
center stage in the drama to solve one of astronomy's greatest mysteries.
