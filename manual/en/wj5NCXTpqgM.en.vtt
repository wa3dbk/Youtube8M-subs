00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.210
Hello and Welcome.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.560
One of the more important pieces of information
you aren’t shown in the default Windows

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.389
interface is what percentage of the CPU is
in use at any given time.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.939
If you are using windows Vista or 7 you could
use a CPU gadget for the windows sidebar,

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.710
but I don’t like the sidebar as it gets
in the way and is much larger than it needs

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.850
to be.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.651
To see what the processor is up to, you can
bring up the “Windows Task Manager” by

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:38.120
right-clicking on the taskbar and selecting
“Start Task Manager”.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.469
Once the Task Manager is open can click on
the “Performance” tab.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.829
Under the heading “CPU Usage History”
you will see each physical processing core

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.889
represented, along with a graph showing the
percentage of utilization for each.

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:59.429
To the left under “CPU Usage” it will
show a bar graph showing the total percentage

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.889
of utilization for all of the cores combined.

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:08.710
Now that the Task Manager is open if you look
down by the clock in the system tray you will

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.570
now see a small square representing the total
CPU usage.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.270
Let’s click on the minimize button.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.101
Now that the task manager is minimized we
still have the cpu usage icon in the system

00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:28.720
tray, but unfortunately we also have an icon
showing that the Task Manager is running on

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.250
the Taskbar.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.259
We need to set Task Manager to not show an
icon in the taskbar.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.979
Click the icon representing Task Manager to
maximize it.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.270
To keep the Task Manager icon from showing
up in the taskbar, click on the “Options”

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.159
menu and click to select “Hide When Minimized”.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.090
Now when we click to minimize Task Manager
the icon showing the CPU usage is still in

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.060
the system tray, but we don’t see the icon
showing that Task Manager is running on the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:19.390
taskbar.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.810
Now we have the CPU usage monitor in the system
tray, but who wants to go through this each

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.540
time they reboot their computer?

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:41.080
Click on the Windows “Start” button, “All
Programs”, Accessories, and then “Windows

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.710
Explorer”.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.600
The “Windows Explorer” window will open.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:03:06.950
Navigate to “Computer”, “Local Disk
(C:), “Windows”, “System32”.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.349
Click on the folder to select “System32”.

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:24.049
Scroll down and find “taskmgr.exe” in
the list.

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:33.750
Right-click on taskmgr.exe, and select “Create
shortcut”.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.810
It will create a shortcut named “taskmgr.exe
- Shortcut” directly underneath.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.090
Let’s rename it something a little better.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.600
Right-click on the shortcut and select “rename”.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:59.049
Enter “Windows Task Manager” for the name,
and press enter.

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:07.829
Now let’s close down the CPU Monitor.

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.181
If we double click on the file, we will see
that it opens Windows Task Manager, and if

00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:18.730
we minimize it, it will stay in the System
Tray.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.670
We want to set this so that when this shortcut
is run at startup it opens to the System Tray,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.380
and does not open up so we can see the application
window.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.580
Right-click on the shortcut and select “Properties”.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.490
Change to the “Shortcut” tab, if not already
there.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:44.220
Next to “Run”, change it from “Normal
window” to “Minimized”.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.290
Click the “OK” button to save changes
and close the window.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.320
Now if we close the “Task Manager” from
the system tray, and double click on this

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:03.440
icon again, it will open directly to the system
tray.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.520
Now we need to take this shortcut and place
it in the Windows Startup folder for “All

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520
Users”.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.010
By placing this shortcut in the Startup folder
every time the computer reboots the cpu monitor

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.740
will appear by the clock in the system tray.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.490
Right-click on the “Windows Task Manager”
shortcut, and select “Cut”.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.450
Now click the Windows “Start” button,
then “All Programs”.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.880
Scroll down to “Startup”.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.270
Notice the folder is empty.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.310
Right-click and select “Open All Users”.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.680
Right-click in the folder that opens and select
“Paste”.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.590
Now if we click back on the Windows “Start”
button again, “All Programs”, under “Startup”

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.120
we now have “Windows Task Manager”.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.800
It’s possible that you might not see the
Task Manager icon in the System Tray.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:08.210
If you don’t see it, then click on the “Show
hidden icons” button, and then the “Customize...”

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.270
link.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.750
The “Notification Area Icons” window will
open.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.720
Here is where you select what shows up in
the system tray and when.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.460
Find “Windows Task Manager” in the list,
and ensure that “Show icon and notifications”

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.710
is select in the drop down.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.080
Click the “OK” button to save the change.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.100
Now, just reboot your computer to test out
and verify that the Task Manager is opening

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.880
to the system tray.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.650
Now if you are wondering how hard your computer
is working, you can just glance down by the

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.310
clock and see your CPU usage.
