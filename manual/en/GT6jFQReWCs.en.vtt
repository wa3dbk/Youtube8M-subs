00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:05.363
THE FACTS PRESENTED ARE REAL.

00:00:05.363 --> 00:00:08.363
FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PERSONS INVOLVED,
THEIR IDENTITY WILL NOT BE REVEALED.

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:11.000
THE MESSAGE IS TRANSMITTED BY ROMANIAN ACTIVISTS.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a very risky action, 
because we will practically bear the lion in his den.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.000
We will satirize some controversial people.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.203
Mircea Sandu 
(president of the Romanian Football Federation):
… gold, the Romanian State agrees, but oh well...

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:26.116
If the local people say: 
I want to go work in the mine …

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:28.445
Now we all have to die of something.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:33.000
THE TEAM 11 FOR ROMANIA 
PRESENTS

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.000
THE INCREDIBLE STORY
ROMANIAN FOOTBAL FEDERATION, CYANIDE AND MONEY

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.000
SOMETIMES WE NEED A LIE

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.000
TO TELL THE TRUTH

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.436
One day, I get this phone call,
it was someone from the Romanian Football Federation,

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:51.464
regarding a sponsorship about Rosia Montana.

00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:53.500
That's cool, I thought, someone 
wants to give us some money.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.100
A few days later, I get again 
a phone call from same person.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.100
And then it hit me!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.100
The Federation actually didn't want to give us money,
they wanted to take money from us.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.658
And actually, they didn't even want to ask us for money.

00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:11.513
In their mind, they thought 
they talk to representatives

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:14.154
from Rosia Montana Gold Corporation.

00:01:14.254 --> 00:01:17.000
In that moment, 
we decided to take advantage

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.000
from their confusion, but not alone.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.000
So we asked for the help of two Yes Men,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.000
experienced in communication and marketing.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.795
What you are about to see, 
is a Yes Men type of action.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:32.819
A small and noisy group planned 
the exposure of the greenwashing process

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:36.708
of the image of Rosia Montana Gold Corporation. 

00:01:36.808 --> 00:01:42.016
Hello my friends. 
My name is Mihai Gotiu,

00:01:42.116 --> 00:01:43.536
I am an independent journalist.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:49.786
I am on my way to Bucharest.

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:52.897
I am going to Bucharest 
with the intention of buying

00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:55.747
the Romanian National football team

00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:59.595
Its image, more exactly.

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:05.155
We will be setting a partnership between FRF

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:10.864
and alleged representatives of the company

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.506
which intends to exploit 
the gold resources in Rosia Montana.

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:16.176
FRF was unlucky enough to send, by mistake,

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:19.176
the mail in which they suggested this partnership

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:21.515
to the organisation opposing the project.

00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:24.690
The most aberrant conditions were proposed

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.544
and Mircea Sandu agreed without hesitation,
on behalf of the Federation.

00:02:29.644 --> 00:02:36.777
Voice 1: At the end of such a tour in Rosia Montana, 
some of the players would have a drink

00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:40.521
from some glasses that we will say 
contain cyanide.

00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:44.647
Obviously, they will not contain... 
It is much below the admitted limit.

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:49.921
So we will show, by this gesture, 
that cyanide is not so bad.

00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:59.899
This is because our main image problem 
is linked with the impact of cyanide.

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.433
Mircea Sandu: 
Yes, the Minister (of Environment) said

00:03:02.504 --> 00:03:59.404
that he would drink from that water.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.434
Voice 1:
He indirectly recommended such an approach, 

00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:17.583
saying that he would drink from that water,
so we thought of such an event.

00:03:17.683 --> 00:03:19.739
Of course, we will discuss about this.

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.766
Mircea Sandu: We will see about this,
about drinking from the pond. 

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:30.674
Journalist: Well, it's a glass of water 
that we will say contains cyanide.

00:03:30.774 --> 00:03:36.878
Mircea Sandu: For some people, cyanide is good, 
especially for politicians.

00:03:36.978 --> 00:03:43.114
RMGC is the hen with golden eggs,

00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:46.877
for the rugby federation and 
for different media institutions.

00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:49.937
They would do anything for money.

00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:05.478
Mircea Sandu: We can organise interviews, 
declarations of the players.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:12.818
Some specialists will take care of this. You can trust us.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:15.709
Journalist: This means we can count on you. 
Mircea Sandu: Yes.

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:23.881
Mircea Sandu: They are paid by us 
and we need to produce.

00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:27.797
So in order to produce... We dispose of their group image.

00:04:27.897 --> 00:04:31.627
We are the national team...

00:04:31.727 --> 00:04:34.684
Voice 1: We want to build there 
a very big decantation pond.

00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:39.464
Every time we try to explain 
this to the people,

00:04:39.564 --> 00:04:42.481
we tell them that this is as big 
as a few football pitches.

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:47.040
This way, people can visualise 
exactly what we are talking about.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.486
So maybe some players 
could be seen around the pond,

00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:56.767
could run a bit around it.

00:04:56.867 --> 00:05:02.852
It would be like an image session.

00:05:06.384 --> 00:05:08.565
Journalist
There is one more thing we wish to clarify.

00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:16.723
In our partnerships with sport associations, 
we had some small surprises with some fans.

00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:20.537
Maybe some people will feel offended, 
but we call them jerks

00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:25.082
they wish to be seen... 
However, Mister Theodorescu ...

00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:29.721
Mircea Sandu:
Well, this depends on who they are

00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:31.902
some of them are paid, 
some are part of different groups...

00:05:32.002 --> 00:05:33.626
To hell with them!

00:05:33.726 --> 00:05:35.326
Voice 2:
The thing is we wish to be sure

00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:38.690
that at the matches of the national team 
people will not shout things

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.210
and will not post signs 
that could affect our image.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.154
Mircea Sandu: What do you mean? 
What kind of signs?

00:05:46.254 --> 00:05:48.102
Journalist: Banners... 
They come with banners.

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:50.771
They come with banners, 
with Save Rosia Montana...

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:55.019
So, if they could be controlled at the entrance...

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:58.920
Mircea Sandu: Yes, they can be controlled. 
We generally do not allow them with banners.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.500
Voice 2: I see.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.742
RMGC is the leader of manipulating 
the public opinion.

00:06:04.842 --> 00:06:08.409
However, it is not RMGC the one 
that imposes the humiliation

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.666
On the contrary, the institutions are the ones 
that offer their dignity unconditionally.

00:06:12.766 --> 00:06:17.064
This thing must stop! We cannot eat money

00:06:17.164 --> 00:06:20.725
And we would all look better
if we hold our heads up. 

00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:25.059
Our message, through this action, 
is for you!

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.417
Citizens of Romania, including the ones 
who are part of football teams

00:06:29.517 --> 00:06:30.994
in the country and abroad.

00:06:31.094 --> 00:06:36.159
FRF and RMGC tried to make a deal

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.989
and to stain with cyanide 
the image of the national team.

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:41.251
Of your national team.

00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:46.794
RMGC is probably capable of buying 
favourable opinions endlessly.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.514
However, we, the free citizens of this country,

00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:52.819
we are numerous and our voices, 
together, can break any embargo.

00:06:59.837 --> 00:07:02.136
Listen and tell others that 
Rosia Montana is not for sale.
