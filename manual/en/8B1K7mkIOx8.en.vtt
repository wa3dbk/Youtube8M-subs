00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:23.470
I had to doublecheck that I wasn’t on any
situation-altering substances when I experienced

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.470
this game.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.050
But there’s something about a malevolent
cloud, nyancatting out a rainbow, and fueling

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.680
this display of color by eating people, smashing
cars and blimps, and chilling with angels,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.469
that makes a man wonder.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:36.629
Was I dosed?

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.219
Who would do such a thing?

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.699
Should I have a glass of water, or a bag of
chips?

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:45.699
I’m confused.

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.839
Game over, man.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.749
Game over.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.730
And then I came to.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.670
And the cloud was still there, emitting rainbows,
and lo, he began to speak.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.079
And he spoke not of the Book of Revelation,
nor of the Song of Blondie, but in the style

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.660
of the King of All Cosmos, decrying mankind’s
inevitable march toward the color grey.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.600
Such transgression against the chromatic shall
not be tolerated.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.250
So to enact revenge upon the heathens, the
cloud shall consume them all, or as many as

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.890
possible while the glory of his prismatic
wake doth trail him so.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.450
And he does that with physics.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.340
Rainbow Rapture is a very simple, one-button
game: You hold A to dive.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.830
That’s the only mechanic that’s actually
under your control.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.800
Your goal is to fly as far as possible, using
only this diving power and the topography

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.450
of the land itself to propel you.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.430
Now I’ve heard of rolling hills before,
but this is a little bit ridiculous.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.789
Still, with a combination of aim and timing,
you can utilize the terrain to your advantage

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.390
and kiss the sky as you CONSUME THE UNPURE.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.479
And smash their cars for speed boosts.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.200
And crush oil tankers to slide along the ground,
grinding the bones of the damned.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.969
And pop blimps to inhale the spirits of the
heretics from any altitude.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.759
They shall become one with your glory, by
whatever means necessary.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.610
Until, that is, you run out of soul-color-prism-juice
and die.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.790
Here’s my problem... and it’s not with
the super-simple design of the game, or with

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.030
the alarmingly freaky aesthetic, or with the
deceptively benign music-box soundtrack.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.730
My problem is that this game reminds me a
lot of a little flash abomination called Nanaca

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.730
Crash.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.530
Nanaca Crash - which I should cover one of
these days - is a dangerous little diversion,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.290
where you inflict aggravated assault upon
a kid for distance, and is exactly the kind

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.750
of free flash thingamabob that you can find
yourself playing for hours, quite accidentally

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.240
with you have papers due.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.700
Rainbow Rapture shares some of this inexplicable
addictiveness, this oddball sense of “I

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.269
can go a couple miles further, just watch,”
as another five minutes of your life is wasted.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.450
Fortunately, for some sense of accomplishment,
there’s a series of challenges to complete,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.930
related to your performance in consumption.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.400
You can engage three at a time, with completed
tasks falling out of rotation.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.090
I don’t know how much I can recommend this
game, given that its primary attraction - and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.310
in fact, the entirety of its gameplay - consists
of a cloud eating people.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.500
I mean, what is this, LOST?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.500
Honestly.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.900
It might get by as a free flash game, but
there’s a whole dollar on the line here.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.989
A DOLLAR.... yeah, just kidding.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.290
Pick it up and confuse your friends!

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.290
Scare your children!

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.640
That’s always a good time.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.030
Whatever you do, just make sure you’re wearing
something colorful at the time.
