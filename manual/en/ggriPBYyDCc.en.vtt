00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.270
Today on our 2014 Ford Taurus, we&amp;#39;re going
to be test fitting the Maxxtow 20x47 Aluminum

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.299
Cargo Carrier that offers a 500 pound weight
capacity.

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.459
It&amp;#39;s part # is MT70108.

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.340
To begin our test fit, we&amp;#39;re going to
slide the shank of the carrier into the receiver

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.270
tube of our hitch.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.670
As we do this, we&amp;#39;ll want to through the
window here on the side for the pinhole.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.410
That will help us determine we have our pinholes
lined up.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:01:21.160
We&amp;#39;ll now take our pin, slide it through,
and then secure it with a clip.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:47.320
Our cargo carrier is 
going to 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:02:39.220
offer us right at 8 1/4 inches worth of ground
clearance.
