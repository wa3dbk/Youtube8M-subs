DEREK DIEDRICKSON: My name's
Derek Diedrickson.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.110
Right now, we're outside
of Boston.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.690
And I'm a carpenter, tinkerer,
microarchitecturer.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.317
Something between those lines.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.680
Basically, the start of all
this, I think-- when I was a

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.920
kid I used to build
a lot of forts.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.380
And somewhere around that same
point in time, when Nintendo

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.570
first came out-- dating
myself here--

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.580
my parents didn't want
me playing it

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.360
inside all the time.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.820
So I went out and built my own
first, real cabin, with heat,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.580
insulation, electricity,
all that.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.430
I was like 10 or so, out in my
backyard, just so I could play

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.250
video games all the time.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.080
From there, I just liked the
whole freedom of just building

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.870
these little, quick, turnaround
shelters, shanties,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.370
escape pods, I kind
of called them.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.840
They're micro-shelters.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.220
If you're working your grind, 9
to 5 job, or you're working

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.990
from home, I figure it'd be kind
of cool to have an escape

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.300
outdoors, where you could get
some of your office, quote

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.370
unquote, "work" done.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.720
These are the four that are kind
of-- it's my mobile home

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.760
park of tiny shacks,
redneck village.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.600
This one here is called the
Boxy Lady, more or less

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.580
because it's simply two plywood
and recycled cedar

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.410
cubes, Legoed, slapped
together.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.520
It's a mobile kiosk slash
single-sleeper.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.370
This folds up.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.580
This roof piece folds off.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.940
There's another table
that folds down.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.880
And you could just wheel it
around by a rope, almost like

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.390
a wheelbarrow.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.290
It's not that heavy.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.390
It's kind of cool when
the sun's out

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.170
just to sit in there.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.475
And it actually warms
up pretty quick if

00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:22.725
you're facing south.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880
This one here is called the
Gypsy Junker because of its

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.990
slight resemblance in shape
to a gypsy wagon.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.100
This one, except for the roofing
and the wheels, is

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.690
almost 100% roadside junk.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.920
The old side of my washing
machine, found window.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.180
This one's the heaviest
of all.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.280
It's on wheels, but it takes
two strong men to move.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.920
I got a little carried away when
I started building it.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.850
And a lot of these aren't
really planned.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.690
So I start building them.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.160
This one got too heavy.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.190
This one's called
the Hickshaw.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.690
This is one of the first ones
I built more recently.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.750
It's a rickshaw for hicks.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.950
That's where the
name came from.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.270
This one's built out of all mill
extras, recycled cedar.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.510
It's 7 feet long or so, like
2, 2 and 1/2 feet wide.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.740
A single sleeper, again, but
something if you went to

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.760
Burning Man Festival, those kind
of things, something you

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.150
could pull around.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.100
This one here is called
the Gotta Get Away.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.530
A lot of these are spur
of the moment names.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.420
It was originally called
the $100 Homeless Hut.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.680
This is another prototype
for a very

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.230
simple homeless shelter.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.700
You could build most of this
for about $100, even with

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.870
store-bought materials.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.830
The poly roofing and pre-cut
plywood sides.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.360
Everything's 4 by 4 by 4.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.710
Yeah, I like the whole idea
of recycling, scavenging.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.530
There's a certain satisfaction
when you find something that

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.070
someone's deemed trash, thrown
on the side of the road, and

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.878
you take it and apply it and
build it into something else.

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:45.550
