00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.810
Today's video is part of a collaboration
with the channel WiseHufflepuff

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.720
from Norway! Vegard and I came up with this tag video for Harry Potter fans and

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.410
all of the questions have to do with the
impact that Harry Potter has had on our

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.910
lives. We also made a video called Hufflepuff

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.869
Problems on his channel so remember to
stick around to the end of this video to

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:18.630
check that out!

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.279
Most of the other Harry Potter tag videos
I've seen have very short

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.310
answers, so I wanted this one to be a bit
more in depth.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.109
Because of that, I wrote these questions so that they would inspire storytelling.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.870
This tag video is partly inspired by the
wonderful Bre Bishop who, quite a few

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.110
years back, made a video asking YouTube
creators to talk about how Harry Potter

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.660
has impacted our lives. You can check out the video response to that

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.550
that I made right here and check the video
description for links to Bre's videos on

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.260
the topic.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.740
But the format for this tag video is a
little bit different because I've actually

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.829
written a bunch of questions for you guys
to answer. So now I'm going to have my friend Vegard

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.949
ask me these questions

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.340
interview style. Here we go! 1. Has Harry Potter changed you as a person in any way?

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.160
If so, how? I'm definitely a pretty
different person than I think I would

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.930
have been if I'd never read Harry Potter.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.010
Harry Potter, I think in many different
ways, has given me

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.369
more confidence and made it easier for me to start conversations with new people.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.549
I was not a confident person when I
started reading the Harry Potter books

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.810
but I think that my involvement with the
Harry Potter fandom has

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.460
really really helped my self-esteem, helped make me more outgoing and more friendly.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.259
I've always been a very creative person
but I think that Harry Potter gave me

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.479
the tools and the inspiration to create
a lot of things that I don't think I

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.140
ever would have tried if it hadn't been
for those books. 2. Have you ever made a

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.840
friend because of Harry Potter?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.390
The short answer to this question is yes.
The long answer is

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.229
that Harry Potter is the first thing
I've experienced that made me want to go

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.149
online and look for other

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.030
fans of those books because there weren't really that many people around me in

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.200
school that were enjoying them at the
time that I started reading them

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.439
so I wanted to find people to talk to
about those books and that kind of opened

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.119
an entire world for me.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.579
I started out making friends on Harry Potter forums and in role-playing and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.280
fanfiction communities and once I started a band inspired by the Harry

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.170
Potter books, I started going to a lot
of meet-ups and concerts and events in

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.560
person where I met all kinds of
wonderful people from all over the world.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.590
Harry Potter has allowed me to meet so many great people. Probably most notably, I met my

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.520
husband because of Harry Potter.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.020
But I also have some really close friends
that I've known for about a decade now

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.580
and they are such an important part in
my life,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.110
I can't picture my life without them, and I probably wouldn't have ever met any of them

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.930
if it hadn't been for these books.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.350
3. What is the most important thing you've learned from the Harry Potter books?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.040
The theme in the Harry Potter books that
always kind of comes back to me is

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.380
love and how important love is - and not
just romantic love, but the love that you have

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.209
for your family and for your friends and for the people who mean the most to you.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.019
It really just all comes back to love
in those books and when I'm having a

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.430
hard time or when I'm angry at someone,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.810
it really really helps me to remember
how important that is.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.910
4. Which character inspires you the most? Why?

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.110
Luna Lovegood definitely inspires me
the most. I love that

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.459
she's not your average human and I
definitely relate to her quite a bit because

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.619
I've never been the type of person to just
follow the crowd and do what everybody else does.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.959
But the thing that makes us different
is that when people bully Luna, when

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.220
people steal her stuff and call her Loony
Lovegood,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.340
she doesn't seem to mind. I don't know if
it just doesn't bother her at all

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.900
or if she just doesn't let it bother her, but I
find that incredibly inspiring and I

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.470
would love to be more like that. I do
still

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.579
tend to worry a little bit about what
people think of me.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.010
But at the same time, I don't want to change for anyone. I like who I am!

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.079
so it helps me remember that I'm not
everyone's cup of tea and there's

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.560
nothing wrong with that.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.780
5. Have you ever created something inspired by the books?

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.220
This is one of my favorite things about the Harry Potter fandom.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.260
It is so creative and so inspiring and
there are so many people making such

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.350
beautiful things because of these books.
I've written so much music inspired by the

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.500
Harry Potter books, I've made

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.290
crafts inspired by the Harry Potter
books, including these little radish earrings

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.750
which actually made in a tutorial on this
channel,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.630
and including a lot of the products that I've made for my etsy shop. I have made lots of

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.870
videos inspired by Harry Potter.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.740
I also love checking out things that other people have created inspired by the books like

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.459
fan art and fanfiction. There are just so
many wonderful things on the internet

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.840
and beyond that are inspired by the
Harry Potter books and I love that.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.700
6. Name one cool thing you've done that
would never have happened without Harry Potter.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.680
Probably my favorite thing that I've gotten
to do because of Harry Potter is the

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.430
trip that I took to London, England in 2013. We went to LeakyCon

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.790
London with a bunch of our friends and we got to do a bunch of

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.410
Harry Potter sightseeing. We got to see
the Warner Bros Studio Tour and

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.990
we got to go to platform nine and
three quarters at King's Cross station.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.560
Ever since I was 11 years old and I started
reading the Harry Potter books, I wanted to

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.520
take a trip to London and I am just so
happy that I got to do it with a bunch

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.110
of other Harry Potter fans who

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.980
understand how much that meant to me.
I also made a lot of videos while I was

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.370
on that trip and I regularly go back and
watch them just to relive it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.790
because it was one of the greatest things
that I've

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.850
ever gotten to do. So that's it for the Harry Potter Impact Tag! I'm going to tag WiseHufflepuff, Kristina Horner,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.290
Rosianna Halse Rojas, ASammyGee, and Karen Kavett.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.460
But if I didn't tag you and you want to answer these questions in a video or in the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.560
comments below,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.330
Just go for it! You can find a list of the
questions in the video description below.
