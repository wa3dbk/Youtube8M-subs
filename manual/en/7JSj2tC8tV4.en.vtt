00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.270
We're going to talk about the very early origins
of time keeping because some of those are

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.500
collectible items as well and things that
you'll find. Obviously, in these cases you

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.959
don't have to wind anything or worry about
how you're going to take care of these time

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.410
keepers but they're interesting in themselves.
We probably figure that the first guy that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.350
figured out about time keeping it poked a
stick in the sand in Egypt somewhere and saw

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.811
that the shadow moved around during the day
and that probably gave him the idea for a

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:33.280
sundial. I have some examples of sundials
here. Some, not always, are as old as you

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.880
might expect. This is the oldest one I have,
this is from seventeen ninety, this was an

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.699
American made sundial. The issue with sundials,
of course, is the sun has to be shinning,

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.750
they don't work on cloudy days or at night,
but they're actually pretty accurate, although,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.929
they have to be set up for what latitude you're
at because the shadows are different, depending

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.520
on where you are. This is a little pocket
sundial, an English instrument, which also

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.840
has an equation of time chart in there and
everything too. They always have a compass

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.240
built into these pocket ones because you need
to orientate yourself correctly in order to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.500
use a sundial and really know what time it
is. This is actually a twentieth-century piece,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.170
made by the Waterbury Clock Company, they
call it their sun watch. They were, of course,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.020
a big clock manufacturer but they thought
this would reach the Boy Scout market and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.450
other people that wanted an inexpensive little
time keeper for their hikes on a sunny day.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.619
There's even a little booklet here that would
tell you all about it. There's other types

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.820
of early time keepers too, water clocks,which
would work by a dripping of water, filling

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.829
a bucket slowly, some of those reproductions
exist still. There were candle clocks, which

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.679
would burn down at a fixed rate and tell you
what time it was. Obviously, these all had

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.340
problems which meant that a mechanical time
keeper was probably the better way to go and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.899
actually the way that we have gone.
