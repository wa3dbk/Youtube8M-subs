00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Child of the first war, forgotten by the second ... they called it 'Metroland'

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.480
Well they did back then, but we're calling it ... Secrets, of the Metropolitan Line

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.680
Now Chesham used to have three platforms

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.840
one of them you can still see here has been turned into a garden

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.040
which won a competition back in 1993

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.780
Best of all though, I do like the old water tower

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.600
which is still there, from the days of steam

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.680
So we're on the single line between Chesham and Chalfont

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.980
takes about seven minutes to travel in total

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.560
it is the longest distance between two stations, anywhere on the London Underground network

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.020
and Chesham trains, used to arrive at Chalfont on Platform 3

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.520
and this is where the four-car shuttle that used to run, between here, when it was old A Stock

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.100
It's a shame, if it had still been running today, it would be the only place on the Underground

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.700
where four car trains ... run ... back and forth

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.460
So we're in the beautiful sunshine at Amersham station

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.440
the furthest west, that the London Underground goes

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.700
Or is it ... ?

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.180
Chesham station is actually slightly further west than Amersham

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.260
On a public train, however ...

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.940
If you're a driver, when you leave Amersham station

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.940
and you go into the sidings that are just beyond the station

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.400
at that point, you are further west than Chesham

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.440
Now back in the day - by which we mean the late nineteenth century

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.080
the Metropolitan Railway actually extended beyond Amersham, to Aylebury

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.560
Quainton Road, Brill, and even a place called Verney Junction. Where the hell is that?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.380
So at Watford, it's not so much a 'thing to see', but a 'last chance to see'

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.360
if you've never been to Watford station - go soon

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.260
In a couple of years when the extend the line from Croxley to Watford Junction

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.020
Watford Met, the terminus here will close completely

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.780
and will come off the London Underground map

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.360
I'm standing under the newest part, of the Metropolitan Line

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.540
which isn't here yet, because it's a bridge that hasn't been built

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.620
but it should be built by 2018

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.600
heading off east, after Croxley, cutting off Watford

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.860
and heading towards Watford Junction instead

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.340
And where the old abandoned British Rail Croxley Green line is

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.960
it will run down, and connect up with Watford Junction station

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.340
and the tube will have a whole bunch of new stations, added to the map

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.880
So we've just left Croxley heading south, and I need you to look out of this window

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.800
for a secret piece of track called the North Curve

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.100
which links Croxley to Rickmansworth station

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.100
Now, one train a day leaves Rickmansworth about 5am in the morning going to Croxley and Watford

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.780
There it is!

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.860
And one leaves at about midnight, coming out of Watford, going back to Rickmansworth

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.220
Now a fan of the tube I may be, but I wasn't prepared to get up at 4am

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.220
to go and get the 5am train from Chesham, that goes round the curve to Watford

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.640
So instead, we got a shot of where the track goes around the curve

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.140
And actually, under this bridge

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.720
which may be the only point of the London Underground

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.440
that goes, sort of, underground outside of London!

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.940
Oh, and here's an animation to show how it might look on the map

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.800
if it were actually on the tube map ... which, it isn't

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.560
Next we stopped at Moor Park station, to walk down this corridor - used by Art on the Underground

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.440
for some very nice posters, to track down and locate

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.860
the Sandy Lodge entrance and exit

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.000
So this is some of the famous countryside that Metroland is famous for

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.480
trees and pathways going off, in all directions

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.300
and you get to it, but coming to the "Secret" entrance/exit

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.200
at Moor Park station, which is not at the front

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.440
but around the back, up some steps

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.820
and I bet there are people that commute to London everyday from this station

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.300
that have never been in or out this way

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.220
We headed south, and got to a point where we wanted to reminisce about the good old days of steam

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.280
... at Rickmansworth

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.700
Chalfont not the only Metropolitan Line station with an abandoned platform

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.700
Rickmansworth - down this end - has also got an oooold platform

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.740
Was used up until 1961

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.560
this is point where steam trains used to start and electric trains used to stop

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.880
and you would come out of London, get off your electric train

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.500
and get onto a steam train, and carry on up

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.480
So we've changed at Harrow on the hill, we're heading west again

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.820
this time to Uxbridge to finish there

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.040
Now we haven't done the section beyond Wembley Park

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.020
because there are some disused stations, which we're going to cover another time instead

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.520
Keep an eye out, for the abandoned tube station video

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.420
which I think we'll do at somepoint, in the future

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.540
We made a quick stop at Ruislip Manor, to check out this really lovely clock

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.800
I love it!

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.460
And then onto the end of the line, at Uxbridge, which gave us a question

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.000
Is it a Piccadilly, or Metropolitan Line station?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.080
especially when I tell you that Charles Holden designed this, to mirror

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.880
Cockfosters, at the other end of the Piccadilly Line

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.880
We say it's Met line station because more Met trains call here

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.080
And here, are some of the cool things to look out for

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.140
Theses winged wheels,  above the entrance to the station

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.640
may help you fly into work

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.060
But before you do, take a moment to admire the many original features

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.400
including the stained-glass windows

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.240
and these one penny weighing machines, that are still on the platforms

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.040
So at the end of the line, we bring to an end

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.740
of this whole series of videos

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.960
We've done all eleven lines now, on the underground, if you have

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.060
or especially if you haven't watched any of the previous ones

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.140
now is the time to click on Youtube, on screen, and go back and watch some of them

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.120
and that is the end of the series - sad i know

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.700
unless of course we do maybe the Overground, or DLR next

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.920
We'll see!
