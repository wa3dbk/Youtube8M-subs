Hi! This is Grace Fitzpatrick here on behalf
of Expert Village and I'm here to talk to

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.440
you today about how to choose a sock for your
sock puppet. There's a lot of thought that

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.950
goes into choosing the right sock for your
right sock puppet. Chances are if you're going

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.589
to be making a sock puppet, you're probably
going to be choosing from socks that are already

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.659
in your collection. Basically, you have to
work with what you have. I'm going to show

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.399
you a couple of different kinds of socks and
talk about the disadvantages and advantages

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.021
of each one. Then I'm going to choose the
sock that I'm going to make into a sock puppet

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:36.630
today. Something that you want to think about
when you're choosing your sock for your sock

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.250
puppet is how your sock is going to be when
it's on your arm. If you are an adult and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.660
you're making the sock puppet for yourself,
your arm is going to be a little bit bigger

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.690
than a child's might. You want to think about
who you're making the sock puppet for. I'm

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.070
going to give you an example now. If I were
to choose an athletic sock from my collection,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.119
it's going to give me a certain athletic when
I put it on my hand. It doesn't go down very

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.420
far, so I'm going to say this isn't a very
good choice for a sock puppet. You want your

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.819
sock to go down to about here so that you
have sort of a body for your character that

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:24.939
you're going to be making. Let's discard any
athletic socks. You also want to think about

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.619
the color of your sock puppet. I'm going to
show you now 3 different colors. We have a

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:40.170
sort of a taupe, a dark brown, and a tan.
If you choose the dark socks, you want to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.999
remember that your features are going to then
need to stand out from the sock. I happen

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:52.840
to know that I'm going to be using some darker
and more colorful supplies, so I might want

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.170
to choose a sock with a lighter background,
but maybe not white just to give it a little

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.210
variation. Remember that you're going to be
choosing from probably socks with no mate

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.330
in your sock draw, so you may not have much
of a choice, but you do want to keep all these

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.000
things in mind.
