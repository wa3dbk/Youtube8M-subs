00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That’s the female. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And there he goes.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.120
The land of the birds-of-paradise is

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.410
isolated at many levels, and that’s

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.530
one of the important reasons why

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.510
thirty-nine species have 
evolved to be so different.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.000
Getting to the difficult 
to reach places,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.040
had to go to so many 
different mountain ranges…. 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.950
so many different islands.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.720
It’s all very logistically
challenging, and once you’re there

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.888
you have to know 
enough about the birds

00:01:16.888 --> 00:01:18.800
to be able to find them.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.380
And once you find them, you have to 
have an enormous amount of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.470
patience to be able to be in the 
right place at the right time.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.460
The work really 
isn’t that glamorous.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.320
It involves hours and hours of just sitting
and waiting and doing nothing other than

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.720
having your blood sucked 
by leeches and mosquitos. 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.200
Which way is the trail?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.480
I don’t know, where’s the trail?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.060
No matter where we go, we end up having to 
hire a whole team of people to porter our

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.179
gear to the site where we’re going 
to work more remotely in the forest.

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.029
Sometimes the whole village, 
the men, the women,

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:15.000
even some of the kids, 
are carrying boots and shovels.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.249
Okay, thank you very much.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.810
There’s absolutely no way we could even 
do the work that we do in New Guinea 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.359
without working with the local people.

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.829
These people are 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.009
experts in their homeland.  

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.559
They know where the resources are;
they know where different kinds of forests are.  

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:36.339
They often know where the 
birds that we’re after are.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.969
While I’m sitting in a blind

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:51.059
trying to photograph one species, I’m always 
aware that I’m just working on one particular bird.

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.039
Ed is usually spending his time either

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:59.049
at other sites observing and 
documenting or scouting, trying to find

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.009
new places for both of us to work.

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.980
It’s really a division of labor.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.280
He’s doing the thing that he’s a specialist at,
that’s climbing the trees and getting

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.309
the photographs in the canopy.

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:11.859
And I'm doing the thing 
I’m a specialist at, and that’s

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.019
finding other birds, finding other 
individuals of different species and deciding

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.609
where we’re going to work next.

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.089
Everyday we’re out there

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:22.829
doing the things that 
we’re both the best at.

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.259
That’s why our partnership works.

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.339
Well, it’s better than from my angle.

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:28.888
At least you’re looking down. 
Well, that’s one of another 

00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:31.400
advantage of having two different angles 
because I’m looking up like that. 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.419
I have this, like, bright sunny patch 
like that right in the background right now.

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.009
A fundamental motivation for our
work is scientifically driven. 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:41.559
It’s not simply to 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.888
have beautiful images or

00:03:43.888 --> 00:03:47.929
images that can be used to 
tell the stories we’re telling.

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.039
But for us it’s also an 
opportunity to understand

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:52.289
more about

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:54.040
these birds and what they do and

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.000
how they’ve evolved and 
how they’ve come to be.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.929
Everybody out there, whether 
they’re scientists or not,

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:09.229
they crave that same kind of feeling.

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:15.129
Knowing that things exist that they didn’t know 
about and getting to experience it for the first time.

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.439
That's one of the most incredible 
things about the birds-of-paradise.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:25.000
They are an example of that extraordinary
element of our planet’s natural heritage

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.040
that offers so many rewards for 
discovery and so many opportunities

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.849
to see things that 
haven’t been seen before.

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.229
The extreme isolation of 
this region has helped to shape

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.610
the diverse evolution of these birds.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.620
But that same isolation has made it 
really difficult for scientists to study them.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.333
Ed and I see our work as a way to 
make what was unknown, known.  

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:53.111
With the birds-of-paradise, there’s 
always something more to discover.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.220
Were you watching when they flew over there?
I was.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.220
So what was your interpretation?
They didn't get anywhere near the spike structures underneath them...
