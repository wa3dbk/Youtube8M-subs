00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.530
 

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.420
With over 300,000 plants species on Earth,
there's no doubt that they have highly developed

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.370
senses to stay alive and thrive. But while
some of their features may be compared to

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.219
taste, sight, touch and smell in humans, have
you ever wondered - can plants think?

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.870
On land, the cumulative mass of plants is
1000 times higher than that of animals. But

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.480
these plants are immobile and can't move around
in their environment; which is, seemingly,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.050
a pretty big evolutionary disadvantage. This
has forced plants to adapt in amazing ways

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.410
that often go unnoticed by the naked eye.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.960
Smell something funny? Plants do too - and
they react to these chemicals in the air.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.559
For example, when fruits start to ripen, they
release a chemical called ethylene. And when

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.149
neighbouring fruits sense this pheromone,
they ripen faster, so that all fruits mature

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.030
at the same time. Plants also give off scents
which attract insects to spread their pollen.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.109
In particular, the amazing carrion flowers
grow tiny hairs, feel warm and smell like

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.800
rotting flesh in an attempt to mimic a dead
corpse. This is to attract flies and beetles

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.109
as pollinators.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.620
On the other hand, when a plant is attacked
by an insect, animal or pathogen, it knows.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.609
When acacia trees are grazed by animals, they
quickly react by producing chemicals called

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.299
tannins, which make their leaves unappetizing
and tough to digest. Some even produce enough

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.070
toxin to kill the animal. Perhaps more impressive
are some corn and cotton plants, which when

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.100
eaten by caterpillars, release chemicals in
the air that attract parasitic wasps, who

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.070
fly in and ultimately kill the insects. On
some level, they communicate with the wasps.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.990
Crazy as it seems, even sound recordings of
caterpillars chewing leaves, trigger this

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.810
response. Without any form of touch, the plants
react, as if they can hear.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.090
On a large scale, plants also work together.
A web of underground fungi can connect tree

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.609
roots in forests, allowing them to exchange
nutrients and information. Using radioactive

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.490
isotopes, scientists discovered that trees
share water and nutrients with others in need.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.289
Large trees nourish smaller shaded ones until
they are tall enough to reach sunlight, and

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.850
trees that stay green all year round share
nutrients with trees that lose their leaves

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.020
in winter - helping them through the season.
Which is then repaid in the summer months,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.280
like a transactional exchange. Some scientist
refer to this as the 'wood-wide web'.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.939
Perhaps the most shocking fact, is that some
plants seem to have memory. Mimosa pudica

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.750
plants, are those leafy plants that close
up when touched. This reflex is meant to scare

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.220
away insects that land on them. In an experiment
on these reflexes, scientists notice that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.819
when dropped from 15cm they would close when
they hit the group. Not so surprising. But

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.590
after repeating the drop 4 or 5 times, some
of the plants stopped closing, as though they

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.790
had realized the stimulus wasn't harmful.
If they were shaken instead, they would close,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.209
but any time they were dropped from this same
height, they stayed open. This effect lasted

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.480
for weeks - the plants had memories.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.830
Of course, plants don't have brains or other
cells and organs that we deem necessary for

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.200
intelligence. Brains and neurons are irreplaceable,
but plants are immobile and often attacked,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.819
so they must be able to survive after part
of them is eaten, or destroyed. A brain just

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.330
wouldn't work. But if you measure intelligence
or thought as the ability to solve problems,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.730
interact with an environment, and even work
in groups, then plants are incredibly smart.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.480
It's something to think about next time you're
munching down on a piece of broccoli!

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.519
