00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.791
We're driving this CLS63 AMG
Shooting Brake to Affalterbach.

00:00:05.345 --> 00:00:08.834
We all know what happens there.
They build machines like this there.

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:16.655
This is no 6.3-liter V8 (it used to be a 6.2).
It's all about downsizing nowadays.

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:25.761
It does 22.6 mpg, so it seemed like a fun idea
to go to Affalterbach on a single tank of fuel.

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.857
We should be able to do that.

00:00:51.647 --> 00:00:53.909
We did what, 93 miles?

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:56.783
76 miles.

00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:08.316
We're on our way to Affalterbach
for the AMG GT unveil.

00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:12.944
Of course Mercedes gave
us appropriate transport.

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:30.750
This CLS63 AMG Shooting Brake
isn't the facelifted version.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.247
It has different headlights, etc.
The technology is pretty much the same.

00:01:35.247 --> 00:01:40.326
As with the E-Class, the CLS has 2 versions.

00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:45.317
The regular one (not bad)
and the S (really not bad).

00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:52.089
With the S you get 4matic AWD for free
and some extra hp.

00:01:54.858 --> 00:02:02.705
The 5.5-liter biturbo V8 has 577 hp,
which we can't complain about.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:08.047
590 ft lb torque is available
on the whole rpm range.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.119
You want more specs? 0-62 mph in 3.7
seconds if you can activate Race Start.

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:19.071
If you succeed. It's Mercedes,
so it's always difficult.

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:25.885
The top speed is limited to 155 mph.

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:29.096
It's a bit of a problem with this car.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:39.455
It gets there so easily. Finding a bit
of road, go pedal to the metal.

00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:44.680
Eventually it becomes a game to play
tag with the limiter, and brake.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.691
The CLS is the ultimate Autobahn runner.
Fast in a straight line goes so smooth.

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:19.083
You can still attack winding roads, but the
CLS AMG is in its element on the Autobahn.

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:24.772
For the record: we did Utrecht - Stuttgart
in a bit over 3.5 hours.

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:29.400
We did end up in a traffic jam, though.
- 2.5 miles slow traffic.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.819
3 - 2 - 1. Unlimited.

00:03:35.691 --> 00:03:38.095
From 75 mph uphill, though.

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:45.744
Going downhill and there's a
Dutch Passat in front of me.

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:50.427
If I wanted to scare Martijn,
I would have hit the limiter.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.356
A Dutch Passat doing 93 mph on the
Autobahn is a bit of a troublemaker.

00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:12.133
And the limiter.

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:26.168
One top tip: order the raised limiter
or have it removed by a tuner.

00:04:26.168 --> 00:04:33.786
155 mph in this car is almost cowardly.
It hits it so quickly.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.300
