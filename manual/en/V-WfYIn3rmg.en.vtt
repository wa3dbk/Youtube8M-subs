00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.170
Now we are going to cut window mats and 3/16
foam core for fabric lined mats.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.220
So, the first thing we are going to show you
is changing the blade to cut a 3/16 foam core.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.370
These 3/16 foam cores, when you cover them
with fabric mats are a real popular things

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.940
now, they add great depth and dimension to
your framing.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.040
So, first thing we are going to do: we are
going to unloosen the blade, take out our

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.660
traditional, regular mat blade and now we
are going to add in the traditional utility

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.880
blade, the angled traditional utility blade.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.120
We are going to add that it and what I've
done is I've raised up my bar, I've put my

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.699
slip mat in and I have my foam core in so
I can measure the exact depth of the blade.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.970
I push the blade down and I have to push the
blade in just until it goes into my slit mat.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.560
I have to slide it in enough to go into the
slip mat.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.330
Slide it in a little more forward.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.360
Tighten that.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.260
Confirm that it's going into the slip mat.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.580
Now that we've adjusted our thickness, perform
a normal mat cutting, a window mat opening

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.580
cutting.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.290
We are going to do this at 3.5...

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:40.770
3 inch, have it set up at 3.5 inch.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:02:02.260
Do your traditional four cuts.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.049
Because I don't like to adjust my blade, I
just do that manually, I don't do the fine

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.710
tuning adjustments because I only do these
cuts every now and then.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.830
If I was going to do a large production run,
I would adjust it more critically.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.450
So, my over my under isn't exactly precision,
so all I do is take one of our scrap blades

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.650
and come back and cut those out.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.691
If you are going to do a lot of those in production,
then what you are going to do is you are going

00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:32.340
to go adjust that critically, but I'm doing
mostly traditional window mats and I don't

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:46.750
want to mess up my adjustment for those cuts.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.430
Okay here is our 3/16 inch foam core ready
for fabric wrap.
