00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.190
Wait. If you're like 69% of Americans who
are overweight, it's a word you've probably

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.510
come to hate. You've tried eating grapefruit
and cabbage soup, and you're tired of walking

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.610
that endless loop. It's likely you've dropped
a few pounds here and there, but it all comes

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.449
back and makes you swear. It's just a matter
of exercising and diet, your friends will

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.590
tell you, but please don't buy it. You see,
our ancestors food wasn't a car trip away.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.710
They chased and they hunted. They stalked
their prey. If the food was too fast or migrated

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.879
North, our disease depleted it till next July
4th. They needed a way to keep what they had.

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.159
Starvation mode was born and it made them
glad. But today when you diet your body's

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.620
afraid a famines about toward the harvest
delayed. So instead of burning up all your

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.039
fat, you use muscle for fuel and keep all
of that.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.089
Is that it?
Are we done?

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.039
Could there be more?
Unfortunately, yes, there's more in store.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.619
Your body is regulated by many a hormone,
happy ones, sad ones. They make you laugh,

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.670
they make you moan, one in particular gets
your stomach a growling. He makes you feel

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.640
hungry. His name is ghrelin. When your stomach
is empty he makes a fuss, tells your brain

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.440
it needs fuel, eat now you must. In short,
a diet's a war versus nature, a battling body

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.619
that thinks it's in danger.
What can you do?

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.969
Is there any way out?
Why yes, there is, that's what Dr. Tom's all

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.749
about. The trick is in getting your body to
know that food's not scarce, the supply isn't

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:45.890
low. It's a matter of changing the shape of
your tummy, from that of a basketball, to

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.229
something more yummy. Shaped like a banana,
it fills up much faster, gives ghrelin a rest,

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.960
making you the master. You eat less food,
without panicking your body and watching pounds

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.859
melt off becomes more of a hobby. Good-bye
weight, diabetes, and more, sleep apnea, joint

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.580
pain, nope, you win the war.
If you're ready to get over that weight loss

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.540
wall, it's time to give Blossom Bariatrics
a call.
