Putting layers into hair extensions is easy if you follow these simple rules.

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:20.173
The first rule to remember is that extensions are not put 
 in the same way that natural hair grows. 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.170
They are going to be installed in rows, so if you cut 
 layers as rows, they are really going to stand out.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:33.431
So what we are going to do, is we are going to compensate 
 for that by finding where we want our layers to start

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:34.835
and where we want them to end.

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:38.834
Now you can see that this hair is all one 
 length, so we need to change that. 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.386
And since we know that we need to fudge in the layers,

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:44.913
we are simply going to start, and it doesn't matter where you start. 

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:50.644
We are going to pull up some of that hair and 
 then we are going to use a slide cutting motion

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.903
to take out some of that hair and create some false layers. 

00:00:56.294 --> 00:00:57.732
Now you are going to do this by feel.

00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:00.967
You can start to see where these layers are going to come out. 

00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:22.416
Layers are all going to be done by feel. 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.694
So make sure that you stop and check to the side often 
 to see where your layers are coming in at. 

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.833
Continue working until you have all of your layers in place.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.090
If you have done your layering properly, no matter 
 where you pick up your extensions, 

00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:48.610
you will have your shorter ends tapering into your longer ends. 

00:01:49.028 --> 00:01:52.200
This should be consistent all the way across the head.

00:01:53.052 --> 00:01:56.490
And if you follow these rules, you will have perfect layers every time.
