00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.530
For this project, I'm going to teach you how
to tie-dye sneakers.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.610
Sneakers can't really be tie-dyed in the perfect
sense of the word.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.290
It would be really hard to scrunch them and
to tie them, but they can be painted to pretend

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.000
that they were tie-dyed.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.140
So for my sneakers, I took out the laces.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.900
I soaked them in water.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.560
I also already soaked them in the dye activator
solution which is made with water and washing

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.160
soda for 5 minutes, and then I wrung them
out.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.800
So they're ready to be dyed.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.050
I selected 5 colors and I tested them out
in a paper towel.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.230
So you see, I'm going to go for the sort of
rainbow, gradient look.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.370
From yellow to pink to purple to aqua blue,
and ending in green.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.390
So we'll see how this will go.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.010
One suggestion that I'll make to you, and
this is how I'm going to do my work, is to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.580
work on both sneakers at the same time.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.110
And that's also to avoid having one sneaker
look different from the other.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.770
That way if you make a mistake, you can kind
of replicate the mistake in the other sneaker,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.220
so I think that's just a good tip.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.500
I'm going to start with a brush and I'm going
to start with the yellow.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.200
So the way I'm going to address this, the
way I planned it, is that the top of my sneaker

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.260
is going to be white and then I'm going to
have yellow in this part.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.120
And then towards the middle I'm going to start
working the purple color, pink, and towards

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.360
the heel, the aqua and the green.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:51.590
Okay, let's get started.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.850
You can use any kind of brush to do this technique.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.370
I'm starting with a smaller one because I
want to have more control over the quantity

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.670
of dye that I'm putting.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.520
I'm unsure how the dye is going to run in
this sneaker, so I want to make sure that

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.619
I'm not putting a lot of quantity at once.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.620
But so far so good, and it's looking great.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.790
And the feathered edges, kind of the tie-dye'ish
look, will happen just by the dye running

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.269
in the sneaker's material.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.680
So don't really worry about having rigid lines.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.290
Of course you can always work it out with
your paint brush, somehow, pulling the dye

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.499
towards the front.

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:36.829
But I'm kind of happy how the yellow is looking
in the front right now, so I'm going to move

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.569
to my pink color.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.120
For the pink color, because I don't know really
well how this transition is going to end,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.909
so instead of starting it right where the
yellow ends, I'm going to start a little bit

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:58.809
backwards to give space for the dye to run.

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:03.569
You could decide while dying these sneakers
that maybe you wouldn't want the top dyed,

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.120
and that would be a cool look too.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.709
If you wanted to go for that, it would be
a good idea to put masking tape on the areas

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.090
that you don't want the dye to go.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.890
In this case, I actually want to dye them
all including the parts where the laces go,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.169
so I'm not worried with that.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:45.430
Okay, going to work a little bit on the second
shoe.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.099
And again, in this technique, it's really
important to test how the colors mix with

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.010
each other, because that's what you're trying
to mix in the transition area.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.319
So always test the colors, especially if you're
unsure about them and have never worked with

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.599
them before.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:13.249
It's better to prevent than to have a garment
not as pretty because you didn't like the

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:30.320
colors in the end.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.620
I'm done with pretty much all of the colors.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.870
I did the yellow, the pink, the purple, the
blue.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.650
I went back a little bit to work the transition
area, and I just did that by going with almost

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.590
a dry brush and kind of like pushing the dye
into the areas I wanted.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.720
I'm ready for my final color which is green,
and that will go in the heel part.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.990
And I'm really happy with how this is looking
so far.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.760
As you can see it was pretty easy.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:19.450
So again, I'm working the transition area
by just pushing the dye.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:35.391
Okay, if you think that some areas are a little
bit lighter than you wanted them to be, you

00:05:35.391 --> 00:05:40.660
can always go back and apply a second layer
of dye.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.830
And again, I just wanted to remind you, if
you wanted to make a different pattern or

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.870
if you didn't want to dye all of the sneaker,
you can block certain areas using masking

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.390
tape.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.900
I wanted to dye them all and I did.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.270
And this is the final result.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.220
This is how to tie-dye sneakers.
