00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.370
bjbj PnpQ Getting good audio is crucial for
any video production. Your sound is just as

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.300
important, if not more important, than the
picture itself, and the only way to get good

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.440
sound is to get the microphone as close to
the talent as possible. However, there are

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.770
times when you don t want to see the microphone
and so, today, we re gonna talk about the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:27.039
dark art of concealing microphones. 
There are a couple of places that you could

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.680
hide a microphone on a person and most commonly
it s done in the clothing but there s a lot

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.690
of things to consider when you start to hide
a microphone in fabric. One thing to be concerned

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.690
about is high frequency fall-off. When you
place a microphone under a person s clothing

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.390
the high frequencies of your talent s voice
tend to get lost or muffled, so what you generally

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.720
want to do is take your microphone and place
it under the first layer of clothing that

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.410
the person s wearing. You always want to add
a little bit of strain relief to your cables.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.031
You never want to have a cable that s perfectly
taut. Essentially what you want to do is make

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:59.149
a little circle with the cable and then tape
it together before you attach it to your talent.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.719
This adds a little bit of flexibility and
slack so that when your talent walks around

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:14.060
the cable doesn t pull off. 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.560
One of the first things you re gonna run into
is clothing rustle or the sound that the cloth

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.399
makes as it rubs against the microphone. Now
generally wools and cotton are considered

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.799
least noisy of the fabrics whereas synthetic
fibers and silks are extremely noisy, so you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.679
want to minimize that. A clever way to minimize
clothing rustle is to use mole skin. Essentially

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.500
you want to cut a thin strip off a piece of
mole skin and wrap it around the microphone

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.329
element before you place it on your talent.
This adds a very fine barrier between the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.999
layers of cloth and minimizes the noise rustle.
You can find mole skin in the foot care department

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.619
of any supermarket or pharmacy and I don t
think they make it out of moles anymore. Attaching

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.450
the microphone to your talent s chest or directly
under the shirt is the most common microphone

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.789
placement but there s other places that are
just as unobtrusive. Another common place

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.560
to hide a microphone is directly under the
collar. This has the benefit of being very

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.310
easily concealed, although you do have to
worry about somebody with an unshaven chin

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.630
causing rustling on a microphone element.
A particularly good spot to conceal a microphone

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.920
on a woman is in her bra, actually just right
here in the center where the two cups meet.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.390
A couple of additional tips to keep in mind
when you re attaching a microphone to a person

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.610
is to, one, make sure you re never accidentally
covering the microphone element with any adhesive

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.360
that you re using and then, second, when you
re attaching a microphone or wiring to a person

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.590
s skin you always want to use medical tape.
Don t use gaffer s tape. Probably the best

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.140
place to hide a microphone on a person is
in plain sight, and there s a couple of ways

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.780
that you can do this. One of the easiest places
to conceal a microphone is on a hat. Simply

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.590
place the hat on your talent s head and run
the cable down the back of the talent s neck

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.640
to the transmitter, then take the pick-up
element of the microphone and place it somewhere

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.580
near the front of the brim of the hat. Another
common place to hide a microphone in plain

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.040
sight is in your talent s hair. You simply
run a microphone cable up the back of the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.850
neck, through the hair, and have the microphone
pick-up element rest just in the front hairline.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.080
The benefits of hiding these microphones in
plain sight are that they re much more natural-sounding

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.520
than a microphone that s hidden under a talent
s clothes. A good way of concealing a microphone

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.830
in plain sight on a man is to use the microphone
clip as a fake tie clip. Simply turn the microphone

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.090
tie clip backwards and clip it onto the front
part of the tie. You want to use a piece of

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.190
mole skin around that microphone element to
keep it from rubbing against the back. My

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.090
favorite place though to conceal a microphone
in plain sight is in a hollowed-out pen in

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.350
the talent s shirt. This is really easy to
do and a very effective microphone placement.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.990
To do this simply hollow-out a ball-point
pen, take your microphone and thread it through

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.250
the empty tube, then you want to cut the top
off of the pen cap and place the microphone

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.232
at the top of the cap, then put the whole
thing in your shirt front pocket and you ve

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.950
got perfect microphone placement that no one
will see. Using these microphone concealment

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.700
techniques allows you to get that microphone
as close as you want to your subject without

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.700
it being seen. [End of Audio] Best Mic Cheats
