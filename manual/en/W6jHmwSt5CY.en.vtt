Hi this is Gary with MacMost Now.

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.710
On today's episode let's talk about reviewing
apps.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.589
So you can review apps in the iOS store for
your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad and you can

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.170
also review apps in the Mac App Store.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.039
To review any app you need to go into the
App Store for that device.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.099
For instance here I am on the iPad and I'm
going to go into the App Store.

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.090
It is the same for the iPhone and even for
the Mac.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.740
You go into the App Store.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.919
Then you can go look at the apps you purchased
or you can simply search for the app you are

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:32.919
looking at.

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:37.230
A lot of times the apps have links directly
to their pages in the app itself.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.660
Anyway you do it you are going to end up going
to the page about the app.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.870
For instance this is for my game, Just Word
Search.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.460
You can see that you've got Details, Ratings
and Reviews, and Related.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.600
Go to the Ratings and Review section and this
is where you can read current reviews and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.660
also where, you will notice, there is a Write
a Review button.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.039
Now there are actually two different things
you can do here.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.290
See on the right where there is the five stars
and it says Tap to Rate.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.719
You can basically just rate the app.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.420
That just gives it a star ranking and not
a review.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.090
Or you can write a full review.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.259
If it is an app that you really care about
and you want to praise for something or you

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.990
have had a big problem with and you want to
complain you can write a review.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.590
Tap to Rate is kind of a quick substitute
for that.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.210
There will be many more ratings than there
are actual reviews.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.060
If you tap Write a Review you get this screen
here and you can still do the rating at the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.710
top and then you can give a title and a review.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.579
So the title might me, "Liked it" or "Had
a problem" and the review can go into detail

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:38.579
about the app.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.180
It is basically the same process in the Mac
App Store.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.140
You, of course, run the Mac App Store app.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.130
You can search for the app and come up with
the Search Results.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.259
Go into a page and if you scroll down you
will find reviews and a Write a Review link

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.509
and here you can do the same thing.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.310
You can rate it, give it a title and write
a review.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.240
If you just want to rate it you can do that
as well.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.939
You don't have to write a review.

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.229
You can hit rate this application right here.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.090
Now some things to think about when writing
a review for any app: First is review the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.650
app not the app store.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.070
For instance if you have had trouble downloading
the app or couldn't figure out how to use

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.250
the app store or install the app, or how to
get it to run on your iPad or iPhone, that's

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.230
not really reviewing the app.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.390
That would be the equivalent to say writing
a movie review based on how easy or hard it

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.350
was to buy tickets at the theater.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.890
So make sure you are reviewing the actual
app itself and not the app store experience.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.790
Another guideline is to review the app that
you downloaded, not the app that you expected.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.530
For instance, say you want an app that would
help you write a screenplay.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.820
You see a word processing app that you think
might be interesting and you download that.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.341
Then you find out there is no real screenplay
ability in it.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.590
It is just a regular word processor.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.050
Well, it wouldn't really be fair to review
that app saying this didn't help me write

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.720
a screenplay when the app wasn't claiming
to help you write a screenplay.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.880
That would be like reviewing a superhero movie
by saying it wasn't a very good romantic comedy.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.110
Now a big guideline is remember not to use
reviews to ask for support.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.040
You see this all over the app stores.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.210
Somebody has a problem with the app or doesn't
understand how to use something and they use

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.340
review to basically write a question or complain
about not knowing how to do something.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.540
You see the developer has no way of knowing
who writes a review.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.420
That information is hidden from the developer.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.460
So if somebody asks a question or wants a
new feature, or something in the app and they

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.700
do it as a review the developer has no way
to get in touch with them.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.810
They can't do anything except let that review
just sit there and let that person be frustrated

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.700
that they never heard back from the developer.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.200
Notice that there was a support link next
to the review link and also most apps will

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.000
have a way, inside the app, to get support.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.810
Or you can just go to the page for the app
and usually there is a support link there.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.960
That is the way to contact the developer and
ask them for help not writing a review which

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.730
will give you no way to get actual feedback
from the developer.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.140
Another thing to take into account is cost
when doing a review.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.920
For instance if you are a car reviewer you
wouldn't hold a $15000 economy car to the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.490
same standard as an $80000 luxury car.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.890
There are a lot of apps that are free or even
just 99 cents or two or three bucks.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.260
You don't want to hold those to the same standard
as say desktop apps that my cost $50 or $100.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.600
As an app developer I would like to say it
is really important to take your time to think

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.310
about what you are writing when you create
a review.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.730
Keep in mind that it might take the developer,
who may be one person or a small group, months

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.730
to create an app.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.850
It is a lot of effort and a lot of work.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.510
It only takes you a minute to review it and
a bad review can completely sink an app, killing

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.500
all those months of hard work.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.410
So if you really like an app be sure to praise
it.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.100
If you don't like an app be sure to say so
but also give reasons why so you can guide

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.470
people who are interested in buying that app
and tell them really why you didn't like it.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.090
Just don't say I hated it.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.480
But say I didn't like this app because a,
b, and c.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.880
I hope this encourages you to leave good,
thoughtful, and conscientious reviews of the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.060
apps that you have bought or downloaded for
free from the App Stores.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:30.530
Until next time this is Gary with
