00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:04.582
- [Voiceover] Yee haw.

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:13.772
- Hey there.

00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:16.821
And welcome to Don't Be Dumb.

00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:18.071
I'm Josh Clark.

00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:21.136
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:25.277
Have you ever noticed that

00:00:25.277 --> 00:00:28.208
whenever a President is sworn in,

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:30.708
he puts his hand on the Bible,

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:36.117
and swears that he'll be
a so, so good President?

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:42.245
Well it turns out, they don't
actually have to do that.

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:48.944
See, there's nothing
in the US Constitution,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.156
or the Bill of Rights,
that says the President has

00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:59.323
to take the Oath of Office
by swearing on a Bible.

00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:04.883
It turns out, it was George Washington who

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:09.649
was the first President to do it,

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.956
and he started a custom because

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:16.956
he was the first President
of the United States.

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.566
Some Presidents buck this trend,

00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:26.856
and don't use a Bible.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.800
In fact, we're not sure if almost

00:01:32.407 --> 00:01:35.737
all of the inaugurations
that took place in

00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:38.820
the 19th century used a Bible or not.

00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:44.838
And we know that John Quincy Adams used

00:01:46.394 --> 00:01:50.771
a law book to swear in
for his inauguration,

00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:53.521
because he said that he respected

00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.538
the separation of church and state.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.367
Teddy Roosevelt didn't use a Bible for

00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:07.306
his inauguration either.

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:11.558
He just took the Oath of Affirmation.

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:16.759
But for the most part,
Presidents do swear on

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.987
a Bible when they take the Oath of Office.

00:02:20.987 --> 00:02:22.603
And they do it as a matter of

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:25.936
either tradition or personal preference.

00:02:27.143 --> 00:02:30.645
Barack Obama was so crazy for Bibles,

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:32.909
that he swore on two of them at once for

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.992
one of his inaugurations.

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.496
So, if at some point in the future,

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:48.150
some President who,
say, really likes food,

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:51.836
takes the Oath of Office by swearing on,

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:56.315
like, a cookbook, and
everybody's going crazy about it,

00:02:56.315 --> 00:03:01.208
you set them straight, and
tell them Josh sent you.

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:03.291
Thank you for joining me.

00:03:13.107 --> 00:03:14.998
Do you have a suggestion for

00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:17.352
an episode of Don't Be Dumb?

00:03:17.352 --> 00:03:20.222
Leave it in the comments below.

00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:22.762

00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:27.578
I don't care.

00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:36.519
(sigh)
