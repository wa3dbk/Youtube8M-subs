Hi this is Willie D. of the Aggro Alliance
Trick Team on behalf of expert village. Now

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.369
let's check our tires. What you want to do
is, start off by placing your hands firmly

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:22.230
on the tire. Having a good grip of it, shaking
it from side to side like this in this motion,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.740
to make sure that your rim isn't moved, your
axle and your hub should be firm, should not

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.239
any movement. While your hands are on the
tire, you want to check your air pressure

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.560
as well. You can do this by squeezing the
tires from the sides, so I'm pinching the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:54.330
side like this, as well as getting this part
of your hand to push down on the tire. Now

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.839
your tire should have a little play in it
but you really should be pretty firm. The

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:06.980
ideal air pressure for BMX stunt bikes like
this, is anywhere from eighty to a hundred

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.700
PSI. Let's check the front rim, make sure
everything is fine here. Again, repeat the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.270
process, grip the tire like this, shacking
it side to side to make sure that the hub

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:32.350
and axle are tight and the rim is not moving.
once you know that you're rim is secure, pinch

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.840
the sides of the tire again like this to make
sure that the front tire, has adequate air

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.670
pressure and also get the bottom part of your
hand and push downward on the tire, just like

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:55.210
you did with the rear wheel, making sure that
the air pressure is adequate in the front.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.500
Again, eighty to a hundred PSI is the adequate
air pressure for a standard BMX bike.
