00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.480
Take a Stand

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.339
Lend a Hand

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.209
Stop Bullying Now

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.190
I so hope your mother doesn't totally forget
to pick us up again, Bibi.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.150
Yeah - we wouldn't want to have to board the
LOSER bus.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.270
Ew, new girl alert.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.379
How funny was it when Cassandra said that
thing about her "sorry" outfit?!

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.120
Like, to die for funny!

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.440
Actually, I thought Cassandra was being kinda
harsh.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.530
I mean, you know, like, harsh in a funny way?

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.120
Speaking of harsh, last night I had this total
nightmare that Cassandra was a judge and she

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.780
sentenced me to jail cuz of my bad outfit.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.899
GASP! That is SO weird! I once had a nightmare
that she arrested me for bad hair!

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.819
MELANIE
Well, don't look now, Mimi, but I think your

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.740
nightmare is about to come true.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.150
What are you talking about, Mel?

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.710
My shirt! If Cassandra sees this, I am SO
out of her inner circle.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.610
Lucky for you I'm a licensed Fashion Emergency
Technician!

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.290
Hey, Raven. Lasa.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.750
The two girls stop and exchange shocked looks.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.560
Whoa. Am I hearing things or did Melanie just
talk to us?

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.290
You're hearing things. Mel left us for "cooler"
friends, remember?

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.500
Come on, guys. You're still my friends, too.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.610
Melanie, who are you talking to?

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.910
Nobody.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.280
That's right - nobodies.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.450
Uh, Mel? Hello? Aren't you gonna walk me to
the car?

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.820
Oh, um, sure.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.800
Did we just go from 'friends' to 'nobodies'
in two-point-five seconds?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.050
Actually, I think it was more like two seconds
flat.
