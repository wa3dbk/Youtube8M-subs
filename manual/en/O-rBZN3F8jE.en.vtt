00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:09.520
Now we're going to play egg and spoon race.
Now the idea is to balance the egg on the

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:20.840
end of the spoon without dropping it. I've
got some little fun eggs here and if they

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.680
fall they crack open. You might have some
little plastic eggs like this left over from

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.630
Easter last year or you might have some just
stored away. You can use those, make your

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:34.850
own little yolk for the center. Or you can
simply use real eggs. It's your choice whether

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.400
you want to hard boil them if you've got a
lot of younger children playing the game.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.280
Or whether you want to make it really fun
and use raw eggs. Of course, the moment they

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.090
go crack, uh oh, the children are going to
want another egg so that they can continue

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.399
playing. Now the idea of this game is to put
one hand behind your back and balance your

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:10.080
egg right on the spoon as you set off down
your designated course. You'll find that the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:22.990
children will want to run as fast as they
can but find that they won't be able to.That's

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.400
the fun of the game. Now you can try that
for the first game but for the second time,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.240
to make it a little bit harder, simply turn
them right the way around. Ask them to put

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.340
their hand behind their back again and this
time go backwards. Here goes. Whoa, whoa.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.490
Its quite likely that all the eggs are going
to go all over the place when they take it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:55.820
backwards. But that's the fun of the game.
But, well, if it cracks, uh oh. That's part

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.180
of the fun too, isn't it? That, boys and girls,
is the egg and the spoon race.
