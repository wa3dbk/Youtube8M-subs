00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.050
Fill in the blanks to
complete the equation.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.550
So they have 76,830 is
equal to 6 ten thousands

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.640
plus blank thousands plus
8 hundreds plus 3 tens.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.130
So let's just
think about 76,830.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:28.020
So if we write 76,830-- I'm
going to try to color-code it.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.250
We could write this out as
being the same thing as 70,000

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.810
plus 6,000-- the 7 is in
the ten thousands place.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.780
So it's 7 ten thousands,
which is 70,000, plus-- the 6

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.862
is in the thousands place--
so it's 6,000, or 6 thousands,

00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:50.760
one could say, plus 800.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.481
Or you could say 8 hundreds.

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:55.720
800 plus 3 tens, or 30.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.680
And then there's 0
ones, so we could just

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.050
write that out as 0 if we like.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.519
Now, what we have
on the right here

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.090
is almost what they have
on the right over here.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.712
Notice the 0.

00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:09.670
They didn't write that.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.160
So we can ignore that.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.380
The 0 really doesn't
affect the value.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.155
We have 3 tens.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:16.740
We have 3 tens.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.950
Let me do this in a
color you can see.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.280
You have 8 hundreds.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.260
You have 800.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.500
But then that's where
it starts to break down.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.700
They have blank thousands.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.080
Here we have 6 thousands.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.413
So we're going to have to
think about this a little bit.

00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:35.010
And then they have 6 ten
thousands, which is 60,000.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.555
Here we have 70 thousands.

00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:42.280
So we've got to work
through these two places

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.290
right over here.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.040
So they have 6 ten
thousands, which

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.090
is the same thing as 60,000.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.690
We have 70,000.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.860
So they essentially
took 10,000 from here

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.314
and regrouped it someplace.

00:01:52.314 --> 00:01:53.980
And since these two
places are the same,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.188
they must have regrouped it
into the thousands place.

00:01:56.188 --> 00:01:57.430
So let's try to do that.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.710
So let's get rid of
10,000 out of the 70,000.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.480
It becomes 60,000.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.790
So this becomes a 6.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.190
And then we're regrouping
that into the thousands place.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.320
So we're going to add 10,000
to the thousands place.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.560
Now what's the thousands
place going to be then?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.280
Well, it's 10,000 plus 6,000.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.830
It's going to
become 16 thousands.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.980
This right over here is
going to become a 16.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.000
So now what we wrote
here looks just

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.490
like what they wrote up here.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.780
This is 6 ten thousands
plus 16 thousands

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.250
plus 8 hundreds plus 3 tens.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.110
And we're done.
