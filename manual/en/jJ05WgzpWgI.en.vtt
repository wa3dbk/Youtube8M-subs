00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.350
There use to be two main ways to be able to
do your color.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.130
One would be to choose the box in the store
and do it yourself at home.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.990
Two might be to go to a hair colorist and
do it that way.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.770
Now we can actually dye our hair online.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.060
One of the companies that I know is called
esalon.com.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.240
They've got hair color online pretty much
down to a science.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:36.710
Upon entering the esalon site you are asked
a series of lets say around 20 question.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.370
The questions can be anything from, what is
your natural color now, what is your desired

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.190
color, do you have any chemicals currently
in your hair.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.620
So esalon really has mastered the correct
questions, I believe they needed to in order

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.460
to give you your desired look at home.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.420
Once you fill out all of the questions towards
the end of the website up pops a picture of

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.950
your desired hair color.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.200
What comes in the mail is even cooler.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.770
Each person gets their own individualized
hair color at home kit.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.390
The hair dye is based from all the questions
that you've asked.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.540
So this is actually prepared per person.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.590
Different from in the supermarket.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.380
Because in the supermarket you're going in
with very limited knowledge.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.290
You may see a color on the box and say 'I
would love to be that color' and you put it

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.990
on your hair and you look nothing like the
color at the end.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.290
Esalon sort of takes care of that because
even though there's not a hair colorist that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.610
you're asking the questions to you're literally
telling the computer and the computer is helping

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.610
you out.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.450
So once you get your box in the mail they
make it very easy for you they give you detailed

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.360
instructions as I said above.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.719
They give you accessories such as skin guard,
some hair clips, some hair gloves.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.990
And this happens to be a kit if you're going
to do your hair for the first time on all

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.810
natural hair.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.190
The reason I say that is because they have
specially formulated a color system for the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.280
root area and in a separate color system for
the areas on the ends of the hair.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480
This is a lot more detailed than something
you might find in the super market and a little

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.569
bit closer to a colorist might do to you at
the salon, at the sink, on the roots.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.440
So I think this is a great way to go, rather
than the supermarket if you can't make it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.290
into the colorist.
