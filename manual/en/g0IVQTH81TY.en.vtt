00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:15.460
We all know there are things that you shouldn't put in the microwave.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.720
In front of us we have a few of these things.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.527
Soap, a lightbulb, firework with a steel sponge, a bottle of wine.

00:00:24.527 --> 00:00:30.539
Sol shall we put a few of these-
-in the microwave?

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:39.782
Dear viewer, Sol and I enjoy making this program.
But the following is very serious.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:50.705
The following scene is shocking. 
But it does show you why you should not try these things at home.

00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:54.364
And why this program is called "Don't try this at home".

00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:01.697
Welcome back to the microwave test.

00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:05.835
Normally it would be a waste to put a bottle of wine in the microwave.

00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:08.209
That's why were are putting a bottle of wine in the microwave.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.896
Exact fit.

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:21.526
Safety first, Sol! Safety first!

00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:27.211
Ready?

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:34.924
If you think you know what'll happen next. Tweet with hashtag DTTAH.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.200
This button, right?

00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:55.816
*Shouting and swearing*

00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:05.896
*More shouting and swearing*

00:02:08.638 --> 00:02:11.800
How is my face? How is my face!?
Your face is fine.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.606
Then you think: "My face! My face!"

00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:16.844
You look around to see if everyone is OK.

00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:25.956
It all goes in slow-motion. It's bizarre and intense. 
Nothing like I have ever experienced.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.000
9 days later.
