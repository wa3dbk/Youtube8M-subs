00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.811
Very nice
UAB ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON BRENT PONCE IS ON THE

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:06.440
PHONE WITH A COLLEAGUE IN ATLANTA.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.610
THEY ARE LOOKING OVER SOME IMAGES PRIOR TO
PONCE PERFORMING A SHOULDER SURGERY IN BIRMINGHAM.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.320
THAT EXTRA HAND BELONGS TO THE ATLANTA DOCTOR,
PHANI DANTULURI.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.470
IT'S TELEMEDICINE WITH A TWIST.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.449
Its real time, real life, right there, as
opposed to a normal Skype or normal video

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.830
conference call which is just back and forth
dialogue, but it's not really interactive.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.289
(nat sound)
AND IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE OPERATING ROOM,

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.180
USING A VIRTUAL REALITY TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED
AT UAB CALLED VIPAAR ALONG WITH GOOGLE GLASS.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.500
THE CAMERA IN THE GOOGLE GLASS SENDS AN IMAGE
OF THE SURGICAL FIELD TO DANTULURI'S COMPUTER

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.500
IN ATLANTA.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.300
HE SEES WHAT PONCE SEES, AND VIPAAR ALLOWS
HIM TO REACH INTO THE VIRTUAL FIELD IN REAL

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.300
TIME.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.470
IN TURN, PONCE SEES DANTURULI'S HANDS AND
INSTRUMENTS IN HIS GOOGLE GLASS HEADS UP DISPLAY.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.300
A surgeon, a remote surgeon is able to put
his or her hands into the surgical field and

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.829
provide assistance.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.899
To point out different structures, the anatomy,
the placement of retractors.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.700
It's a safety net to improve patient care
from having that assistance from an expert

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.049
who is not in the room.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.600
PONCE AND DANTURLUI TEAMED UP FOR THIS FIRST-EVER
VIPAAR/GOOGLE GLASS OPERATION.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.359
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO TEACH SURGICAL RESIDENTS,
OR ALLOW A VETERAN SURGEON LIKE PONCE TO SERVE

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:27.359
AS A MENTOR.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.969
When you have residents graduating or an attending
who is on staff somewhere else who is learning

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:38.719
a new procedure and would want help or assistance
for the first 2, 3, 4, 5, 10.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.039
This system is able to provide the help, but
also they acquire the skills and the education

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.749
while they are doing the procedure.

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.020
It's exporting expertise.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.500
UAB NEUROSURGEON BART GUTHRIE HAS OFTEN ADVISED
LESS-EXPERIENCED SURGEONS AT SMALL REGIONAL

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.039
HOSPITALS ABOUT DIFFICULT CASES OVER THE TELEPHONE.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.330
WHAT A DIFFERENCE, HE THOUGHT, IF HE COULD
SHOW AND NOT JUST TELL.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.860
So if we can actually get our hands in and
guide a surgeon who has the skills but not

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.860
the experience.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.190
That could be a life or death difference.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.750
TEN YEARS IN THE MAKING, GUTHRIE TEAMED UP
WITH UAB'S MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.350
TO CREATE THE VIPAAR TECHNOLOGY.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.070
BESIDES TELEMEDICINE, VIPAAR CEO DREW DEATON
SAYS APPLICATIONS INCLUDE THE FIELD SERVICE

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.420
INDUSTRY, WHETHER IT'S REPAIRING A HOME AIR
CONDITIONING UNIT, OR A FACTORY ASSEMBLY LINE.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.721
It's like being there, side by side with someone
when you might be a thousand miles, or 10

00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:32.721
thousand miles away.

00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:38.770
I can't imagine five years from now, not being
able to use a smart phone to connect to an

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.440
expert to solve my problem.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.650
And have that person reach in and show me
how to solve that problem, because the technology

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.129
is advancing rapidly and we're bringing this
technology to market today.
