00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.520
Hi Everyone!

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.830
Welcome to Wendy's Lookbook.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.390
We are at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.180
And it's actually a little chilly here,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.580
which is the perfect place to talk about layering.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.060
And to me, layering is like painting,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.090
we're creating beautiful outfits

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.030
with different colors and textures.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.080
For this episode, we're going to start layering using two pieces,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.480
then three...

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.070
then we'll finish it off with four pieces.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.990
So, let's get started!

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.540
This is our first pairing.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.620
And we're working with two pieces,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.120
colors that blend harmoniously together.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.070
Our base color is brown,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.070
and we're complimenting that with grey.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.600
For a casual outfit like this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.170
I like to look for tops that have interesting draping

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.470
or texture, because it adds more dimension to our look.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.550
But this look is very comfortable, 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.280
very cozy.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.720
Which is perfect for school, running errands or 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.460
enjoying nature.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.360
This is our second look.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.010
And we're keeping with the same color palette

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.010
which is brown and grey.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.540
But here I have a simple tee,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.130
I'm layering it with a jacket.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.100
And this jacket is light and thin

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.840
which is great because it will help keep the shape

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.700
as we're adding more pieces on.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.620
But we're layering with our third piece,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.510
a sweater vest.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.390
Hello!

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.800
I don't have food, I'm so sorry!

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.810
Yes.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.810
Can I help you?  They actually have grey and

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.010
and ... and blue.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.580
Should I pick 'em up?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.190
This is the completed look.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.450
And I think investing in a sweater vest

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.090
is a must when playing with layers.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.780
Because it helps add dimension

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.180
to our look without the bulk, because it doesn't have any sleeves.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.440
This is my Soyer vest.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.280
And I recommend investing in one that is well draped, 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.610
well designed and semi-thick.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.810
But this outfit is perfect for...

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.430
the brisk weather.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.310
We are in the heart of the park,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.820
surrounded by beautiful museums.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.110
This is our last pairing.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.110
We're going to be working with four pieces this time.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.110
We're changing our base color over to black.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.060
I have black boots on

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.060
and I have a light black tank top on.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.750
We're going to start layering it with a thin button up shirt.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.840
We're just going to leave it un-buttoned and draped.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.990
then we're going to add our third piece

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.440
which is going to be a light camouflage army jacket.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.440
Again we're using really light pieces

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.200
so we don't really add a lot of bulk

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.970
to our upper half, so they don't look top heavy.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.980
But we also don't want to lose our waistline, 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.300
so we're going to cinch it with a couple belts.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.760
I'm going to add one more because I really like that double belt look.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.610
Ok.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.290
And then we're going to re-introduce our base color,

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.870
by adding a black draped cardigan over.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.790
(laughing) I can't find my arm.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.910
And this is the completed look

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.870
with four layering pieces.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.850
Now that we're warm,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.930
let's go explore the area together.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.350
Thank you so much for being with me.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.360
I love layering.  It's effortlessly chic, 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.890
casual and it keeps us warm all at the same time.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.650
But thank you so much again

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.110
and I'll see you soon on Youtube-land.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.570
Bye!
