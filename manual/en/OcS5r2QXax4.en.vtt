00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.003 align:start position:0%
HEAR WHAT?

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.839 size:50% position:75%
YOUR EXPLANATION
FOR THIS.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.206 size:75% position:63%
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON,

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.975 size:72% position:64%
IT'S YOU AND YOUR LOGIC
SO...

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.910 align:start position:0%
YOU WANT ME TO EXPLAIN

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.879 size:75% position:38%
THE DEAD SERIAL KILLER'S
MISSING BODY?

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.149
(people speaking indistinctly)

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.518 size:56% position:28%
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HERE

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.154 align:start position:0%
YET.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.590 size:75% position:63%
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT?

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:24.824 size:78% position:39%
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.492 size:66% position:33%
WITH NIGEL MALLOY
RISING FROM THE DEAD.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.495 align:start position:0%
IT'S HIS BROTHER.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.464 size:69% position:34%
LEOPOLD MALLOY
IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:32.966 align:start size:13% position:88%
YO.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.500
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE LEOPOLD
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.835
NO, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:36.970 align:start size:72% position:28%
LOOK, THE GUY'S CRAZY,

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.671
BUT HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT
ONE THING.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.540
HE HAS NO PHONE, NO E-MAIL,
AND NO VISITORS BESIDES VAL.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:42.808 size:59% position:30%
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME WAY OF PROVING

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.043 align:start position:0%
THAT LEOPOLD'S
BEHIND ALL THIS.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.478 size:56% position:72%
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HE DID IT,

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.446 size:56% position:72%
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
WHO'S NEXT.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.082
I CHECKED INTO THE COURT
DOCUMENTS ON THE MALLOY TRIAL.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.416 align:start size:66% position:34%
I NOTICED A PATTERN.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.684 size:81% position:59%
JASON WAS THE FIRST PERSON
TO TESTIFY,

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:52.952 size:66% position:67%
AND HE WAS ALSO
THE FIRST ONE TO DIE.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.287 align:start size:56% position:44%
A DAY LATER, VAL,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.822 size:81% position:59%
THE SECOND PERSON
WHO TESTIFIED, WAS KILLED.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.924
OKAY, SO THEY'RE BEING KILLED
IN ORDER OF THEIR TESTIMONIES.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.359
WHO'S LUCKY NUMBER THREE?

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.528 size:84% position:58%
UH, MARK HELLER.
I TALKED TO HIS GIRLFRIEND.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.496 size:56% position:72%
HE RECEIVED A DISC
THREE DAYS AGO.

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:04.864
THAT MEANS HE'S DUE TO DIE
TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.232
THAT'S IN FOUR HOURS.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.033 size:88% position:44% line:85%
AND WHERE'S MARK HELLER NOW?

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.033 align:start size:59% position:41%
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.369 align:end position:100%
HE WATCHED THE VIDEO
AND HE FREAKED OUT.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.037 size:84% position:58%
HE LEFT THE HOUSE.
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE HE WENT.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.039
I MIGHT.
HELLER'S FINANCIALS SHOW THAT

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.907
HE BOUGHT GROCERIES AT A STORE
OUTSIDE KINGSTON YESTERDAY.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.409
HIS FAMILY OWNS A CABIN
UP THERE.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.643 size:63% position:69%
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHERE HE'S HOLED UP.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.812 size:72% position:36%
OKAY, ESPOSITO YOU KEEP
DIGGING INTO LEOPOLD.

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.314 align:start position:0% line:85%
RYAN...

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.314
(jangles keys)

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.682 size:78% position:39%
FIND THE OTHER WITNESSES.
MAKE SURE THEY'RE SAFE.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.150 size:81% position:41%
CASTLE AND I WILL HEAD OFF
TO KINGSTON

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:26.785
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET HELLER.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.187 size:88% position:56%
UH, WE'RE GOING TO A CABIN

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.756 size:78% position:61%
IN THE WOODS
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:30.857 align:start size:31% position:69%
YEAH. SO?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.025 align:start position:0%
SO IT'S LIKE THE CO-ED

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:33.493
CHECKING OUT THE STRANGE NOISE
IN THE BASEMENT

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.627 align:start position:0%
IN A SLASHER PIC.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.096 size:84% position:42%
IT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.231 size:88% position:44%
IT'S NOT A SLASHER FLICK.
IT'S A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.899 size:53% position:27%
AND I'M GOING
UP TO THAT CABIN.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:41.634 align:start position:0%
SO YOU COMING OR WHAT?

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.436 line:78%
(elevator bell dings)

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.436 size:66% position:67%
WELL, I CAN'T LET YOU
GO ALONE.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:44.670
(doors open)

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.773 size:56% position:72%
BUT I NEED TO MAKE
A STOP FIRST.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:49.575
(clicks button)

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.978 align:start position:0%
OKAY, SO I'VE GOT

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.814 size:56% position:28%
INCENSE, PALASPAS,
BAGUA MIRROR.

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.883
THIS IS A VERITABLE WAR CHEST
FOR FIGHTING EVIL SPIRITS.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.017 align:start size:63% position:38%
IS THAT HOLY WATER?

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.918 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.918 align:start size:81% position:19%
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT FROM?

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:01.987 size:88% position:44%
A PRIEST BLESSED THIS FOR ME
TWO YEARS AGO.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.656 align:start size:47% position:53%
AND Y-YOU JUST
KEEP IT AROUND?

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.259 size:84% position:42%
KNEW IT WOULD COME IN HANDY
ONE DAY.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.326 align:start position:0%
NOW...

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.761 size:75% position:38%
WHAT WEAPON DO YOU WANT?

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.831
I THINK I'LL BE FINE
WITH MY GUN.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.666 size:72% position:64%
THERE'S NOT JUST ONE...
TINY PART OF YOU

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.502 size:69% position:66%
THAT WONDERS
IF I MIGHT BE RIGHT?

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.307
(cell phone rings)
