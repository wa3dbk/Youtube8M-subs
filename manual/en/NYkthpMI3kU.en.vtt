00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.909
"It took your heart,

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.240
and your loving mind, and your generous soul 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.489
to make this fabulous dream come true.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.130
Here we go..."
We all dream of things, both big and small ...

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.210
and every once in a while what we dream 
becomes reality right before our eyes:

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.659
Danny Thomas dream of building a  
state of the art pediatric cancer    

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.320
research hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.   

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.930
And in 1962, St. Jude   
Children's Research Hospital was born.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.830
Since St. Jude opened its doors,  
the overall survival rate for kids with    

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.020
cancer has increased from 20%
to a remarkable 80% today.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.730
And St. Jude is the only pediatric
Cancer Research Center where families

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.130
never paid for treatment not covered by
insurance,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.850
which means simply no child is ever
denied treatment because of the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.830
family's inability to pay.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.590
Carnival is all about bringing 
fun to families and there's nothing 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.110
like the feeling you get when you put a smile  
on a child's face.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.310
That's why partnering with St. Jude is so 
important to us.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.600
Working together towards our goal of  
raising three millions over the next

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.830
three years

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.520
we can help St. Jude with their fight
against childhood cancer

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.299
and let kids just be kids!   

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:21.870
So we jumped right in...  

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.810
creating the "Tell us Your Best Dream" contest   
and turned it into the world's largest

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.970
children's book with proceeds going to
St. Jude

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.060
Then we wrote a fundraising fun on our ships  
as part of our "Care to Play" campaign

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.660
for St. Jude.   

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.409
Now this is where you come in.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.680
We hope you'll join us and get that
indescribable "do good, feel good" vibe

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.370
and help us make one more dream
come true:

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.100
ending childhood cancer once and for all.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.300
