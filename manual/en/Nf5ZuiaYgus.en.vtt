00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.009
Just fixed a couple of 
bad files here with Markzware's

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.970
InDesign File Recovery Service,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.680
and the customers generally ask, 
"Well, what caused the problem?" 
Well, it's hard to say.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.869
There are multiple issues 
which could cause a

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.110
file to go corrupt,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.100
an InDesign file to 
not work anymore, to crash.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.599
However, one of the common problems are
corrupt fonts. This can be the form of an

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.920
actual font itself which is corrupt or
damaged, the font file itself,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.220
or it could have come down 
to just the font caches.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.100
Well, first of all,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.590
on Adobe's website, there's a great

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.680
troubleshooting fonts on the Mac OS,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.660
and there similar for

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.750
Windows, as well,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.020
and this goes through

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.310
many of the common problems,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.150
you know, make sure 
the format's supported

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.860
make sure the fonts are installed 
in the correct folders,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.510
very important tips.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.189
And make sure both screen and 
printer fonts are installed.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.600
This iss something which is a

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.420
common preflight area which FlightCheck
checks for and helps you find, these missing

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.740
fonts, by the way.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.850
Then, we get into

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.550
clear the font cache.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.970
We can do this manually.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.040
In general, font cache. There are also
certain utilities to help do this for

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.560
you.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.750
Further information for troubleshooting

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.750
damaged fonts.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.020
Now, I'll put a link to this, 
because this is important. 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.420
If you get a bad file, yeah, we 
can fix it for you, but make sure 
it's not your system causing

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.869
the problem, which is,

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.960
you know,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.780
not all time the case, but certainly 
sometimes it is. So, I'm going to show you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.280
a nice little utility I have here,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.180
and that utility is called, "Cocktail".

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.450
Let me show you how that works. 
Alright, so here is Cocktail.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.659
Use to be freebie, I think you have to pay, like 29 dollars

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.010
or Euros, or something 
along those lines, but

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.990
it does a multitude of tasks and,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.450
for instance, just to 
start off with the Disks section,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.890
a great one to run every once 
in a while is Permissions

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.979
to repair disk permissions

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.270
on your hard drive - a very important one,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.810
and there are a host of other

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.889
things it can help you with. 
You can set up different scripts

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.529
to look at your

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.299
Spotlight index files,

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.659
to rebuild your databases 
on your OS, so here is

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.879
under the file section, you'll 
see a lot of different

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.099
things that can be done.

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.769
Under the caches,

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.650
you can hit the Options

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.379
and you get a host of

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.099
additional

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.540
possibilities.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.339
Okay, so under

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.959
Options for your caches, you can

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.699
see that you can

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.519
clear up a host of different

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.009
types of caches

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.659
on your system:

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.719
good CUPS files and

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.509
kernel caches, virtual memory 
slot files, etc.,

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.139
but under User,

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.139
what you'll notice is

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.529
not only ColorSync caches,

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:05.949
Java, QuickTime, etc., but also 
Adobe Systems Incorporated caches,

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:10.229
or even from Microsoft or 
Quark for QuarkXPress users

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.559
So, for InDesign users, 
you just make sure you click this 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.399
for just that user or everybody,

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.379
and just so you see that there's other

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.430
possibilities, as well, to remove your
cookies, your download lists...

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.899
very good things to clear out once in a 
while, because they can cause major problems

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.029
You select OK

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:36.029
and then you basically come here 
and you click Clear,

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.939
and it's that easy!

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.159
You don't need to go into Terminal and

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.519
type some commands if you're 
not familiar with that

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.319
or rummage around your hard drive 
and look for hidden files.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.639
This thing'll just do it. So, you see it 
actually clearing the user caches here.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.499
This is very easy.

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.869
A click of a button and

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.719
Cocktail does all the work for you.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.579
So, that's how you use cocktail 
to clear your font caches,

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.279
if yours still getting bad files, or have a bad file you need to fix anyway, Markzware

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.299
can generally help with that. We have a

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.159
basically no-cure, no-pay service.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.669
There is a 19 dollar or 19 Euro fee.

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.899
(Startup sound) Restarting the other machine

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:25.499
where I just cleared my font caches. 
There is a 19 dollars or Euros one-time

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:26.169
intake fee

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.250
that is not refundable,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.560
as you see in the steps here, 
but the rest is quite clear,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.789
and, once you pay the intake fee, 
you can upload the submission form,

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.189
give us as much details as possible,

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:42.939
and we'll try to fix your file. That was 
how to clear your font caches with Cocktail

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.070
and I'll also give the link to the 
Adobe site we showed earlier.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.270
