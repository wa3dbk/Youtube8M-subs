00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
(West Virginiaâ€™s whitewater scene is known for the awesome Gauley River during Gauley Season.)

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
(This video shows you why ACE thinks Gauley Season should be all year long.)

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:14.214
The cool thing about the Upper Gauley during the 
 summertime is that we're out here by ourselves.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.551
Everybody comes here to West Virginia to raft the Gauley during September and October

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:20.520
during Fall Gauley Season when the water is big, 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.291
but most folks don't even realize that we can run it all summer long.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:31.532
We run it at a huge variety of water levels, from 
 200 CFS all the way up to 15,000 CFS.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:37.337
Sometimes we go in duckies, sometimes we go in the 
 smaller rafts, sometimes we go in the bigger rafts,

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:41.275
but there's always a lot of fun to be had out here.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:48.081
I've bungee jumped, and I've gone cliff jumping, and this has 
 been one of the best trips I've ever had!

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:50.951
It was a crazy trip, super adventurous.

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:58.225
I'd recommend it to anybody, even the big waterfalls, the little rapids 
 that turn the boat around, and the surfing was *very* cool.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.662
As a raft guide, I enjoy the summer Upper Gauley the most.

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:07.034
It's steep, it's technical, it's a challenge for us, and 
 therefore we know it's a challenge for you guys.

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:12.973
It's one of the best trips that ACE provides for you 
 guys that want to take it to the next level.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:19.079
We knew exactly what we were going to do going into the rapid.  
 The crew we had was very good because we paddled very well.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.684
(Our raft guide) told us what to expect and 
 everything was just as expected, if not better.

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:30.090
We take funyaks down the river when the water is low, 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.530
and we really enjoy these trips because we get to get out here 
 with folks and have them do something they've never done before.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.570
We get out on the rocks, and stand in position, and 
 point to where we want people to go, 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.470
and hopefully the folks manage to go where we're pointing :-)

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:49.940
If they don't, well, we're right there ready to pick 
 them up and help them back in their boats,

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:53.140
tell the what a good job they did, and send them on their way.

00:01:53.312 --> 00:02:00.090
We run some very steep little drops, a lot 
 of technical maneuvering, and some really great whitewater.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:09.230
It was a totally different experience.  It gave me a lot of confidence to be 
 able to go through the rapids by myself, without anybody else in my boat.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:14.100
It was, like, more of a technical paddle; I got 
 to practice my paddling skills a lot more.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.300
My favorite part I think was jumping into the 
 slide, the little log flume by Iron Ring,

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:23.840
because I didn't think it was going to work out, but after 
 you got into it, it was just really, really cool :-)

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:29.720
Cool, clean, clear water.  Great rafting.  
 And it's always a little bit different.
