Hi there, welcome to another Friday Findings
video. Today, I thought I would show you a

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.930
little bit about wire twisting. It' a great
tool to add to your repertoire because you

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.340
can use it in lots of different ways. I often
use it when I want to do something with the

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.020
wire and I don't have a heavy enough gauge.
So by twisting two wires together like I did

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.760
in this earring frame now it was heavy enough
to do what I wanted. Also once you have twisted

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.440
your wire, you can hammer it. And then you
have a frame that you can loop wire through

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.300
to make things like this bracelet, or this
piece which is a part of a pair of earrings.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.140
So let me show you three different ways that
you can twist wire. This is a tool that you

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.939
will find in many of your crafting stores
made just for twisting wire. And the idea

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:16.059
is that you put the wire through two of the holes
on this wheel. And then you have to twist

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.770
these ends together. And you have to do it
pretty securely.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.710
This is one reason I don't love this tool,  there
is a lot of waste down here. You can't just

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.189
put it in a couple of twists. You have to
put in quite a few. And also you need

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.649
a hook, something stationary or something
heavy to clamp on to the other end.

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:42.159
So then once you have your wires in here you
just hold on to the other end and twist. This

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.679
tool does its job but there are several steps
involved that I think are a pain. Like I said,

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.789
you waste wire and you have to have a third
hand of some sort.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.779
Instead, you can do the same thing with just
a pair of chain nose or flat nose pliers and

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:05.379
a pair of round nose pliers. Once again the
piece of wire gets folded in half. And you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:13.909
hold on to one end with your chain nose and
flat nose. Tuck the round nose into the loop

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:23.450
and you can just twist the tool. This actually
works well if you put your wire into vice

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.250
grips because then you don't have to grip
on to it. The grips do that for you.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:38.680
But by far my favorite is a power tool. Just
a power drill with a chuck that means these

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.599
little things that come together as you spin
it. And once again you fold the wire in half

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.019
and this is great if you are using heavier
gauge wire that would be difficult to twist

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:01.779
by hand. You just tuck them in there and then
tighten down the chuck until it is holding

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.959
them firmly.
And then I'm not going to be able to get all

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:17.239
of this on camera. But you can put the loop,
again the loop of the wire into your round

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.239
nose pliers. Hit the gas 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.319
and that way your
wire is twisted perfectly, evenly, quickly.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.099
And you can do a piece as long as you can
reach from one hand to the other.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.010
So then once you have your twisted wire you
can shape it just like you would a single

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.120
strand of wire and then that makes it just
a bit more fancy and decorative. You can hammer

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.019
it and again like I said earlier you will
have these holes that open up as you hammer

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.939
it so that you can pass wire through it and
use it as a frame. Make scrolls, just have

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:08.389
fun and create, and experiment. I hope I have
given you some ideas and a new tool to add

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.650
to your jewelry making tool kit.
