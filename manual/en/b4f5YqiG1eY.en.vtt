00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:06.721
It is December 31st!

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.600
We're just minutes away from 2015.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.660
Right now, I am here at Zojo-ji,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.300
which is a temple right by the Tokyo Tower.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.817
It's pretty busy!

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.440
Everyone is here to do the countdown,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.180
and right after the countdown, they can do hatsumode.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.440
Also, Tokyo Tower, I guess, lights up with the countdown.

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.294
So let's go see it!

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.560
Wow, so many people! OMG.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.513
I've never actually spent my New Year's Eve

00:00:48.513 --> 00:00:50.046
outside in Japan.

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:56.305
Oh, see the Tokyo Tower?

00:00:56.653 --> 00:00:58.653
It just turned off.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.060
You can see it faintly behind these branches.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.640
See the red lights?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.440
Trying to find a spot where we can get a good view

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.560
of the light up of the tower.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.140
It's hard. There are a bunch of trees in the way.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.680
Okay, let me find a good spot.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.200
There's like a reporter reporting!

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.380
I imagine it's fun to be over there,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.240
right in the middle of everything as well.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.600
But if you want to see the Tokyo Tower light up,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.840
This is an awesome spot.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.040
There's like nobody here.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.028
and you know you've got a good spot

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.194
when you've got TV reporters next to you.

00:01:41.194 --> 00:01:42.909
Oh no, it's going to light up!

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.360
Two more minutes!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.213
Tokyo Tower is starting to spark with all these sparkles,

00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:53.195
and you can smell the fire.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399
That's where they're burning all of the

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.260
the charms (omamori) and the ema,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.940
those wooden plaques you write on,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.240
you write your wishes on.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.860
You've gotta burn the ones from 2014 and

00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:07.921
get new ones for the new year.

00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:10.280
Look at all those people, OMG!

00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:14.694
Wow, they're all excited!

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.800
Happy New Year! Akemashite omedeto gozaimasu!

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.160
I wasn't ready for that countdown!

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.700
I'm walking towards the bell,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.980
that they ring 108 times!

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:16.633
So you can get a ticket to ring this bell.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.880
I hope you guys had a nice countdown!

00:04:20.372 --> 00:04:22.372
Alright guys! See you soon!
