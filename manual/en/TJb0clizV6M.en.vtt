00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:09.681
(bright music)

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:13.651
- Hi there.

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:15.403
Today I have a special recipe

00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:17.969
to share with you, chicken paella.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.561
Now, paella is the
traditional Spanish rice dish

00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:23.116
that is cooked with meat,
chicken, or seafood,

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:25.323
or a combination of all of the above.

00:00:25.323 --> 00:00:27.319
But paella tends to be a fairly

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.199
time consuming meal to make.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.312
Our version is not only a healthier

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:34.992
take on paella, but also a
simpler version to prepare.

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:36.896
The key is to have all your ingredients

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:39.230
ready to go before you start to cook.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.006
So, let's get to it.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:43.328
First, I'm going to
coat this large skillet

00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:44.402
with cooking spray,

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:49.489
and put it over medium high heat.

00:00:50.807 --> 00:00:52.966
There are actual pans called paella pans

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.845
that are a bit wider and
have handles on each side,

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:57.448
so you can put the dish in the oven,

00:00:57.448 --> 00:00:58.956
or even on top of the grill,

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.732
but we are keeping this simple

00:01:00.732 --> 00:01:01.813
and cooking stove top,

00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:04.149
so our skillet will work just fine.

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.355
Now, I'm adding in one pound

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:08.154
of boneless, skinless chicken breast

00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:09.808
that I've cut into one inch cubes.

00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.791
I'm going to cook this
for five to seven minutes,

00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:17.835
stirring occasionally,
and then I'll remove it

00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:18.817
from the pan.

00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:24.195
That looks about done.

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:35.786
Now that I've removed the chicken,

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:38.857
I'll add in two teaspoons
of extra virgin olive oil,

00:01:41.193 --> 00:01:43.617
or you could use canola or vegetable oil.

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:47.772
Next, I have one medium
sized red bell pepper

00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:52.807
and one medium green pepper

00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:54.334
that I've thinly sliced.

00:01:55.908 --> 00:01:58.485
Sweet peppers are a traditional
ingredient in paella,

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.426
so we always wanna add those.

00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:02.938
Now, I'll add in one small chopped onion.

00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:10.518
Another quick stir.

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:13.948
And I'll let this cook
for about five minutes

00:02:13.948 --> 00:02:17.180
until the onion starts to
become translucent or clear.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.896
Now you can see my
onions are getting clear,

00:02:19.896 --> 00:02:22.067
so it's time to add in two tomatoes

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:23.939
that I've chopped and lightly mashed,

00:02:27.868 --> 00:02:30.434
along with one small can of peas,

00:02:30.434 --> 00:02:32.268
no salt added green peas,

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:34.921
which is another typical
ingredient found in paella.

00:02:37.747 --> 00:02:40.568
Next, I have one teaspoon of minced garlic

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:41.431
from the jar.

00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.803
That's one clove if you're
mincing it yourself.

00:02:46.454 --> 00:02:48.921
Then one half teaspoon of parsley.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.232
And now for the most important spice,

00:02:54.232 --> 00:02:57.924
which truly makes paella
authentic, saffron.

00:02:57.924 --> 00:03:01.325
As you can see, saffron is a
beautiful orange yellow color,

00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:03.567
which colors the rice in paella.

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.806
Now, saffron is an expensive spice,

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:07.199
but you only need a little bit,

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.720
one fourth teaspoon.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.288
Still, if you can't find it,

00:03:10.288 --> 00:03:12.342
or you want a more budget friendly option,

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:14.246
you can use turmeric instead,

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:15.687
which will also give your paella

00:03:15.687 --> 00:03:17.697
that beautiful orange tint.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.974
So in goes my saffron.

00:03:19.974 --> 00:03:22.202
And I'll give that a quick stir,

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.134
and cook this for another two minutes.

00:03:30.664 --> 00:03:32.919
Now I'll reduce this to medium low heat,

00:03:34.305 --> 00:03:35.687
add the chicken back in

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:44.701
with one cup low sodium chicken broth,

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:47.773
or you could use low sodium
vegetable broth here too.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.387
I'll give that another stir,

00:03:52.387 --> 00:03:54.598
cover, and let that cook for 20 minutes.

00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:07.316
OK, so it's been 20 minutes,

00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:09.568
and wow, does that smell good.

00:04:09.568 --> 00:04:11.228
So, for the final step,

00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:12.610
adding in the rice.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.094
Traditional paella is
made with bomba rice,

00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:16.510
a short grain white rice

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.193
that soaks up a lot of liquid,

00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:20.876
so the grains get larger,
but retain their shape.

00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:23.092
To make this a bit more heart healthy,

00:04:23.092 --> 00:04:25.856
I have two cups of long grain brown rice,

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:27.054
which I've already cooked

00:04:27.054 --> 00:04:29.376
according to the package instructions.

00:04:29.376 --> 00:04:31.314
Brown rice is a whole grain,

00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:33.682
something we should all
be eating more often.

00:04:33.682 --> 00:04:35.383
So, in goes the rice.

00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:39.414
I'll give it a good stir.

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.659
And now I'll just cook
this until everything

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:49.786
is warmed through.

00:04:53.797 --> 00:04:55.817
So here is our chicken paella.

00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:58.034
And doesn't it look wonderful?

00:04:58.034 --> 00:05:00.171
I can tell you it sure smells great,

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:02.318
and it tastes wonderful too.

00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:03.792
So the next time you are thinking about

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:05.221
chicken and rice for dinner,

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.729
consider chicken paella.

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.679
You'll be sure to wow the entire family.

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:10.433
Enjoy.

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:15.433
