Warfield: Lieutenant, get the wounded to those shuttles!

00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:19.387
Dominion Officer: We're almost there! Should I send a team to get you?

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:25.462
Warfield: I'm fine, Lieutenant. Just see to those wounded.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.158
Warfield: I'll get out another way.

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:50.262
Dominion Officer: General! There's too many zerg! We're not going to make it!

00:01:02.386 --> 00:01:12.342
Warfield: You listen to me. I have three shuttles packed with men too injured to ever be a threat to you. Husbands. Fathers.

00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:16.215
Warfield: You let those shuttles go. You hear me?

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:32.519
Warfield: You bitch. You're not even human anymore. You betrayed us all. For what? Petty revenge?

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:38.234
Warfield: How many innocents have you killed? How many more have to die?

00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:42.117
Warfield: What if Raynor could see you right now?

00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:53.799
Dominion Officer: General! We're surrounded! We're not going to make it!

00:02:05.597 --> 00:02:16.410
Dominion Officer: General! The zerg pulled back! It's a miracle! We're going to make it! ...General! ...General?
