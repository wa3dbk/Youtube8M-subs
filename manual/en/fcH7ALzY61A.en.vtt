00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.322
I'm Johnny from ExpertBoxing.

00:00:01.322 --> 00:00:02.905
Right now I'm going to show you some tips

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:05.681
to increase the power of your uppercut punches.

00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:09.875
The first tip when it comes to throwing uppercuts

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.015
I always think about my hip and my elbow.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.566
The hip and the elbow position is crucial.

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:18.715
Ok, first with the hip

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.900
You need the hip to be under the uppercut and to support it

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.405
so your hip is out here, it's not under the uppercut

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.300
This is not a very powerful uppercut.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.680
Ok, you need it here.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.651
You need to get this hip as close as you can under it.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.250
so instead of here

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.500
maybe here is better ok,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.900
or on this side on my right side 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.000
maybe, you know, here is better.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150
This is going to be a weak uppercut.

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.900
This is going to be a little bit more powerful

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.181
because I have my hip under.

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:45.894
Now for the elbow

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.040
you want your elbow to really get under the uppercut.

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:51.456
Make sure it gets under and

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:54.422
the elbow follows the fist and supports the fist.

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.800
If you're throwing an unsupported uppercut

00:00:57.888 --> 00:01:01.026
let's say I'm throwing an uppercut like this and the elbow is here

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.630
it's not really that much more powerful.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.102
If I can I want to get my elbow under

00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:07.265
and along with my hip

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.151
so you'll see I'm trying to draw a line 

00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:12.030
between the fist, the elbow, the hip and the foot.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.176
Ok, here

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.489
ok, and I'll show you from this angle. All right?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.247
So, hip and elbow. Very crucial.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.787
Huge point. Huge, huge, huge point.

00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:25.539
The next thing you want to do is

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.800
you want to imagine that the uppercut

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.705
has a big load

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:32.589
with a very tight shot.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.334
It's a very tight pop.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.883
So I'm going to show you the example

00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:38.485
of a big load with a tight pop.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.108
So right here, I'm loading up

00:01:41.054 --> 00:01:42.465
and then bom!

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.600
It's very tight.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.125
Ok, or you may see pros, they're here

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.485
and they're loading up and...Bom!

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:49.422
Ok.

00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:50.650
whoosh, whoosh

00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:53.121
Ok, that's what it is.

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.450
What you don't want is a

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:56.020
a small load and...whoosh

00:01:56.254 --> 00:01:58.400
and you throw a tight pop. It's not that.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.901
It's not this and then...

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:01.650
You know, just here and 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.739
Bom!

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.286
So it's a lot of body motion

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:09.048
to get into a very small, tight, compact shot.

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:13.497
Ok, or here and...woosh woosh...woosh.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.710
Big load, tight shot

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.388
Not small load, big shot.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.012
So, play with that.

00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:22.537
Third tip: when you throw the uppercut,

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:25.211
pull down the back of the reverse side.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.073
So if I'm throwing a left uppercut

00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:31.348
Take this right shoulder. Pull it down.

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:33.814
Ok? Like this

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.266
Don't just fly up with it.

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:38.751
Pull down this side...woosh!

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.973
As if the shoulder coming around

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:42.846
will help you push the uppercut up.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.000
Same thing. When I throw a right uppercut

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.775
I imagine the shoulder comes down.

00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:49.565
Ok, just imagine.

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:52.300
I don't mean literally to expose your face like that

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.317
just imagine it.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.269
And those are some great powerful tips for the uppercut.

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.700
Give them a try, let me know.
