Hello, this is SkarmChikora, teaching you how to make a Basic Fusion out of Pokémon sprites!

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.860
First you need to get the Pokémon sprites you want to use,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.900
I will be using Quilava and Bayleef.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.780
First, take the elements of one of the Pokémon

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.440
I had to do some scratching around the Quilava's head, but that's OK.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.040
Next, add another element, make sure you have two elements at the least.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.400
Once you have added them (don't rush it like I'm doing), you can start to change the colours.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.340
Now as you can see, Quilava has three colours. Blue, that peachy colour, and the fire, whereas Bayleef only has two colours.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.760
If you reach a point like this, just go with which colour looks best. Do it twice if necessary.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.400
(Uum... I don't know what happened there. It's never happened before...)

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.820
Well, I personally prefer the one on the bottom right, so I'll use that one.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.540
Now, save the file as something you can easily find, like "Quilava/Bayleef Fusion" as opposed to "nkghlghlghler"

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.380
And then we have it done, right?

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.200
Possibly, but if you want to make the image transparent, I would recommend doing this!

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.540
Make all white on the Pokémon a shade slightly darker than white.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.720
Now you're done, good job, it's that easy! :D
