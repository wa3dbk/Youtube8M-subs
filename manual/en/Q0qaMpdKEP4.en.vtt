Hi, this is Stephanie Manley with CopyKat.com.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.550
I want to show you a cute
little recipe that I saw on Pinterest.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.050
It's to make Santa hats, and you
just need four ingredients.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.860
You need some white melting chocolate.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.300
This
also comes in big bricks that you can buy

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.140
in your baking section of your
grocery store.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.039
You're going to need some red decorator sugar.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.190
You're going
to need some mini marshmallows.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.330
And then, you're going to need some
pretzels.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.680
So, the first thing you need to do is make
a double boiler.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.940
And you can
simply take a bowl and put it on a pot of

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.530
boiling water, and heat up your
chocolate.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.790
So, once you've got your chocolate melted,
go ahead and take

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.210
your pretzels and set them out.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.509
And then we're going to go ahead and start
to make our Santa hats.

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.250
Well, all you need to do is take some of your
chocolate, and simply pour it

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.900
over two sections of your pretzel.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.439
And then, add your red sugar.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.509
And then
add a marshmallow.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.540
And there you go, that's all you need to do
to make

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.329
these cute little Santa hats.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.030
So, we've just made our Santa hats.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.460
You can see, once the chocolate sets up, you
can move these around.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.380
And
these make great little gifts or great little

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.200
snacks for your holiday
guests.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.640
So, please be sure to give this video a big
