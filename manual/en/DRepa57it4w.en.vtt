00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:18.380
This past winter we had a bucket loader that
dumped about 52 acres worth of limestone rip

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.290
rap on the bottom here in Pamlico sound to
serve as settlement substrate for oyster larvae.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:34.130
So what we did was we went out, these pieces
of rip rap have been piled up into mounds

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.410
that are sort of placed checkerboard fashion
on the sea floor. And so we have randomly

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.699
picked some of these mounds to sample. And
the way we sample for oysters is to after

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.100
we have randomly picked the mounds we place
a quadrant on the mounds and then divers excavate

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.249
those pieces if limestone rip rap We put them
in mesh bags, bring them up on the boat and

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.960
then we put them on what we call a culling
table where we spread them back out in the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.659
quadrant and then we start counting and measuring
the oysters that have settled on those pieces

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.710
of rip rap And we are seeing just incredibly
high numbers that probably settled in June

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.000
of this year.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.690
Oyster populations are at a historic lows
compared to a hundred years ago. So they are

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.640
a commercially important species. Served as
the backbone of the seafood industry in North

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:32.190
Carolina several centuries ago and serve as
critical habitat for fish and crabs and also

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.200
filter tremendous amount of water. So they
serve a lot of different functions. So creating

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.670
these reefs we are hoping that they will not
only perpetuate the reef here but then the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.380
larvae that are spawned from this reef will
be dispersed to other areas that are actually

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.460
open to fishing. This particular area is not
open to fishing.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.031
Well there is a tremendous amount of oyster
settlement as I just mentioned, but also a

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:56.660
tremendous amount of fish. So we are seeing
some sheepshead swimming around down there

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.700
that are recreationally important fish in
this size range. A lot of spot, a lot of croaker,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.280
flat fish swimming around. So within very
short order, within a matter of three months

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.970
these reefs are being utilized by fish.
