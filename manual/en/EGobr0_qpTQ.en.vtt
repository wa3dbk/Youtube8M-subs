00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.400
It looks like a tightly choreographed modern dance.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.400
But in reality it’s scientific experiments that will ensure better data connections...

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
- in next-generation mobile devices.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.800
Morten Christensen, RF Research Manager, Molex:
We’re trying to simulate normal use.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
This dancing around with prototypes is not normally how you do it.

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:28.406
But we are trying to use a handset 
 in different places and in different positions...

00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:33.085
- to see how you’ll experience things like throughput or general performance...

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.530
- in next-generation 4G LTE systems.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.590
Researchers from Aalborg University and antenna experts from U.S. electronics manufacturer Molex...

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.840
- are jointly taking measurements indoors and outside 
 in dense environments to ensure realistic results.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.190
And buildings play an important role.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200
Gert Frølund Pedersen, Professor, Aalborg University:
It really means a lot.

00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:04.151
We’ve figured out that the most difficult connections are 
 when you transmit to the outside from indoors.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.519
That's why we're in a location like this. It’s typical 
 of cities with a lot of tall buildings.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:13.801
The measurements are part of a four-year project with 
 support from the Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.900
It focuses on the convergence of the Internet, digital television, radio and mobile communications.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.540
Molex has a Danish research department with some of Europe's top mobile laboratories.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.720
But there is a good reason why the current 
 experiments are conducted out in the real world.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.760
It’s important that we include everything that affects this type of signal.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.280
If you only take measurements in a laboratory where everything 
 is clean and where there’s no outside interference...

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.640
- you get a misleading result. That’s what many of our competitors do.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We know that this has to be used in the real 
 world and so we need to include all factors.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.320
With 4G systems, this has a huge impact on the performance 
 you’ll experience as an end user of the product.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.900
- What we have here is our measuring equipment. 
 And it's actually a very advanced 4G phone.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.040
But as you can see, it's a completely 
 different size than it will end up.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.830
That’s why we can make one now. But it’s very 
expensive 
 and clumsy, and it uses a lot of power.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.540
We have some dedicated hardware that we made 
 ourselves,   plus some standard equipment.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.420
Everything is controlled by five computers.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.840
The measurements are some of the first in the world 
 without traditional cables connected to the prototype phones.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.620
Aalborg University and Molex have developed a solution that instead uses fiber optic cable...

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.300
- and this removes an important source of error.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.600
We have antennas in the corners and a small battery 
 here. And these are very thin optical fibers.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.040
One is for data and the other is for the channels.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.900
If you have a wire, it will act 
 as an antenna and influence the measurements.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.380
There are no radio signals sent out from the fibers, 
 so it 
works the same as when it’s assembled...

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.500
- with the battery and the transmitter/receiver.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.300
The immediate outcome of the measurements is an enormous amount of data...

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.800
- that must be handled before the researchers can 
 judge the quality of the tested prototypes.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:24.320
- We’ve produced several terabytes of data that have to be processed and analyzed.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.720
So it will take a little time to reach a conclusion for our part.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.160
Then it is up to the IT and mobile industry 
 to determine how quickly the results will benefit consumers.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.600
But things generally go quickly in this business.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.340
The cycle has become somewhat shorter.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.300
Especially now that the standard is here and we’re 
 beginning to see the new 4G system.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.980
So maybe it will only be six months.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.540
These are antennas that are expected to be in 
 the new 
devices that are already being designed.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.720
Now we are testing which of these are the best.
