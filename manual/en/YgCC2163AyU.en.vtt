The Harry Smith print shop

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.820
is our on campus letterpress print facility.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.420
We are really lucky to have this

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.910
resource on campus.  We are one of the few schools in the country that has an

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.779
on-campus

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.110
letterpress shop. You have a really
different relationship with language

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.640
when you're actually physically

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.510
having to set each letter and space. So
it definitely influenced my writing in that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.370
regard. It really helped me to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.500
pair down. To really get to the essential
qualities

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.040
of what I'm trying to express.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.910
I think performances is such an
important part love the creative process

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.260
and Naropa introduced me to performance

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.540
and now I feel more prepared and more
confidence

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.250
in my ability to perform and I think the
report does a really good job

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.110
giving people the strength to share
their voice

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.420
on a stage and not just on the page. Mom
agent is the student-run

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.189
literary journal for the Kerouac School.
Uh students can participate in a

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.759
variety of ways if they're

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.020
interested in publishing aspects and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.060
further learning journal production.
They can be a part of the editorial board.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.619
If you not so much interested in
furthering

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.659
your editorial skills or journal
production skills

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.840
there is also the opportunity to submit
or perhaps be solicited have your

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.920
stuff published.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.670
I think you should come to Naropa

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.229
because it will be unlike any other
educational experience out there

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.909
The contemplative education, the
summer writing program,

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.469
the sense of community being in Boulder
Colorado.

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.069
Having the opportunity to write and to
teach --

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.819
to hone your craft but also develop
yourself as an individual, as a human,

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.929
as an activist. I would recommend

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.959
the Jack Kerouac School to any writer

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.190
who really felt like their work

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.069
transcends the normal genre boundaries

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.129
of how people view poetry. How people view

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.250
prose and Naropa is really great

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.549
for a place to come and expand your
notions

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.650
of what the written word can do. Come
here

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.930
sit down, w in your notebook.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.830
Don't look away.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.360
