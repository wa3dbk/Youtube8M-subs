00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.260
Hey this is Dr K from imedicalschool.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.910
Today we are going to discuss a step 1 practice
question.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.660
So lets get started.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.890
The question is a 56 year old male with a
past medical history of hypertension, diabetes,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.779
and hyperlipidemia presents with new onset
painless jaundice without associated abdominal

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.779
pain.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.070
Vitals signs are normal.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.920
Basic labs are drawn and are shown.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:38.970
The total bilirubin is 9.2, Direct 7.8, albumin
is 3.8, ALT is 130, AST is 146, and alkaline

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.080
phosphatase is 405.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.830
What is the next best step for this patient.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:51.830
Is it A Hida Scan, B right upper quadrant
ultrasound, C ERCP, D IV antibiotics, or E

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.750
emergent cholecystectomy.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.030
Take a few moments and pause here to think
about the question and come up with your answer.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.150
Alright let's talk about the correct answer.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.460
The correct answer is right upper quadrant
ultrasound.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.299
Let's talk about why B is the best answer.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.030
Whenever someone presents with painless jaundice
it is cancer until proven otherwise.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.500
To identify the cause we need imaging.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.870
A HIDA scan is a very good test to identify
obstruction but given that it has greater

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.470
specificity and less sensitivity we generally
do a RUQ ultrasound.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.890
If the RUQ ultrasound is negative but the
clinical suspicion is high then we could consider

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.460
a HIDA scan.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.120
In terms of urgent surgery there is no need
for an emergent cholecystectomy as the patient

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.680
is normotensive and has no red flag signs
to indicate a cholecystectomy.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.250
IV antibiotics would be indicated if the patient
had cholangitis.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.080
Cholangitis usually presents wight the symptoms
and signs in Charcot's triad or Reynold's

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.340
pentad.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.620
Charcot's triad is fever, right upper quadrant
pain and jaundice.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.549
Reynold's pentad is chariot's triad plus hypotension
and altered mental status.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.009
Given the patient does not meet these criteria
antibiotics should not be administered

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.760
Finally lets talk about ERCP.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.720
ERCP is a procedure that can identify blockages
of the biliary tract from stones or masses

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.350
and then open up those blockages.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.350
Before obtaining an ERCP you need an ultrasound
to identify the location and the likely cause

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.390
of the obstruction.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.470
This is why before doing an intervention we
generally obtain a RUQ ultrasound given it

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.330
is a cheap non interventional test that can
provide a great deal of information.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.950
So when anyone presents with jaundice we generally
know that the biliary tract or liver is being

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.480
affected in some way so the first step is
almost always to obtain a RUQ ultrasound.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.510
Lets talk about how to interpret abnormal
liver function tests.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.900
If a patient has a transaminitis, that is
an elevated AST and ALT, we need to determine

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.040
if the patient has a cholestatic or noncholestatic
liver pattern.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.800
Cholestatic means there is an obstruction,
either from a gall stone, mass, stricture

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.670
or inflammation.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.650
Noncholestatic generally indicates a process
that is affecting the liver and not the biliary

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.750
tract.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.090
Let's briefly review the biliary tract.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.370
The liver empties into the hepatic duct and
the gallbladder empties into the cystic duct,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.560
with both creating the common bile duct.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.780
The pancreas empties into the common bile
duct which empties into the duodenum.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.340
When there is an obstruction in the CBD or
hepatic duct this can lead to a transaminitis

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.260
with an elevated alkaline phosphatase.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.489
Now the biggest question is how to differentiate
between a noncholestatic and cholestatic liver

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.569
pattern.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.180
To differentiate between these patterns look
at the alkaline phosphatase.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.290
If a alkaline phsophatase is significantly
higher than the levels of transaminases I

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.360
generally consider this to be a cholestatic
picture.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.260
If not then it is noncholestatic.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.120
Now remember biliary obstruction is not the
only part of the body that can cause an elevation

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.730
in alkaline phosphatase.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.580
ALP can be increased by anything that affects
gut, bone, and uterus.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.449
We can identify biliary versus other causes
by obtaining a GTT.

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.020
If the GGT is high this indicates that the
ALP is likely due to biliary obstruction.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.509
In addition we can also identify if the ALP
is of biliary origin if we fractionate the

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:29.509
ALP.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:36.289
Fractionating the ALP identifies how much
ALP comes from bone, gut, uterus,or the biliary

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.289
tree.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.289
Lets briefly review the biliary anatomy.

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:45.680
In todays' s case we have elevated ALT and
AST with an elevated ALP higher than the transaminases

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.059
with jaundice indicating a cholestatic pattern.

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:54.699
So remember jaundice workup almost always
begins with a RUQ ultrasound.

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.740
