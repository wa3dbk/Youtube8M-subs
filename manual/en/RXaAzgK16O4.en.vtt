00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.700
Welcome to the demo of Gamooga
Second Screen.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.290
Gamooga Second Screen is a realtime
support solution for e-commerce companies

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.030
to discover, understand and engage their
customers in realtime.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.120
We have setup a sample store fully
integrated with Gamooga Second Screen

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.510
for the purpose of this demo.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.540
In this demo

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.210
we will show you three major features of
Gamooga Second Screen.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.910
First is realtime events, second is the
realtime screen mirror and third critical activity alerts.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.950
This is the support agent's dashboard
showing realtime events.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.980
Realtime events are nothing but different
activites that occur on your website.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.530
We use these events to segregate your
visitors into different event tables as per their

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.990
activity and more notably where they are
in your purchase funnel.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.520
You can also customize these events
based on your products and visitor base.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.810
In this video, our demo store has six
visitors online.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.920
"Started session" table shows you all the
visitor sessions along with

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.070
the referrer, location of the visitor and
other details

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.660
"Visited page" table shows you the pages
being viewed

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.000
along with the URL and the title of the
page.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.100
"Searched" event shows you list of all the
searches made on your website along

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.640
with the search term.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.940
"Cart add" and "Cart remove" table show
you the products being added and removed

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.800
to carts along with the product name and
cost.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.590
"Checkout" table shows you visitors
checking out currently on your website

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.700
along with the total number of items and
amount.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.050
"Checkout error" table shows you all the
visiotrs who are facing problems during checkout.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.500
"Started session" and "Visited page" are
provided by default.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.900
All the other events are customized by us
for the demo store.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.590
Similarly you can add as many such
events as required to your dashboard

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.850
to get deepest possible insights into your
visitor activity.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.360
Whenever there is activity on the website
by any visitor

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.230
these event tables are updated in
realtime to reflect the latest activity.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.400
You can see that as one of the visitors
searches for 'top', it instantly appears in

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.370
the 'searched' table.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.430
As he is browsing through the website
you can also see that the 'visited page' table

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.170
is updated in realtime according to his
activity.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.030
Now let me talk about the screen mirror
functionality.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.630
This functionality helps you view any of
your customers' screen in realtime.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.770
You can view all the mouse movements,
mouse clicks, page navigations  made by

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.710
the visior on your website in realtime.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:51.940
The part with in the brown border is the
visitor's screen. It shows exactly what

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.470
the visitor is viewing at the current
moment.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.530
The red pointer is the visitor's mouse.
Any click is shown as a red circle around

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.190
the pointer.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.840
Page navigations are also shown with a
proper spinner.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:17.600
All text typed in text boxes is also
reflected at the agent.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.810
Infact every interaction of the visitor is
shown to all the agents in realtime.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.210
Visitors can also initiate a chat session
with the agent using the chat widget at

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.970
the bottom of the screen.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.160
This functionality is highly useful in the
situations when you need to quickly

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.940
understand your customers' problem and
support them in realtime.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.650
We see that one of our visitors has
removed an item from cart.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.660
So lets chat with him to understand if he
requires any support in choosing a product.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.020
The next and more important feature is
the critical activity alerts.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.180
These are alerts shown at the agents
when ciritical events happen at the visitor.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.190
Examples would be: cart abandonment,
checkout form errors, payment gateway

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.860
issues, repeated search with no results,
etc.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.740
You can configure these alerts in our
admin panel or using our API.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.490
For demo purpose, we have configured
an alert for checkout error greater than

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.850
5000 dollars.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:05:00.700
Now let me make my cart value more
than 5000 dollars and proceed to checkout.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.650
Let me now do an invalid login with
empty username and password.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.920
You can see that a proactive chat
immediately appears at the visitor and

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
simultaneously an alert is shown at the
agent informing him about the checkout error.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.000
Now the visitor and agent can engage in
a chat session to resolve the issue.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.350
That is all for this demo, hope you have
found the product exciting.
