Your comments always make me happy.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I call your comments

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
"love letters"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Please give me your "love letters" on my videos. (just kidding :)

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
well, today's snack time.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I ordered this.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Can you see it?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"Busu no kobu"

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's a snack called "Busu no kobu".

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This "Busu no kobu" is made by a snack company "Sawagiku" in Iwate prefecture.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Masa-san of MarkTubeJapan Channel, a subscriber of my videos, told me about this snack.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
like this... a illustration of a crab.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I think this is the first time I eat a snack from Iwate.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
this is kind of interesting.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I heard these grains are shaped like crab spawns.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I can't imagine how "Busu no kobu" taste like. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
a very unique name.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
good! :)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
bean jam and black sesame.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Iwate has been affected by the earthquake, but they are doing their best.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I want to support them so much.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
"Busu no kobu" seems to be famous in Iwate.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I ordered this through the internet.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It tooks only a few days to arrive.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
everyone try to check it out and consider ordering.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Why don't you have a "Busu no kobu" party?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
post a video response about your party :)

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Thank you so much, Masa-san.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
take care, everyone.
