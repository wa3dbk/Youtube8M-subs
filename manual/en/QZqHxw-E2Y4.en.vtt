00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.450
Are fashion dolls and pretty princesses harmful
to girls? Do we need to dismantle the pink

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
aisle in our toy stores? That’s coming up
next on the Factual Feminist.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.200
I’m Caroline Kitchens, in for Christina
Hoff Sommers. You may have heard of GoldieBlox,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.200
a toy company which aims to replace toys like
Hello Kitty and Barbie with vocationally responsible

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.460
toys that will supposedly inspire girls to
become engineers. As toys, GoldieBlox has

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.909
received mixed reviews. But gender activists
&amp; journalists are thrilled by their aggressive,

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:46.030
girl-power commercials. For them, rescuing
girls from a toxic “princess culture”

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.329
is an urgent priority. GoldieBlox’s latest
commercial shows a spunky girl with a hammer

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.219
and overalls rebelling against an Orwellian
“Big Sister.” 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.969
GoldieBlox says that its new toy will “break
the mold”--it is a figurine of a pretty,

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.660
blonde-haired girl with pink sneakers and
a hammer. Not exactly paradigm shifting. But

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.110
let’s take a look at the message and facts
behind GoldieBlox’s campaign.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.280
GoldieBlox’s website notes that only 14%
of engineers are female. It’s true that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.420
girls have far outpaced boys academically—including
in many of the sciences—but engineering

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.770
is one field that continues to be dominated
by men 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.120
We can’t know for sure what explains the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.910
gap, but GoldieBlox insists that it has something
to do with the all those pink girly toys.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.420
According to the commercial, “fashion dolls
teach girls to value beauty over brains.”

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.020
Is that really true? Industry researchers
agree that toy store aisles have become more

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.460
segregated by gender over the past few decades.
But during the same time period, girls have

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.010
made huge gains in education. Women now earn
a majority of all degrees—bachelors, Masters,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.190
and doctorates. As for STEM fields, women
now earn 44% of college math degrees, 48%

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.569
of chemistry degrees, and 61% of biology degrees.
Does Goldiebox have a shred of evidence that

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.180
fashion dolls are holding girls back?
The GoldieBlox executives cite one study which

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.600
claims to show that girls who play with Barbie
see fewer career options for themselves than

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.930
girls who play with Mr. Potato Head. But the
study had a small sample size—only 37 girls—and

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.420
the researchers asked girls about career expectations
immediately after they played with the toys

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.200
for only 5 minutes. There’s no way to know
the long-term effects of playing with fashion

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.040
dolls. The GoldieBlox creators don’t mention
that the same study also asked the girls how

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.959
many Barbies they own and how frequently they
play with them. Researchers found that these

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.480
variables did not substantially change the
girls’ career expectations.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.750
I applaud efforts to get more girls interested
in engineering. Girls should know that they

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.990
can become anything they want to be. But the
problem with GoldieBlox’s ad is that it

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.209
does not merely encourage girls to be engineers;
it shames millions of girls who like fashion

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.870
dolls and pretty shoes. It teaches them that
they have to make a choice between beauty

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.040
and brains. That’s a false dichotomy, and
it sends a destructive message. Girls who

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.800
like pink, sparkly toys can also aspire to
be brilliant engineers someday.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.099
There’s also something ironic about the
1984 theme of the ad. Toy stores have a pink

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.989
aisle because little girls like it. And when
you give customers what they want, you make

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.860
a profit. Toy companies just want to sell
toys. They are not on a fanatical Orwellian

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.849
mission to re-engineer gender preferences.
On the other hand, the GoldieBlox creators

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.950
are the ones who want to re-socialize little
girls according to some hardline feminist

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.510
gender-correct blueprint.
The creators of GoldieBlox will reply that

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.940
girls only like dolls because of cultural
norms. They’ll say that they aren’t out

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.870
to re-socialize girls, but to liberate them
from arbitrary and damaging stereotypes of

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.030
But what if a little girl does
not want to be liberated from her preferences?

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.010
Of course, culture influences how children
play. But it is scientifically illiterate

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.889
to deny that biology plays a role in children’s
play preferences. The female attraction to

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.650
dolls and the male attraction to gadgets hold
cross-culturally and even cross-species—where

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.880
they can be seen in our close relatives, the
vervet and rhesus monkeys. For a more in-depth

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.440
look, I recommend reading Christina’s 2012
piece in the Atlantic.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.770
Of course parent should encourage their children
to try different types of toys, and they should

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.590
be tolerant of children who prefer toys associated
with the other sex. But the same goes for

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.310
kids who prefer conventional play. At a certain
point, you have to respect their choices.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.760
The GoldieBlox video goes wrong when it belittles
and shames little girls who want to play princess.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.850
A toy store with only gender neutral toys
might please Big Sister – and the other

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.850
gender monitors at GoldieBlox—but it would
disappoint millions of children.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.949
What do you think about GoldieBlox’s new
ad? Should parents be worried if their daughters

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.630
like fashion dolls more than tool kits? Let
us know what you think on twitter or in the

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.410
comments section. Thank you for watching the
Factual Feminist.
