00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.990
My name is Aaron Sumrall, I'm a County Extension
Agent for Texas AgriLife Extension as part

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.170
of the Texas A&amp;M University system.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.080
I'm right now currently in San Jacinto County,
and I'm also a PhD candidate at Texas A&amp;M

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.449
University in College Station.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.920
One of the main things that you may have a
problem with as far as non-target is not necessarily

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.910
a wildlife species but it is domestic livestock.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.250
Domestic livestock sometimes can present quite
a headache in feral hog management removal

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.030
operations because of the curiosity of the
animal or it may be a stress time of the year

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.190
and the bait that you're using is something
that they can use readily, and one way that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.049
we can repel that problem is thinking about
that problem before it presents an issue.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.710
That basically can be alleviated by the shape
of the trap or the size of the trap, the dimensions

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.699
of the trap, and the one that we use the most
whenever trapping around livestock is this

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.370
design that we have right here.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.640
Basically what it is is it's a clover leaf
lobed front of the trap, and what that does,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.780
it creates a funnel into the entry point of
a trap.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.320
If you have a livestock problem, the cameras
again are going to tell you what your problem

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.320
is with non-targets.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.180
If you have a livestock problem, know the
problem.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.270
Is it a calf, is it a horse, is it a cow,
what's the problem there?

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.550
Then you can easily address that issue just
with making sure that the trap is lobed in

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.680
a specific way, and use the same line post
that you would use to slide that post in at

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.280
the height of whatever that non-target species
is to repel it.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.620
If it's a horse, and it's a problem with them
maybe knocking out the trip board trigger,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.200
if it's a horse you just put the post higher,
and you can keep those animals out with the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.500
spade hooking into the panel, and whenever
it comes time to check the trap or re bait

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.150
it, these can be removed easily, and they're
out of your way.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.600
The next thing on non-targets, another thing
that's going to dictate to me, whenever I

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.190
do trapping, is based off of that camera for
non-target species is the trigger that I'm

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.220
going to use.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.330
The camera is going to tell me what trigger
I'm going to use, where in this situation

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.659
here, if the deer are the primary non-target
species that are giving us an issue, a problem,

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.840
or a handicap on our trapping efforts, is
I will hang the bait.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.499
What I mean by hang the bait is what you do
is you put your bait in your bucket, set it

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:36.969
on any type of wood, firewood block, cinder
block or anything like that, the idea being

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.019
that the deer, whenever they come in, they're
not destructive in their feeding habits typically.

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.400
What the idea is is that they'll pick up a
little bit of your feed, the bait before they

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.310
get there, they can pick up a little bit out
of your bucket, and exit the trap without

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.739
tripping the string.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:58.290
Al the while, the hogs in their feeding habits,
once they smell that bait in that trigger,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.269
whenever they knock the bait bucket off the
post, it'll collapse that trigger.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.799
You're going to avoid, in this trap trigger
situation, you're going to avoid some of your

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.459
problems with the deer, and almost all of
your problems with birds, and the reason for

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.239
that on birds, whenever they sit on your trip
string, and the other design we'll show you,

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.090
they'll sit on your trip string and collapse
your board.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.540
Whereas this, they can sit on this trip string
all day long, and it just forces the trigger

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.599
mechanism even more firm into the gate.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.239
But this is the design that we'll use whenever
we have deer as the main non-target that we

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.909
want to avoid, and we'll use the extra line
post to cross the gate whenever livestock

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:41.909
is an issue.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.340
The next trigger we'll talk about will be
whenever you have smaller mammalian species

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.669
such as raccoons and opossums as the non-target
that we need to avoid.

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.480
We'll get on that now.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.129
This is another design, another option in
triggering mechanisms that you may want to

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.239
incorporate, and this one is going to be used
whenever you have raccoons or opossums as

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.699
far as a non-target species that's giving
us a problem in our trapping.

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.930
What this basically is is just the trip string
which goes across.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.100
One of the first things you want to do is
you want to put your trip string as far to

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.150
the back of the trap as you can.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.940
Now what this trip string will do is this
trip string will allow you to set the string

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.470
above the height of the non-target species
like the raccoons or the opossums or anything

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.470
like that.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.040
It could even be piglets.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.780
Whenever feral hogs feed, most of the time
whenever there's a readily available food

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.800
source, the piglets are going to be the first
ones to feed.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.070
So when the piglets come in they can stay
under, while the more trap-shy individuals

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.070
on the outside have time to work their way
in.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.100
What it is basically is it's a trip string
that through the legs of the animal collapses

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.130
the board, it trips the trigger.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.420
The reason we do not use this trigger whenever
we have deer as a problem is deer will trip

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.810
the trigger just like the feral hogs will.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.610
So that's why we don't use this.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.120
Another issue on this one is this break board
that we have right here, it's just a board

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.860
that's hinged in the middle, is that whenever
birds land on this string, it will collapse

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.860
that board.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.440
So if you have birds as an issue, the other
type of triggering mechanism in the front

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.380
may be what you want to look at.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.450
Another issue that we need to think about
is on the trip string itself.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.850
The cameras again are going to tell us what
the size of that trip string needs to be.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.920
If you have larger sounders of animals, sounders
can be up to 30 individuals maybe more, you

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.650
want to make sure that you catch as many of
those animals as you can obviously.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.460
What you do is you put that trip string further
to the back of the trap, and then make sure

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.180
it's only in a small area.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.470
Where this trip string is the area is only
about 4 foot wide.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.680
The reason for this is that the shorter the
width of the trip string, if you've got larger

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.860
sounders you want as many animals in there
before they interact with that trip string

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.970
as you can.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.330
Whereas if you have a solitary boar or a small
sounder of only a few individuals, you put

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.650
your trip string across the entire back of
the trap going from wall to wall, that way

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.900
you know that that animal or that small sounder
is going to interact with that trip string.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.020
So small sounders, the trip string needs to
be wide.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.680
You may not even want to go all they way across
the back, you may want to set it a little

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.680
to the front.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.340
If the sounders are larger, the narrower the
trip string.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:32.300
So, the cameras again will tell you what you
need to do on that, but as far as any triggering

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.110
mechanism, if you have anything that you're
confident in and it works for you, stay with

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.400
what works for you because if you don't have
any confidence in it, typically you're not

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.400
going to use it.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.419
So, find what works for you, don't be afraid
to change, and enjoy trapping hogs.
