00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.440
There are, unfortunately, no shortage 
of lawsuits that need to be brought

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.609
to better enforce environmental law. There's
no shortage of need to represent the public

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.900
interest in trying to strengthen environmental
law and environmental policies.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.660
PEAC fills a great niche by providing
representation to people that wouldn't otherwise

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.750
be able to afford representation in 
environmental issues.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.140
We do a wide variety of cases involving
pollution, water pollution, air pollution,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.700
protection of endangered species, and other
natural resource and land management issues.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.540
So we try to get our students as involved
as possible in all aspects of the cases. They

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:10.529
work on very complex litigation, from a federal
court of appeals to a city task force on

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:14.119
toxic air quality, and kind of everything in between.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.979
When I was working on the appeal
in front of the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals,

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.359
I helped write the brief, and then I also
got to argue in front of the Board. I had

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:31.039
five minutes to make the argument on behalf
of the interveners, and so that was an outstanding

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.350
experience that not a lot of students get.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.069
And because you work closely with
the PEAC attorneys, you're treated as a junior

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.619
attorney. It's not just like you're a law
student who's just kind of doing some research

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.520
and throwing it to them; you're drafting things,
you're writing motions, you're working on

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.490
reports and editing them. And then you just
have the supervision by the PEAC attorneys.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.340
So it's a great experience to kind of get
the real, live experience of what litigation

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.799
is like.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.359
We have been involved in litigation
challenging the operation of the dams,

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:14.359
the hydropower dams on the Columbia and Snake
River, for many years, and our work with

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:23.049
Earth Justice has resulted in additional measures
to protect salmon at those dams. For example,

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:29.810
spilling water over the dams that allows juvenile
salmon to bypass the turbines and avoid death

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.840
or injury that way.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.640
Especially in the clean water context
there'ss been a lot of big cases. In the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.670
ESA context, PEAC has represented people on
protecting lots of endangered species.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.230
And in the Clear Air Act context, we're working
very hard to increase PEAC's representation

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.230
of local neighborhood groups, doing work with
urban air toxics, which is kind of an underserved

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.180
aspect of the Clean Air Act and environmental
law in general.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.590
As much as it is a program, a pretty
well-established clinic, it still has the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.000
feel of sort of like a grass-roots organization
of lawyers trying to make a difference.
