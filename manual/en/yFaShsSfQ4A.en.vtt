00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.070
CL's signature make up looks all involve some
seriously crazy eyeliner.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.750
This makeup look was inspired by CL's lady-like
look from her MV the baddest female.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:34.250
The point of this look is the bold geometric
cat liner, facial contouring for a sharp look

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.880
as well as nude lips.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.880
Lets start

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.210
Step 1, apply foundation

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.980
We begin this look by applying bb cream.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.160
Make sure it's the moisturising type, and
buff it in with a brush.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.440
You want to apply concealor to any areas that
need a bit more coverage.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590
Step 2 Apply eyeshadow

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.980
Use a gold shadow and apply it all over your
lids.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.560
You then want to create some dimension by
using a highlighting colour and blend it on

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.080
the middle of your lids at the roundest point
and blend it up to your brow bone.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.280
You now want to create a deep set look by
using a dark brown shadow on the inner crease

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.220
line of your lids as well as all along your
lower lids.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.940
Extend the dark shadow out from your lower
lids in a straight line across.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.920
This will run parallel to the eyeliner you
will draw on later.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.080
Step 3 geometric cat Eyeliner

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.830
Now the most important part of this look is
the eyeliner.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.300
Start from the inner corner of your eye and
line your top lid.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.560
I have tried to make it thinner in the middle
because my eyes are quite round, so building

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.950
up volume in the inner corners and outer corners
will help my eyes look more catlike.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.770
You can just line your eyelids evenly if your
eyes are more catlike to begin with.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.900
Now extent you eyeliner out a bit past the
corner of your eye.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.700
Now use a dot to mark the end of your cat
liner.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.660
This point is a little bit above the top of
your eye and out.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.060
No use your eyeliner and join this dot with
the eyeliner you already drew.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.700
Create a triangle and fill this in to create
the geometric cat liner.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.860
Step 4 Eyebrows.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.590
To create CL's natural shaped thick eyebrows
use a brow mascara and a eyebrow pencil and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.260
fill in your natural brow shape.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.925
Step 5 lashes Curl your lashes and apply mascara
on the top and bottom lashes, we want to focus

00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:23.260
on the eyeliner so it's best of avoid heavy
lashes which may detract from the liner.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Step 6 Nude lips.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.480
Nude lips is a signature part of this look,
so choose a nude lip colour and apply it to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.480
your lips.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480
Use a dab of gloss to add some life into your
lips.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.319
Step 7 Contour your face

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.500
Now to create a more fierce look we will contour
our face.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.769
Use a contour brush and a powder thats slightly
darker then your skin tone and apply it just

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.820
under your cheekbones to create a shadow.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.820
If you don't know where this is you can suck
your cheeks in, and this will give you a guide.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.389
Also use your fingers to contour your nose,
from your eyebrows draw a line straight down

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:55.950
and around the tip of your nose with you finger,
and blend it out slightly.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.409
Now we've created the shadows lets highlight
our face to create a more 3d look.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.749
Use a highlighting colour and apply it on
the bridge of your nose, in the middle of

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.180
your forehead and on your cheeks in a "C"
shape.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.639
Also apply the highlighting colour to the
middle of your chin.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.420
Step 8 Hair

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.199
CL's hair is created by pulling half of your
hair back and securing it with a hair tie

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.819
and bobby pins.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.659
You can tease it to give more volume at the
top but CL is actually wearing a wig.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.680
Remember to leave a section of your fringe.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.019
Curl the piece of fringe at the front with
a curling iron and you have her elegant half

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.769
up half down hairstyle down pat.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:39.769
And now we're done!

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.090
You should totally feel like the baddest female
right now.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.150
This look is super sexy and fierce, wear it
with a funky hip hop style outfit or a sexy

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.639
tight bandage dress and some killer heels.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.349
Don't forget to pair this look with a smile.
