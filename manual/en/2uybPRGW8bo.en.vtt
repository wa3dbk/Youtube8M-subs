00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:32.189
There are people who get really excited about
a console's power, you know?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.440
The technical specs, the processing power...that
kind of stuff is really important to them.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.050
Frankly, I'm not that kind of guy.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.579
I'm the kind of guy who chooses lady characters,
because they're more fun to look at.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.829
I name them Sigourney Beaver.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.469
As seen on home video.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:01.809
Then I sat down to play Defiance, an ambitious
shooter that tries to bring an MMO experience

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.140
to consoles.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.040
Emphasis on "tries."

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.070
Defiance runs so poorly, it makes the PlayStation
3—a luxury import, as consoles go—seem

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.090
like a 1984 Ford Tempo.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.590
I'm not that kind of guy, but even I thought...

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:27.680
"Wait, the PS3 can do a lot better 
than this."

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.040
I'll tell what other kind of guy I am not.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.040
An MMO guy.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.409
I thought Defiance was just some terrible
show on the SyFy channel.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.799
And I only knew that because of all the commercials
they ran during SmackDown.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.950
SyFy was mixing aliens with my Daniel Bryan,
it was the worst!

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.100
Speaking of the worst...I'm tapping out, guys.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.700
With this framerate.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.030
See, that's what defines Defiance more than
anything else.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.229
More than its cool story about the future
of Earth, more than its gameplay, more than

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.109
Sigourney Beaver...it's the fact that Defiance
is a veritable smorgasbord of glitches, bugs

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.480
and clunkity clunk.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.859
There were times when, all the sudden, the
game just freaked out...like I was pushing

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.500
a million buttons at once.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.469
Menus are popping up, I'm crouching...all
without pushing the buttons to do those things.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:39.249
And somehow, it happened, like, more than
once.

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:44.129
Of course, sometimes the game's technical
tomfoolery works to your advantage.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.640
Like...having trouble with a group of enemies?

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.419
Hey, just walk backwards.

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.280
Eventually, they'll just disappear.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.519
That way you can wait, let your health regenerate...and
then walk back forward again.

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.519
And don't worry.

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.129
Your foes will be right where you left them.

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.699
So obviously, you take those technical issues,
you add the other technical issues, Defiance

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.730
starts to fall apart a bit.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.730
Or a lot.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.640
And it's a bummer, because...when things worked,
I had fun with Defiance.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.269
The shooting mechanics are perfectly fine,
and the game gives you plenty of stuff to

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.269
do.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.940
Tons of side quests, in addition to the main
missions, as well as a healthy list of multiplayer

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:37.829
options.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.359
Thing is, though, even when the game is clicking...Defiance
is never all that great.

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.129
Again, the missions and side quests are great
in number, but not in design.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.139
Most are pretty paint-by-numbers in their
approach.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.230
And you know, the leveling up is kinda weak,
too.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.479
It's neither tangible in game or intuitive
to use.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:04:05.459
It's no surprise that Defiance is much better
when playing others, but even then...it's

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.589
hardly exceptional, thanks to a bit of generic
design and a lot of technical issues.

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:16.370
It's a game that feels a bit aimless...like,
it wants to be this ambitious console-based

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.150
MMO, but it just doesn't have enough ideas
to back up that ambition.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.230
Or enough polish, for that matter.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:44.760
It's not a bad game, but...Defiance has some
sh*t to buff out.
