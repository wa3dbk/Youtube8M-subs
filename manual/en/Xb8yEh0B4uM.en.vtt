00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.269
Our cookies are in the oven now and we're
going to set the timer for 8 to 10 minutes.

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:15.340
Those are very small cookies and they'll bake
pretty fast. We see lot's of times beautiful

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:25.020
large cookies these days, big expensive ones.
You can make those by taking a larger spoon

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:37.260
and you just want to set a few of them to
a pan because these will be very big. These

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.109
are the one's that you see in Starbucks for
about a $1.75 or you can also buy these in

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:55.850
the lobby at the Lantern Theater during intermission
for about $2 and they are big and they're

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.239
beautiful. Those are really big ones and we're
going to make a few and we're going to make

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:10.570
a few others that are a little bit more moderate
size,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.960
but of course you need to space these farther
apart because they do expand and they need

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.390
to stay in the oven for more than 8 to 10
minutes of course. What you don't want to

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.610
do is put very, very different sizes on the
same pan together, because they'll be cooking

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:44.660
at different rates of speed and the cookies
that are tiny ones, if they're on the same

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.300
pan they'll be done long before the other
ones are finished. Try to make them uniform

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:01.041
in size and also in shape, although it should
be remembered that they are artist in the

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:09.310
cookies and so they didn't come out of some
sort of factory, they're handmade and there

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.970
will be variations in each cookie.
