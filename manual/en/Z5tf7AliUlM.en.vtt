00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:06.089
Today on our 2014 Chevrolet Cruze Sedan, we&amp;#39;re
going to install part number C11282, from

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.089
Curt.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.090
This is what the hitch looks like once it&amp;#39;s
installed on the vehicle.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.500
Next we&amp;#39;ll give you some measurements
that will help you out in selecting some accessories,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.150
such as a bicycle rack or cargo carrier.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.440
From the top of the receiver opening down
to the ground will be about 10 3/4 inches.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.750
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
edge of the bumper will be about 6 1/2 inches.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:01:42.830
Now we&amp;#39;ll show you how the hitch is installed.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:02:33.519
First we&amp;#39;ll show 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:53.829
you where 
your 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:04:28.540
hitch mounts up on 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.950
the frame.
