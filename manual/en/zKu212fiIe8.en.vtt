00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.360
Okay so now we're gonna start on foundation,
and like I said earlier this look is more

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.200
mat. You don't want anything shiny, dooey,
iridescent cause the camera picks up everything.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.580
And if you use a shiny or dooey foundation
your gonna look to glowy. So you want to keep

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.750
to a matte, this is a pretty light foundation
and it doesn't have any iridescence to it.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.080
It's completely, ooh I'm sorry, it's completely
matte, and you want to use a little more than

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.370
you normally use for everyday purposes. And
this is the time where you want to cover any

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.489
blemishes. My model doesn't have any, but
if you have any you wanna just a little add

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.989
a little more foundation to blemishes, and
you wanna really just smooth it onto the skin,

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.809
buff it onto the skin. This is the time where
you use foundation all over the skin. You

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.429
don't just want to use it in certain little
areas where you need it, you want it all over.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:06.850
You want your whole face to look smooth and
blended. And because you're gonna be on camera

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.490
you want to use a little more than normal
just to make sure everything is covered and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.270
everything looks smooth. If you don't use
enough makeup on camera you're gonna really

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.640
notice it. You're gonna look like you have
nothing on, and you're not gonna like the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.060
way your pictures turned out. So even though
you're using natural makeup you just want

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.920
to use a little more of it than normal. Under
the eyes, never neglect under the eyes. You

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.060
can use your foundation as a concealer or
if you have a separate concealer that's fine

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.430
also, it's all personal preference. Make sure
you take it down the neck just a tiny bit,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.479
just blend blend blend. Make sure it's all
blended in, you can always add more where

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.149
needed. I like to go on the eyelid a little
bit also just to make a nice clean pallet,

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:09.940
clean base for the eyeshadow. Just make everything
look really smooth and even. And then once

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.940
the foundation's on you just wanna powder
your skin lightly just to help the foundation

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.020
stay, and to make everything look smooth.
You don't want to use a tremendous amount

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.140
of powder because you don't want your skin
to look powdery or dry, but just blend the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.550
powder. Buff it into the skin and it will
just really smooth out the look and make the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.740
foundation stay. I like to powder the lips
as well. Stay away from powder around the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.852
eyes, that can make the eyes look a little
crappy or accentuate wrinkles. And there we

00:02:45.852 --> 00:02:47.569
go. Now we're ready to apply some color.
