00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:03.940
It's not you, it's your avatar.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:12.670
Get ready for a new kind of data dump.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.950
People have more choice about who to date
and marry than ever before.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.660
Things like the Internet and transportation
give us unprecedented access to potential

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.720
mates.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.589
So now the question is how do you choose?

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.580
Online dating sites have been trying to take
the guess work out of dating for years.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.940
Basically they're trying to match up two people
based upon shared interests.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.370
They might ask you a series of questions to
get your likes and dislikes, or give you a

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.520
survey and then base your compatibility with
someone else on that.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.590
But this does not take into account little
things like, let's say your favorite book

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.570
of all time is War and Peace, but really you
only skimmed it back in college.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.620
Some sites have taken upon themselves to start
looking at what they call "revealed preferences."

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.750
What's going on is they're looking at every
single profile you click or breeze on by and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.210
feed that information into a special algorithm.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.460
Now over time this algorithm gets to know
more about you than maybe you do.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.780
For example, you might not be aware that you
have a thing for english teachers, or perhaps

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.490
you're subtly turned off by people who like
sushi.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.320
But the algorithm knows.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.550
It's like you've been dating it all this time.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.260
Creepy, huh?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.659
Well, just like some people's relationship
status on Facebook - it's complicated.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.440
And it's only going to get more so.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.260
It's the year 2050 and you're a swinging bachelor
or bachelorette out on the town.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.119
Your online dating profile now uses an algorithm
that analyzes all of your online activity.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.740
What you buy, which social media posts you
like, who you follow on Twitter, where you

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.119
get your news.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.909
It has analyzed pictures of you using facial
recognition and even uses your genetic information

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.950
to suggest matches with dissimilar immune
systems.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.010
All you do is whip out your super smart phone,
send a message to a match in your vicinity,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.410
and meet up.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.769
From there, things are pretty much the same
as they've always been.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.790
Sparks fly or they don't.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.870
Maybe it means that we end up changing ourselves
more and more for our potential partners.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.670
We've already got plastic surgery, but what
could be next?

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.190
Maybe genetic modification.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.400
Maybe you hear she likes brown eyes instead
of blue.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.569
Are you willing to take drastic measures?

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.790
Or perhaps the whole dating world just moves
into the virtual sphere.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.260
Next thing you know you've got an avatar representing
you that changes over time as your partner's

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.510
preferences change.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.360
Maybe you think love stinks, I'm not into
data dating.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.230
Well, at least you'll have time to finally
finish reading War and Peace.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.270
I got a question for everyone out there.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.270
How much data would you be willing to share,
if it meant that you could get a date out

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.440
of it in the process?

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.489
Let us know in the comments.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.260
