00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.080
Today on our 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee, were
going to install the Tow Ready T1 Connector,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.080
part number 118425.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.840
First, were going to need to access the rear
cargo area.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.040
Then were going to go ahead and remove the
rear tail light assemblies.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.539
Each assembly has two fasteners holding it
in position.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.529
Well need to pry the center out of the plastic
pushpin fasteners.

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.480
Were going to get each of them started with
a small pocket screwdriver then Ill use a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.359
larger screwdriver to really get that center
pried out so that we can release the fastener.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.450
Carefully, pull and wiggle the tail light
assembly so it disconnects from the body.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.780
There are several alignment tabs that you
cannot see until you remove it.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.630
Next, to make it a little easier, I'm going
to go ahead and remove bolt connectors to

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.630
the tail light assembly.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.850
To do this, well simply unlock the red locking
tab, press down on the lock connection, and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.700
disconnect it from the tail light assembly.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:03:07.800
The smaller plug, its 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:31.380
a 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:46.340
black locking tab.
