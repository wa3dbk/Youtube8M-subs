00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
 Hello Youtube friends 

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.500
 in this little video 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.500
 I will show how the knot and a half ago to weave fishing net 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:08.799
 good we take our rule 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.599
 and the needle 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.900
 We grabbed the mesh always below 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.900
 we will help with your thumb 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.899
 and then in index 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.399
 we stand and take two wires 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.399
 then you 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.399
 and we will pull 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.899
 thus we have the knot and a half 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.300
 now we go with another demonstration 

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:42.799
 always below the network behind 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.899
 and we help each finger 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.899
 two wires 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.900
 Bouncing threads back and then one 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.600
 and we pull 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.899
 behind the network 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.899
 we help each other with fingers 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.900
 we take now 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.900
 two wires 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.700
 then you 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.700
 and we will pull 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.299
 well we have another node 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.299
 newly 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.399
 two wires 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 now only one 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.400
 and we pull 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 behind the mesh always 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.799
 we help each other with fingers 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.600
 two wires 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.299
 and now in the middle 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.400
 Well folks here with this video 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:23.899
 we will be rediscovering another time 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.099
 other great videos 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.100
 concerning manufacturing fishing nets 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.099
 which it is an important fishing tool 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.099
 So friends 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.899
 See you another time
