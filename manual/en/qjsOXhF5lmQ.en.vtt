00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.589
Hello, my name is Neil Draper and we're going
to talk about shelters for your pregnant mare.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.040
Now this shelter is eighteen by twenty-one
and it's got good open end for ventilation.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:21.340
You want to make sure you got lots of ventilation
for your horses. Their respiratory system

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:30.880
cannot take stale, dusty environments or having
ammonia from the urine in the stalls so you'll

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.329
want to keep the stall extremely clean. Change
the bedding. Now the bedding can be out of

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:46.149
several different materials. Good clean grass,
good clean straw, there's companies that make

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:56.760
shavings for horses out of wood chips from
pine to cedar chips. There's pellets that

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.700
absorb the horse's urine and waste and keep
the environment drier. The straw and the other

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.840
shavings will do the same thing. And you'll
want to spread it out evenly over the ground

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.320
and make it about three, four inches thick
so it's a nice comfortable bed. And be able

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:28.299
to come in and keep it clean, take out the
wet areas with the manure fork and haul it

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.880
off to your manure pile. And of course you'll
want to take the manure out of the stall and

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.659
to keep the stall as dry and clean as possible,
and usually you'll have to change your shavings

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.570
depending on your horse and your size of your
stall. You know from maybe a day or two to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.310
you know three or four days depending - a
large stall of course you'd be able to keep

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.130
it cleaner and not have to change the shavings
as much as a small stall. And as I said, this

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.200
stall is eighteen by twenty-one and this gives
a horse plenty of room to lay down and roll

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.110
around without getting caught in the walls.
Now you can see these walls are solid, so

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.540
the horse can't get its feet through the walls.
You'll want - if you can a more solid area

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.190
so your horse doesn't get pinned down to the
ground by putting its legs through the bars

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.260
of the fence and having the colt and we've
had this happen, be born on one side of the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.790
fence and the mare is on the other side of
the fence. So if you can, it's good to have

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.530
an area where you can contain the colt and
mare in. But it's not a necessity. Now if

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:50.680
you have an open field and the horse is free
roaming and it's pasture and it's clean, then

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.750
the horse can have it out in the pasture just
fine. As a matter of fact, they'd probably

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.910
prefer it that way. But where our pasture
 - this area is more dirt and we don't have

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.620
the pasture, we're going to try to contain
the mare in here with the bedding down on

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.590
the ground to keep this area clean and nice
and safe for the colt.
