00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:04.750
Okay, here's a good spot.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.400
&gt;&gt; It's all the way
out in the middle.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.340
&gt;&gt; All the way out in the middle.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.615
It's way out there.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:14.556
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Did you bring any
of your extra rubber boots?

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.251
You know what, forget it.
&gt;&gt; We don't have any

00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:15.982
water moccasins in this
part of the country.

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.580
&gt;&gt; I don't care.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.260
Let's go for it.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.940
Can you imagine living

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.500
with water moccasins?

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:30.970
I would freak out.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.470
&gt;&gt; I can.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.602
&gt;&gt; I don't mind snakes at all but
water moccasin?

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:37.712
&gt;&gt; We don't worry about that.

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:38.240
&gt;&gt; Wow, this thing is a beauty.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is the deepest red of
any tropical lily that I know of.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.335
&gt;&gt; It's stunning.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:47.630
I would say that's a red,
as compared to the last one we shot.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.270
&gt;&gt; And they call it the red flare
because it flares out so far.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.531
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:54.730
&gt;&gt; This is-
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna take a picture,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.450
keep talking.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.380
Tell me some more stuff.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.950
&gt;&gt; This plant goes way back.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.050
It's probably in the 1930s.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.094
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:10.630
&gt;&gt; And the reason that you don't see
it is because it's temperamental.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.690
We're trying to-
&gt;&gt; To temperature, or to?

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.440
&gt;&gt; To temperature.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.530
It likes a lot of heat.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.170
It doesn't winter over very easily.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.110
&gt;&gt; It's got a good fragrance.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.310
&gt;&gt; But it's such a gorgeous lily.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.980
&gt;&gt; Oh, my gosh.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.530
&gt;&gt; We had to have it,
and we have to grow it.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.740
We will be offering it for sale, but
we'll be offering it as a specimen

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.570
plant because if we're
gonna take all that trouble

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.750
to get it up to a gallon size, we're
gonna get it up to a bigger size.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.760
&gt;&gt; Right from the get go,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.300
it's already gonna be
one of the 16 by sevens?

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's gonna be a specimen.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.250
&gt;&gt; What would this plant sell for?

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.970
The other one was around 50 bucks.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the gallon and in a
specimen pot, specimen sized plant,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.360
it would probably be $120.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.200
I think this one's a little
more red in the leaf but

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.740
it's mottled a little bit different,
too.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.110
&gt;&gt; It is definitely more red.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.210
&gt;&gt; And the Maroon,
was it Maroon Beauty that we did?

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Maroon Beauty.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.780
&gt;&gt; It was kinda green
in the middle and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.030
then that stuff was coming out but
this one's got different.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.390
&gt;&gt; Still has the strong venation
on the back and the serration but

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.740
it's a deeper red.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.190
Not only a deeper red flower,
a deeper red leaf,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.690
just as I was saying,
it tends to be that way.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.740
&gt;&gt; Is this a hybrid?

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.650
&gt;&gt; It is a hybrid.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.240
&gt;&gt; Okay, but 30s, I'm thinking,
are they hybreeding?

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.337
&gt;&gt; 1938, this was done by
Martin Randig and it came off of.

00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:37.224
&gt;&gt; I never heard Martin's name.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:39.102
I've gotta remember this name,
right?

00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:41.310
I mean, 1930s.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 1938.
&gt;&gt; He's one of the grandfathers?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
one of the premier hybridisers.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.590
He came before Kurt Strom and
Perry Slocum.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.365
And so this is the deepest red.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.350
It's the best red,
as far as I'm concerned, but

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.140
it is a little temperamental as far
as the heat that it requires and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.670
overwintering, and so you don't
really see it on the market.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.970
&gt;&gt; Is it because
it's not doing well?

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.010
I don't wanna keep people from
getting this plant cuz I'm amazed

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.620
by it right now.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.580
I want people to get it but
how can someone put this in, say,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.990
even in Southern California,
where I'm at?

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.190
How we can put it out there and
make it do well?

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.355
&gt;&gt; It does great in the summer,
it may not over winter as well.

00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:25.360
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.955
So, just buy it as a specimen.

00:03:27.955 --> 00:03:32.080
I'm sure you're not the only person
in America that does this plant, so

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.400
if they're buying this from someone
else, it's a one gallon pot.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.990
They've gotta get it up immediately,
right?

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.574
&gt;&gt; Yes, I would.

00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:39.838
&gt;&gt; Okay,
wow this is really fantastic.

00:03:39.838 --> 00:03:42.810
&gt;&gt; The bigger you get it,
the better it's gonna do.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.930
&gt;&gt; So right now, this is about,
I don't know, a four foot diameter.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.710
How many plants are here?

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.270
&gt;&gt; Do you what me to pick it up?

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Is it in a bigger pot already?

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.120
&gt;&gt; No,
this is still in a one gallon.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.980
Actually, this is
a separate plant next

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.710
to it but that's what size it is.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.200
&gt;&gt; It's a great plant.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.552
&gt;&gt; And you can see,
it's got a new bloom coming, and

00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:06.120
it's got a bud after that.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.810
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.324
&gt;&gt; So even in a gallon pot,
what we call a lily gallon,

00:04:09.324 --> 00:04:11.370
it's pretty good sized.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.740
You can see the spread.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.290
&gt;&gt; If you're only going to
have this as an annual, and

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.460
I would treat this as an annual, a
lot of my clients are buying plants

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.470
and would treat it as an annual.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.810
People would spend a couple hundred
bucks on just pretty flowers for

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.917
summer in front of their place.

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:27.900
So I try and tell that to people
when they're doing that for

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.200
water lilies.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.150
Treat it as an annual, get it
in a big pot, fertilize it and

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.100
just be amazed by
it all summer long.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.042
&gt;&gt; And in southern California,
there's a good chance this

00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:46.200
would winter over,
once you got it to a big size.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.480
If you're starting out with
just a tuber in the spring,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.790
that would be more difficult for
the average customer.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.850
&gt;&gt; What's the name I'm not
supposed to forget, Martin who?

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.640
&gt;&gt; Randig.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.850
&gt;&gt; Randig.
Martin Randig.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.050
Love that guy.
I'm gonna look him

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.450
up when I get home.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.320
Take me to another red.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.620
Do you have another one?

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.450
&gt;&gt; We do have another one.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.400
&gt;&gt; What's this one called?

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.810
&gt;&gt; It's called Red Cup, and it's
actually a seedling of Red Flare.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.490
Lead me to it.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.990
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:11.670
It is in another greenhouse.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.334
&gt;&gt; All right, let's go.

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:16.160
Do we have to walk out in
the middle of this one too?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.125
&gt;&gt; We don't have to
walk out in the middle.

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:24.141
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:25.230
&gt;&gt; I should've worn shorts.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.940
What was I thinking?

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.591
Let's hurry up,
cuz I know they're closing.

00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:29.406
&gt;&gt; They are.
