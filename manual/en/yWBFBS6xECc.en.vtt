00:00:03.383 --> 00:00:07.703
Hi, I'm Leon and i work with Mantel Bikeparts and this is the review of the Garmin Edge 810

00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:11.104
The Edge 810 is the successor to the Edge 800

00:00:11.104 --> 00:00:13.944
Garmin added a few neat features

00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:18.785
and in this review we will take a closer look at these features

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.700
Here we have the home screen of the Garmin Edge 810

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.946
Compared to the Edge 800 a lot has changed

00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:29.950
It's still a touchscreen interface, really easy to navigate

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.540
Here on the home screen you can chose which bike you are using

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.630
For instance a racing bike, mountainbike or trekking bike

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.423
You can add even more bikes, it's up to the user

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:44.382
Then you can select the kind of ride you are going on

00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:49.263
It can be a training ride, touring ride or race

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:54.917
You can also add other ride types, and every type will get it's own set of data fields

00:00:54.932 --> 00:01:01.028
If I use 'race', I get speed and distance data fields, these are important data fields to me in a race

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:03.675
But you can completely customize this yourself

00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:05.634
Back to the home screen

00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:08.304
Now I want to go on a training ride

00:01:08.304 --> 00:01:14.570
Tap 'ride' and now we get data fields that I find important for a training ride

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:21.524
Settings can also be accessed from the home screen

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:25.195
Here I can edit the bike and ride profiles

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:29.613
Bluetooth settings (more on that later), system settings...

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.501
Here I can check my ride history

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.903
Rides, courses and workouts... I can also check my personal records

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:40.616
I haven't used this computer on a ride, so no personal records to show...

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:48.005
And here we have the map view

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.197
An important new feature is the Bluetooth smartphone connection

00:02:01.197 --> 00:02:06.533
Using an Android or Apple smartphone you can connect your phone with your Garmin Edge

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:16.727
With the app 'Garmin Connect' you can send courses to the Garmin Edge 810

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.862
Here's a small loop around our store. 'Send to device'...

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.978
...and it's uploaded to the Garmin Edge so I can ride this course.

00:02:31.978 --> 00:02:37.313
Another feature is Live Track

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:45.134
I can send an invitation from here to friends or family using email, Facebook or Twitter

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:48.980
They can follow me during my ride via the internet

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.900
'Start Live Track'... The Live Track activates...

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.947
I can store the phone in my jersey now, and people at home can check my progress, my speed, et cetera

00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:05.116
Ideal if you're going on a Cycle Tour and you want the people at home to track your progress

00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:11.525
Another feature is weather. The latest forecasts can be sent to your Garmin Edge.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:16.980
If the weather suddenly turns, you get a warning message on your Edge.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.031
Imagine you're riding in the Alps, the weather turns, you can make sure you get down from the mountain

00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:26.364
And finally... Uploading activities...

00:03:26.364 --> 00:03:33.278
This way I can uploads rides directly from the Garmin Edge to Garmin Connect, using my smartphone

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:37.663
You have completed your ride, enjoying your coffee at a cafÃ©...

00:03:37.663 --> 00:03:46.025
and you can directly upload your ride and share your results with your friends, using Garmin Connect

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:52.030
I've sent my colleague Jasper on a ride with the Garmin Edge 810

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.110
And here we have an example of Live Tracking

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.822
We can see a map here, showing where he is right now

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:03.140
It's not completely up to date, there is a small delay of about a minute.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.030
But it's enough to get a good idea where someone is right now

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.956
Down here you can see the elapsed speed and height

00:04:10.956 --> 00:04:16.863
I'm switching to satellite view right now

00:04:16.863 --> 00:04:22.862
Up here there's a summary of his ride, showing elapsed time, distance and average speed

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:28.909
This way you can get a really good impression how Jasper is doing on his ride

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.503
The Garmin Edge 810 is available in three different versions

00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:36.140
Here we have the standard version, which comes with a manual

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.383
There is no Dutch manual in the box, but this can be downloaded from Garmin.com

00:04:41.383 --> 00:04:46.865
The Edge 810 itself, of course... Two handle bar mounts

00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:50.310
A wall outlet charger and an USB cable

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:58.823
The two other versions are the bundle version, which comes with a heart rate strap and cadence sensor

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:03.905
and there is a City Navigator version, which also is supplied with a detailed map of Western Europe

00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:08.503
