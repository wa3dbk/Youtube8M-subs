Welcome to howtocookthat.net.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.200
Today we are going to make a Lego logo out
of fondant to go on top of a Lego cake.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.330
If you're not sure how to mix your colors
at a fondant, then go to howtocookthat.net,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.392
the link is just below this video.

00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:25.650
Put a piece of baking paper over your logo
that is printed out in the size that you want

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.310
it to be on your cake.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.020
Grab your red fondant.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.230
Make sure it's nice and smooth.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.100
And then we want to roll it out to make the
square.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.829
Try not to use any icing sugar if you can,
because it's going to affect your colors,

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.440
because you're using bright colors or black
on this logo.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.430
Cut a nice straight line on one edge.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.690
Line that up with your square, just a little
bit off so you can see where it needs to go.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.510
I like to turn the paper to make it easier
to cut.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.510
Then repeat on the other sides.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.980
Once you're finished take a palette knife
or a long straight knife, and just give each

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.140
edge a little tap, just to make sure it's
nice and straight and smooth.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.350
Once you finish that, we're going to make
the black border.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.720
So take some black fondant, and roll it out
into a smooth long snake shape.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.630
It takes some practice to be able to make
a long smooth snake, but it needs to be in

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.780
even thickness the whole way along, because
otherwise your border will be uneven.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.060
If it doesn't work the first time, just screw
it up and roll it out again.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.590
Starting at one corner, press it along the
edges of the red, giving a pinch at each corner

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.590
to make the corner shape.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.410
Then again take your palette knife, tap each
side to make it smooth and straight.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.800
Next, we are going to make the actual lettering.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.740
For that we are going to need some white fondant
again rolled out into an even, long snake

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.010
shape.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.610
And then take one end, round it off, and start
forming each letter, starting with the L,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.099
which is the easiest one, so that's a good
place to start.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.160
And then moving on to the E, do it just as
you did with the L; but when you get to the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.190
center bit of the E, just take a piece the
right length, and squash one end of it, and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.480
tuck it underneath the other piece of the
E. Just like that.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.720
And then repeat what you've already done to
make a G and also make your O. Again with

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.489
the O squashing one edge to make them join
together.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.740
Then you need to roll out some black fondant,
pick up each letter, and place it onto the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.650
black fondant, referring back and looking
at your logo each time to see what angle they're

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.739
on, and how close they need to be together.

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.540
Just adjust the positioning with a knife.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.249
Careful not to get any black from the fondant
onto the white letters.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:09.810
Then using a knife just go ahead and cut around
each of the letters, so you're just left with

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.590
a fine black border around the whole thing.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.980
Then take some yellow fondant.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.292
Roll it out much thinner than you have previously
for the other colors.

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:23.630
Roll a really thin, long piece.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.090
And then what you're going to do is simply
place it around the black.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.909
Just start at one point, any point.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.739
Use a knife to push it into the little gaps
that you need to get it into, and wrap it

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.810
all the way around, right until you get back
to the beginning.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.879
Then take a palette knife again, make sure
it's even and flat at the top and bottom.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.359
Lift it up, and pop it onto your square using
a knife to ease it off the palette knife,

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.829
if you need to, so that it doesn't get out
of shape.

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.209
If you've got more time you can leave it to
set hard before you pick it up and move it,

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.510
that way it's not going to get out of shape.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.719
And there is your Lego logo, ready to put
on top of your cake.
