00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.330
Not only did the original Infinity Blade introduce
players to a new and cunningly effective combat

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.160
system for touchscreen-based devices, it pushed
the boundaries of what was possible on the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.720
iOS platform both visually and conceptually.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.800
Its iterative style of gameplay was (for some)
simply repetitive, but more than anything

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.869
else it has opened the doors up to a great
story concept, something not lost at all in

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.490
Chair Entertainment's sequel, Infinity Blade
II.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.610
While those who played the original will already
be familiar with what's going on it's not

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.309
a per-requisite to jumping on board, and the
game does a great job of setting up your character's

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.570
current situation.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.109
You character is ostensibly an immortal, much
like those he has chosen to fight against

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.219
to free humanity from their tyranny.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.969
In order to break the never-ending cycle you
must guide him back to the prison of the Worker

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.519
of Secrets, sacrificing yourself again and
again to break the bonds that hold him there.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.080
Blocking your way is an almost endless parade
of beasties ranging from lithe ninja-like

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.790
swordsman to behemoths and giants wielding
weapons that would have required entire trees

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.780
to make the shaft.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.520
It's a daunting horror show that requires
patience and cat-like reflexes to swipe, tap

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.750
and gesture your way past them.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.159
Much like the original the combat is broken
up in to duels with the player being able

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.060
to dodge, parry, or block incoming strikes
while waiting for an opportunity to unload

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
with a combo, super strike, or magic spell
of their own.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.259
Instead of the game devolving in to a series
of dodge-matches, players are encouraged to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.829
mix up their repertoire by mastering the parry
and the block to create 'breaks'.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.820
Dodging is further penalized by the character
becoming exhausted if it's used too many times

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.219
in a row, though this is offset by being able
to 'hold' your place to deal with over-extended

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.159
blows from the enemy.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.369
To compliment the deeper combat system, players
are encouraged to customize their gear thanks

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.740
to 'gem slots' with special bonuses including
resistances to various attack types, elemental

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.840
effects, basic stat upgrades, and even bonuses
to finding various items.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.110
The list of available weaponry has also expanded
and players can choose between sword and board,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.180
two-handed, and dual-wielding weapons, each
with their own bonuses and playstyles.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.530
For instance, dual-wielding removes the ability
to block, but grants players with a third

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.300
direction to dodge.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.200
Given the scope and variety of the various
monsters, the combinations of weapons and

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.349
armor they can use, and the deeper combat
system, players are bound to be enchanted

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.800
all over again by the simple act of plowing
through one enemy after another.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.000
Unfortunately this can be marred by the simple
act of exploration, causing you to progress

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.319
no further in the storyline or meeting a dead-end
with no real benefit, resulting in moments

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.080
of fatigue from having to start again and
again.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.909
It goes almost without saying that Infinity
Blade II is one of the most gorgeous games

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.460
on the iOS platform to date, though it does
continue to cheat its way past restrictions

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.280
by limiting the camera angles and removing
free exploration.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.230
Even still, what's presented is simply stunning
and exploring the labyrinthine lair is worth

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.950
it not just to move the story along, but to
absorb every inch of its menacing environments.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.860
What's on offer is not all that's left to
come either as Chair Entertainment leave the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.340
usual promises of additional content, including
multiplayer.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.049
If the sheer volume of updates on the first
title is any indicator, it's going to be a

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.080
long time before anyone truly masters the
depths of Infinity Blade II.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.939
If you have the space and a third-gen or higher
iDevice, you need to make this game part of

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.989
your collection.
