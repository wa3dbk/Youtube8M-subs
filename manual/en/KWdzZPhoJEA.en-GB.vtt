00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.960
Hello everyone, and welcome to this week's
game development log video diary, and this

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.119
week I'm going to be working on rendering
in-game text! I'm going to be doing this without

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:14.400
using any extra libraries or anything; I like
to do everything from scratch as you know.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.490
So yeah, let's get on with the show! Before
I can start work on the text rendering I had

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.950
to just tidy up one loose end from last week
which was the equip interface; I hadn't quite

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.830
finished that off last week but I have now
done that, and you can see it over here on

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.420
the right looking nice and working perfectly.
So tomorrow I will make a start on the text

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.700
rendering. So today I've made the first steps
towards putting text on the screen, and what

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.769
I've done is to create this texture map of
all the characters that I'm going to use.

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.780
As well as the texture map I've had to make
this text file which holds positional and

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.949
size data for each character in the texture
map such as how wide the character is or whether

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.800
it should be written above or below the line,
and this is needed to tell the renderer exactly

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.690
how to render each character.
Before i can render any of those font textures

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.430
on to the screen, I need to have a 2D mesh
to render the textures on to. And that's what

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.510
I've got here. This actually says, for no
good reason whatsoever, "Hello dog, I'm ThinMatrix".

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.510
And I'll edit some text over this in the video
so that you can see what I mean. But basically

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.810
what I did today was to write a method which
takes in a string of characters as an input,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.610
and then for every one of those characters
it gets the ascii value of the character,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.960
finds the corresponding entry in the meta
file, and then using that positional and size

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.251
data of the letter it creates 4 vertices of
a rectangle. And this is what the texture

00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:47.860
is going to be rendered on to. All of the
vertices for the whole text are then put together

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.570
into one buffer array and loaded into memory
as a model, and that's what is being rendered

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.670
on the screen right now.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.909
It is Thursday and today, as you can see,
I've rendered my first sentence of text in

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.260
the game! It took quite a while today getting
the texture coordinates calculated properly,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.640
but I did finally manage it and I'm pretty
pleased with the result. So now I just need

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.810
to go on and add support for text that goes
over multiple lines, and also create the option

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.360
to render text in different colors and sizes.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.450
So today I've been finishing off the text
rendering update by adding a variety of little

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.280
features to the system. As you can see here
text will now go onto the next line automatically

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.670
when it reaches a certain size limit. Also
I've made it possible for text to be rendered

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.620
now in different colors and sizes, and you
can see a couple of examples of that here.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.221
So that's pretty much it for the text rendering!
Tomorrow I'm probably going to have to do

00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:49.420
a couple of little optimizing updates, but
the main features of the text system are now

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.840
all done.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.380
And that is pretty much it for this week,
today I just did a few bug fixes and optimizations

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.099
so nothing really to report there. So thank
you very much for watching this video, I hope

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.560
you enjoyed it...Next time I'm going to be
putting the text into use by adding mouse-over

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.319
text to items,
to tell you what they are and what they do

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.099
and stuff like that, and I might even add
a new gui specifically for showing information

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.810
about items, so that'll be cool.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.130
But yeah, thanks again for watching, you can
follow me on twitter if you want, the link

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.370
is in the descripton bellow, do subscribe
if you haven't already, and I'll see you

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.650
all next time.
