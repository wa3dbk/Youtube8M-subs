00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.940
This review looks at two versions of the
five axle Liebherr HTM 1204

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.450
concrete mixer commissioned by Heavy
Transport Models.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.100
Conrad 72208/01 is in the colours of the Swiss

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.440
company Christen,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.930
and /03 is in the colours of the
swiss company Kibag.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.990
Both models come in the same Conrad
branded packaging with just a label

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.270
on the end telling you what's inside,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.270
and for the unboxing will look at the Kibag version.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.640
As usual there is no information about the
real truck or the model

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.180
and inside the packaging consists of the
foam nbacked cardboard that Conrad often

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.200
uses.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.340
It looks like the model was being kept in a
soundproof booth but it protects the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.340
model well.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.200
As is typical for these type of Conrad
trucks the mirrors and the roof aerials

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.760
have to be separated from their
mouldings

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.480
and I like to pretend i know what i'm
doing by using a sharp knife.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.670
Fitting the mirrors is easy because they've been designed in a way which means they can only

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.320
go one way up

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.100
and they're pretty good fit into the
holes of the cab so they stay in place

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.520
well.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.640
After a quick handbrake turn we can fit the
mirror on the other side

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.009
and there's also a mirror that needs to
be fitted over the top of the passenger

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.520
door.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.500
That one is also quite a good tight fit so
there's no need to worry about it

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.799
dropping out as you push the truck around
the room.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.080
The last bit of the assembly is the two roof
aerials and they're best put in by pinching

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.080
them close to the base.

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.549
For the details we're back with the Kibag version

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.219
and the transmission and suspension is
model well at the rear although it does miss a

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.619
section of driveshaft at the front.

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.729
As per the Kibag colour scheme the
plastic wheels are fairly plain though they

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:35.109
are detailed.

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.479
The Actros cab detailing is good with
nice-looking door mirrors

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:42.379
and the Kibag logo and two-tone color scheme is attractive but there are no number plates

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.739
on the model which suggest this is not
one from the real fleet.

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.699
Behind the cab there is a nice chrome exhaust
and the mixer tank and engine look good.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.369
The mixer drum is metal apart from a
plastic collar at the end and the graphics

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.669
and paintwork are very sharp.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.129
At the rear the funnel, the chutes and the
access platform and ladders are all modeled in

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.900
metal

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.879
and the rear lights are painted.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.219
The Christen version is exactly the same
the wheels look sharper and the color

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.789
scheme is nice.

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.779
The drum doesn't have any graphics and
it really boils down to whether you like the

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:15.499
green of Christen or the blue of Kibag , or both!

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.119
This is a Cranes Etc Safety
Advisory.

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:26.119
When carrying out work you can only defy
the laws of gravity for so long....

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.829
Out on the Cranes Etc superhighway
these models roll well helped in part by

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.179
the relatively heavyweight of them.

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.569
The two driven axles float a bit to
represent suspension and there's linked

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.009
steering at the front which has got
quite a good range of movement.

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.349
Also interesting on this particular
truck is that the rear axle steers as

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.769
well.

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.289
So let's test the steering in action

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:57.329
and with a hard lock the front axles
get fouled and don't roll easily

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.919
but make them slightly straighter and it rolls well in a gentle curve.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.379
This design of truck uses the rear axle
to help spread the load when the mixer

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.549
drum is fully loaded

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.679
but a neat feature which has been
implemented on the model is that the

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:14.729
axle can be raised up and clipped out of
service.

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.989
It works well with the rear axle raised
enough so that when you push it along

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.979
with it clipped out of service the rear wheels don't turn.

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.089
Going to the other end of the model
another feature is that the cab fully

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:26.769
tilts

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:29.779
and is able to be posed in a tilted
position letting you see the engine

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:30.979
underneath.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.009
When you've finished your greasing
and lubrication you can go back to the model

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.090
and close the cab up.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.060
Going back to the other end of the model there is
a working chute which let's you

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.069
discharge the freshly mixed invisible
concrete

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.389
and the last feature to look at is the
mixer drum itself

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.909
and that spins quite smoothly but it's not
free spinning.

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.110
In summary these are both good-looking
mixer trucks and they pose well with

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.849
other models such as concrete pumps.

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.979
The detailing is good and the working
features have been implemented well.

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.129
These are limited edition models so if you like these kind of trucks they're highly

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.749
recommended.
