Hello Origami fellows

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.580
For this model you need first to take a one square paper

00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:14.553
then make the origami fish base :)

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:25.693
If the video tutorial is too fast you can change the speed

00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:53.414
The Seahorse is ready to play games

00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:57.134
