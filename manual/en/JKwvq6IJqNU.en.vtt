"Hi.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.040
My name is Robert Royston.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.210
I'm a five-time world champion of country
dance, working with artists like Taylor Swift,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.710
Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.900
I really hope that you'd learn how to line
dance and experience what it's like to move

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.650
to America's music, and that's country music.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.310
So, the first open position turn you should
learn in two step is a ladies outside turn.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.020
That's what we're going to show you right
now.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.430
So, ladies outside turn.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.140
We're going to do the same prep that we did
in basic closed turn.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.570
We go quick, quick, slow, on the second slow
start to prepare her open just a little bit.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.040
Now, what's going to happen from here is she's
going to turn.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.670
So, from that slow, slow, she's going to go
quick, then turn, quick, then turn, slow,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.930
then she's done, slow, then we take the basic,
quick, quick, slow, slow.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.860
Now, the thing about that is each step is
a half of a rotation, ladies.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.239
So as I go quick, quick, slow, prepare slow,
she's going to go half a rotation, half a

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.510
rotation, half a rotation, half a rotation,
to then finish quick, quick, slow, slow.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.000
And, leaders, what you're going to think about
is kind of go and up the arm ramp of a freeway,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.470
creating a little halo over the head because
she's such an angel.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.930
So you kind of go... just don't scratch your
hands on the horns as you go around.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.940
You're going to go up, you're going to ramp
of a freeway, create a nice circle, and come

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.310
down the off ramp, right?

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.619
So, we're going to go quick, quick, slow,
prepare slow, quick, quick, slow, slow, quick,

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.619
quick, slow.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.880
We'll do it one more time, quick, quick, slow,
prepare slow, quick, quick, slow, slow, quick,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.549
quick, slow, slow.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.630
Let's go ahead and try that to music.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.090
Five, six, seven, go.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:58.690
Quick, quick, slow, slow, quick, quick, slow,
slow, quick, quick, slow, slow, quick, quick,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.840
slow, slow, quick, quick, slow, slow, quick,
quick, slow, slow.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.000
Just one more element before she's done for
ladies outside turn.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.049
Quick, quick, slow, slow, quick, quick, slow,
slow.

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.049
