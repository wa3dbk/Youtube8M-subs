00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.248
Good morning Mr. and
Ms. Warren High School.

00:00:15.658 --> 00:00:17.191
and all geeks sitting
on top of the buses

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:19.618
looking into the girls locker rooms!

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.291
Your mutt-loaf...sir.

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:29.396
Who the hell is Steven Spielberg?
-You're kidding right?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.896
Do I look like I'm kidding?

00:00:32.038 --> 00:00:34.366
Careful! You're bleeding on
moon base alpha.

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:38.236
I still don't get how you think you
can get away with making a Jaws 2.

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.975
The perfect solution was to
shoot it in an insert tank.

00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:42.908
It's a swimming pool!

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:45.511
Cut! Do you mind?!

00:00:45.828 --> 00:00:48.088
What do you think that one of these
movies is going to end up

00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:54.821
In this scene he's decided it's
not worth living if he can't live

00:00:55.126 --> 00:00:56.521
as the alien he really is.
-Hi Pat!

00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.258
These are your morning
announcements for...

00:00:59.608 --> 00:01:02.495
May 25th, 1977!

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.998
A new and golden age lies upon us!

00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:08.066
Genesee Theatres! 3pm! Come on!
let's go guys!

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:11.771
Don't be alarmed. It's only Star Wars.

00:01:13.178 --> 00:01:15.875
Oh right like I'd waste my time
on some dorky sci-fi movie.

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:18.076
Oh so you don't have your little
Star Trek parties anymore?

00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:19.305
Shut up!

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:20.713
What is this movie about?

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.751
[sound effects]
-"I have you now!"

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.020
Haha...

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:30.423
I always wished it was a ufo

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:31.723
coming to take me back.

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:34.560
So where do you come from?
-A distant star system.

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:35.803
You can't get there.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.931
Is this not the coolest thing
you've ever seen?!

00:01:41.843 --> 00:01:44.271
There aren't any "clicks"
in the movie theatre!

00:01:44.548 --> 00:01:47.408
There aren't any jocks or geeks,
or nerds, or braids.

00:01:47.716 --> 00:01:48.650
This wasn't the first time either.

00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:51.778
Your first time was the day you saw
the coming attractions for star wars.

00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:53.515
You had tears in you eyes.
-So?!

00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:55.046
How can I ever compete with that?

00:01:55.213 --> 00:01:57.216
You'll going to go see this movie
and everything will be the same.

00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:00.786
You'll still be Pat Johnson making
his little movies in his backyard.

00:02:01.048 --> 00:02:02.121
They're not little!

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.858
I've just got a big backyard.

00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:11.205
I guess it's like if everyone sees
it and everyone likes it,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.933
I won't be the only geek
in town anymore.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.010
To everybody else, movies
are something to do

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:17.536
when you're tired of real life.

00:02:19.426 --> 00:02:22.575
To you, real life is something to do
when you're tired of watching movies.

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:28.681
Don't say you're going to try
and then chicken out.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.896
Hollywood might be a door.
It might be a wall.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.066
I won't know till I touch it.

00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:54.573
The Death Star could take out
the Enterprise with one shot.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.145
The Enterprise has deflector shields!
