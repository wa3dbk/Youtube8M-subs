Hi, this is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village. For a very unique

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.679
and unusual look and feel to your rain stick.
You can decorate it with sand. Yes, sand.

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:25.740
What you want to do is completely cover your
glue stick all the way around with craft glue.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.800
You want to put it on nice and thick and spread
it so that it's a smooth surface and it covers

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.210
every bit of your rain stick. Once you have
that smoothed on to your rain stick, so that

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.720
you've covered every bit of it. Your going
to take some sand, good old playground sand

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.149
works just fine and put it in a pile on a
paper that's long enough for your rain stick

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:07.420
and simply roll your rain stick slowly in
the sand. If you have completely covered your

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.700
rain stick with glue and you have relatively
fine sand. You will get every bit of that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.670
rain stick covered with sand. Then you have
a very, very unique look to your rain stick.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.759
Now, another thing that you could do would
be to use different colors of sand and spread

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.500
them out across your paper towel and then
roll your rain stick slowly through the colors

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.860
of sand. Then you would have again sand and
the texture but also the different colors.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.670
Once your glue and your sand is completely
dry. You may want to coat it with maybe some

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.040
hairspray or some spray on lacquer to kind
of help the sand stay on your rain stick.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.110
Then of course, you could always take one
of your bamboo skewers while your glue is

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:08.360
still wet. You can even take some of it away
and make designs in your sand. You might want

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.440
to plan that out ahead of time so you know
what designs you want to make. You could put

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:20.080
a snake line there in the sand. You could
put a lizard in it. If you really wanted it

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:29.050
show you could use colored glue when you first
put your glue on and then the color would

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.440
shine through when you wipe the sand away.
So, that is a very unique and fun way to decorate

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.730
your rain stick using good old craft glue
and playground sand.
