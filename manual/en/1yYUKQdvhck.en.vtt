00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.380
Hi, I’m Jim, for Mercedes-Benz.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.920
I’m going to show you how to use the Head-Up
Display in your vehicle.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.900
The Head-Up Display is an option that projects
some key driving information onto a virtual

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.900
screen.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.040
The display appears to be floating over your
car’s hood.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.869
It lets you check your speed settings and
see the next navigation instruction while

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.310
keeping your head…up, and your eyes on the
road.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.289
The button to turn on the Head-Up Display
is on the left side of the dash.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.939
The display is projected from the dash-top,
above the gauges.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.270
A special windshield glass lets you see the
display as if it’s farther ahead, in your

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.500
natural field of vision.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.130
Certain conditions can affect its visibility
to you, including direct sunlight, harsh reflections

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.880
in the windshield, and polarized sunglasses.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.070
And of course, don’t place anything on the
dash.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.400
You can adjust the display for height and
brightness… though it also adapts automatically

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.580
to ambient light.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.610
Using the steering-wheel controls, press the
Home button to bring up the list of menus

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.190
in the instrument cluster.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.280
Then, press the up or down arrow to get to
Settings… and press OK to select it.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.229
Use the arrows to select Head-Up Display,
and OK.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.840
Then select Brightness… or Position, and
OK.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.450
In each of these submenus, use the arrows
to select a setting, and press OK to save

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.680
it.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.409
Also, when you program your driver-seat position
into memory, the height setting for the Head-Up

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.770
Display will be included.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.200
What gets shown in the display depends on
what features are active in your car at the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
time.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.659
Your driving speed is always shown, surrounded
by a circular shape.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.999
If you set the cruise control, or DISTRONIC
adaptive cruise control, a segment of the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:46.889
circle turns yellow… and your set speed
is shown below it.

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:50.850
If the COMAND navigation system is guiding
you to a destination, information about your

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.909
next turn will also be displayed.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.850
As you approach the turn, it’ll show greater
detail about the intersection and the best

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.939
lane to be in.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.529
For more information… please see your Operator’s
Manual.

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:06.570
Remember, there’s also an on-screen Digital
Operator’s Manual in your COMAND system.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.060
If you have further questions, your Mercedes-Benz
dealer will be happy to help.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.810
Thanks for watching.
