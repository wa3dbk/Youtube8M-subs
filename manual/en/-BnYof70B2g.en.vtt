Hey, 반갑슴니다

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.800
In my last vlog about the different gyms and 
 lifting nuances here in Korea one user commented:

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:16.485
"My question is, how do they (Koreans) stay so darn thin and fit?"

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.500
I think many people think that Korean food is 
 somehow healthier than food in other countries,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.913
say like, America.  And in my opinion, 
 it's really not that true.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.900
I mean, in America with the sheer girth of 
 crops and the availability of fruits, and vegetables

00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:39.071
and now all the organic food sources, you 
 can't find healthier choices anywhere.

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:53.402
But, on every corner on every block in Korea you will likely 
 find a fast food joint, Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme, fried chicken...

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.412
and every rice-based snack usually fried with some type 
 of high sodium, high fructose sauce smothering it.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.166
Yet the rate of obesity is pretty much nonexistent here in Korea,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.743
but things are kind of changing from what I can see.

00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:16.607
So, why are Koreans less fat than Americans?

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.826
Another user chimed in on that previous comment to say:

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:29.526
"Koreans tend to be skinny as they eat less compared to 
 America.  Their (American's) food portions are 50-100% larger"

00:01:29.713 --> 00:01:32.476
I can say for certain that one thing that I miss about America is

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:35.976
when I leave a restaurant in Korea on many occasions

00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:39.655
I don't feel completely full or stuffed.

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:43.739
Even when I go and get the Korean version of a super size,

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:45.940
it's really just like a large.

00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.000
And the sodas...there's no refills on the sodas

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.580
at places like McDonald's or Burger King at least here in Busan.

00:01:52.608 --> 00:01:56.010
The other night I went out for a burrito, and it was tasty

00:01:56.013 --> 00:01:58.508
but it was about the size of, like, a Hot Pocket.

00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:05.475
I mean, in South Florida, where I'm from, some of the burritos 
 that you can get are like the size of footballs

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:08.780
I mean, you can practically have a heart 
 attack after eating one of those things.

00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:13.017
And here's proof that portion size is the greatest factor for the difference:

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:17.020
I recently found a story about an Iowa science teacher named, John Cisna.

00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:19.070
You can look it up when you get a chance.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.794
He lost nearly 40 pounds by eating nothing but,

00:02:23.794 --> 00:02:27.390
McDonald's food for 90 days.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.730
He claims that this included your Big Macs, and your 
 Quarter Pounders with cheese, and all the good stuff.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.090
And he also claims that his cholesterol dropped nearly 80 points.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.290
Now, he did this by sticking to a 
 strict 2000 calorie per day diet plan

00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:46.870
of McDonald's food that was designed by his students.

00:02:47.324 --> 00:02:49.520
So, there you go - portion size.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.822
I wouldn't recommend for anybody to go out and eat McDonald's like that,

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.820
but it just goes to show you that your daily portion size

00:02:56.392 --> 00:03:00.390
is probably the greatest contributor to obesity, in my opinion.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.140
And something that I see that Koreans have a firm grasp on.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.490
So, Koreans stay thinner...

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.953
...for now.

00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:11.450
Anyway, thanks for watching.  See you next time.

00:03:11.912 --> 00:03:14.910
Peace!
