My name is Courtney Hester on behalf of Expert
Village. In this clip I'm going to show you

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.830
a few kid friendly websites that I particularly
like. The first one is called Star Fall, go

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:25.560
to www.starfall.com. This is a reading website,
but your kids can watch video's about the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.279
alphabet, they can read books if we click
on this one. They can read all different books

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.300
which each have a phonics focus and then they
can play games to go with those and then some

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.050
of these have movies that they can watch that
teach them about the rule or the phonic pattern.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:54.949
Our next website is called Edgey Place and
you choose your state and I'm in Texas and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.980
then we can pick a subject. I'm going to pick
spelling and then you just pick a book and

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:11.610
there are different games. Crossword challenges
and if you click the other book there's an

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:21.380
online word find and other activities. The
next website we're going to go to is called

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:33.250
Noggin, we're going to go to noggin.com/games.
These are a bunch of games that go along with

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.050
great child friendly characters that are on
the Nickelodeon channel like Dora the Explora

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:52.030
and Franklin, lots of really cute kid friendly
games. The last one is funbrain.com and this

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.610
has some games even for some older kids. There's
academic games and then just some fun games

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.750
to play that aren't really academic. The one
thing to keep in mind when you're choosing

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.380
a website for your child is to view the content
on that website, look at the text, but also

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.280
go in and maybe check out some of the games
for yourself. There are a lot of games on

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.110
the internet now that have been adapted and
they have been adapted for adults and they're

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.220
not so kid friendly.
