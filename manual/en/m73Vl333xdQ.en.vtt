There's people saying

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.800
We've come with our under 17s
and under 16s.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.200
Because we were having a lot of issues,
we wanted to bring the girls away

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.600
and show them what it's like to play
in the NAIDOC Netball Competition.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.080
I like playing with all the people
and being together and having fun.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.600
It's a fantastic competition,
there's a great camaraderie,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.320
you catch up with lots of people.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.000
We have all the girls,
as you see or hear, these guys, as well.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So it's just a great day,
a good carnival day,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.960
a great experience for our girls.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.960
