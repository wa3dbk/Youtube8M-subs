00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.570
Kate: A cell phone.

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:30.683
It's Charlie's cell phone.

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958
Then he has to be around here somewhere.

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:34.053
Let's go that way.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:38.135

00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.271
Thank you.

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:57.535
Do I have to be a baby doll?

00:00:57.831 --> 00:00:59.491
Can you please change me back?

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:02.351
Do you promise to be good?

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:04.893
I promise.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.550
Okay.

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:12.505
Herbie!

00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:14.663
Oh, I'm back!

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:18.485
It feels good to be me again!

00:01:19.348 --> 00:01:21.348
Oh, someone's coming!

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:22.679
Let's get out of here!

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:25.921
Michelle &amp; Katie: Charlie!

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:33.139

Suspenseful Music

00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:50.931
Michelle: Wow, this is so cool.

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.366
I wonder who lives here.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.160
Katie: Probably the Keebler Elves.

00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:57.502
Michelle &amp; Katie: Whoa!

00:01:57.902 --> 00:01:58.902
How'd you guys do that?

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:01.406
Katie: Told you, their magic, like the Keeblers.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.746
Herbie &amp; Ginger: We're not elves!

00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:05.077
Oh, I was just kidding.

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:07.365
Michelle: I'm Michelle and this is Katie.

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:09.232
I'm Ginger.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.530
I'm Herbie.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.690
Okay. We're looking for our cousin Charlie.

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:13.689
Have you seen him?

00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:16.884
Hmmmm.

00:02:18.277 --> 00:02:19.277
Herbie &amp; Ginger: Oh yeah!

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.999
We had him for dinner last week.

00:02:25.662 --> 00:02:27.222
Had him for dinner, what?

00:02:27.448 --> 00:02:28.448
Huh?

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.999
Excuse us for a second.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:32.505
Barfing Noise

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.149
Charlie: What was that Place!

00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:37.561
Ahhhh!

00:02:38.788 --> 00:02:40.788
We just had to up chuck.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:43.015
Get it, up chuck.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.500
Ahhh!

00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:49.346
Katie: This is crazy!

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.309
Charlie, are you okay?

00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:54.642
Charlie: I'm just, so hungry.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.650
Whoa, you're a couple of crazy creep kids!

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:01.042
Uh-huh

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:03.611
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:06.827
Nothing worst than evil little elves!

00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:08.636
Uh-uh!

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:10.622
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:14.501
You're a couple of monster!

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:16.739
Uh-huh

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.440
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:21.445
Michelle: Charlie what's going on!

00:03:21.457 --> 00:03:22.517
This is freaking me out!

00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:24.313
Michelle: Talk to us!

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:25.476
I'm just, so hungry.

00:03:27.994 --> 00:03:28.994
We need a Barbie-Q.

00:03:32.748 --> 00:03:33.748
Barbie-Q!

00:03:36.394 --> 00:03:37.394
Michelle: She's magic!

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.670
Katie: She's a little witch!

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.336
We need some barbies for this barbie-Q.

00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:43.562
Michelle: Let's get out of here!

00:03:44.493 --> 00:03:46.243
You not going any where, Barbies!

Michelle &amp; Katie: Ahhh! This crazy! Ahhh!

00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:51.774
Michelle: What's going on?!

00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:53.604
Katie: We've been turned into barbies!

00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:55.011
Michelle &amp; Katie: Ahhh! Help!

00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:57.347
Shhh, you girls be quiet!

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:00.793
You know what these barbies need?

00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:02.071
Ken!

00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:06.405
Herbie: Oh man, not ken.

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:08.711
What do you mean?

00:04:09.835 --> 00:04:11.835
I was going to say barbie-Q sauce.

00:04:14.345 --> 00:04:15.345
Huh?

00:04:16.496 --> 00:04:18.496
You know, barbie-Q sauce.

00:04:19.707 --> 00:04:21.707
Oh, barbie-Q sauce!

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.069
Come on Ginger, change me back!

00:04:32.593 --> 00:04:33.593
Uh-uh!

00:04:34.797 --> 00:04:36.797
What?! Why?

00:04:39.107 --> 00:04:41.107
Herbie, you got girlfriends.

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:44.209
Come on, give me a break!

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:47.603
Herbie, you're a love bug.

00:05:00.564 --> 00:05:01.564
Laughter

00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:26.911
Awkward.
