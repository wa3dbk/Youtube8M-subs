00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.390
The first iteration of the technology was
an emergency services helmet, and from there

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.230
NewSouth Innovations helped us build the start-up
as a venture and create this technology 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.050
and  make it a viable business.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.780
Having modular devices on helmets has always been hampering 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.820
to all types of athletes from police officers to snow sports enthusiasts to cyclists.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.520
We all went skiing and snowboarding and we saw these devices on everyone’s helmets,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.720
and we thought, “there has to be a better solution to this.”

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.060
Firstly of course it has a full HD camera, which is integrated. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.380
It has a whole set of inertia sensors which can detect where you are 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.570
and how good you are as an athlete and
put it into an app.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.980
 It has great 3D audio so you can actually hear where people are

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.540
when you’re communicating via the Wi-Fi network inside all the helmets.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.620
 And also just having really good audio when you have all these 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.180
EPIRB (Emergency Position Indicating
Radio Beacon) devices 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.280
all in there when you need them.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.600
The biggest problem with this kind of technology

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.240
is you’re paying a premium for a product
that’s almost disposable. 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.620
A helmet is meant to protect you, it’s meant to be replaced,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.820
and that’s something we have to factor into the design of these types of wearable tech.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.320
The top shell, the phone, the speakers, the camera, the computer, the battery 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.960
are all something that you can pull apart, put back together again 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.880
for a reasonably affordable
price.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.470
So say for example I crack the side of the
helmet and I didn’t want to replace the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.270
computing system, which is really expensive,
the shell and the phone you can put together

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.050
for under a hundred dollars. 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.220
And you can change
it each season.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.330
Alpine is designed with strict accordance
to all global standards for light recreational helmets. 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.530
It’s a lot safer than having devices
bolted to a helmet that aren’t meant to be there. 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.940
Where all these things that are
inside an Alpine helmet are meant to be there

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.000
and are tested to be there.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.000
Our mantra is to build super-humans. 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.380
So it could be giving a blind person sight, or helping an older person stand up with the aid of mechatronics.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.710
And that’s our goal. Our goal is to help
people 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.060
while making a real kick-arse  extreme sports product.
