This is MBM

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.700
Hi! This is Kim from made by mommy and today I'll be

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.290
continuing my fruit off the loom series

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.889
with a watermelon slice that you can
make

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.910
in just a couple of minutes with nine

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.619
green rubber band and 11 red rubber
bands

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.310
before I begin I'd like to ask you all a
question

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.199
please write in the comments below if
you would like to learn how to make

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.510
these fruit trays out of duct tape

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.550
Let's get started!  To begin

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.290
take a single red rubber band and wrap it

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.309
around your hook three times

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.460
then take take two

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.420
additional red rubber bands place them on
your hook

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.460
pull it tight and then push that tripled

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.809
over band to the center.   If it won't push

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.850
you can pinch and pull it over your hook

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.850
so it should look like that to begin

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.790
then take another two red rubber bands

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.800
slide them through

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.420
and then we're going to switch to 2 green bands

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.040
so it should look like this

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.310
to start and now we're going to go back

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.060
into not to cap band but this first
pair of bands

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.509
with our hook like that

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.090
and add

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.090
two more red bands so now you should
have

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.869
the pair red and a pair of green on your
hook

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.560
and we're gonna take two green bands

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.020
and bring

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.680
them through all four of those loops. 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.660
Like that.  Now we're going to go back

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.840
into that first pair of rubber bands again

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.280
and put two more

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.280
red rubber bands

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.830
now we take another pair of green bands
and again

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.660
bring them through all for loops. 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.100
Repeat that one more time.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.530
Going back into that first pair

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.920
 of bands, take two red

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.120
Pull those through and then bring

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.560
another pair green bands

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.560
through all four loops

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.450
so now we just need to add a single
rubber band

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.060
to hold the whole shape together.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.359
Take one green band, and pull it through those two green loops

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.040
bring both sides of the rubber band back

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.329
onto your hook and now we're going to
pull

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.780
this side of the rubber band and through the center

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.000
of the other side or if you prefer

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.069
you can stretch this side up

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.159
and over the hook like that to create

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.419
a slip knot and now you have your very

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.639
own watermelon slice!  If you like it,

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.750
please give this video a thumbs-up below.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.290
 I'll be watching the comments to
see whether or not you're interested in

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.919
making the fruit tray

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:17.400
out of duck tape and I'd also love to see
any comments you have

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.699
on what charm I should make next and if
you haven't already I hope you'll

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.400
consider subscribing

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.580
because I have lots of fun projects planned
for the coming weeks

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.370
thank you so much for watching and I
look forward to looming with you again

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.259
soon

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.530
Bye Bye!
