00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:07.429
[Archival music (18 secs) 'Kosovo Waltz']

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.570
[Narrator] Although the Northland town of
Dargaville was named after an Australian merchant

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.270
who founded it in 1872, it is better known
for its Dalmatian heritage.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.390
In the nineteenth century, the surrounding
landscape was full of kauri forests. Once

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.550
the kauri was cleared for timber, gumdiggers
arrived. They searched the swampy ground for

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.579
pieces of buried kauri gum, which had oozed
from the ancient trees and built up around

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.460
the roots.
Kauri gum was excellent for making varnish

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.250
and lacquer. Lumps of gum were exported from
Dargaville to Europe and the United States.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.250
From 1850 to 1900, kauri gum was Auckland's
main export -- ahead of gold, wool and kauri

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.790
timber.
Many of Northland's gum diggers came from

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.320
the province of Dalmatia on the Adriatic coast
of the Mediterranean Sea, which is now part

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.320
of Croatia. During the 1880s, young Dalmatian
men left poor, crowded villages to dig gum

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.439
in Northland. Soon word of the money to be
made encouraged many more Dalmatians to travel

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.530
to the Dargaville district.
[Female Dalmatian voice] ''Nova Zelanda!"

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.530
They said the name over, liking the promise
that it held. Father Ilya had even got them

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.340
a piece of the kauri gum from the museum in
Vienna. It looked rich and wonderful stuff.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.640
They all wanted to hold it, to feel its polished
smoothness.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.840
[Male Dalmatian voice] It means gold and that's
what you'll never get if you stay here. I

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.700
tell you young men, go. Look for a better
life in a new country far from the troubles

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.340
here.
[Narrator] By the 1890s, around 20,000 people

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.439
were involved in the Northland gum industry.
Dalmatians often banded together to dig over

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:16.159
an area, while British diggers were more likely
to work alone or in pairs. M훮ori, many of

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:22.749
whom also dug for kauri gum, got on especially
well with the new immigrants. Today, a large

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:27.969
number of Northlanders have both M훮ori and
Dalmatian ancestry.

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.859
Many gum diggers asked village girls back
in Dalmatia to emigrate to Northland to become

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:39.859
wives. As the diggers prospered, many moved
away from their rough gum field camps to Dargaville.

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:44.059
By 1900, the town had about 3000 Dalmatian
residents.

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:49.870
[English voice] Dalmatians are hardy, sober,
industrious, law-abiding people who would

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.919
make admirable settlers.
[Narrator] But little was done to encourage

00:02:53.919 --> 00:03:00.919
settlement. Instead the discriminatory 1898
Kauri Gum Industry Act established kauri gum

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.489
reserves exclusively for British subjects,
forcing Dalmatians to work on privately-owned

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.219
gum fields.
Gum digging was hard work. The buried gum,

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:17.719
found at depths of up to 10 metres, was located
by probing the ground with long metal spears.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:22.449
Once the gum had been struck, the diggers
had to unearth it using specially strengthened

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.129
spades.
[Male Dalmatian voice] Ah, Dalmatia, I give

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.029
you news of your sons,
How this wild, hard country beats them down

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:37.749
In the lonely hell of gumfields.
[Narrator] Storekeepers were the main buyers

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:43.459
of kauri gum. They 'grubstaked' many diggers
-- meaning that they allowed them to buy supplies

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.479
on credit, on condition that they sold their
findings to the storekeeper.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:54.479
[Male Dalmatian voice] I dig the gum, to get
the money, to buy the food, to get the energy

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:59.769
to dig the gum.
[Narrator] In the 1930s cheaper synthetics

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:06.260
were developed for making varnish. The price
of kauri gum fell, and by the 1940s the industry

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.579
had virtually disappeared. Dalmatians diversified
into other commercial activities, especially

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:18.639
winemaking, horticulture and fishing.
Today Dargaville is the centre of an extensive

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.639
dairy farming district which also produces
90% of New Zealand's sweet potatoes, or k큰mara.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.169
Dargaville is now known as the 'K큰mara Capital
of New Zealand'.
