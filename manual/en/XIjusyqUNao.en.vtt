00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.970
How to Buy a Laptop Computer.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.850
If you're looking for more portable computing
power, this guide will help you get your geek

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.440
on while shopping for the right notebook for
your lifestyle.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.989
You will need Time Patience and basic computer
knowledge.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:22.989
Step 1.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.699
Take the time to identify your wants and needs
to narrow down your search and clarify what

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:28.999
you're looking for.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.870
Make a separate list for each to help keep
stay on budget -- if the cost is too high,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.980
remove features from your want list to bring
it down to a more practical price.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.030
Step 2.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.640
Decide on your screen size.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.590
A 14- or 15-inch screen is basic for laptops.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.540
A larger 17- or 19-inch screen can replace
most desktop computers.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.690
A smaller 7- or 10-inch netbook is more travel
friendly.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.920
Smaller notebooks usually have smaller amounts
of memory, and often lack the latest bells

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.030
and whistles in exchange for portability.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.030
Step 3.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.770
Consider a high or low resolution screen.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.520
Resolution, measured in pixels, determines
what you can see and fit on the screen.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.850
A higher resolution offers clearer images
but smaller default text size.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.100
Step 4.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.710
Look at the battery life for each of your
choices.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.509
The more powerful the computer, the quicker
it will eat up a battery -- but while a weak

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.159
laptop will stay on longer, it can leave you
wanting more later on.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.600
Consider investing in a larger replacement
battery, especially if you're constantly on

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.799
the move.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:37.799
Step 5.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.079
A powerful CPU will speed up operations and
allow you to do multiple tasks at one time.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.600
Anything above 2 gigahertz is appropriate
for general usage.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.939
Step 6.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.850
Go for a hard drive that is at least 250 gigabytes,
especially if you download of lot of music

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.509
or movies.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.679
Step 7.

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.890
Shop around or go online to find the best
deals.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.619
If you can wait, time your purchase around
back to school or after Christmas to get the

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.880
best bang for your buck.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.220
Did you know In 2010, the MC-1 notebook claimed
the title of world's smallest computer with

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.360
a 4.8-inch screen and 4 gigabytes of memory.
