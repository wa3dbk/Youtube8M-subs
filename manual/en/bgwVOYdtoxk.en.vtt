00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:04.490
we actually have some data now about
buying will be we had this question will

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.320
hurricane sandy and the political
implications that invariably follow it

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.289
have any effect on the election

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:11.110
we know that

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.990
this is an opportunity for president
obama to be in the news in a

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.880
non-political but still presidential way
and it's a time where mitt romney's

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.759
going to have trouble getting himself
into the news there's a new washington

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.039
post a_b_c_ tracking poll

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.169
which is giving us some numbers and
seventy-seven percent of those surveyed

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.220
presumably representative of of

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.560
the entire country

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.070
if you believe that this poll was done
in a way that that make sense seventy

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.370
seven percent say president obama
handled hurricane sandy very very well

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.040
now mit romney was not really in a
position to handle hurricane sandy per

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.760
se

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.220
but he did try to kind of inject himself
into it by holding this fundraiser this

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.940
storm relief event even though it was
really a planned rally he just change

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.540
the name of it to be a storm relief of
that collecting supplies against the red

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.840
cross is on indications that supplies
are not what they want but cash is what

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.330
they want and then actually turned out
that the mit romney campaign bought a

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.530
lot of those supplies that were then
donated to themselves just in case

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.240
people didn't actually show up with
donations

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.290
romney did kind of inject himself into
it and people didn't like it forty four

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.510
percent thinking that mit romney did
well surrounding hurricane sandy i mean

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.410
certainly i don't know if the approve of
the job he did phraseology is the one

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.970
that was used because it doesn't really
make sense

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.570
uh... but uh... of people saying that
uh... romney not doing so well so could

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.200
this have an effective really could i
mean if one of those left

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.820
this is one of those intangibles recant
control the weather

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.460
you know you think that the either

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.850
goddess sending of weather events for
specific reasons you can pray to making

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.360
do that or the democrats control the
weather putting all of those conspiracy

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.870
theories aside

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.730
you can't really control the weather and
this is something we're now the last

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.270
image in the last thought a lot of
people may have so-called undecideds

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.740
probably more people who are unsure if
they would vote it all right

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.310
they might say well

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.910
obama did really well and has some of
the republican governor

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.280
i think i think i am able for obama i
think that there could be some marginal

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.499
positive affect your definitely that
there could be a positive but for obama

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.869
just by doing his presidential duty of
course in romney was what he was doing

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.840
was shitty for political gain of course
had obama been doing any of this type of

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.180
pig should be proof political gain he
probably would have gone to a swing

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.739
state bright uh... so

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.219
clearly and i think obama has the
advantage here know what this made me

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.089
think of because this type of the
national weather events and disasters of

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:29.069
all kinds terrorism events

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.299
they bring people together they bring
the country together people tend to

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.510
rally around the president weber days
regardless of party

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.109
we saw that happen in two thousand one
didn't we with george w_ bush i mean

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.180
after george w_ bush gave that speech

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.279
at ground zero after nine eleven

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.749
can something like high eighties
approval now of course he went

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:51.029
completely off the deep end with his
policy in pursuit of war that made no

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.809
sense based on false pretenses and so on
and so forth destroyed the economy ended

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.759
up somehow getting reelected

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.279
the at thirty thousand vote margin in
ohio even with the sub fifty percent

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.419
approval rating if i remember correctly
or around fifty percent

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:09.689
uh... but that being said may be present
obama will actually be able to push this

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.699
into some kind of positive sentiment on
tuesday utr no regardless of the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.369
students affects i would rather the
hurricane had not happened regardless of

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:21.929
whether scores that were any politician
however i think it meets it's a logical

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:25.529
for us to simply ignore the effect that
it might have

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.109
dampened so we can talk about what
happened as a result of that
