Hello my friends and welcome to
another Tuesday of tutorial!

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.500
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and
today we will draw a Lamborghini.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
We begin by placing some
measurements like from the front

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.500
to the fenders, the height, etc.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.700
Then we sketch the super
aerodynamic shape.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.700
I mark the height of the fender
and continue with the linework.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It is not that you have
to take measurements,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but the more measurements you have,
obviously, the easiest it is going to be.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400
I take another measurement
for the windshield because it

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400
didn't look like.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And let´s continue,
this is really fun! :D

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I´ll do some corrections
on the rear part,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and we have a mess,
let´s erase all the lines

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that should not be there,
that´s better!

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.300
Finally we start shading.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.500
I am using a hard led
an H for the light shadows,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.600
a soft one a 2B for the
middle tones and a very

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.600
soft one a 6B for the darks.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.600
The complete list of materials
is in the information below the video.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.700
We continue shading.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.700
I´ll do some reflections
on the glass.

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.769
The shadow below the car is very important,

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.749
so that it does´t look like
it is flying... I know that

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.299
the Lamborghini almost
looks like a spaceship

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.200
but it should be on the ground.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.950
Many people asked me
to do this car, that´s why

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.900
I am drawing it, for you.

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.950
We can draw the street
with lines so as to give

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.600
the effect of the speed.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600
Let´s reinforce some shadows.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.700
Some reflections on the wheels
and it´s ready!

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.700
I would love to know
what do you think about it

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.000
and if you enjoyed it please give it

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.250

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.079
on Tuesday!
