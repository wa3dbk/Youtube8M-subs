Hi, I'm Amelia and I'm going to talk to you
about how to improve your hair growth. What

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.160
is most important with hair growth is you
have to remember the health of the follicle,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.379
so the follicle is the bulb where the hair
actually grows out of think of like a daffodil

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.470
and if that daffodil isn't fed then it's not
going to bloom. So once you feed that follicle

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.870
really well then you can get a lot of hair
even just out of one follicle. Follicles go

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.340
through a life and death process, once the
hair grows it stays in that growing phase

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.960
for about six months to a year, and then it
goes through a stasis phase it can stay in

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.360
that phase up to, I think five six years and
then after that is the dying phase where it

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.310
actually falls out and that's where you see
hair all over the floor hair on your clothes

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.830
that's when your hair falls out it's normal
to lose about a hundred hairs per day, and

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.770
I wouldn't get to stressed out if it seems
like you're losing a lot more, the longer

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.579
and thicker your hair is the more hair it
feels like you're losing. If you're really

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.410
concerned about it you can count them, just
keep something in the shower where you can

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.720
count them and if you feel like it's an overabundance
you can go see your doctor have your thyroid

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.920
checked. Also if you're starting to get actual
bald patches then you need to be concerned

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.810
about of course any issues that could be going
on internally. Hormones thyroid all of these

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.240
effect, stress, all of these things effect
hair growth. So if you're going to be focusing

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.159
on hair growth make sure that you take your
vitamins, b vitamins biotin all help with

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.670
hair growth you're going to want to eat properly
you're going to want to exercise because that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.771
also helps with hair growth and relieving
stress which in turn will keep your b vitamin

00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:44.250
levels up, helping your hair growth. Another
thing that works excellent is niacin, what

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.710
that does is that removes the HT off the scalp
and will also help to feed the follicle, they've

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.619
got follicle boosters in their line that you
can use that will actually sort of really

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.000
give an intense boost of vitamins to that
follicle and what that will do is feed that

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.700
follicle enough where you can get several
hairs growing out of one area, so if you notice

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.340
that your hair is falling out excessively
or if you feel like it's not growing fast

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.360
enough you can try the niacin, try your b
vitamins, talk to your doctor make sure there's

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.860
nothing going on internally, and that's some
ways to make your hair grow longer faster.
