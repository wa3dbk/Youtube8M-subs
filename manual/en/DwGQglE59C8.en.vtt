00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.230
An innovative combination of warmth and breathability,
the Patagonia men’s Nano-Air hoody offers

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.500
temperature regulation and range of motion
for cool and cold weather aerobic activities.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.080
A really light weight offering here, 13.6
ounces.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.410
Fabrication certainly plays a role in that
light weight construction.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.510
But it is an insulated piece.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.649
You have got 60 grams of Patagonia’s full
range synthetic insulation, a light weight,

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.210
compressible insulation.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.180
But it has got that nice, versatile weather
resistant quality as you would expect in a

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.879
synthetic over a down insulation.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:51.370
As far as the fabric is concerned, you have
got a light weight, durable, 20D fabrication

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.570
so a light weight fabrication there.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.219
Very breathable.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.699
You have got excellent wind resistance here
and a DWR finish to give it a little bit of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.750
weather protection.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.130
A pretty close fit on this jacket.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.990
The fabrication has a four way mechanical
stretch so it can fit pretty closely and still

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.920
be really comfortable, allow you to put low
profile base layers or even mid layers underneath

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.920
this.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.280
And you can obviously put a hard shell over
top of this or heavier pieces if you need

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.320
additional warmth or more weather protection.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.520
In terms of adjustability nice clean elastic
cuff.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.450
Also dual points of adjustability here at
the hem.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.219
It does also have an insulated hood.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.579
Pull that up and over.

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:48.899
A nice close cut to that as well, so not what
I would call a helmet compatible hood, just

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.299
a good, athletic fitting, warm hood.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.710
A little bit of elasticity so it is easy on,
easy off and ensures that it is a comfortable

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.710
fit.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.950
A few different pockets here on the jacket.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.049
Always like to see some options there.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.480
Got zippered hand warmer pockets on the front,
also dual Napoleon style pockets up higher.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.250
See those there.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.489
And, again, one on either side.

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.959
Different organizational options to keep all
different kinds of things right where you

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:22.959
need them.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.310
With that combination of warmth, comfort,
breathability, the men’s Nano-Air hoody

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.760
from Patagonia is a really, really excellent
option for any number of cool or cold weather

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.440
aerobic activity.
