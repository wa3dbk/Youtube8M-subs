00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.067
Santa’s Christmas

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:18.150
Bay Lavina Tien

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.400
It was a beautiful December day,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.067
with clear blue skies

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.150
and snow-covered treetops.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.483
and snow-covered treetops.

00:00:29.483 --> 00:00:31.233
Christmas was in the air!

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:34.567
Christmas was in the air!

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.150
But up in Santa’s lodge,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.650
all was quiet.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.900
The usual hustle and bustle

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.067
of preparing Christmas presents

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:49.400
was gone,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.817
for Santa had fallen ill.

00:00:54.817 --> 00:00:59.233
“Oh dear,

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:01.733
what will the children say

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.483
when they don’t receive presents

00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:05.733
this year?”

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.483
Santa wondered sadly,

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:14.150
as he lay on his bed.

00:01:15.983 --> 00:01:17.317
Suddenly,

00:01:17.317 --> 00:01:18.900
he heard a noise

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.817
from outside.

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:23.567
He looked

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:26.483
out of the window

00:01:26.483 --> 00:01:29.317
and saw his four reindeer

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:31.317
standing patiently

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:34.067
as usual.

00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:34.900
But they seemed

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.733
quite out of breath,

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:39.150
as if

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.067
they had just finished

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:43.900
a long trip.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.483
And as Santa took a closer look,

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.483
he could not believe

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:53.983
what he saw.

00:01:53.983 --> 00:01:57.233
For behind the reindeer

00:01:57.233 --> 00:02:02.650
was a long train of sleds,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.567
carrying little children

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:09.150
dressed in all sorts of colors.

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.567
One by one,

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:14.317
they hopped out

00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:16.567
onto the snow

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:17.483
and headed

00:02:17.483 --> 00:02:21.817
towards Santa’s lodge.

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:22.983
Soon came a knock

00:02:22.983 --> 00:02:25.983
on the door.

00:02:25.983 --> 00:02:27.317
“Come in!”

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:29.983
Santa called out,

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:34.567
for he was extremely curious.

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:36.983
In came a little girl,

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:38.983
hugging something soft

00:02:38.983 --> 00:02:41.400
around her arms.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.733
“I heard

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:43.900
that you were sick,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.233
Mr. Santa,”

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:46.233
she began.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.067
“So I’m giving you

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.233
my teddy bear,

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:53.817
to keep you company.”

00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:54.317
“Why,

00:02:54.317 --> 00:02:56.733
thank you little Emma!”

00:02:56.733 --> 00:02:58.400
said Santa,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.733
for he knew

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:04.067
every child by name.

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:08.067
Then entered

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:10.150
a young boy

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.483
with a red package

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:14.817
in his arms.

00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:15.817
“We knew

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:17.150
that you were ill,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.067
Papa Santa,” he said.

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:21.067
“So my family

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.067
knitted this quilt for you,

00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:24.900
to keep you warm

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.733
in the winter days.”

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:28.567
“Why,

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:31.817
what a wonderful thought Paul!”

00:03:31.817 --> 00:03:33.067
beamed Santa,

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:37.317
patting him on the head.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:41.067
And one by one

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:41.900
the children came in

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.150
through Santa’s door,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.317
each with a special gift

00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:47.733
to wish Santa well.

00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:51.067
to wish Santa well.

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:53.317
There were cookies,

00:03:53.317 --> 00:03:58.317
pies, socks, mittens,

00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:02.150
books, jigsaw puzzles,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.567
and even

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:07.150
a small Christmas tree!

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
“Christmas delivered

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.817
to my doorstep!”

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.067
exclaimed Santa.

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:13.900
“Come;

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.650
let us all share

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.900
these wonderful gifts.”

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.233
And he gathered the children

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:22.067
around him

00:04:22.067 --> 00:04:25.733
in a big circle.

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:26.567
“Santa,

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:27.233
which present

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:28.567
do you like best?”

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.567
Emma soon piped up.

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:34.067
“My dear little ones,”

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:37.067
Santa replied, smiling.

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:37.483
“It is the love

00:04:37.483 --> 00:04:39.733
and kindness

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:40.983
that each of you

00:04:40.983 --> 00:04:45.233
has shown me today

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:50.817
that is the best present of all.”

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.900
He looked fondly

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.983
at all the eager faces

00:04:56.983 --> 00:04:59.483
around him.

00:04:59.483 --> 00:05:01.983
“This, my little ones,

00:05:01.983 --> 00:05:03.733
is the true meaning

00:05:03.733 --> 00:05:08.067
of Christmas.”

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.150
And with that,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.233
Santa gave

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:12.567
each of the children

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:16.983
a big, warm holiday hug.
