00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.040 line:84%
Class of 2015, friends
and family, and members

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.290 line:84%
of the Harvard business
school and community.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.290 line:90%
Good afternoon, and welcome.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.440 line:84%
I'm going to talk
to you about 3 Ps.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.235 line:84%
Purpose, perseverance,
and perspective.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.450 line:84%
In my experience, it's easier
to sustain energy and enthusiasm

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.200 line:84%
in your work if you're
animated by a powerful belief

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.830 line:84%
in the good you are doing
and by the knowledge

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.000 line:84%
that your work has
a greater purpose.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.550 line:84%
We will now present the diplomas
for the Master in Business

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.530 line:84%
Administration degrees starting,
unsurprisingly, with section A.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.940 line:84%
I believe there's a desperate
need for good leadership

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.010 line:84%
in the world, that business can
be a powerful force for good

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.660 line:90%
in society.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.470 line:84%
And that force can be
leveraged and magnified

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.060 line:84%
if organizations are led by
well-trained and thoughtful

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.150 line:90%
leaders.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.175 line:84%
Continue to remember the
importance of perseverance,

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:16.280 line:84%
because success and progress
will not always come so easily.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.540 line:84%
They may sometimes require
long and patient work

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.000 line:84%
to overcome both
legitimate hurdles

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.275 line:90%
and systemic injustices.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.580 line:84%
But people who make a sharp
turn whenever they face failure,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.810 line:84%
often spend their lives
turning left and right

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.190 line:84%
and risk never really
reaching anywhere.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.210 line:84%
You always learn something
by standing in another place

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.742 line:90%
and getting another view.

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:52.200 line:84%
Perspective sometimes also
requires putting yourself

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.050 line:90%
in another person's position.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.966 line:90%
To see the world how they might.

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.280 line:84%
And to have the
empathy that is so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.232 line:84%
vital for productive
relationships.

00:02:01.232 --> 00:02:05.830 line:84%
As you begin this journey,
I wish you Godspeed.
