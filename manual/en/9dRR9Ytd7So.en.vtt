00:00:00.224 --> 00:00:04.758
- [Voiceover] Hi. Dan
here from karmanauto.com

00:00:04.758 --> 00:00:08.892
To show you how the process of clearing,

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:09.725
crash data

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.033
from the

00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:16.068
GM airbag control module.

00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:18.818
This is the ones that are sealed.

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:22.509
These are the other
options, that are sealed.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.681
These we'll actually have to make

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:26.489
a little incision

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.781
and get to the board
and then weld onto it,

00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:33.290
solder onto it and then program these.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.560
These you can actually do
without doing anything.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.020
We've got a special connector,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.102
we just connect it and then it
goes through the programmer.

00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:45.479
Which is pretty spendy, a good programmer.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.029
If you don't have a good programmer,

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.862
you'll have to open it up

00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:51.445
and yeah it's a pretty
big job to do those.

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:55.456
And then, if you do have a programmer,

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:56.706
all you have to

00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:01.148
do is

00:01:01.148 --> 00:01:02.315
read the file.

00:01:03.444 --> 00:01:05.956
This is called, also, a dump.

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:08.023
Once you read the dump,

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:11.367
you'll also need to have some basic,

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:13.861
or at least professional skills

00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:16.940
on programming the hex decks.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.431
You'll have to have a good or
a bad dump for that particular

00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.162
part number and a bad dump.

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:26.253
So that way you would know,
where the crash data is stored.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:28.004
Cause when you read it,

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.004
all you'll see is a bunch of numbers.

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.271
And if you don't know what you're reading

00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:35.965
you're not going to be able to program

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:39.064
these other bunch of numbers
that you're gonna have.

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:40.557
That you're gonna get.

00:01:40.557 --> 00:01:43.641
So in order for you to
clear the crash data,

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.474
you would have to know

00:01:46.714 --> 00:01:48.541
the programming skills.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.509
So, listen, I do this all the time.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.509
All I do is just clear it right here

00:01:55.462 --> 00:01:56.295
and then

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:02.286
press right.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:08.556
So what I did is just cleaned
up the original program.

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:11.806
Everything stays the same if you have a

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:15.082
then or a seat program to it

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:16.811
everything stays the same

00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:19.712
all we did is just cleaned the crash data

00:02:19.712 --> 00:02:22.962
and now the computer is as good as new,

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:27.042
without making any

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:28.217
holes in here.

00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:32.090
So, that's how you clear the crash data

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.289
on the GM, these are one of
the easiest ones you can do.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.621
So, if you need yours cleared,

00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:42.522
send it out to karmanauto.com

00:02:42.522 --> 00:02:45.263
There'll be an address
on there so actually go

00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:47.323
to our website karmanauto.com

00:02:47.323 --> 00:02:51.323
and follow the instructions
for GM airbag reset.
