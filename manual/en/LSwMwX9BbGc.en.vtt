00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.620
Put on a cap that produces an electrical current
and BAM, you’re a creative genius who can

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.829
always focus and is never sad.

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:13.500
It seems like science fiction, yet scientists
are exploring a real-life thinking cap.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.810
Hey brainiacs Julia here for DNews

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.920
Thinking caps are an old idea.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.630
Some type of electric charge delivered to
the brain to increase performance have been

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.100
around for nearly two centuries.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.900
Yet it doesn’t have the best reputation.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.500
Electroshock therapy recalls images of institutional
torture during the mid-20th century for mental

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
health patients.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.800
But in recent decades, the technique has been
refined and made humane.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.970
It’s proved very effective for even the
worst cases of clinical depression and certain

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.970
conditions with seizures.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.739
But that’s not the only type of brain stimulation
used today.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.469
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
is similar to electroconvulsive therapy, it

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.210
uses non-invasive electrodes placed on the
scalp to send a small electric charge to stimulate

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.530
specific parts of the brain.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.650
but it uses 1/400ths of the charge that ECT
uses.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.250
Some studies show that depending on the type
of charge, positive or negative, it can reduce

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.650
concentrations of inhibitory neurotransmitters
or reduce types of neurotransmitters that

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.369
excited connections between neurons.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.460
Several studies like one published in The
Journal of the American Medical Association-Psychiatry

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.360
found that it’s as effective as Zoloft in
treating some cases of depression.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.031
And several studies have explored its use
as a treatment for ADHD.

00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:26.030
Yet a recent study says tDCS might not live
up to the hype.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.510
One study published in the journal Behavior
Brain Research found that it doesn’t deliver

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.549
on supercharging smarts.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.780
The researchers tested 40 participants using
the standard WAIS-IV intelligence test, a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.920
measure of IQ before and after treatment with
tDCS.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.950
The researchers figured IQ would increase
after the tDCS, partly because of familiarity

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.190
with test, but their scores would increase
more than a control group’s.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.329
But they found some surprising results.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.759
The group who received the treatment, did
worse in one area of the test that measures

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.630
logic and problem solving.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.070
The researchers caution that not a lot is
known about this technique and we don’t

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.780
know what the long term effects are.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.640
Maybe supercharging one part of the brain
could damage another.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.470
They also stressed that, well, more research
is needed.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.810
The American military is interested in another
technique that’s a little more invasive.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.959
Deep brain stimulation involves cutting a
small hole in the skull and placing an electrode…

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:12.959
well deep into the brain.

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.140
The devices works well as a treatment for
diseases like depression and Parkinson’s.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.469
In fact about 100,000 people use deep brain
stimulation, according to the makers of one

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.700
such device.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.519
The Military is particularly interested in
using it to treat PTSD and other disorders.

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.809
In studies in mice with a type of PTSD, DBS
worked better than current treatment methods

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.999
like selective serotonin uptake inhibitors.

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.590
The device could work well in a military setting
by changing the neural activity in the amygdala.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.480
The amygdala plays a role in process emotions
and reactions like fear.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.949
So DBS could dampen activity in that part
of the brain when a soldier experiences a

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:51.519
traumatic event, basically lessing the emotion
associated with that memory.

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.239
So yeah, super scienced up soldiers who experience
no fear, that’s not scary at all.

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.049
So there’s clearly a lot of ethical issues
surrounding these kind of technologies.

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.029
While therapeutic for some, in the wrong hands,
it could change the game for what it means

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:05.029
to be human.

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.769
But for now if you want to improve your focus
or boost your creativity either hit the gym

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.040
or drink some coffee to give you an edge.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.829
Speaking of getting an edge in the workplace,
a great website is a good place to start.

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.919
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:23.110
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%
off Domain Dot Com’s names and web hosting

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.609
by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.730
And speaking of intelligence, is the IQ test
all it's cracked up to be?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:53.169
Laci takes a deeper look at what having a
high IQ really means, in this video.
