00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:09.260
Chillies are surprisingly easy to grow and
with so many varieties available

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.500
there's one to suit everybody's taste buds.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.100
Now here in the UK we can't guarantee a long hot summer

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.039
so it's best to start off your chilli
peppers indoors as early as possible.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.749
January or February is ideal because it
gives the peppers plenty of time to ripen

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:22.990
before the end of summer.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.269
Sow your chilli seeds in seed trays or small
pots

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.800
of moist free draining seed compost

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.000
and then cover them with a fine sprinkling of compost or vermiculite.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
Today I'm sowing 'Naga Jolokia'
which are one of the world's hottest chilli peppers.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.800
You need to water your seeds lightly
after sowing to provide sufficient moisture

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.000
for them to germinate, and don't forget
to label them.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.950
Chillies need a temperature of 18 to 25 degrees Celsius to germinate

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.500
so it's a good idea to invest in a heated
propagator, but if you don't have a propagator

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.000
then just seal the pot inside a ziplock bag - it helps to keep the seeds warm and moist.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.909
Chilli seeds normally take 7 to 10 days
to germinate

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.020
but it depends on the variety and some of them
can take up to a month.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.100
You'll need to keep an eye on the compost
to make sure that it stays constantly moist

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.000
but never too wet because that could
cause the seeds to rot.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.280
These chillies were sown a couple of weeks ago

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.780
and they're now a few millimetres high so they
can be moved to slightly cooler

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.530
conditions to prevent their growth
becoming soft and spindly.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.610
Somewhere warm and bright like a sunny
windowsill or a heated greenhouse is ideal.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.060
After a few weeks they should be large
enough to handle

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.500
and you can prick them out into individual
pots.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.090
Hold each seedling by its leaves

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.840
and gently tease it out of the compost using
a dibber or the tip of a pencil.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.600
Try to avoid handling the stem of the
seedling as this can easily be bruised and damaged.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.000
Transplant each seedling into its own
pot and gently firm the compost around the roots

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.500
before watering them to settle the soil.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.890
The seedlings will
need to grow on in a bright greenhouse

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.479
or a warm sunny windowsill for a bit
longer. These plants are about three months old

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.000
and they're starting to put on some really good growth.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.280
When you start to see fine white roots

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.660
emerging through the drainage holes in
the bottom of the pots then you know

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.060
that they're rooted in properly

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.000
and they're ready to be transplanted
again.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.150
If you want to continue growing your chillies in the greenhouse

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.500
then transplant them into 2 litre containers or grow bags.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.900
If you don't have a greenhouse then wait until all
risk of frost has passed

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.790
and you can plant them in a sheltered
sunny spot outdoors either in containers

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.360
or moist fertile soil.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.349
You need to acclimatise them to outdoor
conditions for a few days beforehand.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.000
Just pop them outside during the day and
bring them back indoors at night.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.069
Throughout the summer you'll need to keep
them well watered

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.349
and feed them regularly with a high potash
tomato fertiliser.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.750
It's best to keep them a little on the dry side
because stressing them very slightly

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.900
helps to produce hotter peppers.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.370
You won't need to side-shoot your chilli plants
as you would for tomatoes

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.800
but the taller varieties may require
some staking just to support their stems.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.670
From an early sowing you should be able to
start harvesting chilli peppers from late July

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.000
and continue right through to the autumn.
