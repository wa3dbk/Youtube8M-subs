00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.890
Most of the world knows something
about our history,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.390
the history of South Africa.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.630
The prejudice and the pain of
apartheid.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.030
They know something about our people,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.910
the places and the major players.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.710
And then, there was that day.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.920
The time for the miracle,
when the world watched

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.980
and then rejoiced and thanked God.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.850
So, let's start then.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.460
Here, in Cape Town,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.130
the city where in 2010

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.300
the Third Lausanne Congress on
World Evangelization will take place.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.630
In many ways Cape Town
is the perfect place.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.610
Cape Town is a beautiful city
situated at the tip of Africa.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.490
A city of contrasts.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.800
Thousands of Christian believers
live and worship in this city.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.810
About 200 years ago,
a man called William Carey,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.310
said that one day there would be
a conference like Lausanne,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.960
here in Africa.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.590
It is simply awesome
that it is happening soon

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.150
in 2010.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.430
Cape Town has a population
of 3.5 million.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.560
Transports is accessible,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.160
and our hotels are of an
international standard.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.540
There is so much to see and do.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.950
And here we are at the Cape Town
International Convention Center

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.200
where the Lausanne 2010 meetings
will be held.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.230
It is from this venue
that we will engage with

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.400
the tough issues facing the church.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.740
Together, we will seek to discern
God's purposes for this generation.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.480
Together, we will pray
and plan strategically

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.850
for global missions
and evangelization.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.090
God wants to do a new thing here
in 2010.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.890
This is his project
for the global church

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.530
and it's all going to happen
right here.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.700
Join us in Cape Town 2010.
