00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.099
Welcome brothers and sisters to the fifth
meeting of the Royal Order of the Holy Mackerel.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:16.099
A secret society dedicated to discovering,
decoding, and protecting the secrets of Gravity

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.430
Falls. I am this chapters founder and duly
appointed High Exhaulted Big Fish, Douglas

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.500
Mackrell. Before we start, the minutes of
last week's meeting can be found here, via

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.520
this link - and now for this week's order
of business: Dipper's secret first name.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.940
For those who may not have realized, Dipper
is not Dipper's true first name. It's a nickname

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.940
that he was either given or assumed because
of a birthmark on his forehead that he keeps

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.040
hidden at all times by pushing his hair forward
and pinning under a baseball cap. In the entire

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.200
first season of Gravity Falls - including
the shorts - he never uses his first name.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.170
Oddly, I don't see many people speculating
about this in videos or about the web. Perhaps

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.500
it's because there's no concrete clues to
what his real name could be. The closest we

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.840
ever come is when Quentin Tribbly calls Dipper
"Roderick" - but Dipper's reaction leads the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.580
audience to believe that he's way off.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.580
Now, I do have a theory on Dipper's true name,
but it requires that you accept Stan's Secret

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.830
Twin theory. I've spoken about this before
in a previous meeting, and you can learn all

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.830
about it or brush up on the theory now by
clicking this link. So - for the sake of this

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.060
theory, assume that Stan does have a secret
twin brother who is named Stanley.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.640
If we look again at the Pines family tree,
we can see a lot of unknown branches. We know

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.200
- twin or not - that Stan MUST have a brother
in order for him to be Dipper and Mabel's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.200
Great Uncle. And if the Pines family is redundant
enough to name two brothers so similarly named

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.099
- I wouldn't be surprised if they also passed
that name down the lineage as well. If that's

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.959
the case, that could mean that Dipper and
Mabel's father could be named Stanley Junior

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.959
- and this could very possibly mean that Dipper's
true name could be Stanley Pines the Third!

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.599
Granted - this is a fairly huge leap in logic,
but even if you don't believe that Dipper

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.599
is named after his father and his grandfather
before him - there's still a lot of heartbreaking

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.290
story that needs to be addressed in the show.
We still don't know the whereabouts of Dipper

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.360
and Mabel's grandfather or grandmother. All
we know for certain is that at some point

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.360
they gave birth to Dipper and Mabel's father.
And, that if the calendar is true and he did

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.459
go missing in 1982 - he would have disappeared
around the same time his son was born.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.690
But that's just my theory. What do you think
Dippers real name will be? Leave your theories

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.090
and suggestions in the comments below! And
now, before we close today's meeting, one

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.840
last order of business.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.760
It's almost Thanksgiving here in the states!
Me? I'm personally thankful that the Royal

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.760
Order of the Holy Mackerel now has over 200
subscribers. This show has really only been

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:00.959
possible thanks to all of you who watch and
comment and pass the trials to join up. And

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.739
before I close up shop for the holiday, I
just want to wish you and yours a fun - and

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:19.739
most importantly - an easy Thanksgiving. A
lot of people get lost in tradition and reaching

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:27.669
for perfection, and sometimes lose track of
the fact that it's supposed to be about togetherness.

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:34.669
And now for this week's challenge: Mabel's
Maze! It's a holiday, and I feel like all

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:41.939
our members could use a little bit of fun!
If you can solve the three encoded riddles,

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:49.319
you'll get a download of an activity filled
placemat from Greasy's Diner! With no other

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.279
orders of business, I hereby call a close
to this weeks meeting of the Royal Order of

00:04:56.279 --> 00:05:03.279
the Holy Mackerel. Until next time, share,
subscribe, and keep cracking those codes.
