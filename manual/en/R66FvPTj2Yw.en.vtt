00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.890
for our country and our had never directed
a blockbuster

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.409
the emphasis on character was just with his
middle to afternoon

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:10.099
the story

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:10.599
liane

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.779
was much more difficult

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.179
I felt I needed few over

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.599
in the picture

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.759
and yet I could have gagged

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.080
I felt I needed a love story

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.980
and yet I couldn't have

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.869
a lot of smoke change and kissing and a lot
of stuff

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.500
and it happened all these more implied

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.670
ooh I can be the something

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.940
powerful going on in this audience looks old

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.600
and he really carries the picture of course

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.370
so

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.860
I didn't know quite how it was going to do
this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.630
we look at this scene

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.410
I'm still goes into the freezing to you

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.660
georgian scripted

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.380
an exchange between princess leia and non-smokers
from the like this she said I love you

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.270
and counsel knows that

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.820
I love you too

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.909
kind of %uh it seems to me that we were taking
advantage of the character that was damaged

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.090
her own soul

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.820
we tried a the victory

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.030
nothing's at this point

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.670
and finally

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.280
I said piracy

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.700
don't think about it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.300
talking about let's do it

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.980
action

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.409
and the thought that I should cut

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:35.920
thank you

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.460

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.880
that's what it's all about week shop

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.409
civil suits in denver over again this is seen
in the crowd city where council of character

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.909
is kind of pacing up and down and princess
leia comes in

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.829
and he reacts to the way she looks pretty
stressed differently than she has an entire

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.049
rest of the film

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.439

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.890

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.869
I haven't made a decision right

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.169

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:22.889
carlson
