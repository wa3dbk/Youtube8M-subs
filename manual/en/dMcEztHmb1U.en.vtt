00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.840
 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.990
Oceans are the lifeblood of our planet
and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.619
coral reef ecosystems are really

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.680
the heart of places like the U.S. Caribbean.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.680
Growing up in Florida my favorite
thing to do was to strap on fins and a mask

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.610
and go explore the patch reefs.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.590
Back then the reefs were healthier and they
were filled with fish.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.699
I want other kids be able to experience
this wonder and beauty

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:51.000
and that's why I work to protect these
reefs.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.040
It's easy not pay attention to things
that are happening under water, it's hard to see.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.980
So it's important for us to be able to
shine a light and bring these things

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.260
to the attention

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.260
of the public, as well as government
and judges at times.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.659
There is a

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.380
reef fish fishery in the US Caribbean
that targets parrotfish.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.399
Parrotfish are important because
they graze the algae off the reef and that's

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.369
how they protect coral.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.200
Allowing a lot of fishing for parrotfish,
they're taking out

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.460
the fish that are cleaning the reef
and making space for the corals to grow.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.580
That's really what this is about at the
end of the day is protecting these

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.450
corals

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.550
and the habitat that they actually
create.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.619
We're talking about these corals that
have declined by

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.659
ninety-eight percent in our
lifetime. We're really at a critical

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.369
point

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.369
for some of these reefs.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.159
The one thing that we can all agree on

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.509
is that the corals need more fish, the
fishermen need more fish,

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.600
and the people need more fish. Overfishing
then

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.950
becomes almost like a cancer and it
starts to erode

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.209
the system as a whole. The

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.820
system is failing us, we're working to
rebuild

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.840
reefs and restore that living
framework.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.420
One of the major ways we can get our
voice heard is to partner with

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.130
organizations like Earthjustice,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.680
who who take what we have to
say and form it into a credible argument

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.310
and then get it out there.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.130
 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.290
We took the National Marine Fisheries
Service to court because

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.940
fishing for parrotfish was contributing
to a pretty steep decline in two

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.950
species of coral

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.489
Elkhorn and Staghorn Coral. These two
coral species provide

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.130
excellent habitat and they used to be
the main reef building corals,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.760
so because these are protected under the
Endangered Species Act, we had kind of a

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.430
legal hook there.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.989
As a result of the lawsuit,

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.040
National Marine Fisheries is going to have to
do a much better job monitoring

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.480
fisheries impacts to coral reefs. The good news is
that people are really paying attention now

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.250
 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.600
and there are opportunities for people
to take action to make sure that their

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.860
kids and grandkids

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.790
can still experience healthy coral reefs.
There's real

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.630
wonder and beauty that deserves to
persist on the planet

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.880
and I think we have a  real responsibility to
take care of that.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.709
Coral reefs can't speak for themselves,

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.930
we have to speak for them.
