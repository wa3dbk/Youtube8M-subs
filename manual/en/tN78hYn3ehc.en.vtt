[music]

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.330
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Our body is always in flux:

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.240
when we are cold our body shivers;

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.900
when we are hot our body sweats.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.020
Our body engages in these activities to keep
to keep our internal temperature constant.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.340
This is an example of homeostasis, which is
defined as

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.090
the ability of the body to maintain a constant
internal state.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.260
One major way the body maintains homeostasis
is through the endocrine system.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.450
The endocrine system is the system of glands
that produce hormones

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.810
to regulate and control bodily activities.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.359
The endocrine system controls a number of important functions throughout the body,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.220
including growth and development, metabolism, and homeostasis.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.040
There are many different hormones in the body,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.720
and each is responsible for different functions.

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:05.109
Estrodiol, testosterone, insulin, growth hormone, and epinephrine are just a few examples of hormones.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.060
Although they are involved in different 
functions of the endocrine system,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.499
hormones work in a similar manner.

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.099
First, a gland in detects a change in the body's internal environment.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.400
This gland then increases the secretion of
hormones, which enter the bloodstream.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.131
Hormones travel through the blood and can
have potential effects throughout the body.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.860
However, hormones will not act on every cell.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.980
Hormones activitate target cells by binding
to specific receptors

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.399
on the outside or inside the target cells.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.540
When a hormone binds to a receptor, the receptor
sends a signal throughout the cell.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.500
Just like a megaphone amplifies the volume
of a person's voice,

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.969
a hormone's message is amplified inside
the cell.

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:58.169
This signal goes a long way. Just a few hormones
can induce great change.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.999
Once hormones have succeeded in sending their
message to their target cells,

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:09.439
and, in this case, homeostasis is achieved,
the gland decreases the secretion of hormones.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.200
The mechanism by which the gland stops secreting
hormones is called negative feedback.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.049
What exactly is negative feedback?

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.809
Negative feedback allows a system to self
regulate a response or output.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.420
The following example may help explain.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.080
 A house regulates its temperature using negative feedback.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.300
When a thermostat detects a decrease in temperature,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.600
it sends a message to the furnace to produce
heat.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.140
When the thermostat detects that the room
temperature has returned to the correct level,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.381
it stops sending its message to the furnace.

00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:49.401
A furnace will turn on and off several times
a day to keep the temperature relatively constant.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.200
Now lets look at a specific example of homeostasis

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.200
using a hormone that many of you may have already heard of: insulin.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.639
Lets say a person eats a meal.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:10.400
As the food is digested and glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream, blood glucose levels begin to rise.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.780
It is important for this glucose to be removed
from the blood,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.880
otherwise it may cause damage to important
organs such as the liver, brain, and kidneys.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.830
Thus, to maintain blood glucose levels,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.010
insulin is released from an endocrine gland: the pancreas.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.570
The pancreas senses increased blood glucose and releases insulin into the blood.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.620
Insulin travels through the blood and binds to receptors on muscles, fat tissue, and as shown here, the liver.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.740
Upon binding to receptors, insulin causes
an increase in glucose transporters,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.660
allowing excess glucose to be taken from the blood and stored in the liver for future use.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.840
This uptake of glucose by the liver and other organs for storage,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.560
restores blood glucose levels back to a balanced state.

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.509
Homeostasis has been achieved!

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.280
Because blood glucose levels have reached
homeostasis,

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.159
the pancreas will stop secreting insulin.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.060
This is just one type of hormone involved in the endocrine system.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.580
Remember, the glands of the endocrine system send messages to the body in a similar manner.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.920
 A gland senses a change in the body...

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.780
and secretes a hormone.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.940
Hormones travel through the blood.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.500
Hormones are receptor specific.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.270
A hormone's signal is amplified.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.780
And finally, hormones are regulated by feedback --

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.100
many times, negative
feedback.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.860
