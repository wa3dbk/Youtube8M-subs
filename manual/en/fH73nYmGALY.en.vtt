00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.620
Oh, boy.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:26.680
I mean, this is like…you know how you used
to have to crank the handle to open windows

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.680
in your car?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.680
Remember that?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.839
And then, you remember that period of time
when power windows slowly started to become

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:33.969
the standard?

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.929
That little buffer period between the two
periods?

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.350
Remember what you thought when, like…your
friend would pick you up?

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.109
And you’d see that his car still had the
crankers?

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.420
No, no—you don’t have to lie, time has
passed.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.039
You were like, “Oh, f*ck me, I’m friends
with a loser.”

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.749
WCW Nitro is like the video game equivalent
of that friend.

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.300
The loser.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.460
You see, this is what I’m talking about.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.210
This game came to the Nintendo 64…in 1999.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270
Why is that significant?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.480
Well, because in 1998, there was a WCW game
called Revenge.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.910
A little game that, for the purposes of our
story, was like the power windows of wrestling

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.910
video games.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.280
We had power windows, everyone loved power
windows…

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.010
And then Nitro pulls up.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.100
“Hey, want to go the mall?

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.350
Hop in, roll down the window!”

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.600
“Just crank it a few dozen times.”

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.660
“You see, I’m very poor.”

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.620
And I know what you’re thinking.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.180
“Hey, in 1999, 1998 wasn’t that long ago.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.840
Maybe power windows weren’t the standard
yet.”

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.730
Wow, you’re a fair person who doesn’t
judge poor people with cheap cars.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.570
And maybe you’re right.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.860
But, oh, wait…in 1997, there was this WCW
game called World Tour…that pretty much,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.250
basically, introduced power windows.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.590
And 97 was longer before 99 than 98 was before
99.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.000
I don’t even know what the hell those numbers
mean.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.590
And now I have a headache.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.620
Better roll down the windows—OH, A CRANKER?

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.999
F*CK YOU, NITRO.

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:25.760
No, I’ll tell you what gives me a headache.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.499
Going back to something that we improved on,
after we already improved on it.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.939
And that’s what Nitro asks you to do.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:36.569
This is a wrestling game, on the Nintendo
64, the platform king of wrestling games…that

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.170
ignores all the games that made it the king.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.200
Revenge, No Mercy, World Tour, WrestleMania
2000…they changed the genre.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.010
They took a revolutionary new approach to
wrestling games that eliminated the need for

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.719
stupid, cumbersome, unintuitive button combinations
to perform basic wrestling moves.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.499
So how do you play Nitro?

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:03.340
Stupid, cumbersome, unintuitive button combinations
to perform basic wrestling moves.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.709
You want to know how to do a choke slam in
this game?

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.170
I’m not sh*tting you—you press up on the
direction pad, then the C-Down button, then

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.349
C-Right, C-Right.

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.349
Four buttons.

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.879
Hey, how about Savage’s elbow drop?

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.139
Holy crap, it’s four different buttons,
but first you have to climb the rope, and

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.719
you have to do all this before your opponent
gets up.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:27.660
I mean, the Hulk Hogan leg drop…is up, and
then C-Left, C-Left again, then C-Down.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.599
That’s four buttons for a leg drop.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.090
Your three-year-old nephew can do a leg drop.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.959
With a soggy diaper.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:47.689
So I mean…obviously, I’m not a fan of
this style of wrestling game.

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.000
Maybe you are, and that’s fine.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.159
But you have to admit…this is a lot less
intuitive than the AKI system, which is what

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.940
made games like Revenge so good.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.870
I mean, wrestling games were among the best
multiplayer games on the Nintendo 64, and

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.719
with Revenge, anyone could play.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.510
It was easy for people to jump in.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.719
This is like memorizing a cheat sheet.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.129
It’s basically cheating.

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.389
Which is probably why it can’t afford a
better car.

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.779
Nitro never learned anything on its own.

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:18.090
And to be fair, I mean…I don’t know, there
are obviously a lot of positives.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.259
It’s got more than 60 characters, which
is awesome, and there’s a strong amount

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.760
of multiplayer options…but that’s the
thing.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.200
No one wants to play this with you.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.590
Trust me, they’re just being nice.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.419
And it’s not just the combos, either.

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.530
The game just feels clunky.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.460
It really doesn’t play that well, and it’s
never much fun.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:46.919
And the graphics and sound are, just…passable,
at best.

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.160
I still throw Nintendo 64 parties.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.250
To this day.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.669
Usually, my Nintendo 64 parties just turn
into GoldenEye parties, but before that happens…we

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.729
play Revenge, too.

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.150
And you see, we can do that…because it still
plays well.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.430
If I tried to force Nitro on them, they’d
stop being my friends.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.621
Hell, I wouldn’t even like me anymore.

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:06.450
And no one likes me more than me.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.320
I also like wrestling, too.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.960
And wrestling games.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.030
But if I’ve learned anything from Back To
The Future, it’s that the past isn’t to

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.030
be trifled with.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.919
Unless you can use it to amass a fortune,
or get your dad’s book published.

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.259
And listen, I’ll be honest, I don’t see
that happening from playing this thing.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.590
I played it, it was okay, but given power
windows, it’s also kind of pointless.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.300
Kind of like WCW.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.629
It’s WCW Mayhem, for the Nintendo 64.

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.319
Another wrestling game sent to Classic Game
Room, by Kris from Jersey City, New Jersey.

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.770
Hey, I bet Kris sent this from the future.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.250
Perhaps he’s trying to tell us…how to…get
our book published.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.930
I don’t know.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:54.060
I’m not gonna play anymore to find out.
