00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
If you've been watching my videos for a while, you probably know how much I love

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:06.586
handmade products and shops on etsy.com

00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:10.040
I have my own etsy shop, Fairweather Friends, but I also love to support

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.600
other artists and makers whenever I can.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.740
Today, I wanted to tell you guys about some of my favorite etsy shops and show you the things that I've bought from them!

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.580
I'll be putting all kinds of information and links to where you can find their work in the video description below

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.780
so definitely check that out if you're interested.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.200
First up is a business called Figs and Ginger!

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.940
Figs and Ginger makes probably my favorite jewelry of all time. All of their designs have these adorable little animals on them,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.620
they're all nature-inspired, they're beautiful and tiny,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.880
they use recycled metals to make them!

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
I wear their little bird studs in my ears pretty much every single day.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.540
I'm really picky about my jewelry and they are one of the few companies that,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.320
every single time they release something new, I'm in love with it, it's 100% my style,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.000
I've given a bunch of their pieces of jewelry away as gifts and people always love them.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.020
I really just can't recommend them highly enough.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.951
They're also really big Harry Potter fans and they're in a band!

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.240
If you're looking for beautiful nature-inspired jewelry that you can wear with pretty much anything, you absolutely have to check out Figs and Ginger.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.000
The next shop that I really love is Threadfollower, also known as Cynthia Treen Studio.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.676
I originally found her because she sells at craft shows and RISD alumni sales near where I live.

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:23.356
And she designs beautifully detailed plush toys and then she puts together these adorable little kits

00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:27.956
that include the pattern, instructions for how to make them, and all of the materials you need.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.060
I bought her Felix fox kit and made this little fox using her instructions.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.780
Normally, the plush toys that I make are very simple, and they're made out of fleece, and they don't have clothes

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:46.140
and this was such a cool project to do. It was really cool making a piece that was totally different from the style that I work in normally

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.560
and it was so much fun to make this.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.840
I'm definitely going to get more of her kits in the future because I had such a great time making this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.180
and he sits up on my shelf and I love him so much.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.540
She also has different projects for different difficulty levels so she has stuff that's a little bit easier

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.440
to make than this fox, which was more intermediate to difficult.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.440
So if you're just starting out making plush toys, there are plenty of easier projects in her store that you could make.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.040
The next shop that I absolutely love is Cat Rabbit Plush.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.767
I have not had the opportunity to buy one of her pieces yet but I definitely will at some point.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:20.598
She makes some of the coolest, weirdest, most detailed, beautiful plush toys that I've ever seen.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:22.118
They're really sculptures.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.000
They all have the greatest little clothes and accessories and they have so much personality!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.391
As a plush maker myself, I admire Cat Rabbit so much.

00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:35.591
I actually encountered one of her pieces in the wild one time - it was a Ron Weasley doll that she made for

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.800
my friend Paul DeGeorge from Harry and the Potters and when I spotted it in Wonder Fair, which is the gallery

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.680
and store that Paul and his wife Meredith own in Lawrence, KS, I was so excited!

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.400
After years of just adoring her work, that was a really cool surprise

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.060
and I was really pumped to just get to see one up close and see all of the little details and ahh it was so great.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.740
Her characters also appear in books and some really beautiful animations which I'm going to link to you guys

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.560
in the video description - you have to check them out.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.860
The next shop is called Inedible Jewelry.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.360
They make the cutest, tiniest polymer clay food jewelry and I love it so much.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.180
Last Christmas, I bought myself a pair of sugar cookie snowman earrings

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.260
and I wore them to the Yule Ball and when I got them in the mail, I was just so surprised at

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.540
how tiny and detailed and beautiful they are.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.542
And you can't eat them, but you probably wouldn't want to because they're really well-made and beautiful and I just like them a whole lot.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:34.202
The next one is Sweet Beastiary and I also haven't managed to buy anything from this store yet,

00:03:34.202 --> 00:03:36.980
but every time I look at her work, I just get so happy!

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.590
She makes these beautiful little hand-painted sculptures and her characters are so whimsical and weird and I love them.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.410
The next shop is Chandler the Robot.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.095
This one is owned and run by Meg Frampton, who is a brilliant musician who started making jewelry between tours.

00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:55.185
So I relate to her story quite a bit and that makes me extra excited to support her.

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:59.625
She makes these wonderful little robot necklaces! I have this little Chandler bot with the headphones

00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:01.800
and an aviator with a scarf and some goggles.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.520
She also does other items in the same style and I bought these little clock earrings from her as well.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.521
And the last one I'm going to talk about today is called Sepia Lepus.

00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:15.315
She's an artist named Carrie Wagner and I originally found her because she sells her work in and around Providence, RI.

00:04:15.315 --> 00:04:21.418
I absolutely love her art style, she does a lot of really beautiful work that features animals like these narwhals.

00:04:21.418 --> 00:04:23.959
I also have a lot of prints of her work hanging in my living room.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:26.659
She also usually hides a little rabbit in each of her paintings

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.840
and I particularly like this little mer-rabbit swimming with the narwhals.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.432
That's it for now, but if you guys enjoy this kind of video and you'd like to see more like it, let me know!

00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:40.016
I get really excited about handmade art and I would love to share more of my favorites with you guys in the future.

00:04:40.016 --> 00:04:44.275
In the comments, tell me about your favorite etsy shops! Thanks for watching and I'll see you soon.
