of only one 260 balloon

00:00:11.696 --> 00:00:15.840
stretch the balloon

00:00:24.408 --> 00:00:36.600
inflate, leaving 7 fingers tail 

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:41.800
tie close to the ringlet

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.192
move the air

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:51.696
make small pinch

00:00:52.944 --> 00:01:00.872
make a fist size bubble

00:01:01.376 --> 00:01:08.608
or a bit greater then 4 fingers

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.152
make another small bubble

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:21.272
twist it into a pinch

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:26.824
squeeze, another fist size bubble

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.584
make soft 2 and half fingers bubble

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.520
twist it into a pinch

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.464
squeeze here

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:48.056
and make 7 fingers bubble

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.008
twist it into a loop

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.584
and put this pinch into it

00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:14.680
make another the same bubble

00:02:15.328 --> 00:02:20.120
wrap around the pinch

00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:28.768
squeeze here

00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:35.128
to get such a beak

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.752
and squeeze again here

00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:42.128
to move the air back

00:02:42.264 --> 00:02:45.320
take the tip

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:48.424
fold it like this

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:53.000
hold and press here and here

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.784
holding the tip

00:02:57.904 --> 00:03:03.040
so we've got such a head

00:03:05.144 --> 00:03:09.176
twist about 4 fingers

00:03:10.304 --> 00:03:18.512

00:03:23.896 --> 00:03:27.224
move the head down temporarily 

00:03:27.728 --> 00:03:30.032

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:37.312
place like this

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.800
divide the wings in half

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.232
putting fingers here

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:56.312
so that the bubbles

00:03:56.728 --> 00:04:00.408
rub less to each other

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:06.760
divide and twist well

00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:27.720

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:32.112

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:36.128
holding the first one

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:43.976
make the second the same

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:57.856
pressing this twisting like this

00:05:01.232 --> 00:05:06.720

00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:28.256
twist like this

00:05:35.848 --> 00:05:44.120
move the head upward

00:05:49.584 --> 00:05:54.368
