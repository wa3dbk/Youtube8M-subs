00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.080
 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.560
- What are you doing?! - I just came to say "hello".

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.860
- Hello. - George Pemberton.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.860
- Serena Shaw.  - I think we should be married.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.720
I never thought I'd find anyone...

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.860
 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.150
- How much is yours? - Ours.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.420
I sure would like to know what you think
there are little operation

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.070
I think you've taken nine months to do
about six months work

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.350
- did you find a wife or partner? - both.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.740
I'm afraid your stocks are no longer
sufficient collateral

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.470
 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.920
Our future, everything that we talked about,
we will lose it.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.170
- we promise to tell each other everything -
I didn't want to frighten you - i'm not that kind of woman

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.740
- you're not the same anymore - the only thing that's changed is you

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.879
don't forget about everything but each
other

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.080
you have a son...

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.710
You're lying...

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.570
 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.000
I'd like to speak your wife.  There was a murder last night.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.680
You need to get as far away from these mountains as you can.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.680
He betrayed you, George.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.460
Everything you did, you did for us.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.460
I can't lose you...

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.290
 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.170
 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.329
wow this doesn't look nearly as bad as I
thought it would

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.580
I mean I still believe that Jennifer
Lawrence's management team

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.690
and maybe even Bradley Cooper's
management team are trying

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.209
to bury this thing, but it finally got a
release date in the UK

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.910
that's where this trailer is coming from I can
see why they would want to to get out

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.610
there because

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.450
you know it it's not really I think they
progress from when this film's problem

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.390
it's been in the can

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.370
for quite some time I but I guess it
weren't able to prevail it's going to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.519
see the light of day I think Jennifer
Lawrence stars just a little too hot to

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.319
hide something

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.030
I'll she is this the role also roll
where she placed

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.620
something so different than which
usually doesn't think it draws on her

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.340
strengths

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.269
I think she excels honest characters and
this is a very honest character

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.989
unfortunately this character's honesty
is that she's a despicable

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.299
percent I mean I think the trailer he
said you be surprised at how

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.019
far her character goes in the movie and
I want to spoil it for you

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.769
up but I think once you do see how for
Jennifer Lawrence's character goes you

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:03.080
might

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.079
have a little bit a better understanding
a little bit better understand each

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.790
as to why she doesn't want it to be
released I think the production nice

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.370
very good acting particularly by
Jennifer Lawrence looks very very good

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.620
Bradley Cooper I mean its okay i think
is accent is

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.900
pretty rocky I think you'd like to think
he's moved past this kinda

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.579
performance I'm not only just it his
Oscar Awards

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.670
of their knees nominated for with
American hustle of course all rights

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.250
playbook

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.410
but then even Rocket Raccoon I think you
know he's really a high point in his

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.290
career right now

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.870
while you want to take a few steps
backward not just for

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.090
Jersey scraps but also how people see

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.670
audiences see nobody's going to be
looking at him there all until you

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.019
jennifer Lawrence is very clearly for me

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.230
it's being released because the intense
interest in her I and i think that

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.019
while I can understand her not wanting
to be out there from what I've seen from

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:57.930
this trailer

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.060
I don't think she should be embarrassed
because it they should at least

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.590
owning it she's only have horrible scare
just being honest about it i think thats

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.940
all

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.670
you can really asking hope for from
actor so I'm curious what you think so

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.310

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.409

mister character cooper's

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.729
