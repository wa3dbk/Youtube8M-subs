Hey everybody Dave with AmericanMuscle.com
and I am here with one of the more popular

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.370
wheel styles for the 2005 and newer Mustang.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.280
I have the American Muscle Saleen style wheel.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.470
These wheels are designed to look just like
the 5 star Saleen wheels seen on the cars

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.210
over the years, our Saleens would definitely
set you off from the pack and they’re available

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.670
in an 18” diameter.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.770
You can get them in a chrome, a black, and
a matte black finish.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.510
They’re available in an 18x9 and an 18x10,
giving you the option to go with the old school

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.460
staggered setup, or a non staggered fitment.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.100
No matter what wheel size, style or finish
you decide, one thing we guarantee you is

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.170
that wheel is going to look and function perfectly,
and American Muscle offers you a 1 year finish

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.560
and a lifetime structural warranty on all
of our wheels.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.790
You can buy the wheels separate, but we offer
you pre packaged tire and wheel combos, where

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.550
we take your wheel and pair it up with some
of the best performing tires on the market.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.180
And by sticking with a wheel and tire combo,
it’s going to go ahead and take the hassle

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.060
out of buying wheels and tires that fit right,
and it’s going to guarantee you perfect

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.040
fitment on your Mustang, even if it’s been
lowered up to 2”.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.691
We’re also going to go ahead and ship these
to your house for free, we’ll mount and

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:22.510
balance them for free, and for all you customers
with a 2007 and up Mustangs, don’t forget

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.330
to pick up your TPMS sensors when ordering
your wheels.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.590
Once the wheels and tires arrive they’re
ready to install right out of the box, you’re

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.100
just going to want to go ahead and crack the
lug nuts loose with the car on the ground,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.720
and then secure the car, jack the car up and
finish removing your lug nuts and your old

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.090
wheel and tire, take the new Saleen, slide
her right in place, lower it and tighten it,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.610
and you’re good to go.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.570
All in all you’re looking at about an hour
to install.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.330
If the looks you’re after are that of the
clean, race inspired Saleen Mustang, then

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.360
you’re definitely going to want to pick
up a set of the American Muscle 5 star style

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.560
Saleen wheel for the 2005 and up Mustangs.
