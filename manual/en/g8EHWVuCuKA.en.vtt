00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Today we will make a Rainbow Pinata Cake

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.340
The idea is from HungryHappenings.com

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.820
The links for this and to our recipe with the exact measurements of the ingredients are in the info box

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.660
or you can find it directly on http://amerikanisch-kochen.de

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:19.049
At first soft butter is mixed together with sugar and vanilla till itâ€™s creamy

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.310
The you add eggs and sour cream.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.860
The flour is mixed together with baking powder, salt and added step by step to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.020
the butter- egg dough.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.950
When the dough is smooth enough, it can be evenly spread with baking paper on two

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.510
different baking pans.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.410
Each of the baking pans have a
diameter of 24 cm

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.490
Put them for 35 to 40 minutes in the oven at 180 degrees recirculation air

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.420
During that time you can prepare the ganache.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.480
Boil the cream and pour it over
chopped white chocolate

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.170
Let it rest for 5 minutes 
After that stir it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.260
till a nice smooth paste is created.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.340
Let it cool down in the fridge 
so that it gets hard

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.390
When you finished baking the cake
let it cool down completely.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.340
Put it on a cake rack, to avoid moisture

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.340
underneath the cake

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.230
In the meantime you can continue with the decoration. To create the rainbow, dye the fondant

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.350
and knead it into rolls

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.360
We already showed you in other videos how to make fondant yourself.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.110
You can find the links in the info box.

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:19.209
The individual roles are laid out next to each other on the
bottom of the baking pan and

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.039
pushed gently together to create the shape of a rainbow.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.669
In the end you will cut the pieces in the middle of the baking pan in such a way that a semi circle is created.

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:31.329
Because of the baking pan, the rainbow has the same size as the cake.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:37.669
When the cakes cooled down, they are each divided in the middle

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:51.799
If they are too uneven to be stacked, you can still adjust their shape later on.

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.979
After that you have to cut a hole in two of the half cakes.

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:07.599
You can use one half as a template for the other one.

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:46.139
Now you can put the cake together with spreading the ganache

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.789
on one of the concaved halves.

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:55.299
After that you put it on one of the halves
then you spread the ganache

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.739
on the other side.

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.439
The created cavity can now be filled up with various candy.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.630
After that the edge is re-brushed and the last half of the cake can be put as a lid on the other.

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.159
If you made it , brush the whole cake with ganache except the side which was cut

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.719
as this one will build the bottom of the cake.

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:44.059
Then put it in the fridge till the creme is hard.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.759
If everything is ready, flip the cake gently on the cutting side

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.979
and brush it again on all sides with creme.

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.599
The whole thing has to set in the fridge again.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.460
Now you can continue with the fondant cover.

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.729
Spread some powder sugar on the fondant, so that

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.849
it doesn't get stuck when you roll it out.

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.740
Roll the fondant out flat and
afterwards lift it with the help of a rolling pin on top of the cake.

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:59.529
After that you shape and flatten it with your hands .

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.009
You can remove the rest of the powder sugar and flatten the last edges

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:21.349
with a small piece of fondant.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.840
If everything looks good, you can easily cut of the surplus with a sharp knife.

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:36.419
In the end you thinly spread some ganache on the rainbow and attached it to the cake.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.540
We wish you a lot of fun baking!
