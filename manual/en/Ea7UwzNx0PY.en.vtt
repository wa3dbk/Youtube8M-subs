This is Mei Yu, the creator of Fun2draw

00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:09.755
Today's going to be Fun2draw a cute popsicle, and you can draw this with the

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:11.245
other cute foods and

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:15.075
summer things from my Fun2draw channel. First,

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:18.974
let's draw a nice big curve for the top
part

00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:24.265
of this yummy popsicle. Draw the sides coming

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:28.265
down

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:31.335
You can use a ruler if you need to,

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:35.905
to help with the sides. Nothing wrong with using the ruler

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:40.995
for your art

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:44.655
Right now it looks like a tombstone,

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:48.345
but we really don't want a tombstone,

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:51.755
we want a popsicle! So, let's draw a cute, little

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:55.765
stubby handle. And it's just not any popsicle,

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:59.385
it's a happy popsicle. Yes,

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:02.815
that is right

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:07.034
Let's get those big Fun2draw

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:10.735
eyes in there, and let's curve up

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:16.425
and right back down, so we have a leaf shape. Let's curve down one more time

00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:19.435
and shade in this part of

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:22.875
the eye, to make it

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:27.024
thicker. Big curve for the pupil,

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:30.235
and a smaller one for the highlight

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:33.615
Keep your lines really dark

00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:37.785
at first, but as you go down, spread out the lines

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:44.785
and make them shorter

00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:49.744
Let's do the same thing on this side

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:52.795
I think my favorite flavour of popsicles is

00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:57.274
strawberry, there are really good strawberry popsicles

00:01:57.274 --> 00:02:00.744
What's your favorite flavour? Let me
know in the comments below

00:02:00.744 --> 00:02:04.715
So we have two

00:02:04.715 --> 00:02:08.005
of those cute Fun2draw eyes done,

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:15.005
let's get those eyebrows in there. Now I'll show you how to make this popsicle look like

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:15.684
it has

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:22.135
two flavors instead of just one

00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:26.714
Draw a nice wavy line across the head like that

00:02:26.714 --> 00:02:29.805
If you like this video, please thumbs up, favorite,

00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:36.805
and share it with your friends

00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:43.885
Aww, poor little popsicle

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:47.365
Why is it so sad now?

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:51.235
It used to be so happy!

00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:55.964
Ohh... ouch... yeeeah, someone just bit, like,

00:02:55.964 --> 00:02:57.065
half its head off
