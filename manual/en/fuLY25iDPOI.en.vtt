{QTtext}{timescale:100}{font:Verdana}{size:20}{backColor:0,0,0}
{textColor:65280,65280,65280}{width:960}{justify:center}

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.309
{plain}

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.580
[00:00:00.35]
While it's not commonly

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.369
used as a Motion Graphics Tool,

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.390
[00:00:03.46]
you will find that Photoshop offers a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.660
Timeline that gives you some rudimentary

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.960
[00:00:07.70]
animation abilities.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.000
[00:00:09.34]
This can be used for a simple logo

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.679
animation and I like to do the rubber banding

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.960
[00:00:14.13]
approach, where we set Keyframes for

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.360
the landing positions, then stretch the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.290
[00:00:18.28]
pieces out and have them land

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.760
into their final landing spot.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760
[00:00:21.55]
Here's how it works.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.040
[00:00:22.85]
I'm going to go ahead and make a new

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.869
Timeline and that up pops up, and what's

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:48.869
[00:00:29.59]
needed here is I'm going

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:50.300
to want a video Timeline.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.690
[00:00:32.91]
So I'll Convert this to video

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.280
and that gives me each layer.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.430
[00:00:38.44]
Now, I'll go ahead and press Ctrl+- (

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.629
minus) to shrink that window down a bit and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.000
[00:00:42.55]
just make it easier to see all

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.400
my layers.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.100
Looks pretty good!

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.439
[00:00:49.32]
If I need to, I could change the

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.429
Timeline Frame Rate to assign a true video

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.909
[00:00:54.20]
Frame Rate, and if necessary I could

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.170
choose the Panel Options to make it a bit

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.350
[00:01:00.07]
easier to see all my thumbnails.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.899
[00:01:02.38]
All right, that looks pretty good.

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.729
[00:01:05.23]
I left a copy of the logo on the

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.609
bottom there just for reference.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:30.009
[00:01:09.11]
Let's merge the Box and Stroke together,

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.329
select both layers and press Ctrl+E or

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.909
[00:01:13.97]
Command+E, to makes it a

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.069
bit simpler and I like that.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.619
[00:01:19.03]
And what we're going to do is make

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.659
each of these a Smart Object by right

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.270
[00:01:23.36]
clicking and Converting to Smart Objects.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.880
[00:01:27.05]
What this does is it will embed a full

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.440
resolution copy inside the layer and it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.509
[00:01:33.24]
opens up the ability to use the

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.450
Transform command with Keyframes.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.549
There we go!

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.630
[00:01:38.92]
Twirling each one down, we can start to animate.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.979
[00:01:44.31]
Let's take the word Raster first, I'll

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.860
come to the 3 second mark, twirl it down

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.330
[00:01:56.68]
and you'll see the Keyframe for transform.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.420
[00:01:59.98]
I'll turn that on to enable the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.180
Keyframe and then come up to the beginning
here

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.850
[00:02:05.12]
and press Ctrl+T. This allows me to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:34.210
adjust as well as rotate and move.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.350
[00:02:17.96]
Pressing Return, you'll see

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.040
that the object lands in to place.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.970
[00:02:24.73]
Now that worked nicely for a simple

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.670
animation, let's keep going with another layer.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.340
[00:02:30.10]
We'll grab Vector here, turn on the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.970
stopwatch and the visibility, and we'll jump

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.300
[00:02:38.83]
back to the same starting point.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.500
[00:02:41.34]
Ctrl+T, there it is.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.610
If I want to
adjust where it rotates around, I could drag

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.240
[00:02:49.47]
the rotation point there and what I'll

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:21.080
do is rotate this and pull it off screen.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.490
[00:03:06.42]
And they both land at the same time.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.880
[00:03:08.12]
That's looking pretty good!

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.040
[00:03:10.97]
I'll just scale this first one up 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.770
and pull
that off a bit, and they tumble in to place.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.840
[00:03:25.22]
Now, if you want to change the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.710
stacking order, just adjust the heights in
the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.570
[00:03:29.42]
layers panel and you'll see that

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.190
one will sit on top of the other now.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.470
[00:03:33.53]
All right, that's looking nice.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.470
[00:03:38.03]

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.030
[00:03:38.28]
Right about in the middle, I'm going to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.300
bring on the other two boxes, so there's

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.610
[00:03:44.16]
my Red Square and my Black Square and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.680
I'll just use the Opacity Controls here

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:17.690
[00:03:50.02]
and we will set those to 0, and then

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.790
go a little bit forward to about 310 and

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.320
[00:04:04.74]
take them back up to 100.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.810
[00:04:13.24]
So, if we play that back, you'll notice

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.680
that they animate by fading into place

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.870
[00:04:20.04]
as things go passed.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.719
[00:04:22.88]
Remember, if you'd like you can uncheck

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.710
Linear Interpolation and we will have a

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.629
[00:04:28.68]
little bit more smoothing into place.

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.009
[00:04:30.60]
All right, that's looking good,

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.560
let's just round that out.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.039
[00:04:35.19]
We've got our line and I want that to

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.810
build right as those come in, so we'll do

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.520
[00:04:44.57]
Transformation, there we go, and

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.180
coming to the top here, we'll simply press

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.460
[00:04:54.98]
Ctrl+T and we'll uncheck the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.940
width up here and set that to 0.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.210
[00:05:02.38]
What that will do is scale it from the middle.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.289
[00:05:07.55]
Now what's important is you want to

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.210
check your Keyframes, making sure that as

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.530
[00:05:12.10]
you select them, that looks pretty good,

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.629
there's the first one, make sure it's

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:42.199
[00:05:19.52]
selected, Ctrl+T and I'm going to ungang

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.659
those and just adjust the width down to zero.

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:51.220
[00:05:27.12]
Okay, click Commit, and

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.710
you'll see that the line builds on.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.900
[00:05:37.14]
Now, if it doesn't appear that it

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.650
goes all the way off the screen, you might

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.970
[00:05:41.46]
need to make a few tweaks there.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.779
[00:05:43.21]
Well, let's go ahead and press Ctrl+T there

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.490
and just adjust the width until we truly hit
0%.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.659
[00:05:50.68]
I'll turn on Opacity there and just

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:14.879
set that to start at 0 and very quickly

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:17.509
[00:05:57.94]
fade back up to 100%.

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.999
[00:05:59.01]
All right, so there's the line and it

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:25.660
wipes on and we could finish that out by

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.229
[00:06:07.24]
simply fading in the back box, there it

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:34.440
is, and as that wipes, we want the back

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.719
[00:06:16.06]
box to come on, so we'll just twirl

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:40.900
that down and Keyframe the Opacity going up

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:48.040
[00:06:22.85]
to 100%, but starting at 0.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.789
[00:06:29.53]
All right, let's play that from the

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:59.809
beginning, logo pieces build on, boxes fade

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:01.909
[00:06:41.61]
in, and it's completed.

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:05.190
[00:06:44.23]
So a very simple logo animation, if

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.159
I'd like to spit that out for use in my

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:08.430
[00:06:48.83]
Video Editing Tool, I can do so.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.180
[00:06:50.39]
Let's go ahead and save that out by

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.020
choosing File&gt;Export&gt;Render Video and if

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.199
[00:06:55.88]
you'd like Embedded Transparency, just

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:18.750
choose the Adobe Media Encoder, go to

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.879
[00:07:00.47]
QuickTime and you can go

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:22.599
with the Animation Codec.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.930
[00:07:04.82]
That will allow you to choose to embed

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.650
an Alpha Channel if you'd like by just

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.650
[00:07:09.42]
coming down here and I recommend

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.210
that you do a Straight Alpha Channel and

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:39.990
[00:07:13.96]
Render out 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.740
the file.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.380
[00:07:17.00]
