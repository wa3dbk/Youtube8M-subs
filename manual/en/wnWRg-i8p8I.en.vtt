00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.180
Access to safe water and sanitation is one of the biggest problems 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.400
faced by India's poor. 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.210
The lack of clean water and sanitation, impacts on women's lives in many ways. 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.129
Women are generally responsible for collecting water, 

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:23.269
which can be an arduous, time-consuming task. 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.279
Poor sanitation spreads disease and 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.279
without separate facilities at school, girls often stop attending. 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.560
Here in Orissa, 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.110
a state situated on the east coast of India, 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.019
WaterAid and its local partners are 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.089
working with the communities of the 150 villages and 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.230
65 slums through the formation of self-help groups. 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.290
By seeing women as agents of change, these formal groups are established 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.000
to work on key issues that impact on their communities. 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.330
The benefits of women working together, in formal self-help groups are clearly evident. 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.370
Working through women can really be the change. 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.640
One has to focus on women and children, if you want the future you will 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.870
focus on children, 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.700
if you want to reach a family 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.189
you have to touch the women, their mindset.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.539
The slums of Cuttack are overcrowded. 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.260
Sanitation is a problem and 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.830
diseases are common. 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.750
WaterAid started work in this particular slum in 2005, 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.800
encouraging the women to work more formally in a self-help group. 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.229
Katala and her colleagues now run the toilet and shower blocks in one of Cuttack's many slums. 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.820
Under their supervision the toilet has helped to improve the health 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.370
of the slum dwellers dramatically. 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.020
The women are responsible for looking after and maintaining the block. 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.509
They charge a nominal fee for each use, which is later banked and used 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.459
for repairs and sanitation products. 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.489
This has become an income generation scheme. 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.099
The surplus money will be used for further developments within the slum 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.900
and to date the team have banked 35,000 rupees. 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.889
The self-help groups are gaining strength, 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.969
spreading their message across the country. 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.430
It takes women of great courage and strength to go against 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.949
age old traditions, often in the face of adversity. 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.110
Through these groups women are finding a voice. 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.100
Yet a lot more needs to be done to ensure the change is felt 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.680
across the whole of India.
