Viotek Hawkpeck Wireless 2.4 GHz Keyboard
and Mouse Combo (KB-WLS-VTK-HWKPCK)

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.110

Hello and welcome to GadgetGuideUSA.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.110
Thanks for tuning in.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.499
I’m Stephen Kowalski and I’ll be your
gadget guide today as we explore the Viotek

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:10.830
Hawkpeck Wireless 2.4 GHz Keyboard and Mouse
Combination.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.250
Let’s go ahead and get started shall we?

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.590
As you can see I’ve removed everything from
the retail packaging which pretty much consisted

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.430
of this box packed into your standard brown
shipping container.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.850
Inside came the 2.4 GHz wireless keyboard
and the 2.4 GHz wireless mouse and the dongle.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.150
Included was also on AA battery for the keyboard
and 2 AAA batteries for the mouse.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.920
In addition to all this the wireless dongle
came and as you can see this is fractionally

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.110
small.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.530
Almost nothing really and this powers both
or this actually connects to both the keyboard

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.350
and the mouse so that’s required for absolute
operation.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.120
One of the neat things is that when you need
to move the keyboard and mouse the mouse has

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.121
this perfect little cubby there so when you
need to pack up your wireless keyboard and

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.220
mouse you stick it in there and make sure
that you don’t lose it.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.210
Of course it’s so tiny that it would be
easy to lose.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.090
Otherwise so you just need to be careful with
that and you cannot operate the keyboard and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.090
mouse without that.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.610
So we don’t want to lose that.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.880
Let’s go ahead and talk about the construction
of the keyboard.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.530
This is really thin and light and I do like
that as far as a wireless setup.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.060
It’s definitely not the most durable in
the world.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.329
It is spill resistant or water-resistant and
I do believe that the keys are tightly spaced

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.389
together and there doesn’t look to be a
lot of access points.

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:32.219
I definitely wouldn’t try to type with it
underneath the water, completely submerged

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.100
but you know, it is what it is.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.109
The construction is kind of flimsy but for
the price you’re going to pay for this in

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.639
addition to how light it is I wouldn’t expect
it to be too strong.

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:46.299
As you can see there I’m twisting pretty
hard and it does have some give but it’s

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.490
not breaking into pieces so we do like that.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.539
The best thing about this keyboard is going
to be all of the media keys.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.020
Normally for keyboards in this price range
you don’t get too many additional options

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.799
but this one actually gives you quite a few.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.229
A couple of neat ones or actually unique ones
and we’ll get to that.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.950
These are all your multimedia keys and this
is play/pause.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.939
This would go previous in your list.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.579
This would go to the next song or the next
movie or whatever media you’re watching

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.170
and then volume up and volume down.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.380
These all worked right out of the box with
absolutely no user setup.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.989
I just had to plug the dongle in.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.310
Windows recognized it right away and as soon
as it was installed everything worked.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.189
It is worth of note that the volume down and
volume up only changes your Windows master

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.189
volume.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.190
It does not actually change the slider in
Windows Media Player.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.829
You have to do that manually.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.790
But you can turn the volume up and down using
like I said the Windows master volume which

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.049
is how to get to that you go to the bottom
right hand of the screen and actually click

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.170
on that little sound symbol.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.849
I guess it’s a horn or something.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.060
This right here, this key will open up your
default email program.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.420
For me it automatically opened up Outlook.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.700
This little home symbol, I don’t know why
it’s a home but that will open your internet

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.110
browser.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.020
For me it’s Firefox but I suppose for a
lot of you it would be Chrome or Internet

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.020
Explorer.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.050
This little symbol here, I couldn’t actually
figure out what the symbol’s supposed to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.830
be but what it does is actually open your
computer file manager so when you click that

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.890
it’s the same as clicking computer and it
will open up basically your file center so

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.640
you can see what’s attached to your DVD
drives and things like that.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.220
This is a unique key I’ve never seen before.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.079
It actually opens up your calculator automatically.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.230
I guess I don’t use the Windows calculator
very often but occasionally I do so I mean

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.230
it’s there.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.750
And this is going to be your mute key, another
multimedia key.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.040
So it does have a few neat options.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.829
Especially at this price point I didn’t
expect a whole lot but we are getting quite

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:42.829
a bit out of it.

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:49.640
It’s not backlit at all but the WASD key,
the standard directional for video games are

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.180
in red and you can see those in the dark pretty
well.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.019
This Viotek label it helps you see the space
bar when you have only monitor light to work

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.019
off.

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.969
And then of course you have the red arrow
keys here.

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.120
I mean the keys feel nice.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.099
It’s mostly classic construction and it’s
pretty much almost exactly what I expected.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.810
I think the mouse is the better part of the
deal in this combination mainly because I

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.709
like the way it feels.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.070
I have a really large hand and this actually
encompasses that pretty well.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.410
It feels good.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.750
It comes with the standard button configuration.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.190
You have your optical mouse and it has your
on and off and you know I don’t really use

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.640
this on and off switch very often for my wireless
mice and I actually use Viotek wireless mice

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.650
mainly because they have an automatic power
on and off feature and so does the keyboard.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.000
After you stop using it for a few seconds
it will stop draining power.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.650
The battery life, I don’t actually have
this exact Viotek mouse but I have a you know

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.070
it’s a blinky one, I think its called Lightning
and my battery life has been, I’ve been

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.570
using the original batteries for months and
haven’t had to change them so I have no

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.190
reason to believe this one would be any different.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.320
It has your keys.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.190
It has your standard left button, your right
button and the top of this mouse is actually

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.240
rubberized.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.160
The rest of it is plastic but where you actually
sit your two fingers here is actually rubberized

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160
grip.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160
I do like that.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.160
It feels good.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.180
It has a nice strong feel to it.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.150
You have your left click, your right click
and a scroll up and down and then it has a

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.950
3rd mouse button which is actually the mouse
wheel click.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.580
And then it has what’s actually you can
call it backwards and forwards.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.670
If you’re using a browser it will automatically
page back or it will automatically page forward.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.360
But normally since I’m a geek I normally
actually program these keys to other functions

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.970
and you can do that with a lot of different
applications.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.710
If you have a Viotek mouse from another one
you can actually use the Viotek macro manager

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.630
that is not included in this particular setup
but it’s included in some of the other ones

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.162
and I use it pretty often.

00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:52.810
You also have Windows key macro manager which
is free from Microsoft.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.830
It comes as part of…I think you have to
download it separately but you can change

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.900
these keys to whatever you like.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.060
So we’re going to go ahead and set that
away.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.220
It came with the batteries and I guess some
assembly is required.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:12.790
If we look at the back here it does have your
standard flip outs here so you can change

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.950
your angle.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.690
The keyboard is really thin so it’s not
going to help your wrists when you’re sitting

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.480
there so if you have a separate wrist support
you might want to use that.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.900
But for a wireless keyboard I don’t expect
them to be very thick.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.280
But where the construction I was talking about
is I guess it gives you these little feet

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.670
right here and as you can see you need to
just I guess stick those on with adhesive

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:36.670
there.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.190
It looks like it gives you a couple extra
and it also includes the battery.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.420
This is pretty much going to be what I would
call your standard wireless keyboard and mouse

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.740
set with branded Viotek.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.660
It has the Viotek key features, you know this
little Android device sitting on it.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.350
I do like, like I said, I like the way the
mouse is made.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.810
The keyboard seems pretty standard as far
as construction and durability.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.220
Like I said its pretty thin plastic but the
keys have a good feel to them.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.410
It is something that I would use especially
for on the go because it is handy and I do

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.240
like the way that you can hide the dongle
in the mouse to make sure that you don’t

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.240
lose it.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240
I’m not going to lie.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.390
I’ve lost quite a few dongles over my life.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.060
I do hope you enjoyed my product review today.
