00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.910
ELIZABETH STREB: I'm Elizabeth Streb and this
is what's trending in my world.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.240
[Music]

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.190
I worry—I still worry—that a rat will
come into my loft and I've lived with rats

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.599
for so many years or when I run into a rat
on the street, I freak out, so it hasn't happened

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:31.119
in quite a long time but I—that would signify
something that would freak me out that I would

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.920
deeply dislike.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.830
Or a snake I supposed.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.950
Rats are worse.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.090
Right now, I'm reading The Brain Is Wider
Than the Sky and I purchased it in London

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.910
and it's hard to quantify.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.250
It's in chapters and one of the chapters is
this gentleman talking about going to meet

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.969
with Bill Gates and trying to put his finger
on what is really the epiphany Bill Gates

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.190
had right around the time he was believing—this
is a while ago—that the Internet was gonna

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.190
be the superhighway.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.519
In the book, he wrote about that.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.040
And the notion that all of these things that
happen kind of in the world that are preemptory

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.150
but at the time you hear about them—like
when you heard about the world wide web—I

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.080
remember thinking, what the heck is that?

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.550
And so he has one story after another about
these magical things that happen in the world

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.360
and the complexity and the magic and I think
he's tellin' stories.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.750
I read more than one book at a time and I'm
also reading Richard Feinman, The Character

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.920
of Physical Law.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.610
I'm constantly struggling with that.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.490
It was the issue of time and the more—not
the present tense, but the past and the future

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.170
and I'm obsess with listening to his description
of time and I've been trying to get a physicist

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.350
like Brain Green or Lisa Randel to define
time.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.090
And in fact some people will say that it doesn't
exist and I want to know—Richard Feinman

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.041
would say, well you know you drop a cup of
coffee and it smashes onto the ground and

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:09.140
then there's no way you can reverse that and
bring it up and continue to drink it.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.640
And I want to know if time exists and what
the heck is it, from the point of view of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.640
a practitioner.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.050
So I have so many books on time.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.349
I saw Leave the Lights On by Ira Sachs.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.420
And it was great.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.739
It was a beautiful movie, but my favorite
movie is Runaway Train, which the screenplay

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.030
came from Kiwasowa many years ago.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.450
Amelia Earhart because she had the guts even
though I don't think she was ever fully alone,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.459
to sit in a cold dark airplane and go all
the way across the Atlantic.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.459
And I love the mystery that they don't know
where she went.

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.340
She probably went backwards in time and is
now young as can be somewhere in a beautiful

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.340
island.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.290
And I think the other one would be Mohammed
Ali because of his bravery, his unbelievable

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.420
skill at boxing, which I think is physically
harder than what Streb does and I wouldn't

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.209
say that about anything else and that he was
the heavyweight champion of the world and

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.920
he wouldn't go to war.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.739
I mean, right in the midst of his fame.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.681
He refused to go to war.

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:10.681
To the Vietnam War.

00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:15.569
I have one more favorite character that is
nonfiction, from a long time ago maybe 1901.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.760
Her name is Annie Etzin Taylor and she was
the first human who got in a barrel and went

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.180
over Niagra.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.840
I'm gonna say she was around 63.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.860
A year older than myself.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.920
Maybe she was the first person who lived and
went over Niagra in a barrel, maybe she was

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.120
the first woman.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
Who cares.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.050
She got in a barrel and went over Niagra and
she lived and I just think I would love to

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.849
have that ride.

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.019
I would love to do that ride.

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.730
That's a real move.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.549
What I do that I love the most is to draw.

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.099
Especially for the last two years, I've been
drawing circles.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.790
I'm not drawing right now because I've finished
major projects, but to sit in my drawing book

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.760
and imagine action in two dimensional space
and ask questions on the side—it doesn't

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.760
get better than that.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.940
I just think drawing is believing.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.599
I'm Elizabeth Streb and you're watching me
on Epiphany.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.360
And you will have an Epiphany.
