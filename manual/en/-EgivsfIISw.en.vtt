00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:03.965
Some promoters of raw food diets claim

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:06.669
that the "living" enzymes in plant foods

00:00:06.904 --> 00:00:08.904
are necessary for human digestion and health.

00:00:11.556 --> 00:00:13.556
They also claim that your body has only

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:15.036
a finite supply of digestive enzymes

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.814
so these enzymes from vegetables and fruit

00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:18.388
become more important as you age.

00:00:19.097 --> 00:00:21.097
They say that cooking denatures these live enzymes

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:23.647
so that they cannot perform their function in the body.

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:27.846
I would like to emphasize that only some raw food promoters

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:31.038
make this claim.

00:00:30.323 --> 00:00:32.323
There are notable examples of those who will state 

00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:34.023
that this claim is not true.

00:00:34.323 --> 00:00:36.323
They may be in the minority, however,

00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:37.528
of those who actually follow such a diet. 

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:43.315
Let's examine these claims.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.586
Do plant foods have enzymes? Yes.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
Are these plant enzymes active in human digestion? No.

00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:52.836
Plant enzymes are there for the plant to use.

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:55.265
There is no evidence that they have any role 

00:00:55.236 --> 00:00:57.236
whatsoever in human health, 

00:00:56.824 --> 00:00:58.824
other than to provide a source of amino acids.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.229
Does cooking denature these enzymes? Yes.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.467
They are protein based and heat application will denature the proteins.

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.969
To denature a protein means to change its shape 

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:17.562
in such a way that it is not biologically active.

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:21.464
What you may not know is that applying an acid

00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:23.465
to protein foods, does much the same thing as heat.

00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:26.971
This means that these protein enzymes will become denatured

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in the harsh acidic environment of the stomach. 

00:01:31.038 --> 00:01:33.038
However, this does not effect their digestion 

00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:35.161
as peptides and amino acids.

00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:36.993
In fact, as far as protein goes,

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:39.608
cooking them makes them somewhat more bio-available.

00:01:41.582 --> 00:01:43.580
This means that a larger percentage of the protein 

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:45.760
can be successfully broken down and absorbed.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.860
The myth that denaturing proteins is bad for human health

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.860
The myth that denaturing proteins is bad for human health

00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:51.680
is based on the idea that whole proteins

00:01:52.107 --> 00:01:54.110
are biologically active and can be absorbed by the body 

00:01:55.034 --> 00:01:57.030
to perform certain roles as proteins,

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.870
as opposed to being broken down into amino acids

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.080
to be made into other proteins by the body.

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.520
We'll examine this next. 

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.200
Can whole proteins be absorbed by the small intestine?

00:02:15.587 --> 00:02:17.590
Well, for the first few weeks after birth,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.420
 a newborn's small intestine absorbs

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.880
a fairly good amount of intact proteins.

00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:24.430
For example, gamma globulin proteins present in mother's milk

00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:28.360
appear to be absorbed since the newborn has specific receptors

00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:31.580
for binding and transporting them.

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:33.920
The stomach pH is lower 

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:35.410
so that pepsin is not as active

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.000
and there are trypsin inhibitors, 

00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:38.510
all of which helps keep the protein intact.

00:02:39.164 --> 00:02:41.160
This appears to be a way for the infant

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:42.960
to receive active antibodies.

00:02:43.154 --> 00:02:45.150
Even so, we do not know how well 

00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:47.320
this mechanism works in human infants. 

00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:49.430
Only a very tiny amount 

00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:51.030
of intact protein is absorbed by adults

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.540
and in certain people,

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:54.530
ome of these proteins result in anyphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions.

00:02:56.404 --> 00:02:58.400
Other proteins may have a small role

00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:00.980
in gut health.

00:03:00.523 --> 00:03:02.520
However, to exaggerate the importance of this

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.780
is to exaggerate something we know very little about.

00:03:06.077 --> 00:03:08.080
 For the most part,

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.620
proteins are used to provide raw building blocks

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:11.680
for your body to make it's own proteins. 

00:03:17.704 --> 00:03:19.700
We've seen that plant enzymes

00:03:20.694 --> 00:03:22.690
have no role in human digestion.

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:25.490
What of the claim that

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.330
your body has a limited amount of digestive enzymes

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:29.730
and once the supply runs out you are out of luck

00:03:30.263 --> 00:03:32.260
without an outside supply? 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.140
Well, that's hogwash.

00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:35.480
The body continues to make digestive enzymes

00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:35.480
The body continues to make digestive enzymes

00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:37.560
throughout life and secretes them as needed. 

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:45.560
First let's define an enzyme.

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:49.520
An enzyme is a protein that facilitates chemical reactions 

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.400
without itself being changed by the reaction.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.390
Enzymes are known as catalysts.

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:56.940
The digestive enzymes are large proteins

00:03:56.552 --> 00:03:58.550
that facilitate a chemical reaction known as hydrolysis.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.720
Hydrolysis is the addition of water to break down

00:04:01.995 --> 00:04:04.000
a molecule into smaller pieces. 

00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:06.720
This happens to proteins, carbohydrates, and fats,

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.600
each of which have certain enzymes to hydrolyze them.

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:12.430
Enzymes are, of course, 

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:14.070
not the only components of digestion,

00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:15.850
but our discussion will focus on them

00:04:15.407 --> 00:04:17.410
and not on the digestive process as a whole.

00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:25.690
Digestion begins in the mouth and the salivary glands

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:28.450
secrete the first enzyme, called amylase.

00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:32.270
Amylase begins the process of breaking down 

00:04:32.484 --> 00:04:34.480
complex carbohydrates, called polysaccharides.

00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:36.160
These are mostly starches. 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:42.560
The second enzyme is secreted in the stomach.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.970
It's called pepsin.

00:04:44.908 --> 00:04:46.910
Pepsin begins to break down proteins into peptides. 

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.460
From the stomach, the food enters the small intestine,

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:56.130
where a host of enzymes go to work.

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:56.130
where a host of enzymes go to work.

00:04:56.347 --> 00:04:58.350
These are secreted from the pancreas,

00:04:57.858 --> 00:04:59.860
and from the lining of the small intestine itself.

00:04:57.858 --> 00:04:59.860
and from the lining of the small intestine itself.

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.540
The pancreatic enzymes start the process

00:05:02.648 --> 00:05:04.650
by breaking down macronutrients into smaller units

00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:07.030
and the small intestine enzymes finish the process

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.950
by breaking them down even more. 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:17.590
The pancreas secretes seven enzymes.

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:22.460
This is not the only job of the pancreas, by the way.

00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:23.050
It also makes important hormones

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:24.620
that are released into the circulatory system,

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.040
such as insulin.

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:27.840
The digestive enzymes, however,

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:27.840
The digestive enzymes, however,

00:05:27.116 --> 00:05:29.120
go into the small intestine.

00:05:29.172 --> 00:05:31.170
These break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. 

00:05:37.026 --> 00:05:39.030
The small intestine enzymes are actually active

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:41.470
in the lining itself, 

00:05:40.397 --> 00:05:42.400
where the final process is carried out.

00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:45.060
One of these enzymes is maltase, 

00:05:44.663 --> 00:05:46.660
which breaks down maltose to it's final glucose form,

00:05:49.694 --> 00:05:51.690
and sucrase breaking sucrose into glucose and fructose.

00:05:51.493 --> 00:05:53.490
Here is also lactase which breaks down the natural sugar in milk,

00:05:54.964 --> 00:05:56.960
called lactose.

00:05:57.391 --> 00:05:59.390
Now, you may have hard of lactose intolerance.

00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:01.450
Well, some people do not continue making

00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:03.260
enough lactase throughout their lives

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:05.170
and this enzyme deficiency causes them 

00:06:04.727 --> 00:06:06.730
to have trouble digesting the milk sugar lactose.

00:06:08.838 --> 00:06:10.840
You may be interested to know, however, that

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.610
it is very likely the NORMAL way to be

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:15.530
and that the ability to continue producing a lot of lactase

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.440
throughout life is a later mutation.

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:21.120
This makes sense if you figure

00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:22.320
we were never really meant to continue needing it

00:06:22.385 --> 00:06:24.380
after we were weaned from mother's milk.

00:06:24.754 --> 00:06:26.750
I mention this because I do not wish 

00:06:26.214 --> 00:06:28.210
it to be seen as ammo for the "running out of enzymes" claims. 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.980
That concludes our coverage of the plant enzyme claim of the raw food diet movement.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.980
You can get further details in the article linked in the description below.
