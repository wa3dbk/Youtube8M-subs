00:00:00.651 --> 00:00:03.449
So how much do I get paid,
$25 a car?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.545
Paid?
You don't get paid.

00:00:05.823 --> 00:00:09.758
You kidding? You work
on commission. That's better
than being paid.

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:12.624
Most cars you rip
are worth $200 or $300.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:15.795
$50,000 Porsche
might make you $5,000.

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.896
[honking]
Come on, dickhead.

00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:24.701
It helps if you dress
like a detective, too.

00:00:26.808 --> 00:00:29.140
Detectives dress
kind of square.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:33.711
People think
"this guy is a cop"...

00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:36.511
they're gonna think
you're packing something.

00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:39.484
They don't fuck with you
so much.

00:00:39.587 --> 00:00:41.713
Are you?
Am I what?

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:43.822
Packing something.

00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:46.522
Only an asshole
gets killed for a car.

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:50.085
The guys that make it
are the guys that get
in their cars at any time.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.223
Get in at 3:00 a.m.,
get up at 4:00.

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:59.069
That's why there ain't
a repo man I know
that don't take speed.

00:01:00.038 --> 00:01:01.470
Speed, huh?

00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:03.295
[snorting]

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:05.806
[sniffing]

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.743
Jesus Christ.

00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:09.606
##[car stereo playing]

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:14.646
I never broke into a car,
I never hot-wired a car,
kid.

00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:16.743
I never broke
into a trunk.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.711
I shall not cause harm
to any vehicle nor the
personal contents thereof...

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.453
nor, through inaction,
let that vehicle or the
personal contents thereof...

00:01:24.527 --> 00:01:25.960
come to harm.

00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:28.394
It's what I call
the repo code, kid.

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:30.523
[sniffing]
Don't forget it.
Etch it in your brain.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.568
Not many people
got a code to live by
anymore.

00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:38.868
Hey, look. Look at that.
Look at those assholes
over there.

00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:41.897
Ordinary fucking people.
I hate them.

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:43.800
Me, too.
What do you know, kid?

00:01:43.977 --> 00:01:48.277
See, an ordinary person
spends his life
avoiding tense situations.

00:01:48.348 --> 00:01:51.646
Repo man spends his life
getting into
tense situations.

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:53.579
Assholes.

00:01:53.886 --> 00:01:55.615
Let's go get a drink.

00:01:55.955 --> 00:01:57.081
(Bud)
Tense situations, kid.

00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:59.386
Get into five or six
of them a day,
don't mean shit anymore.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.484
I mean, I've seen men stabbed,
didn't mean shit.
I've seen guns, too.

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:05.086
They don't mean shit,
but that's when
you gotta watch yourself.

00:02:05.163 --> 00:02:07.825
Here, I'll handle it, pal.
Try to settle down.

00:02:10.502 --> 00:02:12.435
Have a nice day.
Night.

00:02:12.503 --> 00:02:14.027
Night, day,
doesn't mean shit.

00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:15.360
[bell tinkling]

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.704
Wasn't that Otto?
(woman)
Otto who?
