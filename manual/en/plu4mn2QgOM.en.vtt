00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:16.820
The lost children dance and play.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:27.020
They have been beckoned to the edge of this peak, which we gaze at.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:38.370
If you look down upon that rustling, miniature garden,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:49.670
you will see the singing, laughing people gather together...

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:01.970
If that is so, I bid farewell to today, whilst acting

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:10.070
as if I love everything in various ways.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:42.170
When I linger in an isolated audience seat,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:50.670
and peer out through spectacles,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.170
I am always struck by a rain of cherry blossoms,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.870
and I fall into a slumber within this vain world...

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:15.020
If you shut your eyes to those conflicted gears,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:25.970
and deception, as well, today will be wonderful.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:38.270
There is no reason why one would have arrived here after becoming lost on the road.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:53.070
Whilst believing, a curtain call will welcome them before they are aware of it.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:05.420
This is done so all may climb upon the stage...

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:54.520
Though I am aware that I can meet you again in my dreams,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:05.120
If I cannot sleep, then I shall open my eyes and kiss today.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:15.720
Night returns, and the parade continues...

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:32.970
If all are to walk forwards whilst embracing grief, without looking back,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.820
Then come, to a curtainless world,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:45.670
Beyond that curtain call, where something awaits you...
