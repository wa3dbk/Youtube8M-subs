MARK BLOCKER: Hello, in this segment, we're
going to cover removing the front wheel. At

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.090
this point, and if you remember our tip earlier,
the reason I gave you that tip--if the lug

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.790
nuts were tight and you would just to try
to remove them now, what you do--the whole

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.040
wheel is going to want to spin. And without
something to lock that wheel, you can't get

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.630
the lug nuts loose; so that's why I gave you
the tip earlier. So at this point, it's just

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.830
really easy. All we've got to do is remove
the lug nuts. And I just do it always in a

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.021
star pattern. It's a habit I've gotten into.
It's the proper way to install them. It's

00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:40.730
not nearly so critical or going to cause you
any problems if you don't follow that procedure

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.670
of removing them. It's just a habit I've gotten
into. Make sure you set your lug nuts down

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.011
when you take it off in a good, safe place
and they're not going to roll away on or get

00:00:48.011 --> 00:01:05.030
knocked over or brushed aside 'cause we will
need them later. Once we've got all four of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.499
the lug nuts removed and set aside, just apply
a little bit of pressure in each direction.

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:16.539
Okay, so just apply a little bit of pressure
and the tire is easily removed. What we're

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.539
going to do is just remove this. We'll just
set it aside some place where it's going to

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.909
be out of our way and safe. It's a good idea
to take your lug nuts, keep everything in

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.139
the same place, all in one place away from
the vehicle so you won't brush into it, knock

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:35.630
it over or spill parts around. It gets real
aggravating trying to put something back together

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.409
and you can't find the pieces necessary to
do it. So I'm going to take the lug nuts and

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.850
I'm going to take them out and put them in
a little center cap. And then the tire, I'll

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.499
just set them out of the way over in this
side. Okay. Now, we've got the wheel removed

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:53.000
and I've put them aside, got the other tools
up and out of the way. It's a good idea to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.279
kinda keep things picked up as you go. You
want to keep the tools out that you're using,

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:01.399
but you want to keep them out of your way
at the same time. So I kinda set the parts

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.840
that I've taken off in one place and the tools
close by where they're accessible but out

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.210
of the way while I'm working. Our next segment
will be on--we're going to inspect the brake

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.000
system prior to taking it apart, dismantling
it. That will give us a good idea that everything

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.099
is working correctly and smoothly and verify
we just got warning pads to know the problems

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.959
in the braking system.
