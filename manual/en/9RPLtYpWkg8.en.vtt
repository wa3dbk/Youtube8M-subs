00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.710
Growing vertically maximizes growing space, increases yields, and reduces pest and disease problems.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.206
 In today’s 2 minute tip,

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.441
 I’ll show you how we made these heavy duty trellises

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.677
 that can support the weight of indeterminate tomatoes,

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.413
 squash, pumpkins, and even watermelons.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.182
These easy-to-make trellises follow a very simple design. 

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.785
Concrete remesh, made from welded steel wire,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:22.722
 provides a strong grid with large openings for easy access to fruit. 

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:26.226
The remesh is attached to an EMT conduit frame using zip ties. 

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.494
Now let’s move on to the build.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.130
 If you’re unfamiliar with any of  the materials used, don’t worry, 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.731
I’ve provided links in the description

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.900
 for more information on every item.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.771
You’ll need two 8 foot sections of ½” EMT conduit for the verticals 

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.507
and a 41 ½” piece for the horizontal. 

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.575
To connect the verticals to the horizontal,

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.845
 you’ll need two ½” EMT 90 degree pull elbows.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.781
Conduit is sold in 10 foot sections, 

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.783
so you’ll have to cut the verticals to 8 feet 

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.419
and the horizontal to 41 and one half inches.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.255
You can use a pipe cutter or a hacksaw to make the cut.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.424
I then connected the verticals to the horizontals 

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.360
using the 90 degree pull elbows, 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.597
and laid the frame down to attach the 84 by 43 inch remesh. 

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:08.401
The 41 ½” horizontal plus the elbows provide the perfect width for the remesh.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.637
Using black UV-resistant zip ties,

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.639
 I secured the remesh to the frame, 

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.508
using 7 zip ties to attach the top of the grid to the frame and four on each side.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:18.110
I used two 3 ⅓ foot sections of rebar

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.946
 to secure the trellis to the garden.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.482
To determine where to drive the rebar into the soil,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.180
I simply put the trellis in place.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.321
When I lifted it up, the conduit had left 2 indentations.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:32.492
I then used these indentations as guides as to where to drive the rebar.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:37.997
I drove each piece of rebar about half way into the soil.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:41.334
Some plants, like peas and beans, will naturally cling to the trellis, 

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.537
but for those that don't, I’ll weave the plants through the grid as they grow. 

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.840
This will provide more than enough support for most plants.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.342
But large fruiting plants like pumpkins and watermelons

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:51.177
may need additional support.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:54.381
In this case, I'll often use a harness made from an old t-shirt,

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.884
wrap the harness around the fruit, and tie it to the frame.

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:58.818
Well, that's all for now.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.827
Thank you very much for watching this 2 minute tip.
