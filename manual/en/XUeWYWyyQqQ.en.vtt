00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.160
&gt;&gt; Are you concerned about living in difficult
times, well check this out.

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.360
&gt;&gt; Marjory: This DVD training is for those
seeking to grow more of their own food using

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.920
as little store bought feed or fertilizers
as possible.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.180
The filming has been done on a family farm
where we depend on these systems to grow a

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.859
significant part of our diet.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.789
&gt;&gt; If you've ever considered growing some
or all of your family's food this DVD may

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.830
be for you.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.920
It's a video tutorial to get you started
and a reference to come back to as your skills

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.649
and systems expand.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.859
Learn about water-

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.660
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Different qualities of water depend
on its source.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.300
Rain water is the best water and is often
called the gold standard for garden plants

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.180
and trees.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.829
Nothing brings your garden to life like a
good rain.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.680
Pond water is the next best water if the pond
is healthy and contains life and fertility.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.109
The guideline of about an inch of water per
week is also appropriate in the garden.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.590
You can use this same equation to estimate
how much water you will need based on how

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.870
many square feet of garden space you have.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.539
&gt;&gt; Vegetable garden.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.160
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Different layers of soil have
different levels of biological activity and

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.230
the bio-intensive method takes care not to
overly disturb soil layers.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.230
Regardless of your soil type, continuously
adding compost is the main key to fertility.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.590
Clay soils, sandy soils, rocky soils,-compost
fixes them all.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.590
&gt;&gt; Raising rabbits.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.730
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Rabbits are an easy food source
to grow in a very small space.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.180
In our garden we have an eight cage rabbit
hutch.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.250
Each cage has five square feet of space.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.400
One buck and three brooding does take up four
cages and the remaining four cages are used

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.720
to grow up the babies.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.820
You can get about 90 rabbits a year from a
setup like this.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.290
&gt;&gt; Home butchering.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.030
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Rabbit fires are harvested when
they are about two months old and weigh somewhere

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.130
between three and a half and four and a half
pounds.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.650
&gt;&gt; Poultry.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.040
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Having chickens in your yard is
a real delight.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.640
Chickens are a valuable part of your food
production system.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.950
There are many different ways to keep chickens.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.790
Are criteria of using little or no commercially
bought feed and doing as little work as possible

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.870
shaped the system that we've developed.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.360
&gt;&gt; Integrating dogs into your system.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.250
&gt;&gt; Marjory: To make sure the dogs have easy
access to every area we need protected, we

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.860
cut this hole into the fence which lets the
dogs through but keep the geese in.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.060
&gt;&gt; Growing perennials.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.170
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Perennial plants are bushes, vines
and trees that you plant once and they continue

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.540
to grow year after year.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.950
Geese are a good complement to an orchard
if you have room for them.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.110
We put fresh water into shallow tubs placed
beneath our fruit trees.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.230
The geese love it and they bathe and preen,
copulate and of course defecate in the water

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.000
making a good old mess which is wonderful
stuff for the fruit and nut trees.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.280
We rotate the tubs around the orchard and
every tree gets this liquid fertilizer every

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.560
two or three months.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.900
&gt;&gt; Much more.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.230
&gt;&gt; Marjory: The sweet potato is as efficient
in caloric production and space requirements.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.760
Amazingly enough, the sweet potato does well
in less than fertile soils.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.850
&gt;&gt; The DVD comes with an additional cd chock
full of reference materials to help you with

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.680
each subject covered in the videos.
