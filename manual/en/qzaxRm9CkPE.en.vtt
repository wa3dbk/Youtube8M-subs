00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.930

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.819
that iran isn't enormous danger to this

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.349
weapons in fact one of the american
press this crime

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.469
ron is changing its game plan iran could
now be more willing to attack the u_s_

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.960
at home and abroad ron may be more read
even ever

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.580
to launch terrorist acts inside the
united states

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.479
there's a good chance that this persian
gulf region

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:29.189
critics world within a matter of months

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.909
u_s_ officials warn however that the
runs massive stockpile of ballistic

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:33.949
missiles

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.530
as the more serious prayer

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.590
bronze

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.000
will cable producing enough highly
enriched uranium for weapons

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.440
how alarming is this report from mister
clapper

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.240
is alarming because this is the newest
that facing the u_s_

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.110
that flight

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.850
would be the world's first line of
defense

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.820
they're prepared to take on just about
anything arrived rosette

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.820
well you can't beat the u_s_ media for
propaganda

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.400
if you watch that day in and day out you
think all my car i want them to get all

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.400
this subject

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.900
there's a problem we have facts on the
show we present to you

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.799
and it's a real big problem if you try
new propaganda because look the same to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.600
look at the world map here basile
actually has nuclear weapons

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.150
well know that russia is a town ten
thousand u_s_ as uh... eight thousand

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.240
five hundred

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.620
desert let's look at the countries in
the middle east

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.810
only later that israel appears to have a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.610
that's a lot of nuclear weapons

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.650
china of course france the u_k_ et
cetera india pakistan and they've got a

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.580
lot of nukes there

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.760
wonder what's missing

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.670
now let's take a look at the second all
that's right

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.670
iraq their dispute zero

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.140
it doesn't have any news

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.500
but yet when you look at the u_s_ media

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.309
they're saying

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:56.030
out of all those countries

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.460
which was a nuclear problem

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.180
the rods

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.800
not the countries with the nuclear
weapons there not a problem at all

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.099
for the country that doesn't have one
almighty me plugins

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.629
about maybe having a nuclear weapon many
many years and

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.929
you see a propaganda works now one of
the countries that on the map there is

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.749
north korea they have up to ten nuclear
weapons and they got him during the bush

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.239
administration

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.579
while we were talking to rack

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.109
that had no weapons of mass destruction
whatsoever

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.859
so why did we attack iraq and wire we
threatening to attack around when they

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.259
don't have any nukes fact directed have
any weapons of mass destruction

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.909
when or career was that all the dam

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.989
at the same exact time

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.429
now they're many reasons for that one of
which is there ain't nothing in north

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:46.689
korea ok what do you do when you get
when you win in north korea

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:47.759
not much

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.619
there's no war over north korea

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.989
and also of course north korea's nowhere
near israel

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.150
by the way when they talk about all
quiet works and only safety don't you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.329
think that would be

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.219
of course it

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.939
all other countries a lot of get nukes
in there would be more proliferation

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.419
but there is a country in the middle
east with new since israel

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.079
but no mention of that

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.109
fascinating how propaganda looks

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.489
so when you wanna invade a country

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.769
all the sun is this great danger when
it's not backed up by the facts

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.109
but if you don't wanna

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.089
touch a country gives their your allies
like india israel to some degree

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:28.930
pakistan

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.829
or

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.039
then i hear allies like north korea but
because of up to

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:35.619
well that all the sun

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.659
nothing about them in the news at all

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:39.879
those of the real facts
