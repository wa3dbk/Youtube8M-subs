00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.278
I have a very funny story
to tell you.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:15.282
I was at my dermatologist today
and she was with her girlfriend

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.248
and they came to the conclusion

00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:20.537
that they both wanted
to have a menage.

00:00:20.703 --> 00:00:22.790
- This came out of nowhere?
- Out of nowhere!

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.042
And she asked me
"Do I know anybody?"

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.045
I said: "Yeah, but it'll cost you
a thousand bucks."

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.089
- I was thinking of you.
- Me?

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:33.967
I mean, you need the money
and I'm closing shop.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.719
I am not a beautiful man.

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:37.429
Is Mick Jagger a beautiful man?

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:40.584
You're an experienced lover,
why shouldn't you get paid for it?

00:00:40.898 --> 00:00:42.690
Of course, I saw myself
getting a small fee.

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:45.187
If you're a pimp,
you've got to have a name.

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:46.897
I'll be Dan Bungle.

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:48.440
It's nice to meet you, Dan.

00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:51.318
Maybe I should try
your guy out first, alone.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.320
Just me and him.
You do this often?

00:00:53.788 --> 00:00:54.947
No, I mean...

00:00:55.113 --> 00:00:57.366
- So, this is kind of a part time thing?
- You could say that.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.163
She tipped you?!

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:04.568
You know waitresses pool their tips
and they split them.

00:01:05.237 --> 00:01:06.917
We have another customer,
maybe more.

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:09.044
How about word of mouth?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.629
God bless you, girls.

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.635
- Is he tall?
- Yeah.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.414
I really think
that I should try him.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.183
I like it rough.
Sometimes, I even like to be the man.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.644
To strap on my god.

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:30.023
- Is he Jewish?
- Jewish...

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.066
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:34.236
So this is what you do.
You bring magic to the lonely.

00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:37.197
- That's one way to put it.
- He's shy, so why handle the...

00:01:37.858 --> 00:01:39.825
He's shy?
He doesn't look shy.

00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:41.952
- You are flirting with me.
- No.

00:01:47.723 --> 00:01:50.460
Everybody needs contact.

00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:52.582
They need love, they need affection.

00:01:52.707 --> 00:01:56.717
You do remember that a threesome
is two thousand bucks?

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:00.971
- These are vulnerable people.
- Think of it as a performance.

00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:02.681
They want you to play-act anyhow.

00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:05.392
Let's do the menage.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.436
- Call Bungle.
- Dan Bungle.

00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:11.440
She's so soft,
like a stuffed animal.

00:02:12.857 --> 00:02:15.110
Very nice stage work,
let me tell you.

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:19.328
Have you ever done it,
menage a trois?

00:02:19.453 --> 00:02:21.408
1977, during the blackout.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:24.578
Nobody could see anything,
but that was still very pleasant.
