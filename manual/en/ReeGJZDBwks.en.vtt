cars.com auto review

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.889
hi I'm bill Jackson and we're here with the
scion xB now it was redesigned to look

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.969
like this in 2008 and since then they
have not changed really much of any

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.240
significance since that time so we're
going to go over some of the features

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.269
that remain the same and why it remains
kind of a practical car one of things

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.960
that stay the same as the engine it's a
hundred fifty horsepower four-cylinder

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.890
we have the version with a five-speed
manual transmission and it makes a lot

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.190
more fun to drive driven the automatic
and it's not bad it's just doesn't

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.210
really wow you in either case and moves
away from the satellites very well and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.059
with manual transmission it's
particularly good on the highway

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.900
it's rated at 22 miles per gallon in the
city 28 miles per gallon on the highway

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.510
now one of the nice things about the XP
is it's a hatchback it uses a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.159
traditional swing up rear as opposed to
one of the opening doors things I just

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.790
think it's more practical one thing to
keep in mind it does open a little low

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.939
if you're on the taller side it's not
that big of a deal

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:06.810
the cargo area is generous I mean you've
got plenty of room here for obviously a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.580
normal-sized duffel bag

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.880
we also tested it with a couple golf
bags and a couple pieces of luggage so

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.750
there's a fair amount of room back here
if you need more room it's a split

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.399
folding rear seat very easy to use so
all in all it's really pretty practical

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:28.200
now inside the XB it's it's kind of a
mixed bag you get good visibility to the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.429
front there's a kind of a blind spot to
the rear so that's something that you

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.490
would want to look at on a highway
during a test drive

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.810
the seats are comfortable and i use this
car lot is a carpool vehicle and none of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.990
my passengers complained about a lack of
space so that's a good thing

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.210
now some things on the interior weren't
so great all of my passengers did not

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.289
like the fact that they did not have a
passenger armrest here this been down

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.249
here is way too low to use that really
annoyed them also there's not a lot of

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.600
covered storage space there's a lot of
open areas here but if you want to leave

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.659
something valuable out of sight there's
really only this very small center

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.289
console and then over here in kind of a
smallish glove box

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.350
for me as a driver the thing that I
really didn't like is the tachometer

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.950
it's very hard to see very hard to read
and if you're using a manual

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.180
transmission

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.540
it's almost uses now when the first
scion xb came out it was kind of unusual

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.980
to see a lot of small box cars on the
road now they're a lot more common but

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.310
the one thing that I think keep sex be
competitive and and one of things i

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.580
really like about it is it just does a
lot of things well again we've been over

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.810
the cargo area there's a fair amount of
room there i use it as a carpool duty

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.740
vehicle and again none of my passengers
complain except for about the armrest

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.300
and it was fine on the highway so it's
kind of nice that they haven't changed a

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.040
lot on it from 2008-2010 so that if
you're looking at either new one or used

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.640
when you're basically looking at the
same car and I think that's a good thing

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.010
