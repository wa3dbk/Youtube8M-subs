00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.290
Where will your next
customers come from?

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.180
I'll give you a hint.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.970
It's inside this circle.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.495
Plus, Firefox Performance
Tools get a major overhaul.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:10.120
I'm Rob Dodson.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.000
This is Lazy Web.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.750
Emerging markets are expected
to add billions of new users

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.220
to the web, so
how do we prepare?

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.300
Bruce Lawson of Opera
highlights the top domains

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.380
from around the world
and demonstrates

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.410
that everyone wants
the same internet

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.100
but not all networks
are created equal.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.290
Covering topics like installable
web apps, responsive images,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.050
and proxy browsers,
it's an eye opening look

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.840
at the future of the platform.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.590
You can grab the link
down in the Show Notes.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.400
The Accessibility
Cheat Sheet takes

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.590
some of the pain out of
making your site accessible.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.350
Based on the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.160
the cheat sheet gives
checklist examples

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.310
for features your site should
support and also provides

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.810
visual examples and
links to useful tools,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.780
such as Lea Verou's
Contrast Ratio Checker.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.440
Statistics show that 85% of
US retailers' mobile traffic

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.164
is on the web and it accounts
for 90% of their revenue.

00:01:08.164 --> 00:01:09.580
Alex Komoroke and
Elisabeth Morant

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.330
explain the three selling
points of the web platform--

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.570
reach, performance,
and engagement--

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.740
in this talk from Google I/O.
The talk features high level

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.970
explanations of new features,
like install banners

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.520
and notifications,
as well as data

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.540
demonstrating the size and
financial impact of the web.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.650
Take a look at the latest
DevTools in Firefox Developer

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.460
Edition.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.570
Waterfall View highlights
frame rate changes

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.460
and corresponding
events on the timeline,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.320
such as heavy JavaScript work.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740
The Call Tree summarizes
which functions eat up

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.570
the most time in
your application,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.070
and the Flame Chart
helps you decide

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.940
if a function took a
very long time to run

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.740
or may have just been
called too many times.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.297
This video also highlights
using Web Workers to speed up

00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:51.005
your application.

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:55.210
You can check out the link
down in the description.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.790
Decreasing network
latency with HTTP2

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.140
will make the entire web faster.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.760
Ilya Grigorik's slides from
this year's Velocity Con

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.270
look at the ways that
HTTP2 will radically

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.850
change how we build
performant applications.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.610
Stop concatenating
your resources

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.600
and focus on better caching,
remove domain sharding,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.150
and let server push replace your
current inlining strategies.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.188
You can see the full slide
deck down in the Show Notes.

00:02:20.188 --> 00:02:21.710
That's it for this week, folks.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.750
Links to everything are
down in the Show Notes.
