00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:03.166
President Obama:
-- a Cabinet meeting
with obviously a very

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.900
wide-ranging agenda.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.066
One of the first things we
talked about was the progress

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.700
that we're making in terms
of growing the economy again.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.600
We've now seen five straight
months of job growth and

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.433
economic growth.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.600
Over half a million private
sector jobs have been created

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.967
since the beginning of the year.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:25.667
But we also know that it is
not moving as fast as we want,

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.700
that there's still millions
of Americans out there who

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.100
are looking for work, or
looking for more hours,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.967
or are behind on their payments
because they experienced

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:36.967
unemployment very recently.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:41.767
And so we discussed how all
of us, working together,

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:44.834
agency by agency, are
going to be working to

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:46.033
encourage job growth.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:49.700
And we discussed the need for
congress to continue to move

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.500
forward on an agenda of targeted
measures that can help small

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.767
businesses invest, that can make
sure that unemployed workers are

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:03.000
getting hired, that continue
to add to the momentum of job

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.200
growth and economic growth that
is needed so badly after the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.266
damage that's been done over
the last couple of years.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.433
We also got a full briefing
from our national security

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:15.667
team as well as Vice
President Biden on Iraq.

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:17.767
It hasn't received a
lot of attention lately,

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:23.734
but we are on pace to meet
every target that we set

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.300
at the beginning of
this administration,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.500
to have our combat troops
out and to transfer security

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.533
responsibilities to the Iraqis.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.533
And we had a discussion about
the progress that's been made

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.734
in terms of government
formation there.

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:39.567
We also discussed the
importance of the transition

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:47.133
from a Defense-weighted U.S.
approach to a more State

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:51.000
Department-weighted approach,
and the need to make sure that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.200
we are adequately funding and
supporting all the diplomatic

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.333
measures that are going to be
necessary so that we can partner

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:02.400
effectively with a new Iraqi
government over the long haul.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.400
We had a discussion about the
oil spill in the Gulf and the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.233
important measures that are
being taken both in capping the

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:20.166
well, in making sure that we are
dealing with the consequences on

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:24.467
the shorelines and estuaries
and bays across the Gulf,

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:29.100
and also making sure that
ordinary Americans who are

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.767
being devastated economically
are compensated properly.

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:35.333
Ken Feinberg has already
traveled to the Gulf,

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:39.767
and he is meeting with governors
and local officials with the $20

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:42.333
billion fund that
has been set up.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:45.133
We want to make sure that that
money is moving out as quickly

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:48.467
as possible, as
fairly as possible,

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:51.633
and that some of the people who
I've had a chance to talk to

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:54.533
down in the Gulf who are just
desperate for relief are getting

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:57.367
help as quickly as possible.

00:02:57.367 --> 00:03:03.300
And Secretary Napolitano also
briefed us on the range of

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.800
measures that are being taken to
ensure that we are coordinating

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.400
as effectively as possible when
it comes to skimming the oil as

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.967
it's coming forward,
initiating the burns,

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:16.200
trying to make sure that
we're capturing all the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.533
oil that we can.

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:23.066
And finally, we
talked about energy.

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:26.433
In the context of the oil spill,
as I said last week during my

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:31.133
Oval Office address, this has to
be a wakeup call to the country

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:36.300
that we are prepared and ready
to move forward on a new energy

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.000
strategy that the American
people desperately want but

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.333
for which there's been
insufficient political will.

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.967
It is time for us to move
to a clean energy future.

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:51.533
I think the American people
understand that it is a jobs

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:56.300
creator, that it is a
national security enhancer,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.233
that it is what is
needed environmentally.

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:04.300
And we have the opportunity
to build on actions that have

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.000
already been taken in the
House of Representatives.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.467
The Senate has an opportunity
before the August recess and the

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:15.967
elections to stand up and
move forward on something

00:04:15.967 --> 00:04:19.934
that could have enormous,
positive consequences for

00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:21.734
generations to come.

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:26.367
And the entire Cabinet
here recognizes,

00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:28.767
with all the other stuff
that they're doing,

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:32.433
that if we get energy right,
that an awful lot of things

00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:34.800
can happen as a consequence.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.700
So we are mindful that we
have a lot of work to do,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.200
but we are very pleased with the
progress that has been made by

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.767
each of these Cabinet members,
and we are looking forward to

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:52.800
redoubling our efforts
in the months to come.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.100
All right. Thank you.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.633
The Press:
Mr. President, are you
going to fire Mr. McChrystal?

00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:02.600
President Obama:
General McChrystal is on
his way here and I am going

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.800
to meet with him.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.934
Secretary Gates will be
meeting with him, as well.

00:05:07.934 --> 00:05:11.667
I think it's clear that the
article in which he and his

00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:18.734
team appeared showed a poor
-- showed poor judgment.

00:05:18.734 --> 00:05:22.567
And -- but I also want to make
sure that I talk to him directly

00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:24.400
before I make any
final decisions.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.333
All right.

00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:34.433
Let me -- actually, let me make
one last point about this.

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:37.500
Even as General McChrystal
is on his way here,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.500
I want everybody to keep in
mind what our central focus is,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.066
and that is success in making
sure that al Qaeda and its

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:53.233
affiliates cannot attack the
United States and its allies.

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:56.333
And we've got young men and
women there who are making

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:59.734
enormous sacrifices,
families back home who

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.433
are making enormous sacrifices.

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:06.734
And so whatever decision that
I make with respect to General

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:14.633
McChrystal or any other aspect
of Afghan policy is determined

00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:18.333
entirely on how I can make sure
that we have a strategy that

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:23.266
justifies the enormous courage
and sacrifice that those men and

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:25.734
women are making over there,
and that ultimately makes

00:06:25.734 --> 00:06:27.133
this country safer.

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:29.867
I know Secretary Gates
feels the exact same way.

00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:31.433
All right. Thank you.
