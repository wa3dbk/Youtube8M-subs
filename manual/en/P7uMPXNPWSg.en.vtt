00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.880
Hey Guys!

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.110
It's the Knitting Maniac again!

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.090
Today I'm going to teach you my favorite cast
on method

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.320
The Long-Tail cast on

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.410
You ready to go?

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.910
Let's get started!

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.320
This cast on method requires:

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.490
One needle and your yarn ball.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.609
Now, instead of adding your slip knot right
here with a little short tail

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.869
You're going to make a long tail by pulling
on your yarn

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.720
Like this . . .

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.269
and THEN adding your slip knot.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.189
So you pick that up onto your needle

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.539
How long your tail is really depends on how
many stitches you're casting on

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.270
and it takes a little practice to figure out

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.370
how much tail to leave

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.250
so that you don't run out of

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.050
the tail as you're casting on.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.980
So you can see how hanging from you needle

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.440
it forms an upside-down "V"

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.150
or I call it a "TENT".

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.190
So, you take your thumb and your index finger

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.260
go between your "TENT"

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.820
and with the rest of your fingers

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.310
grab around the other yarn ends

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.870
so this tightens this up here

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.230
like this

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.790
Now you take your needle

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.329
and you pull it back like a slingshot

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.579
and with your needle tip

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.400
go around to the left

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.810
DON'T SLIP THAT OFF YOUR THUMB

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.030
just go underneath that piece of yarn

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.929
then go over to the yarn that is

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:12.409
coming off your index finger

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.590
and grab it with your needle.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.240
Now, you are pulling that through right here

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.149
and dropping the yarn off your thumb

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.460
and that's your first cast on stitch!

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.060
So, go around to the left

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.679
under this piece of yarn

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.509
go over to the right and grab that yarn

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.999
and pull it through this hole

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:43.310
and drop the yarn off your thumb

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.680
Now you can see as you get going

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.810
you don't have to take the yarn off your fingers
at all.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.569
You just go over to the left

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.850
Over to the right pulling that through

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.680
Drop it off your thumb and after you drop
it off your thumb

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.619
Just grab that yarn with your thumb

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.039
to help tighten it up

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.329
and then you're right back in position again.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.240
So, over to the left

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.099
Over to the right

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:08.500
Pull it through

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.800
Drop it off

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.640
Tighten it up

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.390
And that's how you do the Long-Tail Cast On!

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.880
It's my FAVORITE method!

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.360
I've learned that with this size yarn

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.330
which is a worsted weight

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.640
I need about 12" for every 20 stitches

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.110
but it really depends on the size or your
yarn

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.110
the thickness

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.580
and how many stitches you need to cast on.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.670
You just don't want to run out of yarn tail.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.970
So I usually do mine even way longer than
I would ever need

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.890
and then just trim it down when I'm ready
to start knitting.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.060
So I made this little swatch to show you the
end result.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.190
It's a nice elasticy edge.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.480
And it's a smooth edge.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.230
The reason I love this cast on method

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.070
is it's also your first knit row.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.150
So when you make this cast on edge here like
this

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.220
it will have a purl bump on the back

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.100
so it's actually your first row!

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.720
So, if you're a beginner knitter

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.440
you may not understand what I'm talking about

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.680
but if you are an advanced knitter,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.760
you'll know what I mean.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.060
So, the Long-Tail method is one that I use

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.820
for most every project that I knit.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.189
So, thanks for watching!
