00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.430
NARRATOR: Getting into Harvard
with full financial aid

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.500
is considered achieving
the impossible for many.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.530
Yet, Ana Angelovska, a
senior from Nova High School,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.820
has done just that.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.460
Ana was invited to come to
the American Corner Skopje

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.740
to share her success story
with high school students

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.170
from several public and
private state schools.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.970
Also present was her
College Counselor

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.390
and the Dean of Students at Nova
High School, Bella [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.920
The purpose of this
presentation was

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.409
to inspire more high school
students to pursue their higher

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.300
education in the
U.S. What does it

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.740
take for an
international student

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.380
to receive full funding
from a U.S. university?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.690
As a certified
Education U.S.A. Center,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.430
the American Corner
Skopje is the place

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.940
to go if you are looking for
the answer to this question.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.890
Ana mentioned the rigor
of the curriculum,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.420
high SAT and TOEFL
scores, and the strength

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.030
of her personal essay
as important aspects

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.020
of the application.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.940
She also mentioned the
importance of guidance

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.773
she received from her
counselor and advisor.

00:00:56.773 --> 00:00:58.600
SPEAKER 1: Ana,
congratulations on getting

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.830
admitted into Harvard.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.040
Would you like to tell us why
Harvard in particular and why

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.116
do you think you
received full funding?

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:06.490
MS. ANA ANGELOVSKA:
Well, Harvard

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.320
is something that's
always when you

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.590
look in the U.S. and colleges,
it's some kind of a dream.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.300
And I thought that even though
I didn't have the perfect SAT

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.760
score, I had other
extracurricular activities that

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.080
were good for it.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.630
And also as my college
counselor says,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.040
Harvard is the holy grail.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.397
So if you get in, they
give a lot of funding,

00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:28.230
they have the money.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.020
So I decided that I have
to give myself a chance

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.580
and see if I get it.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.890
Regarding to the full funding,
Harvard is a need-blind school,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.420
so they only look
at your academics.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.779
And after you get in, they
look at the financial aid.

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:44.320
And they do have a
lot of money, they

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.310
do have a lot of
alumni that provide.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.900
So I think when they looked
at my financial status,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.184
they gave me the
full scholarship.

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:55.600
NARRATOR: She went on to discuss
the process of submitting

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.400
letters of recommendation,
while Bella

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.410
gave an insightful account
of the three months

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.540
it took her to write the
recommendation that best

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.220
represents Ana
and highlights all

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.616
of her outstanding qualities.

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:06.490
SPEAKER 1: So you're
Ana's college counselor,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.780
would you like to
tell us what made

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.336
Ana different from
the other students

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:10.960
and why do you think
Harvard chose her?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.585
MS. BELLA GLERGOVA:
It's very difficult

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:14.710
to talk about what has
made one student different,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.170
because as a college
counselor I do see them

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.150
all being quite versatile.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.440
But in the specificity
that is Ana Angelovska,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.200
I think what made her
resonate rather than

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.940
what made her different was the
unprecedented extra-curricular

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.680
and community service effort
that she genuinely produced.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.310
And the admissions people,
the smart admissions people,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.070
were very clever to pick up on.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.820
NARRATOR: Ana emphasized
that she believes

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.520
that her success can also be
attributed to her devotion

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.430
to volunteerism since U.S.
Institutions highly regard

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.340
proactive and philanthropic
individuals who do work

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.466
in their local communities.

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:54.340
SPEAKER 1: Any advice
you would give to those

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.533
who want to do the same?

00:02:55.533 --> 00:03:00.700
MS. ANGELOVSKA: I advise that
you study a lot, take more--

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.050
as much as you can intake.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.040
Try everything, not
just academically,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.190
but also a lot of community
service out of school.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.790
And just try to excel at
everything you're good at

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.899
and be proud of it
and show it off.

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.690
MS. GLERGOVA: Well, I
always give students,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.250
whether they come
from our school,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.050
or from the public
school system,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.600
or whether I meet them
in my neighborhood--

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.920
I always tell them to dream big,
because no one should prevent

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.890
you from that opportunity.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.510
I tell them to look at
everything that they are

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.590
and to pick up on things that
they like about themselves.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.320
And to think about things
in terms of why they

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.540
like themselves in this venue.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.040
NARRATOR: American
Corner Skopje can

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.650
provide all the necessary
guidance in helping you submit

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.420
your U.S. college application.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.680
We hold writing workshops and
conversation hours regularly,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.540
which give you the opportunity
to fine-tune your college essay

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.250
and practice your
talking skills.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.240
We have a variety of preparatory
books for the ACT, SAT, GRE,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.360
and TOEFL tests, and a
large collection of DVDs

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.920
free of charge for members.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.470
American Corner Scopje also
can provide information

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.830
about local groups with which
to volunteer with, put you

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.630
in touch with
individual advisers

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.880
to give you personalized
information on the U.S.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.000
admissions process, and give
you a U.S. college application

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.082
timeline and numerous resources
for each step of the process.

00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:21.040
All the U.S. Corners will
be able to assist you

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.570
in similar ways,
so please become

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.460
a member of American
Corners and take

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.510
advantage of this opportunity
to use all of our resources.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.920
SPEAKER 2: The top
universities in the world

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.200
are to be found in
the United States.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.200
So I came to the American
Corner and started

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.970
looking through some books.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.810
For example, the SATs,
the SAT preparatory

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.440
books for the critical
reading, math, and writing.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.090
I have been preparing for
the SATs for a long time,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.870
for three or four months.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.780
But some would say
that's too short.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.420
You were here to help me, to
guide me indeed, and tell me

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.400
where to look,
where not to look,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.380
and how to focus my energy
and my work towards one goal--

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.410
getting into a good university
in the United States.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.570
NARRATOR: There are 126
undergraduate students

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.490
from Macedonia
studying in the U.S.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.460
In the academic
year of 2008-2009,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.370
as reported by the Institute
of International Education.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.930
The mission of
American Corner Skopje

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.700
is to increase this number.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.220
Please join us for upcoming
success story presentations

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.050
