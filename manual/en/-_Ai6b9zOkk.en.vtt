00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.161
This is what we're looking for right now though,
the flame height is about a foot to two foot.

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:13.629
I'm controlling the line to make sure we're
not getting any spot fires on this side of

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:14.629
the line.

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.840
It's my job right now, just watching this
fire.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.530
We're here at Forestry Summer Camp, and this
is Fire Week, and the students are becoming

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.119
certified firefighters.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.310
This is an operational burn for instructional
purposes, just teaching the students how to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.320
do it.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.129
With 23 students here and the whole, and then
we had eight other professionals coming from

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.670
the State Forest Service, the Park Service
and the Nature Conservancy.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.339
They're all represented here to help and help
instruct the students.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:54.449
We started with a briefing that was led by
our burn boss, who is a student, and he's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.600
a senior.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.850
And he planned the whole thing.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.210
Then he told everybody what was going to happen,
the strategy that we're following, and broke

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.040
them up into three crews, and they all went
in separate directions to do their assignments.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.720
Each crew was led by a professional who gave
instruction throughout the whole thing.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.070
Now all you have to do to initiate this is
turn the head of this thing down right along

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.680
this outside edge.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.500
For the past week we've learned about fire
behavior and we've learned about what to look

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.190
for whenever we're actually out on a fire.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.550
So we were out here, and we got the fire started,
and the professors and the other people assisting,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.240
they would start asking us questions to make
sure we knew what was happening based on what

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.421
we had been taught, like the wind and how
the wind is going to affect the behavior of

00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.550
the fire and how it may heat a stand nearby.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.790
And you'll have the radiant heat coming off
and then you may get spotting.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.620
So we've been able to apply the things that
we have learned to this activity.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.550
And it's been really beneficial, I think.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.550
I love how I learn.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.620
You're taught the things, but you can't, if
you can't apply them, how can you really let

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.341
them sink into your memory and really know
what to do if you're in that situation?

00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:11.209
In the classroom they're going to go over
all the scenarios that you're going to see,

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.460
but you're not really going to understand
what it means when they're talking about it

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.599
in the classroom until you get out and apply
it in the field.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.030
You're not going to; you just don't get the
real effect in the classroom.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.750
And you really need to be on a fire to learn
about fire.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.519
That's it.
