You know iPad puts thousands of apps at your
fingertips… you know you can watch your

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.930
favorite movies and TV shows on its large,
multi-touch screen… but maybe you have some

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.810
questions about the device itself; for example,
how do you adjust the volume? What does this

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.460
cable do?

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.760
In this video, we're going to talk about the
physical features of iPad - including how

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.489
to care for it properly, and the different
parts of the device. We're also going to take

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.190
a look at charging the battery, and choosing
a protective case or cover. First, you'll

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.289
want to make sure you're familiar with everything
on the outside - in other words, the ports

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.339
and buttons on the back.

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.749
There's the power button, also known as the
sleep/wake button… the volume button…

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.190
and a small switch that lets you mute notifications
and sound effects…

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.190
There's also the microphone… a place to
plug in your headphones… and a powerful

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.590
speaker - right next to the dock connector.
The dock connector is what you'll use to charge

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.159
your battery, sync your iTunes library, and
more - all using the USB cable that came with

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.770
your device.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.890
Just plug it in, and you have several different
options depending on what you need. You can

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.380
connect the other end to your computer to
charge, sync with iTunes, or set up syncing

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.740
over Wi-Fi. If you just need to charge the
battery, though, it'll charge much faster

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.290
if you use the power adapter, which was also
included with your iPad.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.170
Plug the adapter directly into the wall, then
plug in the USB. Now you're not only charging

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.469
your battery; you're also giving iPad a chance
to sync over Wi-Fi or back up to iCloud if

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.880
you've set up either of those services. Just
keep it plugged into the power source, and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.740
iPad will take care of the rest. The battery
lasts about 10 hours when fully charged,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.750
so that should give you lots of flexibility.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.189
Why don't we take a look at some of the buttons
and features that work when the iPad is turned

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:13.189
on? Just press the sleep/wake button, swipe
to unlock, and you're ready to go. 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:19.380
You can also press the Home button to turn on
your device.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.060
One of my favorite things about the iPad is the 
front &amp; back camera, which comes into play mostly

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.740
when you're using FaceTime to video chat. It also
works with the built-in Camera app.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.740
You see, there's a lens on the front of your
iPad… and also one on the back.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.670
That means you can take a picture of what's in
front of you… or tap the on-screen icon to turn

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.300
the camera around. To switch back and forth,
just tap the icon again.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.100
With so many great features, you'll definitely
want to keep your iPad in good condition,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.050
so you can enjoy it for years to come. Remember:
no matter how durable the screen is, it IS made

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:08.480
of glass. To wipe off any fingerprints or smudges,
I recommend using a dry, lint-free cloth.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.660
I also recommend purchasing some kind of protective
case or cover. This one is made by Apple,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.530
and can be purchased online or at several
different stores - it even doubles as a stand.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.080
Other iPad users prefer a full case - to protect
both the screen, and the hard, metal part

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.030
on the back.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.410
Of course, it's what's on the inside of your
iPad that counts. But the outside is important

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.410
too. Now you know how to handle your device,
charge the battery, and much, much more!
