Hiho N900 user! I am zehjotkah from meetmeego.org and in this video I'll show you a new game from the Ovi Store!

00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:29.904
It's about Draw Challenge, an interesting game where you have to draw lines from a greyed out picture to make it colorful again.

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:35.441
There are different levels which you'll have to unlock to play them.

00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:40.969
I'll turn on the music because it is quite nice.

00:00:48.113 --> 00:01:01.688
You can pause the game on the top left, leave the game on the top right and show Mikroties website by clicking on their logo (btw. thanks for the review-version, Mikrotie!).

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:07.088
Let's start the first level!

00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:28.542
Sometimes it's not that easy but with the time you'll get better.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:43.823
The levels will get more complex as you can see now.

00:01:47.598 --> 00:01:55.661
If you draw outside of a line, your line will get deleted and your available color will reduce.

00:01:58.713 --> 00:02:05.047
I won't play it again now, so you can discover more levels if you buy it for 0,99â‚¬ at the Ovi Store.

00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:11.996
