00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.000
This is the dressing room.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.720
The concert will start
in two hours.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.360
The very first time
the UW Choir will perform
J.S. Bach's Mass in B Minor.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.440
It's a very difficult piece,
containing complex choir parts,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.600
very demanding physically
and technically.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.400
The choirists are the students
and graduates of
University of Warsaw

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.120
and other academies.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.640
Same goes for accompanying us
Beethoven Academy Orchestra
from Cracov.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.800
Most of the musicians
are students of Polish
and foreign academies.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.160
The soloists are singers
of the Polish National Opera.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.320
There where moments -
but please, keep it confidential,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.360
when the Choir
got a little scared

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.400
when it realized
how beautiful it sings.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.840
I've awaited this concert anxiously.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.600
The rehearsals did not indicate
it will go so well,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.320
that's why I'm really pleased.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.600
I'm speechless -
overwhelmed and tired.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.120
I'm very pleased
and I believe the second concert
will be even better.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.040
That is quite a challenge.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.680
Seventeen choir parts,
very long and difficult
both technically and physically

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.600
but very beautiful.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
As one of us said:
"The best of Bach"

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.600
I wish every choirist
an opportunity to sing it.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.240
I'm so happy I finally did
what I dreamt of
for almost eight years.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.520
