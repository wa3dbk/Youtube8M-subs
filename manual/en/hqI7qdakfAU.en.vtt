00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.040
The topic of this part is
the biceps exercises with dumbbells...

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.200
a.k.a. dumbbell curls.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.080
There are lots of dumbbell curls,
but I chose two of them for you.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.440
One of them is called Steve Dumbbell
Curl or Incline Bench Dumbbell Curl.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.080
This can be performed by beginners
with low weights...

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.200
and the more experienced
with higher weights.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.240
It is a shaping exercise which helps
the biceps enlarge and get rounded.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.400
Other one is called Scott Curl
or Preacher Curl.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.600
This exercise
helps to stretch the biceps muscle...

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.480
in addition to working and building it.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.000
I mentioned that
there are several dumbbell exercises...

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.520
but there is a reason
that I chose these two.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.040
If you have watched my previous
videos, you may have noticed that...

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.480
if an exercise has a background story
that is in the past...

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.120
or may not be well-known,
I like to give it prominence.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.800
Incline Bench Dumbbell Curl,
a.k.a. Steve Dumbbell Curl...

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.760
was an exercise done by Steve Reeves,
a champion body builder...

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.480
who was known for Hercules movies
until 60’s or 70’s.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.920
He performed this exercise in gyms
literally on an inclined bench...

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.760
and he got excellent results.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.560
For this reason,
Incline Bench Dumbbell Curl...

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.840
was also called as
Steve Dumbbell Curl.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.680
Other one, Preacher Curl,
a.k.a. Scott Curl...

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.960
was also named after a champion
body builder, Gary Scott.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.000
He worked his biceps very efficiently
by stabilizing his underarms...

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.040
and he was able to fill the gap
under biceps muscle.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.160
Now, let’s see these two exercises
one after another.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.680
After sitting down
and picking up the dumbbells...

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.840
it is important to
pay attention to the fact that...

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.160
I lean my back
and waist towards the bench...

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.400
without leaving any gaps in-between.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.320
And I try to keep it the same way
throughout the whole exercise.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.880
While lifting them, forcing myself,
I breathe out.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.760
While putting them down, I do it slowly
and in a controlled manner.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.400
Meanwhile, while lifting up,
I slightly turn my wrists inwards.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.040
This is the detail that gives the biceps
roundness and gets it into shape.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.680
You can do it
8 or 10 times for 3 or 4 sets.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.600
We put it down slowly
in a focused manner.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.680
This exercise helps to
form this height in your biceps...

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.240
and it is a good-shape exercise.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.040
Dumbell Scott Curl
or Dumbell Preacher Curl...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.320
is an exercise that you can do
on a 60-degrees inclined bench.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.720
Actually, there are special benches
for Scott Curl exercise...

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.200
but in case of their absence,
you can find this kind of bench...

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.720
in any gym and incline it to 60 degrees.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.640
I mentioned that
this exercise stretches biceps muscle.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.840
In order to do this, you need to lower it
to the lowest point...

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.560
but you should not
stop at the bottom point.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.720
In order to stretch your biceps, lower it
to the lowest point, but do not wait there.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.520
Breathe out if you have difficulty
while raising it up.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.480
You can do it
8 or 10 times for 3 or 4 sets.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.960
This exercise helps to fill and stretch the
gap between your front arm and biceps.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.640
You can watch a similar exercise
in my Barfix video.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.960
Pull-up, chin-up exercise
with hands turned inward.
