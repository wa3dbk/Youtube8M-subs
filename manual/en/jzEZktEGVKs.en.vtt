00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.120
I can always tell someone has a bad hip without
an x-ray, without talking to them -- if I

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.070
can just see their hip move.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.299
My patients, all of them, all the time, every
operation, are allowed to do everything that

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.180
they want. I'll tailor the operation to
make sure that happens.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.910
We make an incision and we take the hip completely
out of the joint. Once we get it apart, we

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.650
remove the ball in a typical hip replacement
and just take a saw and cut across the bone

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.609
in the appropriate area, remove the ball,
then we work on the socket part of the hip.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.350
We put a new surface to replace the worn down
cartilage that we have and then after that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.719
we turn to replacing the ball itself.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.719
The common ones over and over would be basically
infection, a blood clot can occur, or some

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.329
goal not met as far as the functional outcome.
For a patient, though, they have to be comfortable

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.070
that they've been heard, so that their symptoms
have been listened to and the operation is

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.079
matched to them, not to someone else, but
to them.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:19.079
You've got to get the joint surface directly
and fully restored and you have to get the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.979
length and leverage of the muscles around
the hip correctly adjusted -- they can't

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.530
be off a little bit and that's not just
leg length, it's a thing called offset too

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.759
that has to do with how far away the center
of the movement is from the center of your

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.200
pelvis.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.329
Metal we know a lot about -- it's plenty
smooth and it will never break. Ceramic's

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.320
smoother, is why you would offer it to a patient.
It has better frictional characteristics.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.909
I've tried hard to break some of the new
ceramic balls and I haven't figured out

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.799
a way to do so yet.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.799
No, nothing. Not a scratch, not a crack -- no
marks at all. And that's after being used,

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.500
hit with a hammer, dropped out of a second
story or so window, and now run over a few

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.280
times with a car. Nothing.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.280
The majority of patients, it'll last them
the rest of their life no matter what they

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.209
do.
