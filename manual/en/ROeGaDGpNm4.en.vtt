00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
I've Dave Thomas for cars.com we're here
with the 2008 jeep liberty jeep libertys

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.690
all new this year and it goes from a
very popular design you might be

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.929
familiar with something more in line
with the rest of the Jeep lineup like

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.480
the wrangler and the commander the old
liberty had a lot of fans mainly because

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.930
it was different from the rest of the
Jeep y know the new Liberty is certainly

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.109
that doesn't look any different than the
rest of the Jeep lineup in fact it looks

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.529
very similar to almost every other jeep
that's out there they all share a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.489
similar boxy look they look like they
came right out of world war two and

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.760
that's something that the brand is
actually trying to do but I might throw

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.230
awesome old fans delivery was one of the
few remaining small changes that had a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.030
swing-out tailgate and 408 cheap has
improved on that feature now it is a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.840
much more convenient lift up operation
which you know you just have to have

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.890
these days

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.719
the car is a little smaller than it used
to be but not a noticeable amount that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.469
has a secret underfloor storage
compartment that's actually waterproof

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.390
and the rear seats fold them the seats
fold down the real easy flip of a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.549
feather there but as you can see if the
front seat is anywhere recliner or push

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.869
back even the slightest degree it is
hard to put down one feature we like to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.310
see in the new SUV these days or
reclining back seats like these so you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.549
get a little more reclined for your
backseat passengers which makes a little

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.240
more comfortable gives a little more
Headroom like the Liberty sit up

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.320
straight

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.820
the dash is really flat it's almost a
90-degree angle this could be

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.850
uncomfortable for some people so this is
why you go out and actually test drive

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.840
cars before you buy them otherwise you
are sitting up high this is the seating

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.259
its lowest position and I'm pretty up I
you know there's there's plenty of

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.070
headroom but like i said you feel like
you're riding high and that's an SUV

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.960
trademark got a lot of people like the
liberty is actually very similar to the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.310
dodge nitro another all-new SUV from the
Chrysler Group unfortunately bars a lot

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.200
of the same cheaper interior elements
especially the bulky plastics on the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.939
dash on the doors that when you knock it
just sounds echo in hollow also some

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.210
flimsy stuff on the air-conditioning
vents it's just one of those things that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.390
when you're driving and you touch it you
can actually feel it being a little

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.960
cheap that's not something you like to
feel the 26,000 dollar SUV

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.120
210 horsepower it's adequate it's good
on the highway it won't blow the doors

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.570
off of a muscle car next year from the
stoplight but it does the job

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.660
it doesn't get the greatest gas mileage
and that's why if you're looking just

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.810
for acute you to run around town you
might not need all this off-road

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.640
capability deliveries gone from a
stylish cute you two more British SUV

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.720
and old fans might be turned off but
keeps hoping a lot of new customers come

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.500
in like the look like the new features
and are happy to the prices remained

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.140
relatively unchanged for additional
information on this car or any other go
