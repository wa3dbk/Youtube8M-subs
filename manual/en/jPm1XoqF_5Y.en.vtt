00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.900
The bow bends and out sprung a flame

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.500
Freezing the night sky 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.600
Bravely, with an azure song of parting

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.500
 I shoot you down…

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.700
Things forgotten from days long past, a scar torn apart 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.600
A cursed promise dwells in your heart

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.600
“If my end is inevitable, then I’d rather it be by your lovely hands…” 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.500
The darkness of the irresistible impulse completely engulfed him...

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.500
The spiraling flames of a twisted world pierce the cycle of life and death 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.200
Bravely, with a crimson blood-stained kiss, I shoot you down…

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.000
It's an ancient legend: He who has been injured by that beast will have a curse running through his entire body

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
... And eventually he will turn into a beast himself

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.200
That incident goes back to the day the two of them met

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.200
He was wounded while trying to save him

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.800
It all began when they met...

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.800
The parched tears bear a blue flame of grief

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.100
 They fire at him arrows glittering with silver

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.000
Again and again, until he is no longer breathing...

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:24.900
In a world where I have lost my beloved, what colors do the flowers bloom in?

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.500
A cross-shaped flame that embraced the moon, intertwining thorns

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.300
Bravely, with a final arrow of death, I shoot myself down…

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:28.600
In a world where I have lost my beloved, what colors do the flowers bloom in?
