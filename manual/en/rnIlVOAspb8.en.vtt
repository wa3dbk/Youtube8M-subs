00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.940
O, say can you see, by
the dawn's early light

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.860
what so proudly we hailed at
the twilight's last gleaming.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.160
We are privileged to
welcome to the Commonwealth

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.500
and to MIT, the President
of the United States

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.200
of America, Barack Obama.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.750
Thank you.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.490
Now Dr. Moniz is also the
director of MIT'S Energy

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.910
Initiative, called MITEI, and
he and President Hockfield

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.060
just showed me some of
the extraordinary energy

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.080
research being conducted at
this Institute-- windows that

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.500
generate electricity
by directing light

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.340
to solar cells, lightweight,
high-powered batteries that

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.890
aren't built, but are grown.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.280
That was neat stuff.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.170
Engineering viruses
to create batteries.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.820
So this thing is not moving,
now the light beams down--

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.480
Exactly.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.870
Go down on the solar
cell and start spinning.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.710
Exactly.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.750
More efficient
lighting systems that

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.140
rely on nanotechnology,
innovative engineering that

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.330
will make it
possible for offshore

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.970
wind power plants to
deliver electricity,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.080
even when the air is still.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.000
And it's a reminder
that all of you

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.310
are heirs to a
legacy of innovation,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.610
not just here,
but across America

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.010
that has improved our
health and our well-being

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.130
and helped us achieve
unparalleled prosperity.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.030
I was telling John and
Devall on the ride over here,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.479
you just get excited
being here and seeing

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.780
these extraordinary
young people and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.220
the extraordinary leadership
of Professor Hockfield,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.870
because it taps into something
essential about America.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.720
It's the legacy of
daring men and women

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.000
who put their talents
and their efforts

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.160
into the pursuit of discovery.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.320
And it's the legacy
of a nation that

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.730
supported those intrepid
few willing to take risks

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.020
on an idea that might fail, but
might also change the world.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.060
Countries on every
corner of this earth

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.940
now recognize that
energy supplies

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.360
are growing scarcer, energy
demands are growing larger,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.440
and rising energy use
imperils the planet we will

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.290
leave to future generations.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.060
That's why the
world is now engaged

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.720
in a peaceful competition to
determine the technologies that

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.970
will power the 21st century.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.850
From China to India,
from Japan to Germany,

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.460
nations everywhere are
racing to develop new ways

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.430
to produce and use energy.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.860
The nation that wins
this competition

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.200
will be the nation that
leads the global economy.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.610
I'm convinced of that.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.040
And I want America
to be that nation.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.920
It's that simple.
