Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen, and in this segment,
we're going to talk about how to harvest plums.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.670
Now plums are one of my favorite fruits, and
I just love them so much. Plums are such a

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.100
wonderful addition to your garden, and I really
enjoy the fruits. And, they're easy to harvest.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.570
OK, when you're harvesting your plums, make
sure that they're fully ripe. So when they're

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.971
really dark purple, and they kind of, are
soft on the outside, they're ready to harvest.

00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:33.500
If they're still really hard, or green, or
sometimes even red still, and they're not

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.601
feeling soft to the touch like an eraser would
feel, then they're probably not ready to harvest

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.480
yet. And, you don't want to pick them when
they're too green, because a lot of times

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.460
they will never totally ripen up. The, I've
found that the plums are kind of a fruit that

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.750
you need to pick when they are ripe. You can't
pick them too early. And there's a lot of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.530
tricks that you can use to harvest them. And
probably the easiest trick that I've used

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.740
is to actually pull the branches down. So,
you don't actually have to get the ladder

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.130
for the bottom branches, you can just pull
them down. It doesn't hurt the tree to pull

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.380
the branch down a bit, and then grab the fruit
off of the branches. And it makes it really

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.530
easy to do it that way. And for the taller
fruit, you can grab a ladder, and always make

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.790
sure someone is holding the bottom of the
ladder when you're trying to harvest them,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.750
because it can fall over very easily and become
very dangerous. But a group effort is always

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.939
best when you are harvesting plums, so if
one person can hold the branch down and another

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:38.100
person can grab it, or someone holds the ladder
for you, and you can pull the plums off the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.920
tree, it's the best way to do it. Because
you never want to fall off the ladder. And,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.850
they do hold onto the tree quite tightly,
so make sure and kind of pull them quickly.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.610
That's what I've found works better then slowly.
Because then they'll pop right out. Because

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.210
sometimes they kind of grab onto the tree
and they won't let go. So, saying that, they're

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.420
really easy to harvest, and they'll last for
quite a while. And they're a great fruit.
