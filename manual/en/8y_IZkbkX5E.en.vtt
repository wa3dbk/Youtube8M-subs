00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.911
let us study the circularly and elliptically
polarized light.

00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:06.041
in previous section we have discussed about.

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:12.651
linearly or plane polarized light in which,
light has, a single plane of vibration so

00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:14.211
when it is polarized.

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:20.821
about circularly or elliptically polarized
here we can write.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.511
in, a circularly.

00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:26.971
polarized light.

00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:33.360
electric field vector oscillates. in a plane.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.821
and, plane of oscillation or plane of vibration.

00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:45.871
rotates.

00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:51.221
either clockwise. or anticlockwise.

00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:58.291
here you can see, this is realistic situation,
where we can understand what, circularly,

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:05.470
polarized light is, in which, you can see,
the vibration of electric field is.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.470
rotating.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.360
along with the direction of propagation it
is propagating.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.100
so, the envelope of the tip of electric field
vector produces, a spiral of which the projection

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.551
of y-z plane is a circle.

00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:25.400
similarly if, the amplitude of electric field
oscillation also changes.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.341
in the 2 directions perpendicular to the direction
of propagation the light will become elliptically

00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:35.260
polarized, here you can see in this elliptically
polarized light.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.220
the envelope of the.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.510
tip of, electric field vector. is oscillating,
in spiral of which when the projection is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.010
taken on y-z plane itâ€™ll be an ellipse this
is the way how, electrically and circularly

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.371
polarized light can be differentiated.

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:58.000
right now we are going to limit our discussion
up-to linear or plane polarized light in the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.640
coming sections of the topic.
