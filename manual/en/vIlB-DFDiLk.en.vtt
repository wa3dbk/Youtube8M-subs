What's up everybody, this is Raymond. From
Crayola Kicks. I'm here with Expert Village.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:17.770
On this tip, we're going to be applying some
brown inside a leopard pattern. Inside of

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.560
the circles. To give it a more realistic leopard
print. Take your round brush and brown paint.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.450
What I'm going to do is I'm going to lighten
the brown this way it stands out from the

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:51.719
black. Just a little bit more, just mix it.
Make sure you mix it properly, you don't want

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:09.251
the white streaks. You don't want to trash
your sneakers. That's about right. Now we

00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:11.030
apply to our pattern. What you do now is just
basically apply in the middle. You can't try

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:32.869
to get like a thick coat, just so you don't
have to go over once. There's your leopard

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:32.999
pattern.
