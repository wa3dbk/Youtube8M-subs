Hi my name is Karl James owner of Creolesoul
Catering located in Round Rock, TX and one

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.709
behalf of Expert Village I'm here to show
you a spicy tuna tartare. Now we want to dice

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:20.390
some red onion for that and we really want
it really fine and minced so we're going to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:39.829
make some small dices against that red onion.
(Like that and across) That will make some

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:59.109
really small dices from those thin slices.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.960
Once again I don't really give you amounts
I think you should really kind of play around

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:17.350
with things that is based on what you like.
You can't really guarantee your recipes toward

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:26.930
to much you know of everybody else, I mean
cause everybody is going to have a different

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:40.149
taste. So I'm just going to run my knife through
here, mince that red onion a little bit more

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.800
so that the pieces are small and manageable.
You want these pieces to be smaller than your

00:01:46.800 --> 00:02:02.170
tuna this is basically just the accent. Okay,
so we got our onion nice and minced be careful

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.330
with the sharp knife if your cutting you can
loose a finger. We'll put that to the side

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.560
and move on to the next step.
