Hi, I'm Jennifer from Workroom Social, and
I'm going to show you how to use a walking

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.820
foot on your sewing machine.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.010
This is a walking foot, and a walking foot
has feed dogs, these little teeth, that move

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.550
up and down with the feed dogs that are on
your sewing machine.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.120
You'll see the feed dogs right here on the
sewing machine, and this is what pulls the

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.970
fabric through the machine.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.490
Now when you're doing regular sewing with
any other regular foot, there are no feed

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.150
dogs on top, but sometimes you want something
pulling that top fabric along with your bottom

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.150
fabric.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.281
It's really great for quilting when you're
sewing lots of layers of thick fabric, and

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:51.940
it's also good if you're sewing thick, slippery
materials like vinyl or leather.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:59.579
To install the walking foot on my machine,
I'm just going to make sure that the pressure

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:08.100
shank here is up, and then I'm going to unscrew
the screw.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.090
We saw that this shank fell off, that's fine,
put that aside.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:21.060
With the walking foot, you want to make sure
that your needle is a little bit low.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.749
Your screw here that attaches, that holds
your needle in this area corresponds with

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.649
this lever that's on the walking foot.

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:40.670
So when you install this, you're going to
make sure this lever is on the right, but

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.779
you want it to sit on top of this screw, that
holds your needle in.

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:53.729
So I'm going to put that in, and this is resting
on there.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.439
Then you can take your screw and put your
screw in to hold the foot, and just tighten

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.609
it so everything is secure.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.520
If you have a screwdriver, you can use a screwdriver
just to hand-tighten it.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.450
Now you can rotate the wheel to bring the
needle back up.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:30.100
You can see as the needle comes up and down,
this lever is resting on this piece and moving

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.670
with the needle, and so that's what controls
these upper feed dogs.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.670
Once you have your walking foot installed,
let's go ahead and try it.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.330
I have two pieces of fabric right here.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:51.070
I'm just going to align my raw edges and put
the fabric into the machine underneath the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.140
presser foot.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.190
My thread tails are to the back, and I'm going
to line up the raw edge with my seam guide

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.110
at 5/8ths of an inch.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:08.930
I'm going to lower the presser feet and I'm
just going to sew.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.260
Now you can see as I'm sewing, the feed dogs
on top are pulling the top layer with the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:26.350
bottom.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.650
And that's how you use a walking foot.
