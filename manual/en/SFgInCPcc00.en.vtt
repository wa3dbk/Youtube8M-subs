00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.870
speaking of killers and shooters the
batman shooter now is being accused of

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.679
staying that his therapist to
brainwashed him to commit that crime in

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.810
the aurora colorado

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.879
nobody ever

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.019
this is

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.019
kind of a controversial we're thinking
we need to kind of a value would that be

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.129
information here

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:24.349
there was a drug abusing inmate who
spent some time neared james holmes in

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.730
itself

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.929
his name is stephen under our

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.640
and he spoke with the denver westward
and said that here for our conversation

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.400
with james holmes in jail on july
twentieth

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.820
after he was brought in for allegedly
killing the twelve people and shooting

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.630
fifty-eight others

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.880
they were in different cells

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.510
but unrest says that he heard homes

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.100
slamming himself into the wall and that
by yelling he was able to have this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.360
conversation with homes and he alleges
that home said

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.270
mike there are pissed brainwashed me and
program to me te execute this killing

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.160
also saying that home said i felt like i
was in a video game when he was carrying

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.210
out these attacks of shooting uh... all
of these people in the movie theater now

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.910
it doesn't appear that this is

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.940
necessarily reliable testimony from
mister conrad because

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.400
police indicate that

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.840
the layout would not allow for this for
our conversation the even take place the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.960
layout of the prison where the jail
where they were being held

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.010
uh... so it's a we had some question
here have to say

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.780
a story told to us by a drug addict
criminal reporting what a psychotic

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.170
individual told him may not be that
reliable i mean do you do we really need

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.170
uh... an investigation to figure that
out

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.760
if the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.230
if if it were me making a decision

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.640
as to whether if you throw this out or
not

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.789
it would be thrown out certainly adam
believe the bid anybody suggesting that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.460
this committee testimony of any kind of
just being discussed

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.359
so uh... that that's what we're hearing

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.230
now let's just evaluated at face value
for a second

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.010
do but you any of us believe the idea
that

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.109
if they would even be possible for
thirty the program this man to kill

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.119
maybe that's not the right word i mean
certainly people have influence over

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.340
others but how do you gonna react to a
claim like that two cents completely

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.060
absurd

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.279
that's not what do you think

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.639
another manchurian candidate

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.239
uh... i don't know i don't know if it's
really possible certainly uh... someone

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.869
who's uh... mentally unwell is probably
more susceptible

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.059
to uh... suggestions like something like
this if it happened but i don't know if

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.570
they really by well i mean we do know
that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.639
you can

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.339
program someone to kill

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.699
it usually starts getting them in a very
young age and then they end up with a

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.839
bomb shelter themselves that uh...
additives are in uh...

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.079
in kabul

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.719
uh... and then boom so we can happen but

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.879
this doesn't sound unlikely that their
peers who just sign a few times in

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.359
college would be able to program and
that way

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.439
yeah interesting

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.530
within today

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.849
we're doing the bones show by know that
we may not mention this off and some

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.659
people might not know the list that we
have a bunch of but there is a bonus

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.169
shelled it was hosted
