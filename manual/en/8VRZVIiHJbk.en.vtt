O'kay so there you have it. We have our Eggs
Benedict, classic dish. Now normally you would

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.980
garnish these with black olives on top or
scallions, whatever you want. Add some color

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.490
and make it nice. Whatever you want. You have
our Eggs Benedict, our breakfast potatoes,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.109
diced baby reds sauteed. We added a little
bit of dill, butter, make sure that you power

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:32.829
cook your potatoes first. Then we have the
variation, the Eggs Florentine of which we

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.870
have the English muffin, a seared tomato,
a poached egg and then our Florentine sauce

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.761
is really easy. It consists of butter, garlic,
fresh spinach, you cook that down and add

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:50.110
heavy whipping cream and reduce it to about
half so it is nice and thick, a little salt

00:00:50.110 --> 00:01:07.270
and pepper to taste. I get to eat so let's
have a taste. This sauce is so good. Come

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:17.430
on.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.990
The sauce is so good, you can taste the spinach
and the garlic and then when you get to the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.020
tomato it is refreshing and it goes along
with the egg. Everything is so nice together

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:42.979
here. Let's have some potatoes and again very
good. The fresh dill, that does it. How about

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:53.039
the Eggs Benedict, one of my favorites. You
can see how this came out. You can see I cooked

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.250
my Eggs Benedict medium so the yolk is not
too runny, just medium, a little juicy but

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:14.840
not too much and that is how I roll. Okay
let's taste this.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.980
Very good. The hollandaise with just a hint
of lemon, very refreshing, goes with the Canadian

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.250
bacon, the potatoes, everything is perfect.
