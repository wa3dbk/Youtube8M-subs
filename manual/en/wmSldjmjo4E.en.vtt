00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.700
Salutations celestial sight seers!

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.660
I'm David Fuller, welcome to Eyes on the Sky;
what's up this week?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.110
Every so often, not just two planets, but
three of them come close to each other in

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.490
the sky from our perspective.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.910
Over the next ten days or so the planets Mercury,
Venus and Jupiter will making some fantastic

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.900
configurations in the sky, all that you can
see naked eye, no optical aid needed!

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.360
That said, the third brightest object in the
sky � Venus � can help guide us to the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.180
other two, even when it is barely past sunset.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.440
On Monday evening, the view will be something
like this, and will require a very flat western

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.390
horizon.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.549
With Mercury this low, it would normally be
quite difficult to find with nothing to act

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:11.799
as a guide.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:18.070
But Venus is about 3 degrees away, so if you
cannot spot Mercury naked eye, use binoculars

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.140
to pick off the innermost planet.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.900
Over the next few days, movement appears to
only happen from the speedy Mercury, which

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.400
rises up to meet Venus where it is.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.900
Yet Jupiter is actually getting closer to
Venus by a full degree every day.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.100
Now let's imagine how this scene appears from
overhead, rather than from our perspective

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.100
on Earth.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.780
What is happening with the orbits of these
planets, that causes such a planetary pile

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.540
up in the sky?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.300
Note the line created by these planets, as
we look at them from Earth: All three planets

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.780
are on the opposite side of the solar system
from us, but because Mercury and Venus move

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.320
faster than Earth does in orbit, watch what
happens.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.960
By the end of this week, the two inner planets
and the king of the gas giants are in a straight

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.870
line of sight from where we are.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.720
So how do you think that will look in the
sky?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.180
More on that when I come back.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.480
Dark Sky Fact: Fully shielded lights that
use motion sensors to turn on only when necessary

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.510
� and that turn off when unneeded - are
the most efficient way to light up a given

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.060
area and maintain safety.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.489
By Friday, the three planets are within about
4 degrees of each other, which places them

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.090
in the field of view of binoculars.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.700
All of them are quite bright too � Venus
at negative 3.3, Jupiter at negative 1.5 and

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.730
Mercury at a bright-for-it negative 0.8 magnitude.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.880
As the sun sinks lower, look to see if you
can spot Jupiter's 4 Galilean moons in binoculars

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.010
with the two other planets; that may be a
challenge with Venus so bright, but it shouldn't

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.420
be impossible.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.500
On Saturday, the trio tiptoes even closer
to each other, within a 3 degree area.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.090
Of note here is that Mercury is just one and
a half degrees from Venus, so when you can

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.690
just barely see Venus after sunset, use binoculars
to pick off Mercury just above it to the north,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.819
then look for Jupiter to the east.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.800
But the best happens on Sunday: Though Mercury
is slightly farther from Venus, the three

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.209
planets are closest to each other collectively,
at approximately two degrees each!

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.720
That's about two pinky-widths held at arm's
length, and with a very wide field telescope

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.000
like an Astroscan or rich-field refractor,
it may be possible to include all three in

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.630
one telescopic field of view.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.860
Even without doing that, the naked eye view
will be a superb sight to see, and even simple

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.930
binoculars will enhance the view substantially.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.550
It is a great week to witness this triple
conjunction, so look every evening you get

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.709
the opportunity, in case it is cloudy later.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:20.350
Along The Ecliptic: With so much action occurring
in the western sky, the only real naked eye

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.120
planet left to see right now is Saturn, which
is already up on the southeast after the triplet

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.040
of planets has set.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.720
The Moon reaches full phase on the 25-th,
so this is an ideal week for all of this planetary

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.240
viewing.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
That's all for this week.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.720
Keep your eyes on the sky and your outdoor
lights aimed down, so we can all see, what's

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720
up.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.599
I'm David Fuller, wishing you clear and dark
skies.
