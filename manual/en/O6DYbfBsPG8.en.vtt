00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.580
Hey, what's going on everybody?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.970
I'm Sam from
 Computer TV.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.980
And you are looking 
at the HP Mini Note.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.030
This is the 1115NR edition,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.850
and if haven't had a chance to 
check this one out don't worry,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.350
now is the time we're going
 to tell you all about it.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.130
First of all, 
netbooks are great,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.490
because they're super portable,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.360
they weigh next to nothing,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.100
you can put them in your backpack,
put them in your purse,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.670
and take them to class,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.630
you can take them on, 
you know, an airplane.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.010
They really are superb for travelers.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.210
So, let me tell you 
a little more about it.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.150
First of all, this Mini Note runs on
 the 1.3 GHz Intel Atom processor.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.950
You have 1GB of DDR2 RAM.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.200
You have a 16GB Solid State drive.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.060
Now that's different,
a lot of netbooks we've seen

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.430
have a 160GB hard drive, 
this does not.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.220
16 GB Solid State drive.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.060
It comes with Windows XP Home.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.310
802.11b/g wireless.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.100
Now, you have a 
3-cell battery on here,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.900
so you're going to get about
 three hours of battery life.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.230
You also have 2-in-1 card reader,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.510
it reads SD and MMC cards.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.780
So it's a great way to 
upload all your photos,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.130
all your videos,
and get them onto the web,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.910
so you can share them 
with friends and family.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.850
Now this,
as you can see,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.990
is an 8.9 inch widescreen display.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.180
And, a lot of HP Mini Notes, 
they have that 10.1 inch,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
this actually has a smaller screen,
it's 8.9 inches.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.930
So definitely take note of that.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.700
And this whole thing, 
this whole netbook,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.000
weighs just over 2lbs.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.480
It really is incredibly light,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.400
can fit in your backpack and
 you wont hurt your shoulder,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.350
no back pain at all.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.170
Let's take a tour 
around this thing,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.120
and learn more 
about this Mini Note.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.420
Starting up top,
in the bezel right here,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.820
you see you have your 
1.3 megapixel webcam.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.400
Again, your 8.9 inch widescreen display,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.760
this actually has a 
1024x600 resolution.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.000
Your built-in stereo sound speakers.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.610
You have a 92% full sized keyboard.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.440
I am a fan of the HP netbooks,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.340
their keyboards are
 super easy to type on,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.410
and you don't feel 
cramped at all,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.680
and a lot of netbooks
have smaller keyboards.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.690
OK, so moving down below,
you have your mouse lock,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.760
your touch pad, and your 
left and your right click right here.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.060
Moving on to the side,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.930
you have your card reader, 
right here,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.370
again, for your MMC and your SD cards.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.200
This is your USB 2.0 port.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600
And right here, 
this is nothing actually.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.740
It's just part of the design.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.180
We have your ethernet in here,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.480
this is your headset and your mic jack,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.950
this is 2-in-1.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.320
This right here, this is for 
your docking station,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.360
it's an extra port to hook up to
an external docking station.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.400
Another USB 2.0 port,
that's two in total,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.310
and right here,
this is your power.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.510
Up top here, this is your
power on/off switch,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.440
and you also have, 
on the other side,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.160
your Wi-Fi.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.680
OK, now we're ready to
close up this netbook,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.280
and you can see the design.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.180
Very nice looking.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.850
You have these funky swirls.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.720
If you are concerned with
eco-friendly products,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.460
you want to be green,
you'll be happy to know

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.070
that this netbook is actually
ENERGY STAR qualified.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.940
And, you'll see, 
right here,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.000
you have this
ENERGY STAR label,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.520
right here,
to prove it.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.040
So for all of you 
green people out there,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.440
want to keep

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.650
ecofriendly lives,
definitely this is one to check out.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.120
This is the HP Mini Note.

This is the 1115NR edition.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.120
Definitely check this one out.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.210
