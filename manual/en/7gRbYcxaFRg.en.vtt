00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:41.239
Lunch time. Habit Burger.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.063
I gonna eat a humberger.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500
This is a common type of humberger.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
It's big!

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:28.200
Umm... Delicious. It's a tasty minced meat.
Oh,yeah. It's a good taste of meat.

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:34.000
It was delicious.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.100
Let's go now!

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.300
Tornado is likely to occur.
Are we all right?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.300
We plunge into clouds.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.000
It's likely that clouds come down to the bottom.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.600
Wow! We are floating on the road, aren't we?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.800
Yes, we are definitely floating.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.900
There is only one road from a little while ago.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.500
Next crossing is about 19miles away from here.
We are going straight forward next 19miles.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.100
We never lose our way,huh?

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.730
I really wanted to see such a view.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.400
Well...There are so many traces of stepping on break.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.510
It seems like stepping on break very hardly.
What are they?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.680
This road is bumpy like waves.
So,We are floating.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.700
It's very cold. I bought a knit cap at gas station.
A middle-aged woman said that I look nice with this cap.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.950
I see an airplane.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.100
We arrived at Mojave airport. An airplane is displayed here.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.900
I see an air plane "phantom".
Can we enter here?

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:40.740
MOJAVE AIR AND SPACE PORT.

00:03:44.447 --> 00:03:46.720
Look around the airport.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.420
That's C-130 aircraft body.

00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:58.610
The horizon became good orange.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.150
Oh! it's upside down.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:12.580
Airliner, Big, old type. Is it tristar?
It's Tristar.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.830
Good old airliner. It's a big airplane.

00:04:18.832 --> 00:04:26.770
I can see the jet fighter.
SAAB 35 Draken. Swedish fighter.

00:04:28.275 --> 00:04:33.510
The magic hour in the wilderness.

00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:39.036
What's that? What airplane?

00:04:39.036 --> 00:04:47.050
I don't know the name but it is the airplane.
That's a jet airplane.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:53.700
The airplanes are parked on like scrap car.

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:08.260
The big airliner.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.115
There are no engines.

00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:16.940
There is the armored combat vehicle.

00:05:18.455 --> 00:05:23.460
Armored troop carrier.

00:05:23.465 --> 00:05:26.920
Why these on here?

00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:29.556
Someone's hobby vehicle?

00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:35.830
We found the army navy shop where near the airport.
