Presenter:
Hey, everyone, today I am going to show you

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:08.559
the ProGrate and Tombstone Combination Kit
for the KettlePizza pizza oven accessory on

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:18.160
the Cooking Everything Outdoors show.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.090
So let's take a look at our ProGrate and Tombstone
Combination Kit because this is really cool.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
This is for all of you hardcore pizza-makers
out there.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.660
They want to take your KettlePizza experience
and knock it up a few notches.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:42.880
So inside you're going to get your heavy,
heavy Tombstone.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.530
And the first thing you're going to notice
is that obviously it's fragile but that you

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.070
need to make sure that you wash this but with
water only.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.400
Now, I'll tell you and it says here, there
maybe some slight imperfections and that's

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.550
not going to affect the cooking at all in
any way shape or form but do not cook with

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.759
this until it is completely dry.

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.149
So wash it off with water and put it out in
the sun, not in an oven or on the stove to

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.810
dry, just put it out in the sun until it's
completely dry.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.859
You don't want this to crack on you.

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.859
And look at that.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.090
That is 5/8 inch Cordierite.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:34.719
This is the idea surface for baking pizzas,
breads, calzones, whatever you can think of.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:41.430
Now, inside of each kit comes a complete assembly
and usage guide.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.060
This is our hickory chunk rear basket.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.100
Our ProGrate makes all this come together.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.689
This is 304 stainless steel, will not rust.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.859
So let's put all this together now.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.630
Assembly is a very, very simple.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:10.000
You simply take your 5/8 inch Cordierite pizza
stone, place it in the holder on your ProGrate.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.690
And then your basket, when it's time to put
this in a kettle simply sets towards the rear.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.360
This replaces the grill cooking grate that
you have in your pizza kettle right now.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.040
So you have your KettlePizza pizza oven conversion
kit, your ProGrate with your 3/8 inch Cordierite

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.210
pizza stone.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.530
And you want to just set this in there.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.960
Now, I find that the best way to do this is
to hold the inside bracket and the Cordierite

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.090
baking stone, put it in towards the thermometer
side first.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.000
Gently set that down to the first wing nut,
the second wing nut and then the third wing

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
nut.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.050
And you have that assembled and ready to go.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.390
So putting this on the Weber kettle is just
as simple as the first time.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:14.370
Transport it over to your grill, set it in
place, put the lid on it and you are now ready

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.190
to rock and roll.
