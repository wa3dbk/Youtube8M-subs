bjbjqPqP Think about it; If you give a child
something to write with, they going to make

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.240
images. Its an instinct, ingrained in every
human being. As we get older we learn our

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.880
letters and we suppress our visual instincts.
Many people never attempt to reach their potential

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.350
in drawing because they are scared of messing
up or looking bad. You dont have to worry

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.500
about messing up today-Tell em why Little
Old Man! Little Old Man: Because baby, you're

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:39.870
a firework! 
As I was saying.....Today, YOU are going to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.050
Draw Katy Perry and you are going to surprise
yourself with the quality of your work. I

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.579
recommend that you hit the link in the video
description. The link will take you to a page

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.370
on my website with photos and text. This guide
on my website will enhance your understanding

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:07.729
of what I am teaching you in this video. Everybody
grab your pencils and paper, lets get started.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:16.290
Step 1: Draw a bowl shape. Step 2: Observe
and draw the nose shape at the top of the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.390
bowl shape. Notice its size and placement
within the bowl shape. Also, add the lines

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.251
which look like parentheses; notice their
angle and their placement compared to the

00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:35.730
outside of the bowl shape. Step 3: Add the
three shapes to make the smile. Notice the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.280
placement of these shapes, compared to the
nose and the smile lines. Be sure to notice

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.020
that the upper lip is the smallest of the
three shapes and the bottom lip is the biggest.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.350
Step 4: Draw in the teeth. Notice that each
tooth appears to become smaller as they go

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.600
further back in the mouth. This is not the
case in real life, but it is when we draw

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.869
a smile. Try not to darken the lines between
the teeth too much. Step 5: Merrill? What

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.860
the HECK is THAT? Relax! Don't worry!....Ill
make this nice and simple. First, notice that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.700
the new shape is taller than the bowl shape.
The triangular shape at the top center is

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.140
slightly wider than the nose shape. Look closely
and notice that the left side is squared and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.840
the right side is rounded. Also, be sure to
see that the right side is lower than the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:42.440
left. Step 6: Listen, youre a firework!!!!
Don't freak out! This is EASY! Hair moves

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.330
all the time. You do not need to get this
shape perfectly. Use your observational skills

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.890
to get the general shape of the hair. Again,
don't be intimidated by this step; just generalize

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:03.989
what you see. Step 7: Draw in the eye shapes.
Notice that there is one eye length between

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.230
the eyes. Notice the difference in size between
the top eyelashes and the bottom ones. Notice

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:19.670
the size of the iris compared to the whites
of the eye. Step 8: Draw in the shapes for

00:03:19.670 --> 00:04:03.769
her body. 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:44.610

00:04:44.610 --> 00:05:14.930

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:46.369
