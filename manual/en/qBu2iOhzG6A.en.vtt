00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.509
Halitiphobia, the irrational fear of bad breath. 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.969
I'm a Halitiphobic. 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.799
I'm not so much afraid of me having bad breath

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.199
I am afraid of other people having bad breath as in "HEY BUDDY! Your breath smells like crap!"

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.359
Maybe you should develop a case of 
Halitophobia. (In unison) 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.939
Now I know what your asking, how do we know if we have bad breath?

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.999
You use this. A spoon. I know what your thinking.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.059
A spoon? You eat with a spoon. You play spoons.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.510
You spoon your girlfriend?

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.030
You take the spoon, you put it to the back of your tongue and gently scrape. 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.270
Let it dry. 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.380
and take a whiff!

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:51.380
If it stinks, your breath stinks. And if your breath stinks, this is the only kind of spooning your going to be getting. 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.090
The smart viewer out there will know, that to check our breath, we check our tongue. 90% of bad breath comes from residue and bacteria on your tongue. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.360
ON YOUR TONGUE!

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.000
Now your mom doesn't sound so stupid for telling you to brush your tongue, now does she?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.180
Tongues are like sponges. Soaking up all that bacteria. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.700
Toothbrushes are made to clean the smooth surfaces of your teeth, not your tongue. 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.700
and the tongue scraper? Thats like trying to clean your carpet with a snow shovel. 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.660
This isn't going to work.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.850
And then there's the option

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.450
that actually works. 
This!

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.610
The orabrush! 
The soft bristles feel great on your tongue. 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.180
Go back and forth a few times, then go all the way to the back

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.780
and pull it forward, and see what comes off. It helps cure bad breath!

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.700
It lasts as long as your toothbrush.
Using it in the morning, eliminates bad breath. 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.520
Fresh breath and use it at night. 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.520
right before bed. 
Oh yeah, you know what I am talking about. 
I don't know what that means.....

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.750
So do you, me 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.960
and all 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.510
and all the rest of man kind a favor and get one of these! And your uncle Steve? the 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.180
one that looks like he has a thick coat of fur on his tongue? Get him one too. Put it in his Christmas stocking 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.739
He'll thank you for it later. His wife will, his kids will

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.499
everybody will be happier. Trust me.
