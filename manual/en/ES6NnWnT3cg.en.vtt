the Spanish are being taken outs to see

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.480
the picture to feed a much bigger
southern bluefin tuna kept in pens

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.090
anchored an hour sure is by sickly

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.349

every year hundreds of thousands of

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.430
the open ocean

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.020
and drag to close at Alans they're fed
twice a day

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.940
in six months they'll double in size and
international quota limits how many fish

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.679
can be taken in the first place

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.069
those in the tuna industry say after
decades of

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.670
overfishing that means this is
sustainable fishing

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.010
to the dismay and environmental groups
use a southern bluefin tuna numbers

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.319
are still critical the quota Borcina
ruching

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:58.780
has just been increased an amazing sight
now

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.000
maturity the children this pen resold in

Sheena in this alone well over

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.600
million quotas are important

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.960
but as the number of people eating fish
around the world increases

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.909
probably not enough to save the species
hey can stare has made a poor tonight

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:22.780
the tuna fishing

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.820
he believes at current levels it
sustainable

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.310
but not as demand increases the village

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.780
idiot can work at all if you push up
towards

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.190
9 billion people in the world

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.909
the fish has to come from somewhere and
the fish can come

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.950
out of the ocean anymore so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.929
at a facility Australia South Coast
scientists are trying to farm tuna

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.200
the Ottoman ambition is to be our 25
southern bluefin tuna

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.530
from juveniles that were produced in a
round hatcheries Ron

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.060
ball court test so far have failed

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.979
but there is confidence is possible
kingfish produced here

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.979
are among the species that have been
bombs commercially

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.680
the years it wouldn't be much alike for
a southern bluefin tuna

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.420
buddy the fish can be found it could
save the species

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.709
and meet ever-increasing demands Andrew
