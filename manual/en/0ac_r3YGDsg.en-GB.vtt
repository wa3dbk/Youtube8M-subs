What Destroys Your Smash (15) Taking it Side of Your Body

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.498
This one I am going to explain to you

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:16.020
what makes smash poor

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.846
what destroys your smash

00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:19.197
is

00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:21.530
big issue

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.131
I have spent how many years

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:29.579
yeah 41- 42 years in badminton

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.050
as a player and as a coach

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.083
I see this problem so much

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:40.860
what?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.899
They turn their face side and they take shuttlecock

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.061
side of their body

00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:50.220
so watch this

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.919
so I am ready like that

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.206
opponent hit shuttlecock from there to here

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:57.511
so

00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:02.512
lots of people at the beginning they learn this way

00:01:03.282 --> 00:01:04.161
they are ready

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:05.517
shuttle comes

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.704
they turn it that way

00:01:09.058 --> 00:01:11.561
so their view becomes there

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.700
and then when they hit it

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.328
they turn it again and then hit it that way

00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:24.418
it looks like shooter

00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:29.445
they are set that way

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:32.201
and then suddenly you change and shoot

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:37.127
the archery player set that way

00:01:37.574 --> 00:01:39.271
and then change and shoot

00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:41.886
it looks like that

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:45.516
the dart player targets there

00:01:46.132 --> 00:01:50.003
he set dart like this and then throw there

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:55.320
to me its not so logical

00:01:57.613 --> 00:02:01.024
shuttle is coming from there to here

00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:04.545
I am hitting back to the other side

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:09.975
why my face, my impact point has to be changed

00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:11.213
the side way

00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:13.365
and then hit it that way

00:02:14.058 --> 00:02:15.677
it makes swing

00:02:16.293 --> 00:02:17.193
swing

00:02:19.424 --> 00:02:22.215
it makes this player lose the vision

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:23.423
target vision

00:02:23.423 --> 00:02:24.564
target is there

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.375
but he has to look

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:28.078
she has to look that way

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:30.773
and then hit it that way

00:02:33.974 --> 00:02:39.008
I saw this kind of beginner, intermediate players

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:39.760
so much

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.185
if I see 10 players

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:44.913
8 or 9 players normally do that way

00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:47.533
so watch the shuttlecock

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.041
so you are ready here

00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:52.899
shuttlecock is there

00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:55.796
long, longer back

00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:59.996
then your face should remain there

00:03:00.843 --> 00:03:03.140
so I watch shuttlecock

00:03:04.094 --> 00:03:06.235
I can feel the court

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:08.998
so I can control it where

00:03:10.845 --> 00:03:12.128
but watch this

00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:13.509
this player is ready

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.649
shuttle comes

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.857
and then turn and hit it there

00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:20.727
they turn and then hit it from side

00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:28.762
so same

00:03:30.347 --> 00:03:31.371
question

00:03:33.558 --> 00:03:34.927
if I say to you

00:03:35.758 --> 00:03:38.766
if you hit your smash over there

00:03:39.597 --> 00:03:44.072
10 times and then 7 or 8 smashes goes there

00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:46.541
I will give you million pounds

00:03:47.557 --> 00:03:48.231
then

00:03:49.678 --> 00:03:51.539
would you smash there

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:55.956
turn your face and hit it there

00:03:55.956 --> 00:03:56.853
like this

00:03:57.561 --> 00:03:58.678
no you wont

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:00.464
because you don't know where it is going

00:04:01.264 --> 00:04:02.582
you will see

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:05.725
shuttle and then corner together

00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:08.112
you will see there

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.380
so you want to feel that

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.796
you want to see the shuttlecock

00:04:11.796 --> 00:04:13.397
so you can hit it there

00:04:16.597 --> 00:04:17.442
that way

00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:18.911
you can

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:22.209
you can make line between

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:24.072
string, you can make a string

00:04:24.072 --> 00:04:26.324
between the shuttle and the target

00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:27.976
there will be string there

00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:31.875
if you take shuttlecock in front of your body

00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:33.696
but

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:37.004
if you turn your face and body

00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:39.485
and then make your impact point

00:04:40.177 --> 00:04:41.616
side of your body

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.281
then its complete guess

00:04:49.758 --> 00:04:51.028
just simply

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.417
today go to the club

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:55.116
and experiment

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:56.313
look

00:04:57.898 --> 00:04:58.940
who will win

00:05:00.587 --> 00:05:04.819
the player hit very accurately not very powerful

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:07.044
but very accurately

00:05:07.583 --> 00:05:10.138
but a player once in a while

00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:11.658
hit very hard

00:05:11.658 --> 00:05:13.476
but shuttle goes every where

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.803
he cannot beat the other one

00:05:16.696 --> 00:05:17.884
but further more

00:05:18.838 --> 00:05:21.004
taking shuttle side of your body

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:22.500
in smash or clear

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.535
you have to use only

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:27.398
arm

00:05:27.922 --> 00:05:28.840
your body is there

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.827
your body weight is not going in to the shuttlecock

00:05:32.335 --> 00:05:34.885
so its not really powerful either

00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:38.338
so your weight has to go

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.819
your body has to go

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.178
behind it and then goes

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.723
here, here like that

00:05:44.754 --> 00:05:45.302
here

00:05:45.302 --> 00:05:46.750
so my whole weight

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:48.809
goes to the shuttlecock

00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:51.122
and then I can feel where it goes

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.729
if you ask me Lee

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:05.829
technically what is most important thing in badminton

00:06:06.922 --> 00:06:11.844
I would say taking shuttlecock in front of your body

00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:16.950
is the most important technique in badminton

00:06:17.504 --> 00:06:20.449
I call that diamond technique

00:06:22.588 --> 00:06:25.501
no other technique can beat that technique

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:27.838
because shuttle is there

00:06:27.838 --> 00:06:29.702
you know where it goes

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:31.804
you hit and you are ready

00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:33.820
you have recovery

00:06:34.174 --> 00:06:35.501
you have vision

00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:38.095
you can make so many deceptions

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:45.172
if you cannot take shuttlecock in front of your body

00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:49.659
if you take side of your body turn your face away

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.407
you are only able to do 10% of badminton skills

00:06:55.977 --> 00:06:59.906
90% of badminton skills you are not able to do

00:07:00.537 --> 00:07:05.103
because shuttlecock is not in front of your body

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.686
and your vision is away from the target

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.359
shuttle, target has to be one line

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:16.605
that way

00:07:16.852 --> 00:07:18.813
not that way

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:23.319
