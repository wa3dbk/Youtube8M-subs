00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.037
(Dr. Karla Kennedy-Hagan).
Hello.

00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:03.030
My name is Dr. Karla
Kennedy-Hagan

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.050
with the School of Family
and Consumer Sciences

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.040
at Eastern Illinois University.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.023
If you're in the mood for the
perfect dessert, we'll show you

00:00:10.023 --> 00:00:12.057
how to make this creamy
chocolate milkshake.

00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:15.027
Sit back, relax, and
enjoy the show.

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:16.033
(Lindsay Schwarz).
Hi, my name is

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:19.017
Lindsay Schwarz and this
is Sondra Cremillis and

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:23.040
I'm going to discuss some
ways to gain weight

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.057
if you are underweight.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.057
I'm a graduate
student here at

00:00:27.057 --> 00:00:29.043
Eastern Illinois University.

00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:32.020
While many people today
are overweight or obese,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.070
there are a certain
percentage of the population

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.053
whose health could be benefited
by an increase in weight.

00:00:38.053 --> 00:00:42.083
There are many reasons for
wanting to gain weight.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:46.083
Many athletes, genetic
predisposition to a low body

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:50.087
weight, there are people who are
recovering from diseases.

00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:53.097
So weight gain can be
beneficial for many people.

00:00:53.097 --> 00:01:00.023
There are consequences for being
at too low of a body weight.

00:01:00.023 --> 00:01:03.037
Some of these include
increased risk of infections,

00:01:03.037 --> 00:01:05.097
particularly, upper
respiratory infections,

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:08.000
the loss of a menstrual
cycle which could

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.030
lead to problems with
fertility later in life.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.077
And also there is an increase
in osteoperosis and anemia

00:01:14.077 --> 00:01:18.010
if a person was
significantly underweight.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.020
How can you figure out
if you are underweight?

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.020
There is a BMI test
that you can do.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.050
You just take your weight times
your height squared, multiply

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.057
that by 703 and if it's under
18.5, you are underweight.

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:37.017
Also, other tests including
body fat percentages, that

00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:39.090
could also be a good indicator
if you're underweight.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.073
This is Sondra and she is
going to discuss with me

00:01:43.073 --> 00:01:46.030
a concern that she has
regarding her weight.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.063
(Sondra Koumelis).
Well, I was recently

00:01:48.063 --> 00:01:50.023
at the doctor, and he told
me that I was underweight

00:01:50.023 --> 00:01:52.063
and I needed to gain
some additional pounds

00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:55.040
and so I had turned to
Lindsay for some help.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.047
(Lindsay). 
Okay, and in order

00:01:57.047 --> 00:01:59.067
to gain about 1 pound a
week, you need to increase

00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:03.010
your calorie intake by about
500 calories and you don't

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.007
really want to gain more
than one pound a week,

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:08.037
even 1/2 pound would be good.

00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:11.037
So just increase your calorie
needs througout the day.

00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:13.007
(Sondra).
Okay, that sounds great.

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:14.060
(Lindsay). 
Okay, and I'm going to

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.073
give Sondra some
tips on how she can

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:18.090
incorporate more
calories into her diet.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.023
Never skip meals, eating
consistently throughout the day.

00:02:22.023 --> 00:02:24.087
You still want to follow the
food guide pyramid just picking

00:02:24.087 --> 00:02:28.047
higher calorie foods in
all of the food groups.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:31.000
For example, if you are
choosing to drink juice,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.047
cranberry juice has more
calories than orange juice.

00:02:34.047 --> 00:02:37.013
Just eating larger amounts
of each of the foods

00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:38.070
in the food groups.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.097
Beverages are a really easy way
to increase your calories

00:02:41.097 --> 00:02:45.063
throughout the day because they
are easy to drink even if you

00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:47.003
are not hungry, you
can always drink

00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.047
and you're still getting
some calories in.

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:52.060
Also, it's important
to excercise because

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.053
you want to gain muscle
mass and not fat mass.

00:02:56.053 --> 00:02:59.053
So I'm going to give you some
tips on some snacks that you can

00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:01.037
eat throughout the day
because it's important

00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:04.020
to eat snacks in
between your meals.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.020
A few high calorie snacks
include peanut butter and jelly

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.027
sandwiches, there's many high
calorie energy bars out there.

00:03:11.027 --> 00:03:14.017
Some are better than others.

00:03:14.017 --> 00:03:17.043
It depends about your
taste preferences.

00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:21.003
Also, milkshakes are a really
good source because you get

00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:24.093
your calcium and some
protein in there as well.

00:03:24.093 --> 00:03:28.033
So I'm going to demonstrate
how to make a milkshake

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:32.023
that is a chocolate milkshake
and it is higher in calories

00:03:32.023 --> 00:03:34.033
than a typical milkshake.

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:38.037
So what you do is you add 1/2
cup of--this is two percent milk

00:03:38.037 --> 00:03:44.043
because it has a little bit more
calories than skim milk.

00:03:44.043 --> 00:03:48.050
Then you want to add
about 1 cup of ice cream.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.080
You can use any flavor you
want, I chose chocolate

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.080
and that's about three
scoops of ice cream.

00:04:01.047 --> 00:04:04.070
Then after you add the
ice cream, I'm adding

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.017
1/4 cup of chocolate
Carnation instant breakfast.

00:04:08.017 --> 00:04:10.047
You can add vanilla or
strawberry and this is

00:04:10.047 --> 00:04:13.053
just a way to add more
nutrients in calcium

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:16.053
and calories into the shake.

00:04:16.053 --> 00:04:19.043
After that, you'll stir
it and mix it up.

00:04:19.043 --> 00:04:32.017
Then, you pour it into
a glass and enjoy.

00:04:32.017 --> 00:04:37.070
And Sondra is going to taste.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.007
(Sondra).
It's really good.

00:04:40.007 --> 00:04:41.097
(Lindsay). 
And this right here

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:46.000
has 429 calories which
is a significant amount

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.030
of calories to eat in
between your meals.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.027
It also has 18.5 grams of fat
and 10 grams of protein.

00:04:56.027 --> 00:05:00.097
So, just like a lot of people
in today's society need to

00:05:00.097 --> 00:05:03.030
lose weight, there are
a significant amount

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.093
that would benefit
from a weight gain.

00:05:05.093 --> 00:05:09.020
So I hope that if you are in
that population that would

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.093
benefit from the increase weight
I have given you some tools

00:05:11.093 --> 00:05:14.013
to use in planning your diet.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:26.000
Thank you.
