“This episode of DNews is brought to you

Buick, GMC or Cadillac vehicle.”

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.870
I love chewing ice.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.360
What does that say about me?!

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.400
AM I GOING TO BE OKAY?!

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.320
Hey guys, it's Trace for DNews.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.530
Ice chewing is a thing with records of it
dating to the 1600s!

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.750
People do it for different reasons, like if
your refill never came, or you just like the

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.280
crunch…

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.870
But one thing's for sure, it has NOTHING to
do with being sexually frustrated.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.960
Abnormal ice cravings are part of something
doctors call pica, or the craving to chew

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.230
something with no nutritional value.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.860
If it's specifically ice, that's called pagophagia,
and the MAIN thing ice chewing can indicate

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.400
is iron deficiency or anemia!

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.880
Seriously, it's a symptom!

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.640
Of course, this is if you're chewing a massive
amount of ice, not just a cube or two.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.739
They're not sure why people who are iron deficient
crave ice, since there's no iron IN ice cubes,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.970
perhaps it's because they're crunchy?

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.830
Ice chewing can also be symptoms of emotional
problems like stress, or something more serious

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.500
like obsessive-compulsive or developmental
disorders.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.790
Again, you'd have to chew more than what's
in the bottom of your water glass to be diagnosed

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.330
with this, but anyway…

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.430
Though we don't know WHY people chew ice.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.210
We know they do, and have for hundreds of
years.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.120
Dentists don't recommend chewing ice, because
YES, ice chewing CAN damage your teeth.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.680
You might not see the damage, but it's there,
and it's cumulative over time.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.810
Though they seem hard, tooth enamel is really
brittle, and is about as easy to break as

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.810
glass.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.479
The reason they DON'T break is because your
teeth are made of microstructures of enamel

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.479
and dentin.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.830
The microstructures keep microscopic cracks
from spreading, but that doesn't mean they

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.480
aren’t any cracks.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.009
A study in Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences found human teeth can withstand

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.840
1000 Newtons of force, while other primates
with crunchier diets have thicker enamel and

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.450
thus stronger teeth.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.590
Those primates can crunch nuts and fruit pits,
or grind thick plants, where we would literally

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.590
crack a tooth.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.920
Add to that, the temperature shifts from chewing
ice.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.310
Your mouth stays around the high 90s normally,
but introducing ice can drop that temperature

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.550
just as you crunch on the ice.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.900
Colder teeth are even more prone to cracks!

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.650
Knowing people's affinity for chewing the
cold chunks, a company called Scotsman Ice

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.930
Systems created an ice machine that creates
an easy-to-chew ice nugget, it's more like

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.290
compressed snow.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.220
You can find it at Sonic, if you're near one.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.510
Bottom line, chewing ice doesn't hurt you,
but it can damage your teeth if you do it

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.510
too much.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.000
It can cause fractures, chipping, and cracking,
not to mention increased temperature sensitivity

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.630
and decay.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.730
Plus, dental fillings, crowns, veneers and
such don't have the resiliency afforded to

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.370
natural teeth, so THOSE will wear even faster.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.410
Enamel doesn't grow back, so next time you're
chewing on ice, think of your old person self,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.420
because they're probably gonna be pissed.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.420
Are you like me?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.750
Do you chew ice?

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.750
Why?

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.290
Did you ever think about it?

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.819
If you don't, why not?

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.920
Comments, leave one, that's why they're there.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.730
I love you guys, thanks for watching DNews.

questions on twitter: I'm Trace Dominguez.
