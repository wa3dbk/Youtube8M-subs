00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.079
I first heard about Céline through a stylist
friend

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.810
It just felt like something finally cut through
my emotional sensibility, you know?

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.480
There are not many houses left I can rely
on for that subdued, quiet dignity

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.230
Quiet dignity matters to me, and I think it
matters to Phoebe too

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.679
There are many parallels between our lives

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.010
I'm a gallerist and she's married to one

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.890
She was born in Paris and I regularly catch
the Eurostar when I do the fairs

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.890
I take quality and aesthetic seriously, and
I think Phoebe does too

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.799
A real gallerist is unobtrusive and anonymous

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.170
Today I can wear my pool slides to meetings
at Claridge's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.189
and no one bats an eyelid

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.689
That's function

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.100
Those blocks of colour

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.570
They look exactly like the Bauhaus coat in
look 30

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.350
Pure genius Philo

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.880
Phoebe brought a whole new luxe consistency:
a cleaner kind of chic

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.700
We were hooked

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.430
Now, it's become the way I curate my life

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.820
Yesterday, I took a picture of the sky on
my way back from Café Gitane

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.729
And tagged it "Very hashtag Phoebe Philo"
and it got 295 likes

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.299
It was grey and textured

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.600
and it reminded me of the walls of the new
London store I saw on Style Bubble

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.600
Now, I want to redo my floors but my landlord
is like, "No fucking way Vivian!"

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.590
I choose this house because it's created the
uniform for the ultramodern woman

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.890
The Philo effect

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.310
At first I thought, luxury leather is too
old for me

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.610
At that point I was a maximalist

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.000
You know, all 70s prints

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.520
But so is Phoebe at heart

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.590
At work we have this motto:

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.020
WWPPD: What Would Phoebe Philo Do?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.840
Wear Stan Smiths with a suit

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.629
Wear your sleeves too long

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.959
Keep a pot of lush seasonal greenery always
available

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.330
and keep your left shirttail tucked in, right
tucked out

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.190
Buy your jumper two sizes too big, then tie
it around your waist

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.680
At the Vogue Festival I was sitting front
row

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.160
I didn't know if she would get on with me

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.530
if we would see cool eye to eye

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:23.830
But I caught hers; just for a tiny second,
we smiled
