00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.700
My name is Jeff White and I'm a research entomologist
for Bed Bug Central and the host for Bed Bug

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.230
TV, Bedbugcentral.com.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.160
I have no idea how I got into bugs and bed
bugs, and here I am six years later and having

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:22.609
a lot of fun with working with bed bugs and
I'll be talking to you about pest control.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.410
Dogs have been used for decades, to find bombs,
to find drugs, to find all different kinds

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.410
of things.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.900
They've even been trained to find turtles
and so can dogs be trained to find bed bugs?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.630
And what you need to know is that yes dogs
have been trained to find the odor of live

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.630
bed bugs.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.090
They can find as little as one bed bug.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.960
And so we see in the news all the time, these
dogs running around scratching on beds, saying

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.000
bed bugs are here, and it's a very cute topic.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Let's be honest.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.760
You know a cute little beagle comes into your
house, runs around, can detect bed bugs, pretty

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760
neat.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.260
But what I can tell you is, you need to do
your research.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.050
There are actually some dogs out there that
aren't working properly and that can often

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.540
create for you a bigger headache than you
need.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.140
And so yes dogs can work very well and detect
bed bugs.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.990
Now if you call a company, hat you want to
ask them is, how many inspections have they

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.990
done?

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.990
How long have they been doing it for?

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.420
You want to find the most experienced company
that you can find that's using dogs.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.400
And then when the dog comes into your house,
and god forbid it does scratch in a location,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.820
and says yes bed bugs are there, you want
to do something that is visually confirming

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.160
what that dog is seeing.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.100
Do an inspection, or have the company do a
quick inspection of that area to try and see

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.130
if you can confirm what the dog said.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.220
We're hearing a lot of reports of people bringing
dogs in, they say you have bed bugs, but they

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.000
can't find anything.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.770
Yes dogs can detect bed bugs at a very low
level, only one bug, and you may even very

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.000
easily missed that through a visual inspection
but if a dog scratches in say five different

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.320
areas and says there are bed bugs in these
five different areas, you should be able to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.270
confirm bugs in at least two or three areas.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.390
And if you can't do that, you want to question
the company in how well that dog is working.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.010
Yes you can miss these bugs, but if it's scratching
in that many areas you should be able to see

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.010
something.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.429
And so I believe dogs can find bed bugs, I
know that they can find bed bugs because I've

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.370
worked with them, but you want to make sure
you do your research, follow up on what the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.849
dog is saying, and you want to bring a dog
in, it's a grat first step in to identify

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.079
bed bugs in your home.
