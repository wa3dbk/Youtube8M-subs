00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.560
- We need to get our air
in so that we can carry out

00:00:04.584 --> 00:00:06.852
the functions of
the respiratory system,

00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:09.935
and we're going to start out
in the upper respiratory tract.

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.101
From here on out we're looking
at plumbing.

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:13.975
We're looking at structures

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.852
that influence how the air flows
through the plumbing.

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:25.477
And so even though there's
two ways we can get in,

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:29.602
we can get into the respiratory
system through the mouth

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:31.059
and into the oral cavity,

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:36.310
or through the external nares
and into the nasal cavity.

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:37.975
The nasal cavity,
there are a couple

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.226
of structures in here
that I want you to be aware of.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.852
First of all,
this is actually skull,

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:47.226
and these are holes
in the skull bones themselves.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.975
These are your sinuses.

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.393
They're called
paranasal sinuses.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:54.975
Hopefully we
have a half head prep

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.351
that we can look at to examine
these different structures.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.518
Once we are
through the external nares,

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:06.435
air is through the external
nares and in the nasal cavity,

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:11.935
remember the nasal cavity is
the space that's superior

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.185
to the hard palate.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.935
You'll notice
that there are some,

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:19.975
I don't know,
little--

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.975
what are those, bumps?
They are bumps.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:28.975
These are actually epithelial
covered pieces of skull.

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.810
They're bones that are part
of your skull.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:34.975
And make sure that you
understand that this image right

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.059
here is actually a sagittal
section down the midline.

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:43.268
It's a mid-sagittal section
with the nasal septum removed,

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:44.975
so that we can
actually see this.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.975
If it truly
was a mid-sagittal cut,

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.393
we'd go right down the middle
of the nasal septum,

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:57.435
which separates the left nostril
from the right nostril.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:58.975
If we remove the nasal septum,

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:02.018
then we can look
into that nasal cavity space,

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:03.560
and you'll see these bumps.

00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:10.560
These guys are
your nasal conchae.

00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:15.810
And when we cover the skull,
you'll learn the names

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:20.226
of the bones that lie
beneath the epithelium

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.975
and create that structure
of the nasal conchae.

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.975
This guy is my
inferior nasal concha,

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.768
this is my middle nasal concha,

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:36.727
and this is my
superior nasal concha.

00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:41.643
And what's the purpose?
Why do we have these things?

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:42.975
Because the lovely air

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.976
that you breathe
in when you are not smoking,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.894
comes in,
and your nasal conchae,

00:02:49.918 --> 00:02:51.976
like, move it all around.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.975
Like, they make
the air turbulent.

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.685
Why?
It helps you smell better,

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.685
because it moves the air
all around and touches

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.685
your olfactory epithelium.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.810
It helps condition the air.
It helps warm it up.

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:12.975
It helps moisten it before you
send it onward into the rest

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:16.435
of the respiratory tract.
All right.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.101
So once we get turbulated,
that's totally a word,

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:27.643
you go into the nasal pharynx.

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:30.477
I'm just going to-- no,
I can't make a line over it.

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:34.435
This is my nasal pharynx.
We already know that.

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.935
The nasal pharynx is superior
to the soft palate.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.602
And remember
this little friendly guy?

00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:42.935
Do you remember that guy?
That's the uvula.

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.560
The uvula is the extension

00:03:44.584 --> 00:03:46.894
of the soft palate
into the back of your throat.

00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:50.310
It's the worm thing hanging down
in the back of your throat.

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:55.310
Now, this might be one of my
favorite structures ever.

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:56.810
Do you see that right there?

00:03:56.834 --> 00:04:00.226
Okay.
You saw where I drew.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.685
Do you agree that you might
argue it might be a hole? It is.

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.310
It's a hole in your nasal
pharynx that connects,

00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:16.894
are you ready for this,
to your middle ear.

00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:19.976
Really?
Yes, really.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.602
I am not telling you
a lie this time.

00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:27.768
It's true.
This is your auditory tube.

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:32.643
Auditory tube?

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:36.310
No, Eustachian
tube is a way cooler name.

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:41.143
Eustachian tube
or pharyngotympanic tube.

00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:44.310
Eustachian, who in their right
mind would remember that,

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:48.018
except for me because that's
how I learned it?

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:50.975
Auditory tube lets you
know that yeah,

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.393
this probably does connect
to your ear, so that's cool.

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:58.268
Pharyngotympanic tube,
that's a good one.

00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:02.226
Pharyngo, it's in the pharynx,
tympanic,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.685
it goes to the part of your ear

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:09.310
that is attached or connected
to the tympanic membrane,

00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:14.894
which is your eardrum.
What, this thing?

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:15.975
That thing.

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:18.226
You experience
that guy every day,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.975
and if you did--
maybe not every day,

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:23.727
but at clutch moments
in your life

00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:26.435
the auditory
tube does its thing.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:30.975
And if it didn't,
you would be crying right now.

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:35.935
The auditory tube is what helps
you equilibrate the pressure

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:39.185
in your ears
when you change-- okay.

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.059
It helps you equilibrate
the volume of gas

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:45.975
in your middle ear
when you change elevation,

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.975
which is changing
atmospheric pressure.

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:50.351
Dude, really?

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:53.018
Yeah, because you have air
in your middle ear,

00:05:53.042 --> 00:05:55.852
and when you go
to a higher elevation

00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:59.768
you are going
to a low-pressure environment.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:04.477
And the low pressure,
when a gas is at a low pressure,

00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:07.768
it actually expands its volume.

00:06:07.792 --> 00:06:10.810
Well, the gas in your middle
ear expands its volume,

00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:12.810
and it pushes
against the tympanic membrane,

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:14.894
and it pushes
against the oval window.

00:06:14.918 --> 00:06:16.852
It's, like, expanding
in your middle ear,

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.185
and how does that feel to y'all?
That hurts.

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:22.268
That done hurt.

00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:24.185
And if it hurts,

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:26.059
you don't like that,
so what do you do?

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.643
You go like this,
right?

00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:31.310
Do it right now.
You can totally hear

00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:36.226
your auditory tube open,
and when it opens,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.894
it allows gas to go in or out.

00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:42.768
If you go to a higher pressure,

00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:46.435
hard for us at sea level
unless we go into the water,

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:50.351
but if we were on Mount Everest,
and we decided to come down,

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:53.268
then as the pressure increases,

00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:57.268
the gas in our middle
ear actually shrinks,

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.975
which same thing happens.

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:01.685
Your ears start feeling funky,
because there is, like,

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:06.018
pressure pushing in
on your tympanic membrane. Ow.

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:10.059
And so all you have to do
is pop your ears, right?

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:11.852
That's just opening
the auditory tube

00:07:11.876 --> 00:07:14.894
and allowing gas
to go back and forth.

00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:17.560
I love the auditory tube.

00:07:17.584 --> 00:07:20.435
You can't see it
unless we have a half head,

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:22.685
so I hope we
have a half head too.

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:25.310
Okay.
We've got our pharynxes.

00:07:25.334 --> 00:07:27.685
The pharynxes we know already.

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:32.975
Here was nasal pharynx,
here is oral pharynx,

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.975
and this guy is laryngopharynx.

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:38.268
And we're going to spend
the next entire section

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:40.643
talking about the larynx.

00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:45.018
So we already know
what pharynxes are,

00:07:45.042 --> 00:07:46.727
especially the fact that this--

00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:48.894
I'm drawing a green line
through my--

00:07:48.918 --> 00:07:51.018
what structure is that?

00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:53.101
That's my esophagus,
clowns.

00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:57.268
So our esophagus, you can
send air down your esophagus,

00:07:57.292 --> 00:07:58.975
but let's not,
because there isn't going to be

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:01.018
any gas exchange
that occurs there.

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:04.602
There will be only belching.

00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:05.935
All right.
Are you cool?

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:08.435
Is there anything else
that you need to know?

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:11.975
I don't think so.
Let's move on to the larynx,

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:15.975
which will explain
how and why you can hear me.

00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:17.999
I can make sound right now.
