00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.230
With the hips, literally and figuratively
at the center of everything we do, it goes

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.730
without saying today's exercise, the most
important one that you're not doing, is going

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.500
to involve the hips.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.790
Let me show you what I mean today.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:24.540
What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.770
The most important exercise that you're probably
not doing is the one I'm going to show you

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.770
here today.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.710
Now what got me to thinking about this and
the reason why I thought it was worth a video

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.199
to instruct and show you this, was the video
I did over the weekend.

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.030
Which was the Top 10 Biggest Workout Fails.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.769
And one of the ones we covered in there was
the RIP DL, which I call it.

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.629
Right, and I showed you the importance of
the hip hinge.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.570
Alright when we hinge our hips we can hinge
straight down, like that here.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.120
Or we can hinge with a backward movement of
the hips as well.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.250
That's a critical point, so much so that I
thought, why don't I show you how to actually

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.580
train that and how much of a carryover that
that actually has, and we do that with our

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.580
bands.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.190
Now if you guys don't have the ATHLEAN ELASTIX
Bands you can find them over at our website

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.640
in our training bands section.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.910
But basically they're the big thick resistance
bands, enough to resist your own bodyweight.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.800
And we already have one hooked around something
sturdy.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.610
Ok this is around a Smith machine, it could
be around a squat rack, something that's not

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.780
going to move.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.160
Now I'm going to demonstrate with two bands.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.910
If you're just starting out and you're going
to use this exercise as an activator, right

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.173
a glute activator and then you're going to
want to use one band.

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:41.360
If you're going to try to use it as a strengthener,
you're going to use two bands.,alright.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.521
So basically we just take it around put it
right inside of itself, like that and it's

00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:49.521
anchored around.

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:55.240
Now we take both of them and we're going to
step inside, like this.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.160
Put them around our hips and we kneel on something
that's going to tolerate our knees.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.790
So basically the importance here guys is two
things.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.299
Number one, you want to feel what it's like
to hinge at the hip with the backward movement

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.180
of the hips, like I showed you in that second
demonstration.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.540
So think about it, when you're going to do
a squat, when you're going to do a RDL, when

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.159
you're going to do anything, even a bent over
row, you shouldn't always be bending straight

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.280
from the hips.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.491
Which is what a lot of guys will do especially
for the bent row.

00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:35.249
With a bend row you want to get forward with
the trunk but backwards with the hips.

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:40.519
That will set up that arch, in the low back
right here that you need for a bent row.

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.599
If we go into a squat, right it should feel
as if the first move is down and back.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.599
So when I resist against this band here, if
I let it go it's going to pull me back and

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.999
down, ok.

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.501
Same thing for the RDL, it's going to pull
me back and down.

00:02:56.501 --> 00:02:57.590
That's the perfect position.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.150
So number one, it's going to teach you what
it's like to first hip hinge backwards as

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.650
opposed all in the four directions.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.769
It's going to protect your back as we talked
about in that other video.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.709
The second and most important thing here is
glute activation.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.450
That's so important to everything we do and
I'll demonstrate as soon as we're done here.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.029
After I let it go, the exercise is, contract
the glutes to squeeze your hips forward.

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:27.340
And again with two of these bands on here,
that's a lot of resistance wanting to pull

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.400
me back down here, right.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.079
So we get up tall, we're going to let it drop
back, and then squeeze forward all through

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.400
the glutes.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.550
Let it drop back and squeeze forward all through
the glutes.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.639
You've got to hold it.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.700
Yeah, this is a great activator, right.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.200
For the guys that have glute amnesia.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.749
Which we talk about all the time.

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.780
Underactive glutes lead to a whole mess of
body mechanical issues.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.689
Between how the hips function, from our feet
up through our hips to our arms.

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.400
So if you have bad mechanics right here in
the center guys, you're going to have bad

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400
mechanics overall.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.730
And it's going to impact you in ways that
could lead you to get injured through any

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.120
of your exercises, upper or lower body.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.700
So again, let it drop down and then pull through,
again contracting with the glutes.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.660
If you're looking at it from the side you'll
see again that I'm dropping down.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.919
Just letting the band take me down and then
as I come up, I'm driving straight through

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.669
the glutes against the resistance of this
band.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.699
You want to make it a little bit more applicable
to what you're doing?

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.319
Take a pair of mock dumbbells just to feel
it.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.729
Put the dumbbells up here, put a bar up here,
an empty bar, feel what it's like to go down

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.490
into the squat the right way.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.009
Come up and out of it squeezing through the
glutes.

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.270
Take your dumbbells, RDL.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.770
Let them come straight down to the mat in
front of you, ok.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.440
Squeeze through and drive the hips through.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.750
So barbell row, again come down in here feel
it like that, ok what the feeling is like.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.159
And of course just the exercise itself will
drive you back through and use your glutes.

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:14.659
Finally guys what I wanted to show, is when
you translate this to an exercise like a step

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:15.659
up.

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:21.039
If I come up here and I put my foot up on
my surface to do my bench step up or whatever

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.039
I'm doing.

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.199
What is the move?

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.770
The move is, up and then drive through the
hip.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.379
Everything we do guys, functionally in the
weight room, once you're on your feet, athletically,

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.020
right the athletic position, we call it the
breakdown position.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.500
is here, right, hips back.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.150
You don't see a guy in an athletic position
like this.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.259
Because what will happen is, their center
of gravity is all forward and as soon as someone

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.020
hits them here, they're falling over.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.970
But if my center of gravity is back and my
hands are out, that's a good athletic position.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.120
But if you don't train that way, you're never
going to ingrain it.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.629
And that's the important thing here guys,
ingrain this movement.

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:07.569
Use this to wake your ass up like I say, wake
your glutes up as an activator with one band.

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.449
Or if you want to incorporate as a strength
training exercise, then start doing it with

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.449
two.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.080
Guys we train athletes here but they all don't
have to be professional athletes, ok.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.240
A lot of you guys are out there watching just
compete in everyday life, right.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.689
Wanting to get better at what you do, wanting
to feel better you know, than how you feel

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.189
today.

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:28.189
That's what it's all about here.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.979
And I think at the core of it all, it's learning
the principles of training like an athlete

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.379
that you've got to apply to your everyday
life.

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.259
And it has a long term effect on how much
better you'll feel and how much stronger you'll

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:40.259
be.

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.900
That's what we do at ATHLEANX.COM and that's
what we do in our 90 day training program.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.050
So if you haven't already gotten it guys,
then head over there, right now and grab it.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.139
I'll see you guys back here in just a few
days.

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.069
In the meantime let me know if you find this
helpful.

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:54.069
.
Try it out and you'll tell, your going to

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:57.060
see right away what if feels like to actually
get those glutes going.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.009
Alright guys be back here in just a few days.)
