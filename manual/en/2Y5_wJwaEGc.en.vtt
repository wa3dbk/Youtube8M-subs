00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:01.920
We want to go Mars.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.480
For the spirit of exploration, to create a
backup location for humanity, possibly to

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.310
search for additional resources.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.280
... or maybe, just because it's hard.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.990
Elon Musk stated that the goal of SpaceX is
to help humans get to Mars.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.510
They're designing rockets, landers and equipment
to support that.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.949
Musk would like to build a Mars colony with
80,000 people.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.120
Which is a good choice, as its probably the
second most habitable place in our Solar System.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.329
Real estate should be pretty cheap, but the
commute is a bit much.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.559
Mars is beautiful.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.220
It looks like a nice desert planet with winds,
clouds, and ancient river beds.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.320
It's great.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.710
If you're not made of meat and don't need
to breathe oxygen.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.780
Otherwise, it's incredibly hostile.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.579
It's not much more habitable than the cold
vacuum of space.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.429
First, there's no air on Mars.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.210
If you were dropped on the surface of Mars,
the view would be spectacular.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.280
Then you'd quickly pass out, and expire a
couple minutes later from a lack of oxygen.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.799
There's almost no air pressure, and temperatures
are incredibly cold.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.680
Did I mention the constant radiation streaming
from space?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.149
You also might want to note that the soil
is toxic.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.350
There's a long list of these types of problems.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.740
The days are a little longer; you'll be sleepy.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.881
If we intend to live on Mars, and stay there
permanently, we'll be leaning hard on our

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:39.480
technology to keep us alive, nevermind comfortable.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.039
In order to survive the lack of air pressure
and the cold, humans will need pressurized

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.119
and heated habitats.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.369
Fortunately there's a little local support
as Mars does provide us some raw materials.

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.329
The regolith, the material which covers the
surface, could be used to make concrete, and

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.490
there are cave systems which could be converted
into underground habitats to protect citizens

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.590
from the radiation.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.950
Martians, the terrestrial kind, will need
a spacesuit whenever they go outside, and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.500
every hour they spend adds to their radiation
exposure and grants all the complications

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.390
that exposure brings.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.750
For the long term, we'll need to figure out
how to extract water from underground supplies,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.890
and use that to generate breathable air and
rocket fuel.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.690
Once we've reduced the risk of suffocation
or dying of dehydration, we'll need to consider

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.420
food sources, as we'll be outside the delivery
area of everyone except Planet Express.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.160
Care packages could be shipped up from Earth,
but that's going to come with a hefty price

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
tag.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.730
We'll need to produce our own food.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.890
Interestingly, although toxic, Martian soil
can be used to grow plants once you supplement

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.110
it and remove some of the harsher chemicals.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.050
NASA's extensive experience in hydroponics
will help.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.750
One of the biggest problems will be access
to spare parts and medical supplies.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.922
You can't just go down to the store when you're
on Mars if your kidney gives out or if your

00:03:12.922 --> 00:03:14.760
sonic screwdriver breaks.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.590
There will need to be a constant stream of
supplies coming from Earth until the Martian

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.620
economy is built up enough to support itself.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.820
One more big unknown is what the low gravity
will do to the human body over months and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.820
years.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.510
Will it shorten our lifespan or lengthen it?

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.230
We just don't know.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.980
To thrive on Mars, the brave adventurers may
want to change themselves, or possibly their

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.980
offspring.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.010
This could lead to genetic engineering to
help future generations adapt to the low gravity,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.120
higher radiation and lower air pressure.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.870
Why stop at humans.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.350
We'll adapt our plants and animals to live
there as well.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.620
Finally, to take things to the next level,
We can make a few planetary renovations.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.550
We'll change Mars itself through the process
of terraforming.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.940
We'll need to release mountains of greenhouse
gasses to warm the planet, unleashing the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.980
frozen water reserves.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.870
Perhaps we'll crash a few hundred comets into
the planet to deliver water and other chemicals.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.290
It might take thousands, or even millions
of years, but it could be possible to restore

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.800
Mars to a place we could live on even without
a spacesuit.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.670
What do you think?

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.590
Would you be part of the Mars terraforming
expedition?
