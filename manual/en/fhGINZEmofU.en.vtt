00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.230
So I'm not exactly sure what color she's going
to be in this specific makeup line. So I'm

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.160
going color match her foundation, which is
something that you should also do to either

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.630
your clients or yourself. You should make
sure that you either have a professional color

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.340
matcher or you color match yourself to see
what foundation really suits your skin. You

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.210
can't tell on the back of your hands and you
can't tell from the bottle. And I know that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.050
from tremendous amount of experience. So,
what you want to do is I'm going to use a

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.469
little bit of water and I'm going to wet down
my powder and I'm going to do a swatch of

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:46.700
each color on the side of her cheek. So I
pick three colors that are in her range and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.149
I'm going to do a swatch of color on each,
on the side of her cheek of each color, just

00:00:52.149 --> 00:01:00.659
to see which one blends in. 'Cause once this
dry, they're going to turn and you can't really

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.560
tell what the exact color is, like I said,
from the bottle or from the back of your hand.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:18.910
"Okay, turn your cheek this way". So these
are the three color swatches and I'm going

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.700
to wait a few seconds for these to dry and
see which color actually blends in with her

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.360
skin the best. And obviously now, we can see
that this one is a little too dark, the middle

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.850
one and you definitely don't want to go darker.
You want to match your skin tone almost exactly

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.100
and you don't want to go darker. I mean, if
you want your skin to look a little more,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.700
a little darker tan, you use a bronzer. You
don't get a darker foundation. That's a big

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.830
no-no. So, we're definitely going to swipe
this middle one away because that is way too

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.530
dark. And we're going to see how the other
two are turning out. This one's running a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.030
little pink and her skin tone is a little
more yellow. So this one is looking like it's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.150
matching better. I'm just going to blend it
in a little bit and we're going to wait for

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.170
it to dry and as you can see, this one is
really blending in nice. It's looking like

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.099
it's matching almost exact to her skin color,
whereas this one is turning kind of purple

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.019
or pink. And that's a big thing. I mean you
really have to look at your skin tone and

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.689
most people don't even realize that they have
a pink undertone or yellow undertone. She's

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.730
very yellow. So this one, look, it dried and
it blend in completely. So we found her exact

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.500
color and this is the color that I'm going
to use as her concealer and as her foundation.
