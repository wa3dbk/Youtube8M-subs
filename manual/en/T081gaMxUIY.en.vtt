00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.800
Hi, I'm Dr Josh Axe and welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.580
Today we're going to be making cashew chicken
lettuce wraps.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
It's one of my favorite Asian dishes and I
think you're going to love it as well.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.800
The first thing I'm going to start off with
is cutting up some ginger.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.650
So if you just kind of want to watch me here.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.780
What you're going to do is you're going to
take ginger root and just simply break off

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.640
a piece about this size and then you're going
to actually peel it and grate it down.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.010
So I'm going to start here by taking off some
of these edges right along here, making it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.810
easier to peel with a knife, simply like that,
and then what I'm going to do is start peeling

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.010
the ginger.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.410
Ginger has a lot of amazing health benefits.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.610
The ginger root is great for anti-inflammation,
actually.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.500
It's something where if you have any sort
of joint pain or any sort of health condition,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.280
ginger will help reduce inflammation in your
body.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.471
I actually have a lot of my patients take
it.

00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:19.150
I eat it on a regular basis, specifically
after I go on long runs or more strenuous

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.150
workouts.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.120
I always take some ginger to help reduce inflammation
there in my joints and body.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.470
All right, the next thing we're going to do
is we're going to grate the ginger so you'll

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.710
get a grater here.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.170
Take the ginger and just start simply bringing
it back and forth.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.640
Now that we've got the ginger minced, we're
going to actually use some garlic.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.770
We're going to take the garlic, chop it up,
mince it up.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.160
Garlic has some amazing heal benefits, actually.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.930
Garlic contains allicin.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.700
It's a natural anti-viral anti-parasite.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.400
It also helps kill off fungus in your body,
and so again, a lot of health benefits here.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.950
And you're going to chop up a couple green
onions.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.200
And next thing we're going to do is open up
the water chestnuts here.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.800
All right, and now it's time to prepare the
sauce and this is one of the easiest sauces

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.250
you'll ever have to make.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.330
What we do is we're going to start off with
some honey.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.500
We try and use raw natural honey so we've
got that in the bowl, and we have two tablespoons'

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.500
worth.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.090
The next thing we're adding is two tablespoons
of either Tamari or Bragg's Liquid Aminos.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.620
So Tamari or Bragg's Liquid Aminos.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.620
We've got Bragg's here.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.550
I'm just going to take a couple of tablespoons.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.170
There's one, there's two, and then what you're
going to do is just take a tablespoon or any

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.500
sort of utensil and just start stirring the
honey and the Tamari or the Bragg's Liquid

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.480
Aminos together.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.550
And bam, you've got your super Asian sauce.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.620
All right, the last piece of preparation is
toasting up some cashews.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.050
Cashews have some amazing health benefits.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.790
They're actually very high in minerals, very
high in protein content, and also good quality

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.790
fat.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.220
You're going to take just about a cup full
of cashews.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.060
You're going to place them in some sort of
baking dish and put them in the oven at 300

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.720
degrees for about 3-5 minutes.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.650
All right, this dish you can cook up in some
grape seed oil or coconut oil, and we've chosen

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.650
grape seed oil.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.810
And the reason why we pick grape seed oil
or coconut oil is they have a higher heat

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.510
threshold and so they're not going to oxidize
like other oils, like olive oil or canola

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.510
oil.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.330
Now that the grape seed oil is good and warm,
we're going to add in the chicken.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.100
We've taken actually three chicken breasts,
chopped them up into smaller pieces and we're

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:02.360
just going to go ahead and toss those in the
oil here and get them cooking.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.290
Then we're going to go ahead and season the
chicken.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:13.790
So what I have here is some sea salt and we're
going to take that sea salt and just sprinkle

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.790
it on there.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.459
The next thing we have is some black pepper
and we're going to take that.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:31.150
All right, now that the chicken is a nice
golden brown we're going to add in the ginger,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.170
the green onion and the garlic.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.210
So you're just going to take all this here
together and then what you can do is actually

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:49.130
take a spatula and just lightly kind of mix
it up there.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.949
After about a minute you're going to add in
the water chestnuts and then following that

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.010
you're going to add in the sauce.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.040
So scoop the water chestnuts in there and
then we're going to take this sauce, the honey

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.500
tamari sauce, and just kind of pour that over
the dish like so.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.970
So now that our dish is complete it's time
to serve.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.240
And so what you're going to do is simply take
a spatula or some sort of scoop, you're going

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.600
to take your cashew chicken and you're now
going to place it in the wrap.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.680
Okay?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.300
Once it's in there like that, you're going
to simply take some cashews, sprinkle those

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.449
on top and voila, cashew chicken lettuce wraps
ready to go.
