Woo, Woo, oh hi, today we're going to tell
you, woo, how to fix an upside down compute

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.090
screen. Why do you keep asking me questions,
I don't know these answers. How to fix an

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.039
upside down computer screen, well it's quite
a complicated procedure that is going to require

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.589
a complete hardware realigniation and correct
pin out capology. Now look, it's not quite

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:33.570
that easy but it's not quite that complicated
either. Well if it's upside down of course

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.360
the easiest way would be just to turn it right
side up but with todays monitors, especially

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.820
flat paneled monitors they have the ability
to rotate that screen and this is very helpful

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.360
in case you would like to turn your monitor
and see something long ways. You are able

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.900
to rotate the image up to 360 degrees. However
if you should come in and find that your image

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.720
is upside down, typically it is a very easy
process of going to your control panels or

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.430
your system preferences, selecting the display
and look for the selection that says rotate.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:18.110
Here you'll see that you can actually rotate
your screen 90, 180, or 270 degrees. It should

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.650
be a simple matter of actually just selecting
the rotation that you want, notice now that

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.890
I have rotated the image 90 degrees and I
can turn my flat panel monitor 90 degrees

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:38.490
and see my documents lengthwise. On older
CRT monitors it is very rare but still occasionally

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.580
you'll find one that has an upside down image.
Typically a pin in the cable has become dislodged

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.140
or broken off and this might be the very pin
that sends information to orient the screen.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.200
Typically the way to fix this is to simply
buy a new cable. On the worst of occasions

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.280
you might need a new graphics card. However,
over the past few years this has become almost

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.310
completely nonexistent as a problem in the
computer world. So if you come in some day

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.120
and you've got an upside down screen and it's
not you or the monitor that is upside down,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.599
hey look in the control panels or the system
preferences and very likely you are going

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.690
to find one small adjustment that is going
to allow you with one click to put the image

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.660
right side up again. But hey, don't take my
word for it, read the flippin' manual.
