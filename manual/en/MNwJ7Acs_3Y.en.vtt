00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.360
Slippery winter roads or hills
can pose a difficult challenge-

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.760
-for trucks with heavy trailers.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.320
Even for the most skilled drivers
there's a risk

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.640
the trailer becomes unbalanced
and spins forward.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.760
The so called jackknifing phenomenon,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.320
for which Volvo Trucks
now has a solution,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.160
can involve great risk
not only for the truck's driver-

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.640
-but also for oncoming traffic.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.200
Johan Sundberg
at Sundberg's Haulage Company

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.160
drives heavily loaded rigs
on narrow forest roads.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.080
He has experienced
the problem firsthand.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.960
It happens on and off.
It's a very scary feeling.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.520
It feels like being on a roller
coaster. You have no control.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.920
Jackknifing is
a very dangerous situation.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.080
There can be many consequences,
such as losing control of the vehicle

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.000
or going down the wrong
side of the road, personal injuries,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.040
damaged vehicles
or even fatal accidents.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.880
The problem is that the situation
is so difficult to control.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.680
Jackknife is a phenomenon that occurs
between truck and trailer.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.760
It's a nasty phenomenon
where the trailer,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.920
when braking, pushes ahead
and comes up alongside the truck.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.400
To prevent the risk of jackknifing

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.920
Volvo Trucks has developed a new type
of brake system: the stretch brake.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.720
Stretch brake is a system
that automatically brakes the trailer

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.160
when the driver has activated it.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.200
The system works so that
when the driver throttles down

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.200
it automatically
pulse brakes the trailer,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.280
which keeps truck and trailer
straight and you avoid jackknifing.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.800
Stretch brake
is something that will give

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.120
the driver
a feeling of more security.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.880
That he knows what he's doing and can
control the vehicle in a good way.
