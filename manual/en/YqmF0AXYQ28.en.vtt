Hey, Stephanie with americanmuscle.com, and
this is my quick breakdown of the Whiteline

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.140
transmission mount bushing insert available
for the MT-82 6-speed transmission that is

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.880
found on all 2011 to '14 Mustang GTs.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.070
Whiteline is a performance suspension company
whose number one goal is to activate more

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.820
grip in your ride, thanks to products like
sway bars, Watts link kits, and other suspension

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.820
components.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.190
They also specialize in designing and producing
cutting edge bushing technology, thanks to

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.830
synthetic elastomer material.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.789
We've used a few of Whiteline's products in
the past.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.020
In fact, if you'd like to see more detailed
product breakdowns along with project cars,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.010
well, then you guys should know what to do
by now.

YouTube channel, if you haven't done so already.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.880
Now, if you have a manual Coyote, then chances
are you've already run into some of the common

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.470
issues, such as high RPM lockout or lockout
during aggressive cornering.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.469
This is due to the stock transmission mount
and soft rubber bushing, allowing for excess

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.000
transmission movement when the car is being
pushed hard or when you're really trying to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.070
bang gears.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.350
This bushing insert from Whiteline eliminates
the excessive play by filling small voids,

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.750
strengthening the mounting location, and eliminating
the high RPM issues altogether.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.710
The bushing insert itself is made from Whiteline's
signature synthetic elastomer which usually

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.310
does a great job of reducing noise, vibration,
and harshness.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.400
I say usually, because in the case of this
bushing insert, you may notice a little bit

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.830
more noise inside the cabin.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.560
In fact, now is a great time to head back
to the product page if you aren't there already

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.939
to see what some of the customers have to
say about running this bushing insert in their

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:31.939
own ride.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.790
As far as installation goes, the site calls
for two hours on this one, but a number of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.290
our customers have stated that it only takes
an hour or less.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.660
This is an installation that takes place under
the car, so make sure you have your jack and

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.580
jack stands ready, or a lift if you're lucky
enough to have access to one.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.630
Of course, detailed install instructions are
available on the product page, and you can

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.750
always feel free to reach out to a Mustang
expert should you have any questions.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.110
If you're looking to improve the shifting
situation in your MT-82 equipped GT then be

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.109
sure to check out the Whiteline bushing insert
available here at americanmuscle.com.
