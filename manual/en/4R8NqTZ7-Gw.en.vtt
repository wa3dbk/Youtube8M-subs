can see it's very busy ..not ..and I wish

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.760
you guys could come in moments of the season

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.600
where it's so quiet because yes

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.650
then you can really make the most of it

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.670
you can you know.. just think about your turns

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.280
without worrying about anybody crashing into you..

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.400
or things like that but if you can't..

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.800
anyway here in Cervinia the slopes

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.090
are very wide so you know even the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.350
in the busy periods there are so many lifts

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.000
that you can then you can avoid queues

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.720
and.. ( see vdeo part.2 )
