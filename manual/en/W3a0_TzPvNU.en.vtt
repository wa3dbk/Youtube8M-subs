00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.389
intensive study of it for for one more
sinister

uh... cell you told me that you learned

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.170
arabic had to do with that talking to

my own two books are and i found a book

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.130

neatly silks and things like that but as
i was telling

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.349
and uh... one problem with it was that
the dialect that i was learning is

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:03.170
called modern standard arabic

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.820

that but it's basically our cleveland of

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.640

if you want to meet some of the region
the students from lebanon and jordan

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.900
were much more sort of modernism

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.409
listen to consider

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.279

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.419
designated that area people want to get
away from the group for a little bit

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.009
