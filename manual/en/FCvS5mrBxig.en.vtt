00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.520
All right, so there was this group back in
the '90s called Wu-Tang Clan.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.660
For some reason, now they have a dance, Wu-Tang
Clan, and everybody wants to do it.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.160
We're going to show you how to do it.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.230
This is what it looks like.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.029
I'm going to do it first and then we're going
to break it down and show you what it looks

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.050
like.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.110
It looks like this.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.190
Now, if you notice, I made a 'W' in there.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.559
Basically, that's what's happening.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.499
You're going to do a right, left, and make
a 'W'.

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:46.499
You got it?

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.390
Because a 'W', for Wu-Tang, got it?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.210
So now, the whole time it's happening, you're
going to make sure that your pelvis is going

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.210
down.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.370
See, your body's going to go down into it,
down into it, 'W'.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.370
Got it?

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.060
You can do right, left, boom, pull it down,
and left, right, boom, pull it down.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.990
As long as you get that 'W' in there, you
can even do so many of these, but you have

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.870
to get that 'W' in there, or else it's not
a Wu-Tang.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.870
You understand?

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.619
All right, we're going to do it nice and slow
one more time.

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.600
You're going to go just the hands this time.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.170
You're going right, and bring it across.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.189
See how I bring it across my body?

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.579
And then I go left.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.610
Then I go Wu-Tang.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.090
Yeah, again, you can have fists.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.540
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.480
Then I'm going to do the left side.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.280
I go left, right, X, boom, and that made a
'W'.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.140
There's your Wu-Tang right there.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.479
We're going to do it again for you, a little
bit faster, and then you guys can try it when

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.810
we put on the music.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.090
So the whole time you guys are going to remember
to make sure you have this bounce happening.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.030
All right.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.679
Everything in hip hop has to do with bounce
in the knees.

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.110
The knees are very important in hip hop.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.500
In this you're going to make sure that you're
bouncing using the knees, and you're going

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.050
to make sure that you have this 'W' happen.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.260
We're going to go right, left, 'W', left side.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.340
Boom, boom, boom, ha.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.890
There's your Wu-Tang.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.041
Are you ready to try it?

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:26.041
Hey, that's Wu-Tang.

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:27.041
You ready?

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:33.870
Let's do it again.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.870
Like this.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.250
Come on.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.430
Hey, there's your Wu-Tang.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.810
You got it?

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.190
Let's try it.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.770
Come on.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.150
Everybody, let's go.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.940
Wu-Tang.
