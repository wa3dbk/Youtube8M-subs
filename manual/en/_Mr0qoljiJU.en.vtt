00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.885
If I get lost in the woods, how do I get home?

00:00:00.885 --> 00:00:04.504
My brain knows…

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:13.545
I hope… *gulp*

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:18.405
Sometimes I read science and I'm just floored
by how much we DON'T know about the world

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:19.405
we're living in.

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:24.574
For example, how does your brain, a lump of
tissue stuck in your head, know where it is,

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:27.625
where it's going and where it's been in three
dimensional space?

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.675
It's not like it has GPS, right?

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.255
… Well… maybe it does.

00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:32.255
Sorta?

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:33.255
Kinda?

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.804
This week, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was
handed out to Prof John O'Keefe and Edvard

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:41.725
and May-Britt Moser for their studies of the
brain's internal navigation systems.

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:47.335
In the 1970s, O'Keefe discovered neurons that
he called, "place cells," that fire only when

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:50.295
an animal is in a particular spot.

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:55.285
The news didn't take off in the media, but
other researchers continued plugging away.

00:00:55.285 --> 00:01:01.014
Then in 2005, the Moser's, working with O'Keefe
in London, found a set of cells in the brains

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:03.645
of rats which helped them navigate.

00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:08.205
They called them "grid cells," and according
to write-ups in Scientific American and Nature,

00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:12.155
they're like a map, or a navigational chart.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:16.875
The cells help us place ourselves and know
where we are.

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:21.675
Their research showed animals were creating
a quote, "representation of the external world

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:27.145
inside their brains," said Dr Colin Lever,
from the University of Durham one of their

00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:28.145
colleagues.

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:32.635
The grid cells reside in part of the hippocampus
called the entorhinal cortex.

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:37.285
By attaching extra sensitive sensors that
can detect the firing of INDIVIDUAL neurons,

00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:44.105
the researchers found the neurons fired and
created a near PERFECT hexagonal grid of locations

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:47.165
in the rat's brain to map the space it explored.

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:50.445
This is pretty incredible stuff to say the
least.

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:51.455
Why a hexagon?

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:52.735
GLAD YOU ASKED!

00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:56.425
Hexagons, like in a honeycomb, are the most
efficient shapes possible.

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:59.405
You get the most map with the least effort.

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:02.225
The simplicity is just… it's… wow.

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:06.205
Nature created the most efficient way to map
a space!

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:13.425
They did the experiments again and again,
and kept getting the same information.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:19.236
This was a secret language that existed deep
in a rat’s brain all this time, and when

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:24.125
they attached electrodes to the cells in the
brain of a rat, they revealed the grid in

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:25.125
real life.

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:29.415
They won the Nobel Prize almost ten years
later because the 2005 discovery alone wasn't

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:30.415
enough.

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:33.925
They kept producing more and more research
on how these grid cells worked, and how it

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:38.775
tied into growth and development, memory,
disease and so on and so on.

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:44.465
For example, the Mosers hypothesize the grid
cells form within a few weeks of birth, and

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:46.935
then develop as we learn to explore our world.

00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:50.775
They also guess, because the entorhinal cortex
is one of the first parts of the brain to

00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:55.085
succumb to Alzheimer's, that these cells might
be why sufferers can't recall where they've

00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:56.875
been or where they ARE!

00:02:56.875 --> 00:03:01.845
Knowing how we map things can help us develop
a better understanding of human development.

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:06.235
These Nobel winners have no desire to slow
down; they want to map how the grid cells

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:10.384
integrate into the brain, develop and grow
and how the grid will change if instead of

00:03:10.384 --> 00:03:13.975
a flat cage the rat is reared in a sphere.

00:03:13.975 --> 00:03:15.345
Which was where my thoughts went...

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:17.775
I want to know about three dimensions!

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:20.725
In space, you can't just make a grid.

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:22.305
There's no flat world to map.

00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:25.725
Is this why Kahn lost in the original Wrath
of Kahn?!

00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:28.065
A two dimensional mind in a three dimensional
world?

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:31.505
If we were born in space, would we develop
a three dimensional grid?

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:32.524
I dunno.

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:34.635
But holy crap my brain hurts even thinking
about it.

00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:42.015
So it's not GPS, but it does help you map
your apartment or where the milk is in a store!

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:43.015
That's useful!

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:45.475
Do you have a good sense of direction?

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:54.815
Can you wander your house in the dark?
