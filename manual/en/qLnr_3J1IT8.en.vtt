00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:23.027
A gene can simply be defined as a stretch of DNA that is transcribed into RNA, 

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:27.857
and most RNA is then translated into protein. 

00:00:27.857 --> 00:00:35.631
Each protein is a unique contiguous chain of amino acids evolved to perform some task in the cell. 

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:38.366
Some proteins act as structural support. 

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.708
Some proteins copy the DNA. 

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:43.375
Some proteins help metabolize sugars. 

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:49.165
And some proteins are motors that move cargo around inside of the cell. 

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:54.306
But where did this diverse array of proteins, and in turn genes, come from? 

00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:58.225
The human genome contains some 25,000 genes,

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:03.071
but bacteria only contain between 1000 and 6000 genes. 

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:08.746
If the theory of evolution is correct, if humans share a common ancestor with bacteria,

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:15.272
then over the past 2 billion years we must have gained at least some 20,000 genes.  

00:01:15.272 --> 00:01:20.722
Of course if you do the math that's only 1 new gene every 100,000 years.  

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:25.618
That would be only 1 new gene since modern humans first evolved,

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.743
and we already know of many novel genes that have evolved 

00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:32.793
since humans and chimps diverges roughly 6 million years ago. 

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:37.817
But where did these genes come from? What is the origin of genes?

00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:42.434
Now you may have heard the argument that genes cannot form by chance.  

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:46.780
Take for example a protein that is 200 amino acids long.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.772
Since there are 20 different amino acids, 

00:01:49.772 --> 00:01:55.449
the chance of such a protein forming by chance is 20 to the 200th power, 

00:01:55.449 --> 00:02:00.328
or roughly 1 in 1 followed by 260 zeros.

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:04.606
say that such an occurrence is unlikely is unlikely is putting it mildly.  

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:10.476
It is more likely for two people to randomly pick the same subatomic particle 

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:15.469
in the entire visible universe, than have such a protein form by chance.  

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:21.389
So how do genes form?  Well not by chance, that's for sure.  

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:27.002
In two previous videos, The Origin of Life - Abiogenesis, and the Origin of the Genetic Code, 

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:31.815
I covered how the first genes, the ancestral genes, originally formed. 

00:02:31.815 --> 00:02:36.629
But this doesn't explain were the 20,000 some genes required to make a human 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.743
from a bacterium came from.  

00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:45.216
How does nature, through blind unintelligent processes, form something so improbable?  

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:48.956
Well the first answer is actually quite easy. 

00:02:48.956 --> 00:02:53.330
Occasionally, small stretches of an organism's genome are copied,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.583
and any genes contained within are duplicated.  

00:02:56.583 --> 00:03:01.983
Most often mutations occur causing one copy of the gene to become nonfunctional. 

00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:06.877
Such a mutation would be lethal to the organism if it weren't for the backup copy.

00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:09.014
But every now and then a mutation happens

00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:12.031
that changes the function of the protein the gene codes for. 

00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:16.845
Maybe the structural protein now forms branched chains instead of straight ones. 

00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:20.666
Maybe the protein now metabolizes a slightly different sugar. 

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:23.851
Maybe the motor protein moves in a different direction.  

00:03:23.851 --> 00:03:28.830
If this small change is beneficial to the organism, it will be selected for, 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.766
and overtime the new gene will spread throughout the population, increasing the count by one.

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:40.635
And we can see evidence for such gene duplications in every genome sequenced to date. 

00:03:40.635 --> 00:03:43.677
Occasionally even whole genomes are duplicated.

00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:46.068
So how else can new genes form? 

00:03:46.068 --> 00:03:48.686
Proteins themselves are modular units. 

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:52.035
While a protein itself is a single chain of amino acids, 

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:56.815
that chain may contain a number of independently functional units, called domains.

00:03:56.815 --> 00:04:01.451
And it's the combination of domains in a single protein that can lead to novel functions.

00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:06.901
Wally Gilbert first proposed more than 30 years ago the idea that new proteins 

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:12.559
may evolve through the occasional accidental reshuffling of these domains. 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.823
So while some new genes may be the result of duplication and mutation,

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:20.872
others are the result of novel protein domain arrangements.

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:25.394
But are these only ways new genes can form, from pre-existing ones? 

00:04:25.394 --> 00:04:28.404
For the longest time the answer was thought to be yes. 

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:33.689
The first genes were thought to have formed before DNA and proteins were used by organisms,

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:37.804
and from then on it was simply duplication, mutation, and rearrangement. 

00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:43.707
That is, until a study came along in 2006 by Yuuki Hayashi and colleagues. 

00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:47.332
In this remarkable study this group of scientists showed

00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:52.097
what many biologists thought was so improbable it was essentially impossible,

00:04:52.097 --> 00:04:57.205
the evolution of entirely new genes from completely random DNA sequences. 

00:04:57.205 --> 00:05:02.587
The exact thing creationists have been arguing is mathematically impossible.  

00:05:02.587 --> 00:05:08.923
In this study the researchers replaced a 139 amino acid domain of a gene 

00:05:08.923 --> 00:05:13.087
that makes up the coat of a virus with a random DNA sequence. 

00:05:13.087 --> 00:05:18.339
Without this protein domain the virus is extremely inefficient at infecting cells.

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:21.427
And if creationist math is to be believed, 

00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:28.147
the chances of these 139 amino acids randomly mutating back is so unlikely,

00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:31.334
the virus will be doomed forever. 

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:39.451
However, in only 7 generations the group saw a 240 fold increase in infectivity of the virus. 

00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:46.673
After many generations the virus had increased its infection rate by a factor of 17,000. 

00:05:46.673 --> 00:05:53.535
Where once there was just random DNA, now existed a fully functional viral coat gene,

00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:59.064
but not the original gene, an entirely new gene had evolved to fill the role.  

00:05:59.064 --> 00:06:05.147
What this group showed was that not only could entirely different proteins perform the same job,

00:06:05.147 --> 00:06:10.269
but these could evolve rapidly starting from completely random stretches of DNA.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:14.286
If a random stretch of DNA through a fortuitous mutation

00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:18.042
happens to be transcribed by RNA polymerase,

00:06:18.042 --> 00:06:22.514
the resulting protein will most likely do extremely little. 

00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:30.387
But, if the little it does do happens to help the cell, even just a bit, that new gene will be selected for, 

00:06:30.387 --> 00:06:36.160
and over many generations, through gradual mutations, that originally random stretch of DNA 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.587
will evolve into a fully functioning and completely novel gene. 

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:46.684
The creationist argument simply shows that a single specific amino acids sequence 

00:06:46.684 --> 00:06:49.774
will not spontaneously form by chance.

00:06:49.774 --> 00:06:53.953
This however does not mean new genes don't evolve.  

00:06:53.953 --> 00:06:57.580
Novel genes originate through a variety of mechanisms, 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.305
and are refined through random mutation and natural selection.

00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:07.843
All the while increasing the complexity of the organism, and adding information to the genome.  

00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:11.583
More often than not organisms don't reinvent the wheel 

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:15.616
and use preexisting genes or domains to form new genes. 

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:21.894
But every now and then, a completely new gene forms from nothing more than random DNA, 

00:07:21.894 --> 00:07:28.431
adding more raw fuel to the engine of life we call evolution.

00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:37.457
Think about it.
