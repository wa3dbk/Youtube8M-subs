Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.330
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the hinge shim on the refrigerator.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.540
It’s a pretty easy job.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.959
All we’re going to need is Philip screw
driver and a 5/16the socket and ratchet.

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.429
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.290
Now to gain access to this part, the first
thing we’ll need to do is empty all of the

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.310
items out of the shelves on the door.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:34.309
Then we will begin by removing the screw that
holds the hinge cover in place, and 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.309
then we’ll remove two bolts that secure
hinge to the cabinet.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:49.609
You can then remove the hinge and now we’re
ready to lift the door off and we’ll put

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.989
it on a suitable work surface.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.399
Simply lift straight up in door and we’ll
set it on table top.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:03.329
Now that we have the door on suitable work
surface, we’re ready to remove the doorstop

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:15.060
two 5/16 screws we need to remove.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.320
Remove the one closest to the hole in the
door riser first.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:30.030
You can slide that 
door riser out, just take note of how it’s

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:39.230
located in there, and holding the doorstop
in place, we remove the second one.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:55.240
Now we’ll separate the doorstop from the
existing shim and we’ll lay the new shim

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:07.061
right over top of that and start the screw
through the doorstop and shims just to hold

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:13.840
everything in place, and then reinstall it
on the door.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:36.400
Next we’ll reinstall the cam riser, and
we’ll want to make sure that we align that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.270
riser with the opening in the door, so that
the hinge pin will fit through it.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:53.650
And then ultimately tighten those 5/16 screws.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.490
And we are now ready to reinstall the door.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.180
And we’ll just remount the door in the same
manner that took it off.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.191
Center it over the lower hinge pin, make sure
it engages, and let the magnet hold it in

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:20.450
place until we can get the hinge on, insert
the upper hinge and then reinstall the two

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:33.180
bolts that secure that hinge to the cabinet,
and we’ll tighten those bolts down.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:45.700
Next we’ll put the hinge cover in place,
tighten that screw down, we’ll reload the

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.040
door and our repair is complete.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.880
We told you it was an easy job.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.030
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
