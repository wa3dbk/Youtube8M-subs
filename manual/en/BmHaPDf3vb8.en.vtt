00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.610
Regardless of any effort, our mind and heart
has a tendency to remember chief events that

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.000
happened in our life.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.970
And so layer by layer, we build memories of
every horrible, disgusting thing we have done

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.000
or said, almost like piles of dirt on our
conscience.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.110
It’s a sad time in our lives when we lose
innocence and the once clean, pure parts of

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.530
our lives are inhabited by destructive guilt.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.990
What chains this places on your life!

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.050
It’s truly unbelievable how much depression
and grief comes from foolish decisions.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.990
The Bible is no stranger to recording such
stories, and none is more painful than that

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.120
of David and Bathsheba as recorded in 2 Samuel.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.420
After having sex with another man’s wife
and getting her pregnant, the king of Israel

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.689
tries to cover this affair up with Bathsheba
by having her husband murdered.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.780
Wow.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.420
What a mess he has gotten himself into.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.800
And because of his choices, their child dies
and war never departs from his household.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.840
We find out later in Psalm 51 that King David
was plagued with feelings of disgust and guilt

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.960
at the sin he had committed.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.780
How do we combat these cancerous feelings
of guilt, remorse, and disgust after we have

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.560
stuffed up again?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.300
Some people try to cover the mess with alcohol,
drugs, online games or porn, but the stain remains.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.400
Now David was cut to the heart concerning
this, and in his tearful cry, he asked God

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.270
to wash him so that he would be pure and clean.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.260
As King David knew, one could only become
clean through a 180-degree turn of repentance

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.510
to God.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.270
When you come up from the water and receive
the Holy Spirit, you are made pure in the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.780
eyes of God, and all guilt and shame doesn’t
need to trouble you any longer.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.000
Being as white as snow, you can now combat
all sin, guilt, and shame through the power

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.330
of God’s Holy Spirit, through a close prayer
and study life, and most importantly, through

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.400
keeping God’s perfect law.
