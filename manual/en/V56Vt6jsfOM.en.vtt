AMANDA CLAIRE: All right, so now what I've
done is I've cut two more pieces of wire to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.719
length, we're going to now solder same things,
strip the ends, tin the copper tips, hook

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.369
one into one terminal, one into the other,
solder them to the terminals and then from

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.699
there--well one of them is going to go to
one of those two points from the circuit board

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.730
and the other is going to go to the other
of those two points, and then we'll solder

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.990
them in there. And then when we're done with
that, we're close it up and see if that switch

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.400
does what we want it to. So, I'm just going
to kind of get started with that, go ahead

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.910
and strip the tips of my wires again here.
Again, just all you need is just a little

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.980
tiny bit of exposed metal there. There I just
have about eighth of an inch so it will be

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.800
plenty, maybe a little bit more for the side
that we're going to hook into that terminal

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.630
of the switch itself. Okay, so there's one
of our wires, let's get kind of this other

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.850
one down here, and there's one. We'll use
that side because it's a little longer for

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:07.120
the switch, and then that little one there,
good. All right, so first step, remember,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:15.140
we're going to tin little wire, so I'm going
to clean our tip here, we're going to get

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.220
the wire hot, we're just kind of put in near
the solder here, you see my solder coil coming

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.011
up here, going to get the wire hot and just
kind of let the solder--Whoops!--Just kind

00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:29.050
of let the solder flow, kind of right on to
it and there it is, that's all it takes. I

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.909
mean it happens so fast. So, now the tip of
this wire is tinned, and since we're here,

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.680
might as well to just get to the other side.
Look, there it is; it happens almost instantly.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.770
So, going to make, just like we did before,
we're going to make kind of a little hook

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.570
shape here and put the little circuit board
up, we're going to put it in one of these

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.780
two. You know, well, one thing to think about
when you're doing this kind of thing is sometimes,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.060
if you make the piece of exposed wire too
long, it might be even long enough to kind

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.340
of bridge one of the contacts of the switch
and touch the other one, in which case that

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.330
switch isn't going to do its thing, so you
really to make sure that every contact you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.050
make, every solder joint you make, really
only is bonding the wire that you're interested

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.130
in at the contact on the component you're
interested in, and really try and make sure

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:39.319
that there's no metal-to-metal contact or
solder-to-wire or solder-to-contact connection

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.319
that you didn't intend. So, okay good, so
now we got this one in place.
