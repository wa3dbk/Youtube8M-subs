What's in here?

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:17.890
Daddy: What is it Sebby? Is it Batman, Batman
LEGO. And a Batman mask.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:26.220
Batman Duplo LEGO and a Batman mask.
Lets have a look.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.390
Cut this out.
Sebby: wow.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:43.559
Daddy: OK, yeah I did a good job there!
Sebby: Mine!

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.079
Daddy: I think that is a bat boomerang or
something... or is it for the mask? I don't

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.399
know, we'll soon find out I guess.
Batman mask - are you going to put that on?

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.210
Over your head.
Are you Batman?

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.100
Sebby: Ah ha ha haaaaaa!
Daddy: You're Batman are you, you're Olaf Batman because you have your Olaf t-shirt on still.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.070
Sebby: Yeah, it funny.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.479
Daddy:Yeah
Sebby:(sshhhp noises)

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:28.790
Daddy: And we've also got Batman and the Joker in LEGO Duplo. Batman in his car.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.170
And, Look on the front.
For 2 to 5 years. Just your age isn't it.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.780
Sebby: Wow.
Daddy:And it is 40 pieces.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.729
Sebby: Mine, Batman.
Daddy: And it is model 10544 if you want to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.399
look it up. I will leave a link in the "more
about" thing below.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.399
Daddy: Shall we open the box then Sebby? Sebby:
Yeah.

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.340
Daddy: Yes, should Daddy help you.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.130
Mind your fingers. (cutting)

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.100
Like that and that.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.099
Sebby: Wow, toys!
Sebby: A car Batman.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:33.160
Daddy: A car!
Daddy: Hey you've got a bat-car.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:45.920
Daddy: Look at that you've done page 2 already!
You put 
the bat-car together, that's amazing.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.650
Daddy: Lets look at the bat car.
Sebby: Yeah.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:00.140
Daddy: That's nice isn't it. You've even got a piece for the Batman to sit on.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.739
A jet on the back and it's input to his turbo

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.659
thingy jet on the front to let the air in.
Sebby: Daddy, cape, cape cape!

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:24.100
Daddy: The cape, we've got the cape.
Daddy: We need the Batman, where is 
the Batman. I think he is in here.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.000
Lets have a look, oh it's the Batman.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
There is his cape on the back.
And there is Batman.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.500
Sebby: Mine!
Daddy: You play with him Sebby.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.800
This is his Bat-erang. In his hand.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.800
Fire extinguisher.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.260
Purple.
And that one on there.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.450
There is that, that's one bit. Page five.
Sebby: Daddy.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.819
Daddy: Where is the Joker? Oh you have the
Joker there.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:19.400
The Joker, he is pretty cool.
And his arms move, and his legs move.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.900
He is meant to have his fire extinguisher.
OK, there is the Joker and the fire extinguisher.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.830
(singing batman theme: nah nah nah na na na
nah. Brooom car comes on).  Joker: Boink, ooops, sorry!

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:45.560
Mummy: Why is the Joker in the Bat Mobile?
Daddy: Why not. You've got to share!

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.690
Bring him back and that is all that.
I think we've done everything that is in the

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.700
manual.
And of course you can change it about.

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.400
Make different things.
But we just built what is in the manual there.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.759
So we've got that (bridge), and we've got
this control station.

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:16.949
Two double blocks, flame or fire.
And we've got the Joker.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.710
Can you get that back together Sebby?
Sebby: Yeah.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.990
Daddy: You're pretty good with LEGO.
Sebby: Daddy! (help)

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:34.660
Daddy: There you go. That looks like that.
And you try to drive the car through it...

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.479
oh it fits!
I wonder if that was deliberate by the LEGO designers.

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:46.630
So that is cool.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.490
Batman!
Batman!

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.810
Do we like Batman?
Sebby: Yeah.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.740
Daddy: If you like Batman and you like this
video go and click the thumbs up button, just

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.990
to tell us.
Or even better leave a comment.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.110
Say you like Batman.
Sebby: Bye.

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:08.419
Daddy: Bye.
Daddy: Kid Toys Are Fun

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.120
Sebby: (sounds like) "kud tooys arre fuuun"
Daddy: (giggles).

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Daddy (as Joker): Ah nobody is about. (singing
Batman theme tune)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.650
Mummy: Why are you singing? It's annoying.
Daddy: It's the Batman theme tune.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:44.000
Mummy: I know.
Daddy: (continues singing)
