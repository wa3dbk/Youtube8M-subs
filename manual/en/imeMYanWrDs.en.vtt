00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.450
ok this is what most people do when they are
pruning an upright branch back

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.299
they'll go to the outside bud and prune the outside
bud because - just above the outside bud rather

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.650
because that's what seems to make sense but
this is what happens

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.679
you get that outside bud to break and it goes
up very vertical and very strongly and even

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:28.309
these lower buds will break and they will
also be very strong - and so instead of cutting

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:35.309
to the outside bud we should be pruning to
the upright bud and then coming back and taking

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900
that off as the lower bud comes out

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.080
as a weaker growth and that's the that's
the branch that we will keep

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.850
okay this is an example of what we should
do as far as pruning these vigorous branches

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.360
as we want to

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.570
select an upright bud as we see right here
and prune just immediately above it. This is kind

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.030
of counterintuitive because typically we’ll
think let’s prune to that that outside bud.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.410
Let’s not do that, let's prune to the upright
but as we did here. What happens then is that

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.340
that upright bud will break very vertical,
very strongly growing

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.660
like you see here

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.810
this is a temporary branch it will be eliminated

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.430
the important thing though is that these lateral
branches lateral bud down below will break

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.380
they'll break horizontally as you see here
we got three branches that we can keep if

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.900
we want to

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.870
this branch I said is temporary so we’ll come in
here

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.480
and now will just simply remove it just like
that and now we've got nice flat angles on

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.990
these three branches that are left.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.590
This type of pruning is called double sectoral
pruning 'cause it's basically a two-step

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.210
process you make your initial cut

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.590
to that upright bud

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.570
that branch grows up you come back later on
and you cut that off so you've got two

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.540
sets of pruning that you have to do in order
to make this a successful process.
