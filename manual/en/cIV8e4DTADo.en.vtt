00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.400
Sumatra’s tigers are facing extinction. 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.400
Only 400 remain in the wild...

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.200
...and these peat swamp forests are critical for their survival.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.600
Asia Pulp &amp; Paper (or APP) aims to be
the number one pulp and paper company in the world.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.400
Its paper ends up in everyday products
sold by the likes of Xerox, National Geographic and Walmart.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.200
A Greenpeace investigation shows...

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.000
...that APP is pulping peat swamp forests
that are home not only to Sumatra’s tigers...

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.600
...but also a protected tree species – ramin.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.600
Indonesia banned the logging and trade in ramin a decade ago. 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.400
At the same time, ramin was granted international protection...

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.200
...under the same UN Convention that controls the ivory trade.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.000
APP claims that no illegal logs are part of its wood supply.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.600
However, our year-long undercover investigation...

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800
...reveals illegal ramin logs...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.600
...are regularly mixed in with other rainforest logs
that feed APP’s global paper empire. 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.800
This APP pulp mill is already the largest in Indonesia and is expanding rapidly. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.200
Hundreds of thousands of rainforest logs
are stored at the mill waiting to be pulped. 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
Much of this wood supply comes from peat swamp forests...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600
...and illegal ramin logs are easy to find.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.400
Numerous ramin logs can be identified...

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.600
...often lying within just a few paces of each other.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.800
These logs measure up to a metre across.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.200
A distinctive blue mould sometimes grows on the wood.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600
And the bark has long brittle fibres. 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.600
Dozens of samples were collected from these logs. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.400
They were locked in tamper-proof bags with a security seal. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.000
An internationally-recognised expert confirmed that the samples were indeed ramin.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.600
APP paper ends up in everyday products sold around the world...

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.800
...from copy paper and tissue products...

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.600
...to coffee table books...

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800
...to packaging for electrical goods and food products.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.200
APP’s illegal trade is driving Sumatra’s tigers closer to extinction.
