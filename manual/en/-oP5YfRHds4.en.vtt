What'up? Welcome to the around the world tutorial! This is a basic trick, and you can learn it pretty fast.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:41.200
you may think that this trick is all about speed, and a fast leg. But that is completely false. Sure, a fast leg will help you with this trick, but the most important thing is to learn the movement and make it feel comfortable for you.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.200
lets get started

00:01:47.400 --> 00:02:08.200
i'll start of for right footed players. Start with the ball balanced on your foot. Then in the same time as you kick the ball up in the air, you make a rotation with your leg around the ball.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:23.200
the kick and the rotation should be a simultaneous movement. So do NOT kick the ball up, and then go around with your leg. This is total wrong and it will never work out for you if you do it this way

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:44.200
as you see here, i am making that mistake and it will both look ugly and be hard for me to do the trick. Another thing you shouldn't do is to have the leg to high.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.200
I will now show you around the world for left footed

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:40.200
when you feel comfortable with doing ATW from footstall, you can start doing it from juggling the ball first. If you are doing ATW from juggling, you can also give the ball a small amount of spin to give yourself some more time to execute the rotation.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:04:13.200
i strongly recommend you to learn to juggle with both frets before go ahead doing juggling ATW. This is only because of the artistic aspect - it will look so much better this way.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:27.200
do not kick the ball with just one foot! juggle the ball with left and right after each other! This will both look better and also give you even better control of the ball.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:50.200
when you are juggling the ball and are preparing for the ATW, you should do right and left juggles after each other. And if you are left footed you should kick the ball with the right foot and the directly execute the ATW with your left foot.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:05:03.200
do NOT take extra touches with your ATW foot before executing the trick!

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.200
i will now show you my way of doing the Around The World trick

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.200
i will also show you WHERE on the shoe you should hit the ball when doing the trick

00:05:44.400 --> 00:06:04.200
you should hit the ball out on the toe, and not to long into your foot. By hitting the ball at the toe you will get a better control

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:27.200
if you execute the atw with an inside movement, you should hit the ball on the inside of your foot. And if you doing the trick outside, you have to hit the ball on the outside of your foot

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:40.200
okey, this was it! If you have any questions about this trick or something else please send me and comment below.
