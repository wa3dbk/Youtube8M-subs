00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200
So, you'd like to learn how to hit a draw
shot. First of all you need to understand

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:16.209
a few basic rules. Very importantly, it's
the club face which controls the starting

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.300
direction of the shot. So, for a draw you'd
want the ball to start a little bit to the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
right side of the pin or the right side of
the fairway. At impact, the club face must

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.420
be aligned to where you want the ball to start,
a little bit to the right of your target.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.410
It's the swing path which will control the
shape of the shot. So, for a ball to move

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.820
from right to left in the air, the swing direction,
or your swing path, must be more to the right

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.020
side than the club face.
I put a few numbers in those to help you.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.800
Let's say your club face is five degrees to
the right of the target, your swing path must

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.989
be ten degrees to the right of the target.
This will produce a ball that starts to the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.480
right, and then draws back towards your target.
How you get to these numbers doesn't really

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.969
matter. Many players will achieve these in
different ways. But if I assume that you have

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:11.959
a fairly neutral swing, one that's on plane,
with a reasonably square club face, the easiest

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:15.909
way to achieve this at impact is by adjusting
your setup.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.649
How I would hit a draw is at a setup, I'd
align my club face to where I want the ball

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.420
to start, a little bit to the right side of
the pin in this case. And then I'd align my

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.119
body more to the right than the club face,
in the direction I want the swing. And then

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.450
simply, if I maintain this throughout the
swing, making my normal swing, the ball will

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.530
start to the right and draw back towards the
target.
