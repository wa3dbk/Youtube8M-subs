00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.390
Sometimes, caffeine is a
bad self-medicating drug,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.750
causing all sorts of problems.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.305
But other times, it can be
really good for your brains.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.920
Hey y'all, Trace
here for D News,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.960
helping to validate your coffee,
tea, and chocolate addictions.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.340
What do they have in common?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.260
Caffeine.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.050
Caffeine is an uber
popular stimulant

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.340
that people self-medicate
with all the time.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.324
Thanks to its
proliferation, scientists

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:28.490
have been studying this
little molecule for a while.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.060
We know it boosts people's
feelings of alertness, slows

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.600
dopamine reabsorption,
and now we've

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.370
got another bonus,
memory consolidation.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.910
Memory consolidation
is the moving

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.460
of information from the
20 to 30 second short term

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.430
memory to the long term memory.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.930
It's not the same
as memory retention,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.080
which is the ability to recall
a specific bit of information.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.580
Consolidation is usually thought
to take place during sleep.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.650
In a new study in
the journal Nature,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.600
neuroscience
explores how caffeine

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.030
could add to this process.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.070
The researchers showed
non-caffeine consumers

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.990
a set of pictures.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.790
And then afterward, gave them
either a 200 milligram caffeine

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.200
pill or a placebo.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.659
200 milligrams is about what's
in a 16-ounce cup of coffee.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.241
The reason they didn't give it
to them before the test is they

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:08.870
weren't testing
memory retention,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.029
but memory consolidation.

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:12.070
They wanted to be sure
the caffeine didn't affect

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.850
the people's test
taking ability,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.270
but instead, affected
if they forgot things.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.860
24 hours later, the
same participants

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.180
were shown another
set of pictures

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.770
and were asked to
identify which were

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.550
in the second set and the first.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.440
To stimulate a certain
brain process called

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.680
pattern separation,
a deeper process

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.930
than simple memorization,
the second set

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.380
was similar but not quite
the same as the first.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.000
The results indicated
that those who

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.200
took the caffeine pill forgot
less and were better at picking

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380
out the new photos,
showing caffeine

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.350
helped, although
they're not sure why.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.950
So back to the lab, ho!

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.200
The practical takeaway is
you can help tell your brain

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.240
to remember a specific event
or maybe a bit of information

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.171
if afterward, you just get
a little bit of caffeine.

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:53.420
It's sort of like highlighting
a piece of your memory.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.460
Maybe if you do that,
your brain will include it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.290
in tonight's consolidation.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.670
The half life of caffeine
is about six hours.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.920
So if you were to drink the
200 milligrams of caffeine

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.710
that they're recommending for
like, a 10:00 PM study group

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.860
session, there would
still be 100 milligrams

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.610
in your body at 4:00 AM.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.880
That can affect sleep quality.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.690
So maybe it's better to
try this during the day?

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.170
Just saying.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.920
I may have to do some
self-experimentation

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.090
to see how caffeine
boosts my own memory.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.360
I already know it does
wonders for my attention span.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.620
And if your attention
span is as short as mine,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.370
you'll probably dig Scott
Bromley's Internet Rabbit Hole,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.249
a brand new show launched on
our sister network, Rev3Games.

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.040
Scott will take you on
a fast-paced journey

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.360
through pop culture to prove
how everything on the Internet

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.484
is completely connected,
if you know where to look.

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.590
If Pac-Man was never
invented, Christian Bale

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.110
would have never been Batman.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.180
Check out every Tuesday.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.650

why not subscribe?

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.108
Anyway, what were
we talking about?

00:02:40.108 --> 00:02:41.020
Oh, right, memory.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.040
So how's yours?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.230
Mine is pretty bad
about a lot of things.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.720
I can't remember what I even
had for breakfast last Friday.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.220
No idea.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.380
But I remember all
sorts of stupid trivia.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.780
So tell me about it down below.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.420
And that's what
those boxes are for.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.890

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.506
