00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.100
Hi, I'm Clara from Online Fabric Store.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.000
Today I'm going to be making storage bins out of fabric and cardboard,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.800
These are great for storing stuff like toys or sewing supplies.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.380
So let's get started.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.540
The materials you'll need are:

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.160
1 yard each of two coordinating fabrics,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.280
I'm using Orange Broadcloth and Premier Prints Rosa Mandarin Dossett,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.200
a small piece of chalk cloth,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.300
cardboard,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.680
thread,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.180
pins,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.900
a sewing gauge (which is optional),

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.100
a fabric marker,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.660
a box cutter,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.440
a yardstick,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.720
a rotary cutter and mat and/or scissors,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.020
a hot glue gun,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.580
and also an iron and ironing board,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.260
This box is 12 by 12 by 6 inches high, which is the size I want my box,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.380
so I'm just going to cut the flaps off the bottom and the top of the box.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.880
I also need a 12 by 12 inch piece for the bottom of the box, so I'll measure and cut that.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.920
Next I'm going to measure and cut two pieces of fabric that will form the sides and bottom of the box.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.540
One for the inside, and one for the lining.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.180
To determine the measurements, add the bottom width and the height of the two sides.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.220
Then, if your box is rectangular, measure the bottom length plus the height of the two sides.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.960
Add 10 inches to both these measurements.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.720
So for my box, I'm cutting a 34 by 34 inch piece for both fabrics.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.280
I also need another piece of the inner fabric which will cover the bottom cardboard insert,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.760
so I'm just going to trace around the cardboard, adding about an inch and a half to each side.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.420
Next I'm going to hot glue the fabric to the bottom cardboard piece.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.760
Set this aside for now.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.280
Next I'm going to iron creases to determine where to sew the seams that will form the corners.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.920
Fold over one of the sides 10 and 3/4 inches and iron.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.760
Fold over another side and iron it, but don't iron over the first crease.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.780
I want the inner square that's being formed to measure 12 and 1/2 inches,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.580
so I'm marking that with pins, folding the fabric over to find the pins on the other side, and ironing it.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.040
Then take the two pieces of fabric apart.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.680
Take one of the pieces and fold the fabric diagonally, and match up the creases at one of the corners.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.900
Sew along the creased line from the corner of the inner square to the raw edge.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.400
Repeat this on all corners of both the inside and outside fabrics.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.260
With these seams sewn, the fabric forms a box.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.000
Trim off the excess fabric.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.600
Next I'm going to add a chalk cloth label to the box.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.640
First you have to season the fabric by rubbing it with chalk.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.260
Then wipe it off, and repeat.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.440
I'm cutting my label to be 2 by 4 inches.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.260
Place the chalk cloth on the front side of the outer fabric so it's centered between the seams,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.620
and about 1 and 1/2 inches from what will be the bottom of the box.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.040
Put a couple dabs of hot glue down to hold it in place.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.760
Next I'm going to sew around the edges of the label.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.780
You can choose a straight stitch and sew just inside the edge of the chalk cloth,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.940
or use a stitch like a zigzag and sew on either side of the edge.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.140
I'm using one like this that's a little more decorative.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.560
Next I'm going to put the cardboard into the fabric pieces.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.680
So take your outer fabric and make sure the right side is facing out.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.680
Put the side pieces of the cardboard into the outer fabric.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.320
Then nest the inner fabric inside this.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.680
Finally, put in the cardboard bottom piece.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.100
Fold the raw edges of both fabrics inward about an inch,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.900
and keep on rolling until it's folded over the edge of the box about 1 and 1/2 inches.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.320
You can make these bins in a variety of sizes to fit your needs, and they'll add style and storage to your shelving.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.880
Thanks for watching this OFS project!
