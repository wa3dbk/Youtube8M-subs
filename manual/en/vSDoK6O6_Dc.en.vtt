Hi, I'm Jamison from Telstra and today we're
taking a look at the new Windows 8 Phone from

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.320
Nokia. The Lumia 925 is a feature-packed 4G
mobile phone housed in an elegantly crafted

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.750
body. Here are some of my favourite features
of the new handset.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.670
Nokia Lumia 925 runs on Telstra's 4G network.
For camera lovers, the fantastic 8.7 megapixel

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.860
PureView camera, with a Carl Zeiss lens, captures
blur-free photos and videos, even if the camera's

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.550
shaking or in low light. There's a dedicated
hardware camera button that makes taking photos

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.460
a breeze.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.150
The features of the camera go further. Firstly
there's Nokia SmartCam, which takes a series

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.880
of images in quick succession and then chooses
the best one for you to save. It can also

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.950
create an action shot by splicing the images
together. So for example, if you took an action

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.470
shot with someone riding their bike, it would
feature them several times in different places.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.870
There is also a really cool feature that lets
you remove unwanted objects from your pictures.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.210
Or if you're taking a group shot, get everyone
at their best with the Change Faces feature,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.609
which lets you combine your favourite expression
into a perfect group photo.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:14.179
The screen itself is a high quality 4.5-inch
display, with 1280 by 768 pixel resolution.

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:18.689
The Windows Phone 8 interface looks incredibly
crisp. Small text is perfectly comfortable

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.509
to read and high resolution photos look great.
Nokia has also made the screen more sensitive,

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.219
allowing you to swipe around while wearing
gloves or in fact using any conductive metal.

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.049
The Nokia Lumia 925 looks great from all angles
and is well designed. The use of metal is

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.299
a great addition for the Lumia phones. The
phone fits nicely in your hand and it's lightweight

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.759
design makes it highly pocket-friendly.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.359
Some of my favourite features, other than
the beauty and functionality of the Live Tiles,

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.840
is the People and Me hubs. They link together
your Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.020
allowing you to see all updates in one place
and post to your own networks without having

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.649
to switch between apps.

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.389
The Windows Marketplace is growing and the
range of apps is outstanding. As well as the

00:01:57.389 --> 00:02:00.520
usual favourites like IMDb, Soundhound, and
many more.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.319
So go online or into your Telstra store and
check this phone out today. I'm Jamison from

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.640
Telstra, thank you for watching.
