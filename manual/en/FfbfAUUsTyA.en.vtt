00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.790
Can you tell me how to fix high latency on
Xbox One?

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.500
Microsoft’s first recommendation is to check
your internet connection.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.100
So they want to blame the ISPs.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.630
Or your bandwidth.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.400
After all, you’re going to have high latency
issues if someone else in the house is streaming

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.760
Netflix or downloading from GitHub, or if
the ISP is throttling your connection because

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.300
you usually do all three at once.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.410
No, just gaming while someone else checks
email, and half the time, that’s on their

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.720
wi-fi or phone.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.470
Someone else’s laptop running a WiFi hot
spot while you’re on WiFi can cause them

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.400
to interfere with each other.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.610
That’ll definitely increase the latency.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.960
Too much of a good thing, then.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.479
And you could have high latency because you
have poor wi-fi connectivity while trying

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:57.760
to play.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.330
I thought connectivity was a yes or no, not
a sliding scale.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.800
It slows down and delays functions because
it is trying to collect all the bits to put

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.549
together the new, full picture.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.310
If your connection is poor, even if it is
just you, it will slow down.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.619
I wonder how McDonald’s wi-fi does.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.939
Let’s just say it is barely enough to surf
the web while sipping coffee and they won’t

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.450
appreciate it if you suck it all up to play
games.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.060
Should I switch to a wired connection?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.689
It will reduce your latency issue if the wi-fi
is seeing interference or slowdowns.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.469
What could interfere with my WiFi if there
is no one else in the room?

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.960
Wireless security cameras, wireless home automation,
wireless phones in another room on the same

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.969
frequency band, lots of things.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.490
And I thought the possible spying from the
Kinect camera by the NSA was bad enough.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.990
One look of you gaming in your underwear,
and they’ll stop, I promise.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.850
But having a streaming chat with someone while
gaming can slow things down.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.680
I usually do not use that feature.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.149
Try not playing while the system is trying
to download updates.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.850
If you experience high latency when it first
starts up, the solution is finding something

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.320
else to do for five minutes while it updates.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.110
As long as I do not lose another ten minutes
rebooting.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.830
If you were gaming with multiple people, I’d
almost suggest asking what the other people

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.690
are experiencing.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.780
One person’s latency creates latency for
everyone else in the gaming session.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.470
Talk about not wanting to be a drag on others’
party.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.900
You could also try clearing out the system
cache to free up system resources and delete

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.910
upload clips so they do not increase latency
by uploading in the background.
