00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.970
want to bring some excitement to the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.220
table and today I am going to show you a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.560
dish which is like a sister concern of

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.529
Murtabak, what we call as Baida

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.570
roti and I am telling you it is got so

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.880
much fun there is egg in it there is keema

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.820
in it  there is in en en in this and I am telling

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
you that is what makes this perfect what

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.129
is that makes perfect en en that is what we

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.020
are going to add in this so first we're

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.200
going to learn how to make the dough for

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600
this you going to slap this dough to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.960
make a really nice stretchy so first we

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.030
are going to take around one cup of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.670
all-purpose flour in this we're going to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.670
add pinch of salt let us make sure that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.989
we just mix this salt then add half an

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.080
egg and also add some water and make

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.560
this into a soft dough and because we

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.570
added egg in this and we made this dough

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.780
soft and so this is going to stretch

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.119
like paper thin after you added the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.509
water then you can add some oil onto

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.509
this and then just knead the dough till

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.850
the gluten sets in and this stretches

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.950
really nice and good then we are going

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.350
to rest this dough for at least you know

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.110
20 minutes and then we are going to see

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.900
how we can make this baida roti now the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.790
dough is perfect I am going to put a lid

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.549
on and we're going to let it rust now I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.040
am going to show you the stuffing so

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.729
first let's switch on the stove here now

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.939
take a pan add some oil in a pan and now

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.860
you're going to cook the keema the same

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.570
way you cook for the samosa you want it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.399
a little bit dry you don't want it too

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.020
moist either because we're going to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.570
spread this on to the our baida roti

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.369
in this we're going to add some onion

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.219
let me add all the onion in here then

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:09.929
add some salt wow in this you know

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.120
you're going to add some ginger-garlic

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.319
paste

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.670
make sure that the ginger garlic paste

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.930
raw flavor is all gone then add green

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.980
chilli now add chilli powder you know

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.450
I'm adding the chilli powder on the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.790
onions because if the chilli powder gets

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.739
slightly burned here with the smoke will

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.980
make me cough like crazy some coriander

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.379
powder and a little bit of garam masala

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:40.500
okay now add the mincemeat you know you

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.879
can use any mince you want to use

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.469
chicken you want to use beef if you want

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.389
to use lamb anything but today I am

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.969
using the lamb mince and just mix with

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.909
this onion do not add any water or

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.680
anything because I want this slightly

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.829
dry and because this is a mincemeat it's

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.209
not going to take a long time to cook

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.189
it's going to take around you know seven

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.739
to ten minutes and on high flame even

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.639
less so just keep mixing till the mince

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.549
meat is nicely cooked and dry okay now

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.069
this is all good if you want to add you

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.439
can add some chopped coriander on this

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.359
because anyway we're going to add some

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.430
chopped coriander when you make this baida

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.639
roti so now this all done we're

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.370
going to switch off the flame and let's

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.879
start making our baida roti  now you

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.280
know the dough is rested for a while now

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.849
so first you know for this making this

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.370
paratha you know we were just going to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.729
add some oil and that's how we're going

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.220
to spread this if you want to do the way

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.019
the chefs do you can do the way i am

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.970
doing otherwise you can take a rolling

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.659
pin and roll it thin what we do is we just

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.680
spread this you know the dough thin after

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.709
that we do something what you know you

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.810
can do couple of methods one is you can

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.759
do it the way we make the roomali roti

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.979
or else other thing is how the Indian

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.109
woman usually wash the clothes they

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.699
takatak takatak so take this dough and swing

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:13.379
it and see swing it then this becomes

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.820
nice and thin okay very simple after

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.009
this becomes thin you know look at this

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.729
it is stretching nice okay you can you

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.260
know the dough is so thin that you can

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.600
always stretch it just

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.550
make sure the bottom part is slightly

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.030
thicker then we're going to take this

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.580
mincemeat and we're going to spread it

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.570
okay the more you want the more keema you

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.610
can eat if you are I you know I would

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.280
prefer like half kg of meat in here and on

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.510
this now is the trick you know what we

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.830
do is put in some spring onion, chopped

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.290
coriander if you want some tomatoes, some

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.770
mint already there is lot of chili

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.170
the masala inside the keema so I'm just

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.240
going to take an egg and just beat on

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.120
top of this okay if you want you can

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.680
also sprinkle  little bit of salt on

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.260
this and then all we need to do is just

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.660
fold it fold it fold it fold it ok the

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.210
make sure that the edges are not too

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.730
thick and it's raw after that you

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.640
going to transfer this onto hot tawa so

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.860
the tawa is hot here on the tawa add

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.450
little bit of oil just transfer your

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.910
paratha on to the plate and you can add

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.530
some more oil if you want bus how now

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.870
once you cook it on one side just turn

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.600
it to the other side Wow and you know

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.480
this is even in the dough there is egg

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.610
so even if slightly the dough is thicker

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.020
a one-point don't worry it's

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.820
going to taste even more better wow

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.140
and now the egg what we put in the last

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.530
it will also freeze in cook and will

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.420
become a nice thin layer of omelet and

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.700
imagine the mincemeat the omelet you

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.350
know when you eat out they're going to

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.970
use very little mincemeat but when you

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.210
make at home see how loaded this is now

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.640
you going to cook it on a medium flame

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.980
till this nice the dough on the sides

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.760
everything is nicely cooked oh then turn

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.680
it to the other side and look at this

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.370
