University of Northampton - Safety Induction
Video

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.580
Introduction:

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.060
[Beth] Living in University accommodation
is one of the highlights of coming away to

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.060
study.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.840
[Laura] You are going to meet people from
all over the world and experience lots of

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.120
new and exciting things.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.259
[Robbie] When living together though you do
need to be aware of the risks such as fire

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:24.420
safety and what you can do to prevent them.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.900
Fire Safety:

00:00:28.900 --> 00:01:07.110
[Beth] When a fire alarm sounds it is important
to get out of the building immediately.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.600
Walk calmly to your nearest exit and do not
stop to collect belongings.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.890
Do not wait for others, just make sure you
get to a designated assembly point.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.510
Wait for help to arrive.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:44.570
Fire takes hold in a matter of minutes so
it's vital you act quickly and calmly and

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.950
stay safe at Uni.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.430
Most fires start in university kitchens when
cooking is left unattended.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.640
Fireman Dave Tate demonstrates.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.800
[Fireman] The pan has actually been ignited
as if we've got some oil in the grill pan.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.220
We're getting a bit more severe as the heat
is starting to pick up plumes of smoke reaching

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.640
ceiling height now and that's going to spread
across the ceiling and the temperature will

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.910
then start to increase.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.890
This type of fire can develop in just a couple
of minutes.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.530
It's very hot in the compartment now and the
smoke level has dropped even further down.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.850
It wouldn’t be the flames that will be killing
you, it would be the smoke and the fumes.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.590
Okay, we are going to have to withdraw now,
this is getting to a dangerous level where

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:37.290
we are going to have to get a crew in to extinguish
the fire as it has developed beyond control.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.900
[Laura] In your accommodation you're not only
responsible for your own safety but also for

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.330
the safety of those around you.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.790
There are some very basic things we can do
to prevent fires in our accommodation.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.090
[Beth] Never leave tea-towels on top of hobs.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.270
Always place in a safe environment away from
the cooker.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.810
[Robbie] Toasters: vital to students all over
the country, but jamming bread in it and leaving

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.120
it can cause all kinds of problems.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.020
[Laura] One of the most common causes of fires
in your student residence is the grill pan.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.770
If you pan is really greasy this is not only
gross but can also ignite very easily if the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.000
oven is left unattended.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.790
[Beth] This next point is pretty important.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.370
Never cover up or tamper with smoke alarms
or heat detectors.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.590
They are designed to keep you and your mates
safe.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.070
[Robbie] Never, ever leave anything on the
hob unattended as this is another massive

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.069
fire hazard.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:50.220
[Laura] Fire doors, the ones with the blue
and white stickers.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.739
Everything you need to know is already written
on them.

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.069
Keep them shut.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.720
[Beth] Often in halls, people set fire alarms
off as a joke.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.310
This not only wastes everybody's time, but
it can also put people’s lives at risk.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.190
[Robbie] And finally, don’t mess around
with fire extinguishers or safety equipment.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.849
They are essential for fighting a fire in
the first instance and if they are faulty

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.979
it could put you and your mates in danger.

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.449
[Laura] So remember, never leave cooking unattended.

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.270
Fire doors must be kept shut.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.460
Never tamper with smoke detectors or firefighting
equipment and always know your evacuation

00:04:31.460 --> 00:05:24.979
routes and assembly points.

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:34.229
[Fireman] Within two minutes the whole of
this area has been ignited and the cloud of

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.539
smoke has got to the ceiling level gone across
and then come back down again.

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.490
All this lot here, as we know, can be replaced.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.580
But you can't be replaced.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.590
[Beth] Moving into halls for the first time
is a fantastic experience.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.650
[Laura] You get to make lots of new friends
and have some brilliant times.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.659
[Robbie] Just follow these simple rules to
stay safe and they'll be even better.

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.759
[Ends]
