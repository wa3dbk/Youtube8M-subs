00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:23.100
Let’s just admit it: Small screens are kind
of a pain to look at for long periods of time.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.769
Until that magical invention known as the
DSiXL, it felt like I was struggling to look

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.369
at a postage stamp animated with my favorite
portable games.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.219
And while something like that might be passable
for short periods like Tetris or whatnot,

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.210
around the mid-90’s a magic thing happened:
POKEMON.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.899
Sure, there had been other portable RPGs around,
like Legend of Mana, the early SaGa games,

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.030
and Link’s Awakening, but nothing caused
kids to sink more hours into their portable

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.769
fixations than the prospect of catching ‘em
all, and being the very best like no one ever

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.199
was.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.420
And while Red and Blue came with built-in
Super Game Boy functionality, as the series

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.730
developed, more and more extra bits got tacked
on.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.030
Time for a minor hardware upgrade!

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.079
Here it is, folks, the Super Game Boy 2.

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:20.189
It’s translucent, because Nintendo was convinced
that was a cool thing at the time.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.140
It’s functionally identical to its predecessor,
save for one important difference: See that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.850
little port on the side?

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.880
After Pokemon popularized the idea of Game
Boy connectivity past what anyone had expected,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.710
it became clear that making this new device
compatible with the various trading mechanisms

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.189
and whatnot was of crucial importance.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.469
Heck, you can hook up a printer to this thing.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.140
Who says we didn’t get interesting add-ons?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.610
Nuts to the whole Super Nintendo PlayStation
rigmarole.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.030
We’ve got the capacity for a PRINTER.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.689
So you can stick Pokedex entries to the inside
of your locker, so you have something to read

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.710
when you’re locked in there.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.090
I kid, I kid.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.090
You wouldn’t have enough light to read them,
anyway.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.420
Alas, we never did receive this device here
on Western shores.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.280
By 1998, when it was released, we were already
deep into the N64 era, and we’d see some

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.570
similar functionality when the Transfer Pak
and Pokemon Stadium allowed for playing your

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.110
Game Boy carts at double and even triple-speed,
a blessing that has to be experienced to be

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.110
believed.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.430
It’s a cute little quirk of science, and
a odd and interesting addition to your collection,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.989
especially if you like teal translucent things.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:33.989
With glowy bits.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.370
That allow you to hook printers up to things.
