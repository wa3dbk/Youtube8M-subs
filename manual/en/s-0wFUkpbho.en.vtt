00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:05.540
My internship experience has been awesome.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.500
They really teach you the in's and out's of
the business.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.870
I get to go out on the site, and it's been
really interesting.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.690
Western Construction Group.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.689
Build Your Future As A Western Intern.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.039
Western really makes sure you are going to
learn everything you are going to want to

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.479
know on all aspects of the business.

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:37.670
You come aboard, and we have a very good training
program, a very good career path process,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.789
where you start here and you want to be here,
here's the things you have to do to get there.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.660
I get to do a lot more than my friends that
are interning with a General Contractor.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.149
I'm more of a hands on person.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.679
I learn by doing.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.070
So, it's been great and it's exciting going
out there and working with the guys and seeing

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.850
the foremen, and see how what we are doing
in the office, directly affects them.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.920
I think what sets it apart is all the different
scopes of work that Western Construction Group

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.920
performs.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.430
There's all of the restoration, tuckpointing,
brick repair, waterproofing and concrete work.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.320
I don't want to be with a general contractor;
I like the specialized contracting.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.960
I get to look at a set of plans, and figure
out what exactly needs to happen and the best

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.369
way to get it done for the customer.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.070
I think the most important part is the way
you learn new stuff.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.939
I started to learn the specific work in construction.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.280
They really care that you really learn something,
and learn it in detail with an understanding

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.549
of the whole business itself and how the construction
industry works.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.840
We are actually doing repairs on this whole
plaza level.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.409
I think one of the great things about Western
is their emphasis on safety.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.299
The best practices we teach you, so you will
be successful.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.119
We know what it takes to be successful, to
be profitable.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.039
All you have to do is be willing to do it.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.929
It has like a family-feel to it.

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.980
There are seven guys that work in our office,
so we all know each other pretty well.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.000
You won't be just a number.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.860
Take in every experience, the benefits, the
people you are going to be around.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.520
If you go to a job just for money, you won't
be there long.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.690
Period, in my opinion.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.580
I think most people that have been in any
job and have moved on, will tell you that.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.730
During this process, I feel like I am more
confident with my ability to work after graduation.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.130
I've learned so much.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.310
If you want hands on and office work and different
stuff, go with Western Construction.
