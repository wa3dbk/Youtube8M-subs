On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Terry and
I'm here today to show you the workings of

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.880
a forge. When working with a forge you always
want to take precautions. Before you ignite

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.700
it, you want to make sure that you don't have
any leaks in your hoses; no cracks in your

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.039
hoses, your valves are working properly. Once
it's ignited and lit...well then you have

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.550
the heat and the burn factor. You want to
always use tongs to hold your material and

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.430
you want to use gloves. The best gloves to
use are Teflon coated gloves. What I have

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.520
here is just plain old welding gloves. They'll
work, but you really want to get some Teflon

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.680
coated gloves because you can hold onto material
a lot longer. Handling these rods will soon

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.390
get hot with welding gloves on where you can't
hold them, so you have your tongs. You really

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.620
want to have an apron, a heavy leather apron.
You know...you make one mistake, you drop,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.600
you fall, you stumble....Whenever you drop
something on you it's going to burn right

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.910
through your clothes immediately because of
embers three-thousand degrees. And so, you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.850
know, what I'm wearing here is some thick
cowhide. You can see it's gotten hot before

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.250
and all it did was curl up. So, as far as
safety you want to keep a bucket of water

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.960
around. You also, just in case there's a fire
that starts....you know...you may not notice

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.460
it right away. Even a fire extinguisher would
help. But I keep a bucket around so I can

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.490
cool a piece of metal off. If I need to throw
it down, I don't throw it on something. I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:32.071
completely stow it in the bucket. They extinguish
the heat that's on the rocks so that it doesn't

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.550
catch anything else on fire. But it's always
good to have plenty of water and maybe even

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:44.350
a water hose. But find a bucket and a fire
extinguisher is adequate for what I do here.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.071
I wear steel toed boots because I don't like
hammers and things falling on my boots. That's

00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:56.030
a good thing to do is protect your toes. You
know, there are a lot of dangers you don't

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.341
see around...as long as you?re well protected.
Safety glasses is a good idea. Usually, you

00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:09.619
don't get a lot of pop and crackle off the
metal but...You know you have this shell that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.230
pops off the metal as your working it and
you can get a piece in your eye, so a pair

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.691
of safety glasses is a good idea. Some people
even wear a shield and that's just to shield

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:23.700
your face from the heat. But if you?re working
in front of a larger forge than this and your

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.090
working around it all day, it'll be just like
a sunburn...you can blister your face. So,

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.659
I would recommend a shield, gloves, safety
shoes, and a leather apron.
