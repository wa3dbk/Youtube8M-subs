In this video I show you how to make these earrings from a metal bangle.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Going slowly, you can completely make these in about a slow 15 minutes.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You'l need one metal bangle, 20 glass seed beads and two large glass beads, two coils and 2 earring fishooks and 20 guage wire.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
These are those metal bangles that come in sets of about 6-12

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So cut one bangel into two equal halfs.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Take a small tube - something a little larger than a pencil - place it in the center of the half bangle and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
squeeze both ends together until they touch.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Because they are already curved they will look like this when squeezed together.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If one is bigger than the other trim it to size.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Like these.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Squeeze the hoops until the ends cross - When you stop place the tips of the hoops together

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Then place the tips of the hoops together

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Take your 20 guage wire and wrap twice around to start.  Thread your first bead.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Wrap the wire twice around again...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and continue that way until you have wrapped four beads. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
After the fourth bead wrap the wire once  then add threee beads one after the other. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So thats a seed bead , followed by your large bead then another seed bead 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
then contiune to wrap the wire twice around the hoop after each bead until you are finished.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Next make two 3/4" coils - and seperate them in the middle by gently pulling the middle a little bit apart.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Fold each coil over 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and place them over the ends of your earring hoops.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If the coil you've made is not a snug fit you should dab a little metal/superglue on the ends of your hoop before inserting them into the coils.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Because you seperated the coil earlier you will see a single coil in the middle through which you can thread a 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
jump ring. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Just like these.

Finish with  some fishooks and you have a pair of handmade earrings that are sturdy and quite lovely.
