00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:03.639
Imagine, 85 years old,

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.513
Putting the spoon into there,

00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:09.693
eating and chewing the Parmigiano-Reggiano crust—and they start crying

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:18.906
People, they're touched
by these kind of things

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:21.364
I remember once there was a couple

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:25.389
It was like their gold wedding,
or I think the diamond wedding

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.124
you know, they were very old

00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:31.362
and they present themselves
with a lunch at Osteria Francescana

00:00:31.382 --> 00:00:35.860
and they were eating
this compression of pasta and beans

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.512
in which I put the royale of foie gras

00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:45.718
pig’s skin and beans at the bottom

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:50.390
and so, that was like
a compression of my life

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.950
because those are the first steps
of my gastronomic life

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.191
as the French, they were teaching me

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.811
this royale, you know
how they are, the French

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:05.519
they put a little bit of foie gras
and they say “royale”

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.773
and finishing with an air of rosemary

00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:13.116
so it reminded you of Ferran Adrià,
the avant-garde Spanish...

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:16.132
because rosemary
in pasta and beans

00:01:16.132 --> 00:01:19.026
it’s kind of too aggressive

00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:21.944
So, I created this stratification

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:27.153
of all the flavors
to rebuild pasta and beans

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.306
In the middle
bit here, there was

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:32.909
instead of pasta,
I switched pasta

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.782
with parmigiano reggiano crust
boiled into the beans

00:01:35.782 --> 00:01:39.500
as my grandmother was telling me to do

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.563
And then I sliced this crust
very thin, as it was pasta

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:50.561
but in the moment I was pouring
some bean sauce on the top

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:54.818
the pasta gets chewy

00:01:54.818 --> 00:02:00.024
and it’s the most beautiful
feeling in the palate

00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:04.288
So the meaning of this plate
was compressing

00:02:04.288 --> 00:02:06.177
not just the pasta and beans

00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:08.071
the rebuilt pasta and beans

00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:12.139
but compressing between Ducasse
and my first steps in gastronomy

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.760
and Ferran Adrià, my grandmother

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.985
with the crust of parmigiano

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:20.917
These guys, they were eating this dish

00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:25.647
imagine, 85 years-old,
putting their spoon into there

00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:29.591
eating and chewing
their Parmigiano-Reggiano crust

00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:31.602
and they start crying

00:02:31.602 --> 00:02:35.073
because the feeling of chewing the crust

00:02:35.073 --> 00:02:38.137
is the feeling of

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:39.591
a kid

00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:42.985
that is chewing a crust of Parmigiano

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:46.932
because we grew up like that

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:49.602
So those are incredible emotions

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.479
To see this

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.426
Transfer of emotion with the food

00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:55.194
is the most beautiful thing ever
