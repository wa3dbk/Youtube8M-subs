00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.930
So I'm filming a project for school and we
need to make fake blood

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.850
Most of the recipes you can find online call
for corn syrup, which as you might not believe

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.199
is really, really hared to find in some places
in the world, AKA Australia.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.619
So I decided to make this video of me making
fake blood sans corn syrup.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.730
I hope you enjoy.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.960
First of all I should let you know that I'm
just making up this recipe as I go.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.349
I basically took what I learned online and
I'm applying my own rules to it.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.431
I found corn flour which I think is corn starch,
it seems to have the same texture so we're

00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:37.431
going to use that.

00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:41.260
I'm going to make my own syrup using white
sugar and water.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.080
I've got a little coffee here that we're going
to use to darken it down.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.510
And, using red and green.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.220
The reason why I chose green instead of blue
is because green is chromatically the opposite

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.900
of red, so I was hoping that instead of turning
it purple, if anything it would turn it brown

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.580
and blood does tend to have a bit of a brownness
to it.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.990
So here we go.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.670
So here we are at the stove, like I said I
have no idea what I'm doing here.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.720
So we're going to start a little heat.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.710
Basically what we're going to be doing is
mixing the sugar with water in a really high

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.180
ratio, so that we form a syrup.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.640
Instead of water I'm going to use coffee.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.851
I have know idea how much sugar to use, but
I know how much blood I want.

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:28.960
I want about a litre of blood, so we're going
to use... about half that package of sugar.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.960
Awesome.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.889
Kids, if you're doing this at home make sure
you wear an apron or you have your parents

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:33.889
to help.

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:35.100
Or just don't be an idiot.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.939
Also, the way sugar works is the longer you
cook it, the harder it gets.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.840
Although we want to get it to the point where
the sugar is just dissolved, becuase that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.060
way once we cool it, it won't turn into candy.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.670
I can tell already it's going to be hard to
judge how thick it is because it's definitely

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.270
going to thicken when it cools.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.770
So I'm just going to eyeball it and hopefully
it works.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.420
I'm going to use a spoon to test the thickness
of the blood to see what it's like.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.060
You can also add chocolate syrup to your blood
I think, I just didn't feel like buying any.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.461
But if you made it with coffee and chocolate
syrup and corn flour to thicken it, you'd

00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:23.650
end up with something that's reasonably good-tasting
without being too sweet.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.159
You'd definitely be able to put it in your
mouth or something if you want to do a scene

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:32.000
where you're getting punched in the face,
or you're vomiting zombie guts or something.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:44.829
The only reason I'm still stirring is to get
all those corn starch chunks out.

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:52.510
So, just by taking some of the syrup out and
letting it cool on the back of a spoon, I

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.420
can see that it's got a really syrupy consistency.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.830
That's perfect, I think that's excellent for
blood.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.120
Tastes pretty good.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.360
Now I'm just going to pour off my blood into
this plastic container.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.860
I'm going to leave this in the fridge probably
for I don't know - half an hour to an hour.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.290
Alright so it's been about an hour, I just
pulled the coffee syrup out of the fridge.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.280
So as you can see it's definitely thickened
up a bit.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.870
Yeah that looks pretty good, a couple chunks
in there but that will be alright.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.239
So time to add the food colouring I think.

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:38.450
"Pillar Box Red" about a splash of that.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.769
And as you notice, the red is really really
bright and that's not really how blood looks,

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.459
so we're going to use the green to darken
that down a bit.

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.959
But I want to increase the richness of the
red a bit, so I think I'm going to add another

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:53.959
splash.

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.749
Okay, now with the green, or blue or whatever
you're using, you gotta be really delicate

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:02.370
so I gotta find some way of putting this in
properly.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.379
And just throw in a few drops.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.159
So that's darkening down our blood considerably.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.560
Okay so I've got a little piece of white paper
here so we can test our blood.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.909
See how it pans out in terms of realism.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.389
I still think it's a little pink.

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.350
I might tweak it a little bit, maybe add a
touch more green but other than that I think

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.710
that looks pretty solid for blood.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.940
You can see it runs pretty nicely for blood.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.090
So it might be a little on the bright side,
but again I can just add more green to darken

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.550
that down.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.639
And that's about it, so thanks for tuning
in!

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.020
To give you the recipe again like I said I
just winged it, but I think I used about a

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.950
cup and a half of sugar, maybe three quarters
of a cup of stale coffee, a tablespoon of

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.500
corn flour, about two teaspoons of red food
colouring, and just a few drops of green.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.460
And that produced me about a pint of fake
blood.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.099
It looks pretty tasty, so hope you guys enjoy.

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.419
Good luck on your filmmaking, and have fun.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.360
*ominous music and crying*
