00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.530
The Timeless Isle is now open, another new
build on the PTR, a look at more new gear,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.840
new cosmetic items (plus a giveaway on MMO-Champion),
and more!

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.519
Hey guys, Jess here with the WoW Update!

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.460
First up, a new patch on the PTR has opened
up Proving Grounds, and here's what we know

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.640
so far:

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.110
Items are scaled to item level 463, but gems
are not scaled down.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.770
Set bonuses don't work.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.150
Flasks and food buffs are allowed, but potions
are not.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.980
You also get a full set of raid buffs.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.460
The UI elements (timers and wave counters)
and audio were not in in the videos below.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.500
The DPS video below just shows Gold for DPS,
stopping a few waves before the end.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.870
This is a somewhat older version of Gold,
the current version on the PTR is significantly

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.120
easier.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.140
Another new build on the PTR will add lots
of Siege of Orgrimmar Loot, as well as some

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.030
of the glyphs we'd previously seen that hadn't
yet been implemented, and an item called Xal'atoh,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.930
Desecrated Image of Gorehowl.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.510
Next, the TImeless Isle opened on Friday and
here's what we know about it:

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.460
You will receive an item in the mail that
will teleport you to the Isle, allowing you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.820
to learn the flightpath there.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.250
There are no flying mounts on the isle!

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.210
Next there is a one time quest that sends
you all over the Isle to explore it, before

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.290
heading back to the Celestial Court in the
center.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.500
The Celestial Court has the four Aspects world
bosses in the center, with many of the NPCs

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.100
from Mists of Pandaria around the outside.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.220
You can purchase the new aspect pets here
for 3 x Celestial Coin, which are a reward

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.409
of the tournament that requires 30 level 25
pets to enter.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.310
Most NPCs, objects, and gathering nodes scattered
around the isle drop Timeless Coins, as well

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.490
as the pet battle and lore daily quests.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.920
Timeless Coins are used to purchase Timeless
Caches for 7500 x Timeless Coin, which reward

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
item level 496 gear, similar to Battlefield:
Barrens.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.240
Moving on, we got a look at season 14 Mage
gear and Tier 16 Monk gear - as usual, these

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.770
are just previews so the final sets may change,
but you can take a look at how they look for

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.770
now.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.060
Next up, MMO-Champion has several cool things
going on lately.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.390
First of all, new cosmetic helms for transmog
are available on Blizzard store for $15 US

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.950
dollars or 12 Euros, and MMO-Champ is giving
away 10 of them.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.900
Comment on the contest post to enter, which
we'll link for you below if you're watching

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.330
this on Curse's YouTube channel, and the giveaway
ends tonight, so hurry up and get those entries

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.330
in!

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.369
The other cool thing MMO-Champion's doing
right now is recruiting mods, so if you wanna

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.970
moderate their forums, be sure to read the
entire post first (which we'll link for you)

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.400
before applying.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.150
And then finally, a few additional miscellaneous
patch notes: Death Knight and Druid teleport

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.880
spells now return the caster to where they
came from when cast again.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.260
Also alts will be able to access Ordos, the
new "hard" world boss in Patch 5.4 as long

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.000
as one character on that account has the legendary
cloak.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.330
And, patch 5.5 is looking more likely - Dave
Kosak recently tweeted that "Most of orgrimmar

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.400
permanent changes will happen in a future
patch, but before the next expansion."

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.820
Well, that's it for this week's WoW update!

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.730
As always be sure to subscribe to Curse and
MMO-Champion on YouTube, and give this video

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.100
a thumbs up for WoW!

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.700
Thanks for watching, enjoy the game.
