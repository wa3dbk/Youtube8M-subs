00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.120
We can't say hi 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.720
or look at each other

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.560
If I meet you down the street

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.480
I'll walk away

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.320
You're a solitary agent

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.400
you have no doubts

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.440
That this is a dirty work

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.080
This is reality

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.400
There's a secret between us that's too big

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.240
And we can only keep it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
We are only shadows in the sun

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.600
It's my fate and I will have to accept it

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.320
I won't look for you anymore

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.080
I'll pretend I don't know you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.800
We're just two agents inside NEXT STOP

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.440
It's a dirty work and I shall do it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.160
I won't look for you anymore

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.840
I'll pretend I don't know you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.560
We're just two agents inside NEXT STOP

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.240
It's a dirty work and I shall do it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.720
It's hard to understand 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.880
but you will in the end

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.160
You are asking me to explain

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.520
something that I can't

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.720
We're just solitary agents, you will also be

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.920
This is just our work

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.280
This is reality 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.720
There's a secret between us that's too big

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.560
And we can only keep it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.240
We are only shadows in the sun

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.880
It's my fate and I will have to accept it

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.720
I won't look for you anymore

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.400
I'll pretend I don't know you

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.120
We're just two agents inside NEXT STOP

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.840
It's a dirty work and I shall do it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.920
I won't look for you anymore, (I know you)

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.000
I'll pretend I don't know you, (I shall do it)

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.880
We're just two agents inside NEXT STOP

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.600
It's a dirty work and I shall do it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.840
It's a dirty work and I shall do it

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.120
It's a dirty work and I shall do it
