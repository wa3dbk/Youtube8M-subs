00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.710
We're standing on Harvey Cedars

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.750
on Long Beach Island, New Jersey.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.440 position:72%
The Army Corps of Engineers is helping rebuild

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.080
the beaches in this community.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.950 position:98%
There's a dredge offshore, there's equipment, we're building up

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.790
a protective dune and a berm,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.020
the flat space in front of the dune

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.270
on the beach to get this community

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.130
ready for future hurricane season

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.160
and help reduce storm damages from

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.240
future events. This project is a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260 position:83%
partnership that we have with the state of New Jersey

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.020 position:58%
and the federal government is working

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.030 position:59%
to help reduce future storm damages so

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.170 position:64%
this community and others up and down the

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.410 position:59%
New Jersey shore. On Long Beach Island

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.290 position:63%
it was really a perfect test case during

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.520 position:63%
Hurricane Sandy because we had a project

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.580 position:63%
built in certain sections of the island.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600 position:67%
And so as engineers we were able to observe

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.840 position:59%
areas that had a project right next to

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.270 position:59%
areas that didn't and we could see the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.720
difference that this makes.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.740 position:73%
The project was originally constructed in 2010,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.180
and was in place

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.370
when Sandy,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.800
Superstorm Sandy hit.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.730 position:64%
This is one of the portions of the island

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.010
that sustained very minimal damage

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 position:59%
mostly because the dunes were in place

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.140
to protect it against the storm.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.150 position:70%
The communities on either end of this project

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.190
took significant damages

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.020
and some homes were

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.260
condemned and

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.990
they didn't have the dunes

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.240
that we built here. So the dunes

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.270
really did their job and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.390 position:64%
protected this area. On Long Beach Island

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.230
a 22 foot high dune with a

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.520
200 foot berm in front of it was

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.570
the authorized plan.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.660
After the Sandy Relief Act

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.710
was signed into law

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.660
we were now, we will have

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.910
the funding and the

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.020
time to build

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.070
the project in it's entirety.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.170 position:75%
So the way beach nourishment or beach fill works

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.210
is a dredge transits offshore to

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.320
what we call a borrow area

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.750
and that's a place on the seafloor

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.070
where there's suitable sand that we

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.480
can pump onto a beach.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.160 position:66%
The dredge sucks up that sand, holds it in

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.680 position:78%
what's called a hopper, a container in the dredge,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.570
comes back toward the shore

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.400
and pumps it onto the beach through

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.650
submerged pipe and through baskets

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.690 position:61%
and then bull dozers and land equipment

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.260
maneuver the sand and push it

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.480 position:61%
into a dune and a berm that's protected

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.850
and helps reduce storm damages.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.980
Right now on Long Beach Island

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.940 position:64%
we're pumping about 3 million cubic yards

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.960
of sand onto the beaches here.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.680 position:63%
So really it's the equivalent of about a

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.750
150,000 dump trucks dumping

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.830 position:63%
sand onto this island and moving it into

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.210
a protective berm and dune system.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.860
Helping rebuild Long Beach and the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.220
beaches along Long Beach Island

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.710 position:59%
is one part of the federal response to

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.960 position:75%
Hurricane Sandy, but the Army Corps of Engineers

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.010
has a lot of other work in the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.660 position:56%
Federal Emergency Management Agency.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.300
We helped build a breach at

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.190
Mantoloking, New Jersey. We helped

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.640 position:73%
dewater facilities, but this is just one aspect

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.660 position:58%
of the federal response to the storm.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.690
We're working right now

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.740
to get this built before hurricane

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.760
season is fully upon us

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.720 position:69%
and get it completed so we can reduce future

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.620
storm damages to the communities

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.860
on Long Beach Island, New Jersey.
