00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:01.413
A lot of you have written in,

00:00:01.413 --> 00:00:04.409
on the hunt, for some
inspired lunch ideas.

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:06.964
So I thought it was time
to show you four more

00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:08.589
salads in a jar.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.329
Today, I'm going to show
you Cobb salad in a jar,

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.405
a tasty, autumn inspired salad in a jar,

00:00:14.405 --> 00:00:16.704
a wonderful taco salad in a jar,

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:19.479
and finally, a beet salad in a jar

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:21.743
that is super seasonal and delicious.

00:00:21.743 --> 00:00:22.787
Now if you've never seen the first

00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:25.306
salads in a jar video,
I highly recommend it.

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:26.966
You can find it at this thumbnail,

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.219
or, there's a link in the
description box below.

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:30.867
So be sure to check it out.

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:31.960
So for these delicious salads,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.037
I am using one liter mason jars.

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:35.406
You can really use any size jar

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:37.925
you have on hand, and I always like

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:39.621
to put my dressing at the bottom.

00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:40.480
And the reason for that is,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.780
if the dressing's at the bottom,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.522
then you can stack all of your ingredients

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:45.461
without them getting soggy.

00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:47.063
Basically, you can make
these two or three days

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:49.141
in advance, and then when
it's time to eat them,

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.044
you just give them a really good shake,

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:54.064
pour them into a bowl,
and boom, lunch is served.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:56.037
So let's start with our protein packed

00:00:56.037 --> 00:00:57.720
Cobb salad in a jar.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.005
Now we are starting with my
home made blue cheese dressing.

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.584
This couldn't be simpler to put together,

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:04.663
I highly recommend
making your own dressing

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:06.358
when you can, I've left the recipe

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:07.785
in the description box below,

00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:09.445
and on the domesticgeek.com.

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:10.571
So if you want to check it out,

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:11.826
you absolutely can.

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:14.287
You can also use the
store-bought kind, if you want.

00:01:14.287 --> 00:01:15.367
So we're starting with a good splash

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.688
of blue cheese dressing
at the bottom of our jar,

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:18.709
and to that, we are going to start

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.684
to stack our ingredients.

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:22.808
So we're going to start
with some tomatoes,

00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:25.467
and some avocado, and
then I've got some cooked,

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:27.197
chopped chicken, this is a great place

00:01:27.197 --> 00:01:29.392
to use your chicken leftovers.

00:01:29.392 --> 00:01:31.294
Then I'm going to add some boiled egg

00:01:31.294 --> 00:01:35.428
that I've just diced up, and
some cooked, chopped bacon.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.309
I'm going to top this all
off with some mixed greens,

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:39.816
and boom, you have a
tasty, delicious lunch

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:43.298
that you are absolutely going to love.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.652
Next up, we have our autumn
inspired salad in a jar.

00:01:46.652 --> 00:01:48.069
Now I love this, because it incorporates

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.263
all of the beautiful flavors of fall.

00:01:50.263 --> 00:01:51.668
So we're starting with some maple,

00:01:51.668 --> 00:01:53.076
balsamic vinaigrette.

00:01:53.076 --> 00:01:54.457
Now again, this is my home made dressing,

00:01:54.457 --> 00:01:56.884
you can find the recipe in
the description box below.

00:01:56.884 --> 00:01:59.542
To that, we are going to start
to stack our deliciousness.

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.480
We have some beautiful pear,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.060
I've got some butternut squash that I just

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.697
roasted with a little bit of olive oil,

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:06.276
salt, and pepper.

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.657
Then we are going to add some pecans,

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:10.605
and some blue cheese, but you don't have

00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:12.138
to use blue cheese in this recipe.

00:02:12.138 --> 00:02:14.240
You can absolutely use
goat cheese instead,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.158
and we're just going to fill the rest

00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:16.643
with some simple mixed greens.

00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:19.224
What could be easier than that?

00:02:19.684 --> 00:02:22.344
Next up is our tasty, taco salad in a jar.

00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:25.408
Now it all starts with my
lime-cilantro vinaigrette.

00:02:25.408 --> 00:02:27.625
To that, I'm going to
add some black beans,

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.380
a little bit of red onion,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.560
some chopped tomatoes, some bell pepper,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.324
and some avocado, some green beans,

00:02:35.324 --> 00:02:36.438
and then for some protein, I'm going

00:02:36.438 --> 00:02:38.237
to top this all off with some ground beef

00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:41.128
that I've just cooked with a
little bit of taco seasoning.

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:42.207
Now if you don't eat meat,

00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:43.380
you don't have to sweat it.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.448
You can do the very same thing

00:02:44.448 --> 00:02:45.620
with a little bit of quinoa, and add

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.605
taco seasoning to that,
it's equally delicious,

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:51.563
and just as nutritious.

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.549
Finally, I'm going to show you one

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.312
of my all-time favorite
salads, my beet salad.

00:02:57.312 --> 00:02:59.530
Now I love beets in the
autumn and the winter,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.562
they're just so hearty and delicious,

00:03:01.562 --> 00:03:03.223
and I absolutely love making this salad

00:03:03.223 --> 00:03:04.626
when I have leftover beets.

00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:06.530
It's the perfect way to use them up.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.781
So we are starting with my
sweet champagne vinaigrette.

00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:12.347
Again, recipe's in the
description box below.

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:13.809
To that, I'm going to add some beets

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.865
that I've just peeled and steamed,

00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:17.804
top that all off with
some crunchy walnuts,

00:03:17.804 --> 00:03:22.064
some tangy goat cheese,
and some delicious arugula.

00:03:22.064 --> 00:03:23.004
When you're ready to eat this,

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:24.409
you can just shake it all up,

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.301
pour it into a bowl, and oh my gosh,

00:03:26.301 --> 00:03:29.645
it is absolutely delicious,
super nutritious,

00:03:29.645 --> 00:03:33.940
and it was so, so easy to put
it all together, wasn't it?

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.647
I hope you'll give these
delicious salads in a jar

00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:37.748
a try, they are super great to make

00:03:37.748 --> 00:03:39.270
on Sunday night, and they're basically

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.266
good until Thursday, so you've got almost

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:44.343
an entire week of tasty
lunches standing by.

00:03:44.343 --> 00:03:45.410
Thanks so much for watching,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.432
