00:00:06.146 --> 00:00:07.470
- [Voiceover] Alright, so
let's make our marinade

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.550
for our chicken wings.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.128
Remember, these are crispy wings.

00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:13.193
Anyway, got some black pepper, some salt,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.536
some granulated garlic.

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:18.127
I'd rather use that than the power

00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:19.393
but you can, powder'd be fine.

00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:22.275
Some cayenne pepper for
a little bit of spice.

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:25.123
Now, I'm going to put some hot sauce.

00:00:25.123 --> 00:00:26.702
This is the vinegar based stuff.

00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:28.758
Use whatever brand you like.

00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:33.355
Now, we're going to add our buttermilk.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.254
And then, we're just going to give this

00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:40.239
a really good stir to mix everything up.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.586
And then we're going to pour
our marinade over our chicken,

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.548
we're going to mix it up really good,

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:47.419
and then we're going to put it

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:49.619
in the refrigerator for about one hour.

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:53.421
You can go two hours but
I would not go over three.

00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:55.360
You marinade these things too long

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.507
and the buttermilk's gonna break 'em down

00:00:57.507 --> 00:00:59.453
and they'll just fall apart.

00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:02.267
I have some all purpose flour here

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:03.545
and we're just going to season that

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:04.903
with the same seasonings

00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:06.586
that we seasoned our marinade with,

00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:08.619
except I'm not going to
put any hot sauce in here.

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.354
Then, we're going to give this a good mix.

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.645
And we're going to coat our chicken

00:01:13.645 --> 00:01:14.922
with the seasoned flour.

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:17.127
Now don't wash that buttermilk off.

00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:18.648
Just let it kind of drip off a little bit

00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:20.320
and then we're going to get a nice,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.363
thick coat of this flour mixture on here.

00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:23.258
What we're going to do,

00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:24.545
we're going to up it on this sheetpan,

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.595
we're going to let 'em
set for about 10 minutes.

00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:30.142
And after about 10 minutes,
they're gonna look like this.

00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:32.940
See how you got some dry
spots and some wet spots,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.321
like right there you got a wet spot?

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.719
Anyway, we're going to
take care of that right now

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.429
and all we're going to do

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.554
is we're gonna put these
things back in the flour.

00:01:41.554 --> 00:01:43.876
This is the same flour
that we were using before.

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:45.849
Now, whenever I get done doing this part,

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.150
I'm gonna throw that flour away.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.605
I don't want to save it because
it's had raw chicken in it.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.058
Alright, I'm gonna test my oil

00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:54.870
by putting a little
piece of flour in there.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.411
Looks good, I'm wanting a nice
gentle fry on this first fry.

00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.129
That's a lot of fries, isn't it?

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:01.475
Yeah, anyway.

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:06.739
If I had a thermometer, I'd
be looking for about 340F.

00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:11.563
Now, as soon as I get
some color on both sides

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:14.442
of this chicken, color
just about like that,

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:16.417
I'm gonna take it out and
put it on the wire rack

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.254
and then I'll start on the next batch.

00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:25.367
Alright, my last batch is done.

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:27.086
What I'm gonna do, when I get these out,

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:29.907
is I'm gonna crank the heat up to 375.

00:02:32.647 --> 00:02:35.026
And now that the oil's
up to second fry temp,

00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:36.849
we're gonna put our first batch of wings

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.676
back into the oil.

00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:41.655
Now that we have this
batch of wings in the oil,

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:43.211
we're gonna keep stirring 'em around.

00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:44.709
I don't want 'em to sit on the bottom

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.775
because if they do, they'll
get black spots on 'em.

00:02:46.775 --> 00:02:49.817
And I want 'em to have a nice
pretty golden brown color

00:02:49.817 --> 00:02:51.530
all the way around.

00:02:52.847 --> 00:02:54.808
And then when our wings
get nice and crispy

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:57.142
and golden brown, just about like that,

00:02:58.062 --> 00:02:58.814
we're gonna pull 'em out,

00:02:58.814 --> 00:03:00.643
put 'em back on the wire rack.

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:04.279
Now don't those look good?

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:07.982
Nice and crispy, nice and
hot, little bit spicy.

00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:11.173
As always, how does it taste?

00:03:11.173 --> 00:03:12.487
I know one thing, it's hot.

00:03:12.487 --> 00:03:14.613
I can feel it on my fingers.

00:03:21.363 --> 00:03:24.463
Crunchy, it's got a little bit of heat,

00:03:24.463 --> 00:03:26.762
it's not hot enough, real spicy,

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:29.200
but then again, that
depends on your spice level.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.148
But this thing is loaded
with flavor, it's moist,

00:03:32.148 --> 00:03:33.484
absolutely wonderful.

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:34.814
Please give this a try.
