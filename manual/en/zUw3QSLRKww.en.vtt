00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.250
If a cloud drifted into your house on a mountain
top and then it began raining outside, would

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.180
it rain inside your house as well?

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.719
Unfortunately, probably not.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.130
Raindrops require more vertical space than
the height of the average house to form.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.390
They start out really tiny and get larger
as they fall through the water droplets of

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.390
the cloud.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.300
Clouds are just like a very thick fog high
up in the skies.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.580
Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA's Kennedy
Space Center CAN have this problem.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.529
This is where Saturn V rockets got assembled.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.690
The interior of the building is HUGE huge
HUUUGEEEE! 160m of open vertical space!

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.149
Since it's in Florida and it's so huge, rain
clouds can form at the ceiling.

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.210
But we should all be happy to see rain because
of phantom rain.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.129
Sometimes over the deserts heavy rain-clouds
are raining down, but because of the hot climate

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.030
near surface, all rain evaporates before it
reaches the ground.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.629
Imagine, as Edward Abbey said,

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.470
"Then you see curtains of blue rain dangling
out of reach in the sky, while the living

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.730
things wither below for want of water.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.659
Torture by tantalizing, hope without fulfillment.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.470
And the clouds disperse and dissipate into
nothingness�"

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.810
But we are still very lucky because we don't
live on HD 189733b, a planet in a "little

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.780
fox" constellation, where it rains liquid
glass sideways at 4,500-mph!

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:38.170
Heavy rains and a little bit of thunder are
not that scary anymore... or are they?

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.759
William Rankin, an experienced pilot of World
War II, was flying his F-8 Crusader on a routine

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.060
flight at 47,000 feet.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.969
At 6PM, because of the engine failure, his
was forced to eject into -50 �C (-58 �F)

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:52.969
air.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.969
Without a pressure suit, this was a life threatening
choice.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.270
But this wasn't his biggest problem.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.210
Since at the time he was flying over a heavy
thunderstorm cloud, when he ejected, he found

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.700
himself in the midst of a beast.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.660
Lightning appeared, which he described as
blue blades several feet thick, and thunder

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.160
that he could feel.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.970
Getting hit by hailstones and trying to hold
his breath to keep from drowning in the rain,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.510
he landed after 40 minutes, 65 miles from
where he ejected.
