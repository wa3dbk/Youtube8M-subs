00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.760
Tell us short: have you driven a electric gokart before?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.800
No, never! I'm used to drive normal gokarts, sort of saying.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.620
With petrol motors, KF2 40-45 HP

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.420
So no, I've never tried it before.

00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:23.673
What is your expectations?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.100
That it will accelerate from the button and all the way up!

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.260
Okay, let us come back to you after the drive!

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.380
Exciting, I'm looking forward to it.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.040
How was it?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.960
It's insane!

00:05:44.653 --> 00:05:46.653
Whats the cost of it?

00:05:47.954 --> 00:05:49.954
It's cheap for sale for 130.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.380
130?

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.140
I have 130 kr. inside my locker.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.160
There's missing some zeros.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.680
That's more then your track racer.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.980
But it accelrate as crazy!

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.153
It controls surprisingly well.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.320
I think it controls surprisingly well taken it's weight inconsideration.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.840
It will off couse slide a bit at the front wheels

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.080
but

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.780
that is natural because of the the weight.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.900
Maybe we'll move the back wheels a little in so the grip gets better at the front wheels.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.920
But I don't think it drives bad, not at all!

00:06:36.113 --> 00:06:38.113
I'm surprised over have well it handles.

00:06:38.393 --> 00:06:40.393
What about the acceleration?

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.900
Crazy!

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.060
The KF's they're......

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.200
My KF'er is..... nothing like this.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.180
This one just starts accelerating then you move your feet.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.160
That's not the case with the others.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.380
They accelerate but it's not the same.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.340
When you're out of the curve and you've reached that point then it's just......

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.960
It's only because I have respect for their gear that I don't give more then I did.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.014
Because it handles well.

00:07:08.014 --> 00:07:11.434
That can Nanna also confirm when she'll dive it. She dives much better then I.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.140
How was it to drive it?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:23.220
I think you have ruined all my sense I had for petrol gokarts.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.260
This is too insane!

00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:27.934
Totally insane!

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.740
I only thought that it was the gearkarts that you could drive as fast as you dare.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.020
It's totally wild!

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.580
Totally wild!

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.840
It just accelerate and continues.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.525
It's just a too small track.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.120
It could be fun to bring it to Jyllands Ringen.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.220
Yes, maybe just to Roskilde.

00:07:50.994 --> 00:07:52.994
It drives as fast as you dare!
