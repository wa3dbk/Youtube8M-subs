00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Narrator] Here's a state space

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
diagram for a simple problem.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It involves a room with 2 locations.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The left we call A, and the right we call B,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and in that environment

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
there's a vacuum cleaner, and there

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
may or may not be dirt in either                                                               of the 2 locations,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and so that gives us 8 total states.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Dirt is here or not, here or not, and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the vacuum cleaner is here or here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So that's 2 times 2 times 2

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is 8 possible states, and I've drawn

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
here the states based diagram

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
with all the transitions

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
for the 3 possible actions, and                                           the actions are moving right.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So we'd go from this state to this state.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Moving left, we'd go from this state to this state,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and sucking up dirt, we'd go from this state

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to this state for example, and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in this state space diagram,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
if we have a fully deterministic,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
fully observable world, it's easy to plan.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Say we start in this state, and we want to be--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
end up in a goal state where                                                                          both sides are clean.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We can execute the suck-dirt action

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and get here and then move right,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and then suck dirt again,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and now we end up in a goal state

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where everything is clean.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now suppose our robot vacuum cleaner's

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
sensors break down, and so the robot

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
can no longer perceive either

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which location its in

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or whether there's any dirt.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So we now have an unobservable

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
or sensor-less world rather

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
than a fully observable one,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and how does the agent then represent the state of the world?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Well it could be in any one of these 8 states,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and so all we can do to represent

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the current state is draw a big circle

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or box around everything, and say,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
"I know I'm somewhere inside here."

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now that doesn't seem like it helps very much.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What good is it to know that

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we don't really know anything at all?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But the point is that we can search in the state

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
space of the least states rather

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
than in the state space of actual spaces.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So we believe that we're in 1 of these 8 states,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and now when we execute an action,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we're going to get to another belief state.

00:02:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's take a look at how that works.
