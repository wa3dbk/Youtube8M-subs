how to tie your tie in 10 seconds hello
if you're sick of being late for work.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.730
pratik s-- has the answer for you tying
a tie in 10 seconds it's possible there

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.430
you go with just a few slights of hand
you've got a perfect toy not just how it

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.240
should be let's take a close look at how
to do it

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.739
first lay the tie down on a table next
you need to make a loop with the large

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.970
end like this

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.900
do the same thing with a smaller end
like this

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.739
there you go that's right with your
right hand take the small loop and turn

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.520
it once

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.860
I'll show you again take the smaller
loop and turn it and now you need to

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.170
slip the smaller loop inside the bigger
one

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.170
like that inside it

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.590
take the tail of the tie like this

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.869
and slide it inside the two loops take
it on the other side and hold the two

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.009
ends together now pull gently on the
neck loop with your left hand very

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:49.759
gently and as if by magic there you have
a perfect toy knot there you go you'll

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.780
never be late for work again
