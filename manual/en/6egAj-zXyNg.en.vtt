00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:01.690
So what you're saying is...

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.470
EXCELSIOR!!!

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:14.180
[music]

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.360
Ok so I'm really excited today,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.680
today is our summer watergun edition.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.800
*sound of success!* *sound of sword ca-ching-ing*

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.010
Look at this amazing water gun!

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.420
We had no choice but to get these.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.820
Is it a water gun, or is it a GUN BLADE?!

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.350
Anybody a fan of Final Fantasy 8?  Squall Leonhart?

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.880
I played all the Final Fantasys because I'm a nerd.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.670
Ok well mine is a really special one,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.000
this is a little pump stick,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.190
and pretty much you just gotta suck the water up,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.550
and you gotta spray it out,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.010
We're gonna put water in our little bear bucket, and Simon will,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.570
so I'll pump it in and I'll spray it out.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.780
What makes this so magical is the illustration on it:

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.540
You see a little boy: he's pumping off a big load.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.240
of water!

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.170
Into this girls face, with her arms open,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.820
and she's like "YAY!"

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.570
and her eyes closed and her chin out, 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.500
and...I thought it was very appropriate for summertime fun!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.290
Now, I've never used this before, and I'm a little bit worried,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.920
because the spraying comes from here, and you fill it in his bum,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.030
and so it's like, if I spray it, 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.050
won't it go up my nose or something?

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.380
No, it's gotta be like a gun blade,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.080
you gotta hit and spray at the same time,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.800
I gotta hack...I'm gonna get killed here today! 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.210
Well, no.  I think that makes it a more lethal weapon.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.240
We have an unhappy party of crying children all around us.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.010
The children are terrified of this game that we're playing.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.230
I think we scared everyone.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.160
I know.  It's the foreigners!  They're playing with toys!

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.070
Ok so we've come up with a set of rules here.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.500
We've brought two buckets with us,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.000
and each of us is allowed to fill the bucket with water,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.760
as you can see behind us, we've got lots of water,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.600
and you're only allowed to use this.  You can't keep going back.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.670
Because Simon's water...stick...pump,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.590
can definitely fill more water than my gunblade,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.100
Ok so we're gonna see who's gonna win this battle.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.380
I think I'm gonna win.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.100
Are you ready to go?  Let's battle!  READY?!

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.540
*lame combat sounds of two people clearly inexperienced in the art of fighting*

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.120
Ok so the deal is we have each of our buckets placed behind us,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.930
That's mine.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.760
We can only refill based on the water,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.170
we cannot go back to the fountains.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.490
that's it, and we're gonna see who has the superior weapon.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.660
Martina's going down!

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.070
I'm really scared, I'll be honest

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.810
You better be!

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.110
I can still beat you with the sword though!

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.010
If you can even catch me!  I'm a fast runner!

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.030
Ok, to battle stations!

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.250
3, 2, 1, go!

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.360
YAH!

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.270
Make sure you stay in the camera range!

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.030
This is completely unfair!

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.670
Ah yeah!

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.970
*girlish giggling*

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.720
You can't use my bucket!

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.120
You can't!

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.240
*more girlish giggling*

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.900
I think it's clear that I won

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.300
This is terrible!  It's defective!

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.710
Winner!

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.150
Ok this is a totally unfair invention!

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.330
Winner!

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.420
Look at my makeup smudged face!  Unfair situation people!

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.410
Oh bombaclot!

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.520
No!

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.530
So I think it's clear to say who is the winner here!

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.830
Even though mine broke in the middle of battle,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.710
It still has the most bang for its buck.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.760
This is a totally ridiculous game,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.480
Because this little pumping thing here,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.470
first of all it goes up!

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.590
So you're like pointing it at the person 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.660
and my finger's all like, look at this!  I'm actually bleeding!

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.110
One thing that's for sure is that this is,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.540
it said 0-3: this is for 4 and up,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.750
I wouldn't give my 4 year old this.  You could really beat someone with this!

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.050
I mean, imagine if you're losing at your watergun fight.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.600
I would resort to kicking people, or beating them with the sword.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.000
Flashback!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.440
I gotta tell you, this is the best water gun that I've owned in my entire life!

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.460
It loads really quickly, right?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.050
Like, yours has really tiny sprits,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.570
and sure it last longer than the other ones, 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.390
but, like, one pump of this one, 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.300
INSTANT VICTORY!

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.620
Look I still got water in here.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.010
I suppose this can be like a good joke gift.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.330
You're like "hey let's play with this water gun!"

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.330
This has so much range also,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.170
I mean, look how far it's gonna go.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.900
And it finally just hit the ground right now.  That's pretty intense.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.300
Anyways, that's it.  I'm gonna go home and sulk now

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.600
after everybody in the park around us saw me get my butt kicked.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.120
You got hosed!

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.830
GONG!

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.870
And as for the winner of the WTF care package of the month,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.070
The winner is: gonna be announced in the bloopers,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.310
I'm all wet!

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.120
You got hosed.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.320
Uhhh.  

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.000
That's a cute little blanket you have on your head.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.360
It's not a blanket!  It's a towel!

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.820
I'm a very cute blue bear!

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.940
See what I have to put up with, guise?

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.540
What?!

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.950
See what I have to put up with?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.470
Why?!

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.470
GONG!
