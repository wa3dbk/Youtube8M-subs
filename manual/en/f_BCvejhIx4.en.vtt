00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:09.049
Hey, we're goin' down with the floors, and
these are home grown-- and you know what does

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.959
for our carbon footprint.

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:19.130
They an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.130
I'm Allen Smith.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.700
Join me as I push the limits with time, budget
and creativity with the Garden Home Challenge,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.340
exclusively on eHow Home.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.820
Got an exciting day today with the floor going
down.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.010
What's a house without a floor?

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.890
You see, the first thing that went down here
was this paper --or laminate-- which serves

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.920
as a vapor barrier.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.160
What we're trying to do here is prime a floor
that is actually going to not buckle.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.660
You know, we had to cut some expenses here,
and we're using #2 Grade flooring.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.370
These are 6 inch boards of pine.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.120
And you can see, they're tongue and groove.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.609
So, here's the groove on this side, and here's
the tongue on that side.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.950
And then, if you look, this is the top part
of it.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.990
And boy, I wish that all of it looked like
this.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.780
But we got a lot of knot holes.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.250
Again, that's why we got such a good deal
on it, because we bought #2s.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.909
And on the underside, you'll see, that there's
this groove cut here and a groove cut there.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.270
That's to help keep the wood from actually
buckling.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.759
It sort of breaks the grain, if you will.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.189
And so, it's gonna keep the floors from buckling
and keep them very smooth.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.000
Now, what Tony's doing is he's putting this
thing down with a 1/4 inch spacer here against

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the wall.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.340
So all the way around, there'll be a 1/4 inch
distance that'll come off the corner a 1/4

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.920
in the corner there and all along this side.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.409
And this is our north-south axis.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.100
So, from the front door to the back door,
you're gonna have all the boards running in

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.439
this direction.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.549
And then, in the kitchen and in this guest
room, we'll have them running the same direction.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.700
And if you look up above us, you'll see that
the upstairs faux finish floor of this ceiling

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.009
shows that same direction of flooring--you
can actually let it run any direction you

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.009
like.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.760
In fact, I may change my mind a little bit,
and we may run the boards this direction.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.849
I wanna give each room the illusion of being
as large as it possibly can.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.690
And by looking down --down these boards--
you get a sense of perspective, and it makes

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.690
the room feel longer.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.920
But we'll get to these rooms a little later.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.960
You're gonna get contraction in a â€¦ no matter
what.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.370
So, you're not gonna be able to see this little
1/4 inch gap, because the baseboard for the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.879
wall will sit right here, so it'll cover it
up.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.099
But it'll sure come in handy, because this
will inevitably move over time.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.970
Now, the final finish on the floor is gonna
be paint.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.530
I'm gonna paint the floors, so that's why
it didn't bother me to have to come in and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.420
maybe use some of this wood that's got more
knotholes in it then I really want.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.540
We'll have to come through with a wood putty
and fill in some of them, sand them off, and

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.769
then we'll have to figure out a color--but
that's different story.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.180
