00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.090
I have come back and the first day was absolutely
fabulous.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:15.980
I had it on for like 9 hours straight and
I had no pain and I was able to flex my foot

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.580
before it was stationary.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.810
And I wanted to have sandals.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:29.699
So I came back and now I have sandals all
adjusted and I can wear these, and I can wear

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.340
these, and I can wear a smaller size in these.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:46.940
But I'm very excited about this and we have
adapted my sandals so that the foot of the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.769
brace is close to the sole of my sandal so
I don't have any kind of pain across the bottom

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.280
of my foot.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.699
I'm just so excited and look at them they're
even pretty.

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:08.920
So make sure the back part of the sandal as
the ability to be . So this can be pulled

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.250
back a little bit because sometimes it might
be too tight.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.820
This one worked fine.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:31.130
In this particular case this strap 
I extended the Velcro here so she could get

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.259
it farther across and that can open up a little
bit more.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.490
I added a little bit more of loop Velcro so
the brace would stick to the bottom of the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.490
shoe.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.770
You adjusted that one too.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:51.109
This one here did not have any adjust ability
to it so I just cut it and added a piece of

00:01:51.109 --> 00:02:00.130
padding to extend the heel section but it
would be better if you did this kind of sandal

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.289
and buy the one that's adjustable to begin
with and also make sure that this strap that

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.920
comes across the top of your foot is long
enough so you don't have to add any material.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.270
But you did it!

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:26.690
But I did it but you'd have to come all 
the way to Maine.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.830
Thank you so much.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.690
I'm just so excited.
