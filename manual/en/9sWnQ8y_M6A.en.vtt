00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:04.179
Well, well, well.

00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:07.932
They are scraping the bottom of
the barrel for cheerleaders these days.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.435
What are you doing here?

00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:15.688
We were going out for ice cream.
Thought you might like tojoin us.

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:19.774
I said I'd be home at 1 0:00.
It's not even 9:00.

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:27.073
Who said anything about that? I thought
you'd like tojoin us for ice cream.

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:31.325
Maybe your "Bug" here can join us.
We can talk about burying the hatchet.

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.662
- Do you know what a hatchet is, Bug?
- It's an ax?

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:36.914
Sort of, yeah.

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:39.374
I got one in the car
ifyou'd like to see it.

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:43.003
- I'll pass.
- Fair enough.

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:48.214
I like to carry it. You never know
when you're going to need it.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.217
A situation may come up.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.844
For example,
someone's been drinking...

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.513
and about to drive
a loved one home.

00:00:56.638 --> 00:00:58.848
Then I like to know I have it.

00:00:58.932 --> 00:01:02.684
Not to kill, no.
Just to maim.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.603
Take a little off the shoulder.

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:08.731
The elbow.
Shave a little meat...

00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:11.024
off the old kneecap.

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:14.527
You got both kneecaps?

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:20.240
I like to keep mine razor-sharp.
Sharp enough to shave with them.

00:01:20.324 --> 00:01:22.867
I've been known
to circumcise a gnat.

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:25.370
You're not a gnat, are you, Bug?

00:01:25.453 --> 00:01:27.413
Wait a minute.

00:01:27.497 --> 00:01:29.456
Bug. Gnat.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.543
Is there a similarity there?

00:01:35.377 --> 00:01:37.921
Whoa, I think there is.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.632
You understand
what I'm talking about?

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:49.054
I don't thinkyou do.
I'll be right back.

00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:58.021
I'm sorry.

00:01:58.104 --> 00:02:00.146
I thinkyou'd better split.

00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:02.608
I don't want him going berserk
with an ax on me.

00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.109
He's all talk.

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.902
Here it is!

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:10.656
Come on over!
I want to show it to you.

00:02:12.158 --> 00:02:13.533
Maybe later.

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:26.084
He's gone in a few days.
Just relax.

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:29.755
I'll get him back.

00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:47.309
That's a stupid thing to do
during flu season.

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:49.812
I bet she's getting the tongue.
