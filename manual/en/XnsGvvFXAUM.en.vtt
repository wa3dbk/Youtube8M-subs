00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.870
PINDAR: BERNARD WHY DON'T YOU GET IT YOURSELF

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.510
BERNARD: WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT MY MOMMA?

YOU ACT LIKE YOU DON'T LIKE ME. WELL GUESS
WHAT I DON'T LIKE YOU. YOU ALWAYS DRESS FUNNY

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.989
AND NONE OF THE OTHER KIDS AT SCHOOL LIKE
YOU EITHER WITH YOUR WEIRD CLOTHES YOU ALWAYS

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.580
WEAR. LIKE LOOK AT YOUR HEAD. YOU'RE ALWAYS
WEARING A FUNNY HAT. NOBODY LOOKS LIKE THAT

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.479
AROUND HERE. YOU NEED TO GO TO THE MALL AND
DRESS LIKE US.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:06.869
PINDAR: (CRYING) BERNARD I AM SO OVER YOU.
PLEASE GET YOUR CANDY AND LEAVE.

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.869
BERNICE: THERE YOU ARE. I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.310
PINDER: BERNICEWHY HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR
ME?

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.140
BERNICE: BECAUSE I HEARD EARLIER YOU KICKED
MY BROTHER OUT OF YOUR STORE BEING MEAN TO

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.660
HIM.
PINDAR: I WAS NOT MEAN TO YOUR BROTHER. HE

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.500
CAME IN ASKING FOR CANDY AND STARTED TALKING
ABOUT HOW HE DIDN'T LIKE ME AND HOW FUNNY

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.480
I DRESSED.
BERNICE: WELL HE'S RIGHT. PLUS MY I DON'T

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.909
LIKE YOU EITHER. YOU ALWAYS COME AROUND ACTING
LIKE YOU'RE BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE AROUND

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.070
YOU BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS HAVE A STORE. NOBODY
CARES ABOUT YOUR STORE.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.070
PINDAR: WE DON'T ACT LIKE WE'RE BETTER THAN
EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.330
BERNICE: YES YOU DO AND YOU GUYS TALK ALL
WEIRD AROUND US AND I DON'T LIKE YOU EITHER.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.750
PINDAR: I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T LUKE ME.
BERNICE: BECAUSE YOU HAVE THOSE FUNNY CLOTHES

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.700
ON. YOU ARE JUST WEIRD.
PINDAR: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU BOTH DON'T

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.519
LIKE ME SO MUCH. I'M ALWAYS COURTEOUS TO YOU.
BERNICE: THERE YOU GO WITH THOSE WEIRD WORDS.

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.130
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. TALK IN
ENGLISH FOR ONCE.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.510
PINDAR: BERNICE THAT IS ENGLISH.
BERNICE: WHATEVER. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.770
WE WILL NEVER LIKE YOU. BECAUSE WE'RE TOO
TIGHT. YOU ARE JUST WEIRD. YOU'LL HAVE TO

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.090
GET USE TO IT.
JO: WHAT UP PINDAR? WHERE YOU BEEN AT.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.310
PINDAR: OH JO I HAVE BEEN AT THE STORE ALL
DAY. I'M SO TIRED OF WORKING THERE AND HAVING

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.600
PEOPLE PICKING ON ME ALL THE TIME.
JOE: WHAT DO YOU MEAN PEOPLE ARE PICKING ON

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.780
YOU.
PINDAR: EARLIER TODAY. BERNARD CAME IN THE

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.780
STORE TODAY. AS USUAL HE HAD TO COME INTO
BEING MEAN TALKING BAD ABOUT MY CLOTHES. HE

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.650
EVEN MADE FUN OF MY HIJAB.
JO: THAT AIN'T EVEN COOL. HE SHOULD NOT TALK

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.120
ABOUT HOW YOU DRESS. I LIKE THE WAY YOU DRESS.
PINDAR: YOU DO?

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.120
JO: YEAH GIRL. YOU ALWAYS WHERE THOSE PRETTY
SCARVES WITH YOUR HIJAB. I THINK IT'S COOL.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.750
. DON'T LISTEN TO THOSE TWO GIRL.
PINDAR: I TRY NOT TO BUT IT IS HARD. I JUST

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.750
WANT TO SIT IN AND IT FEELS LIKE I NEVER WILL.
JO: I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL GIRL. I MEAN MY MOM

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.040
AND DAD ALWAYS BOTHER ME ME ABOUT HOW I DRESS
SAYING I NEED TO DRESS MORE LIKE A LADY. BUT

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.040
I DON'T CARE. I LIKE HOW I DRESS. ITS ME.
I'M NOT MY SISTER JESS WHOSE MISS FASHIONISTA.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.470
I LIKE PLAYING SPORTS AND FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE.
PINDAR: I HEAR YOU. BUT AT LEAST YOUR PARENTS

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.819
GIVE YOU A CHOICE. NO MATTER WHERE I GO I
HAVE TO COVER UP. MY DAD WILL HAVE A COW IF

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.660
I CAME OUTSIDE WITHOUT MY JOB AND SHOW MY
REAL HAIR.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.400
JO: I KNOW GIRL. PARENTS ARE LIKE THAT, BUT
THEY LOVE US AND I'M SURE HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.800
SHE FEELS IS RIGHT. PLUS THAT YOUR CULTURE.
DON'T LET ANYBODY MAKE YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.680
YOUR CULTURE. COME ON I KNOW THE PERFECT PERSON
TO TALK TO.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.769
MISS MEETRY: HEY LADIES. WHAT BRINGS YOU TWO
BY MY PLACE?

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.230
JO: HEY MISS MEETRY. I WANTED TO STOP BY WITH
PINDAR BECAUSE SHE'S HAVING A BAD DAY. I'M

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.889
GOING TO LET THE BOTH OF YOU TALK. I'LL SEE
YOU LATER.

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.279
MISS MEETRY: WELL I SURE AM SORRY TO HEAR
THAT YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY BABY. WHY DON'T

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:30.150
YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
PINDAR: I JUST GET TIRED OF PEOPLE ALWAYS

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.960
PICKING ON ME BECAUSE I'M DIFFERENT.
MISS MEETRY: WHAT DO YOU MEAN DIFFERENT? YOU'RE

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.409
STILL THAT SAME BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL THAT
I FIRST MET WHEN YOUR MOM AND DAD STARTED

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:44.550
THEIR STORE HERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
PINDAR: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE NICE. NOT EVERYBODY

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.120
TREATS ME LIKE YOU DO MISS MEETRY.
MISS MEETRY: WELL BABY THAT IS THE FUNNY THING

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.620
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE, BUT NEVER LET THAT GET
YOU DOWN. THAT'S ONE THING YOU'LL LEARN. IF

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.499
YOU LET PEOPLE WHO ARE MEAN UPSET YOU ALL
THE TIME OR MAKE YOU SAD, THEN YOU WILL ALWAYS

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.550
BE UPSET. DON'T LET OTHER PEOPLE THAT DON'T
KNOW HOW SWEET YOU REALLY ARE GET YOU DOWN.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.029
BECAUSE YOU ARE SPECIAL AND YOU HAVE TO WALK
AND TALK LIKE A SPECIAL LADY EVEN WHEN OTHERS

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:04.639
MAY NOT SEE IT IN YOU.
PINDAR: BUT I FEEL SO WIERD ALL THE TIME.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.129
I HAVE TO WEAR THESE CLOTHES WHEN NONE OF
THE OTHER KIDS HAVE TO WEAR THEM. THEN PEOPLE

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:15.259
LIKE BERNICE AND BERNARD MAKE FUN OF ME AND
SAY I TALK FUNNY.

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.900
MISS MEETRY: GIRL YOU CAN'T PAY THOSE 2 ANY
ATTENTION. BUT I DO KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.919
PINDAR: YOU DID?
MISS MEETRY: OF COURSE I DO BABY. YOU HAVE

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:29.919
TO REALIZE I'VE BEEN AROUND A VERY LONG TIME
AND WHEN I WAS YOUNG LIKE YOU I HAD TO WEAR

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.580
DRESSES ALL THE TIME. WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO
WEAR ANY JEWELRY OR MAKE-UP LIKE THE YOUNG

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:44.900
GIRLS CAN TODAY. MY MOM AND DAD SAID IT WAS
ABOUT BEING MODEST AND BEING A LADY. SO THAT

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.279
IS JUST LIKE YOUR HIJAB. OF COURSE YOU WEAR
IT BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS TELL YOU TO BUT YOU

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:56.509
ALSO WEAR IT BECAUSE IT IS A PART OF YOUR
CULTURE. A PART OF WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:01.770
BELIEVE. NEVER BE ASHAMED OF THAT BABY. BE
PROUD AND DO YOU.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:08.389
PINDAR: THANK YOU MISS M.I REALLY NEEDED THAT.
MISS MEETRY: ANYTIME BABY. AND THE NEXT TIME

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.860
I SEE THAT LITTLE BERNARD AND BERNICE I'M
GOING TO HAVE A TALK WITH THOSE TWO.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.110
PINDAR: THANKS MISS M.
