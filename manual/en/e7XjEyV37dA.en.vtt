00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.744
Right after
I got injured...

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.898
Dr. OdÃ­lio got in touch
with my agent,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.291
offering the Club's structure to me,

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:30.849
which made me very happy.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.900
I left the team,
but I still have friends in here,

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.746
I left an open door at a huge club.

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:42.331
I chose to come back here
to be close to my family,

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:44.378
I already knew all the professionals
who work here,

00:00:45.287 --> 00:00:46.805
and I can only thank...

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:49.833
Santos FC for the support,
affection and attention...

00:00:50.177 --> 00:00:51.716
given to me once again,

00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:55.925
and for healing me
to start playing again for my team.

00:00:56.093 --> 00:00:59.803
He's fit to gradually
start playing again,

00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:05.199
he'll still have to develop
a transition work,

00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:09.227
so that, in a month,
he'll be completely fit to play,

00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:12.041
which is the things
he likes the most.

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:15.880
We never expect to see
a friend in such situation,

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:19.495
we want to see our friends
in better conditions.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.405
To be able to see him,
to follow up on his recovery,

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:25.384
and to conduct his treatment
was great,

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.678
it was very pleasant,
especially due to its success.

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:32.212
We worked together
for four months,

00:01:32.214 --> 00:01:33.891
he was very committed,

00:01:33.898 --> 00:01:37.311
it's even redundant
to mention his commitment,

00:01:37.312 --> 00:01:39.828
because he has always been
very committed,

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.041
he was always focused,

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:47.185
he was always seeking the goals
we established during the treatment,

00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:49.604
it was very easy
to conduct his treatment.

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:50.682
It was great,

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:55.118
I hope we manage to meet again,
but under better circumstances.

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:13.950
The first month was the toughest,
that's for sure,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.513
it was very hard to bend
and to extend the knee,

00:02:16.514 --> 00:02:17.508
 I felt a lot of pain,

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:20.896
but everyone who works at CEPRAF,
Thiago, Avelino and Rafa...

00:02:20.897 --> 00:02:23.399
did an extremely good job.

00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:25.686
It was another miracle,

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.270
I remember that when I broke
my leg back in 2009...

00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:30.078
the doctors said
I'd be recovered in 9 months,

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.649
but, after four months,
I was already playing,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.889
and the same thing happened again,

00:02:32.976 --> 00:02:35.603
after four months and a half
I'm fit to start training,

00:02:35.604 --> 00:02:36.974
thanks to another miracle...

00:02:36.975 --> 00:02:40.777
and to those professionals,
who are amazing.

00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:44.527
We already knew him,
what to do,

00:02:44.528 --> 00:02:49.424
we knew the patient very well,
the things he likes,

00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:51.227
and the problems we might have...

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:53.995
which made it easier for us
to establish his treatment.

00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:07.248
Arzul is one of the best
goalkeeper coaches...

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.438
I've ever worked with,

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.817
he's extremely talented.

00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:13.126
It's curious that he was my first
coach when I came to Santos FC,

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:17.214
he was the goalkeeper coach
for the team's Youth Academy,

00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:19.331
we developed our careers
at the same pace,

00:03:19.978 --> 00:03:21.815
and to be able to work with him,
both in the professional team...

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:25.541
and during the last phase
of my treatment was amazing.

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:27.300
I'm feeling great,
thanks to God,

00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:31.571
of course I'll improve my skills
as time goes by,

00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:32.456
which is normal,

00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:34.508
it's been four months
since last time I trained,

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:37.725
but I'm surprised,
I'm feeling better than I expected.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:52.279
Gustavo...

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.227
I used to play for the U-17 team
and he used to play for the U-15,

00:03:55.228 --> 00:03:56.978
and the U-15 team
used to play before the U-17,

00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:00.217
and I used to watch their matches.

00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:03.190
He's always been very tall,
he used to score headers all the time,

00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:05.618
we developed our careers,
I joined the professional team,

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.074
then he did,
we've always been friends,

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:11.060
but now that we were
being treated together...

00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:13.032
we became even closer.

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:15.576
I'm going to miss him a lot,

00:04:15.577 --> 00:04:17.516
and I'm very happy to see
that he's fit as well.

00:04:17.587 --> 00:04:19.603
I underwent surgery
two days after he did,

00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:22.100
but we went through
the same process,

00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:25.046
we used to feel the same pain
when bending our knees,

00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:27.740
and we kept supporting each other,

00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:30.941
and, thanks to God,
we handled all those things,

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:32.889
then we started working out...

00:04:33.162 --> 00:04:35.741
Whenever someone was not
feeling good...

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.282
the other one would be
very supportive,

00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:40.531
it was great,

00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:43.652
we used to go
to each other's houses,

00:04:43.798 --> 00:04:46.010
we became very close friends,

00:04:46.332 --> 00:04:49.157
I can only thank God
for putting him in my life.

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:08.426
Santos FC will always be
in my heart,

00:05:08.513 --> 00:05:09.870
it has always been,

00:05:09.948 --> 00:05:12.691
I experienced amazing moments
while playing for this team,

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:16.408
and, once again,
Santos FC took care of me,

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.756
as well as the fans,

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:19.224
they kept sending me messages.

00:05:19.492 --> 00:05:21.555
Santos FC will always be
in my heart,

00:05:21.556 --> 00:05:22.821
I would like to say thanks
to everyone,

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:25.882
I would like to send a kiss
to everyone,

00:05:26.348 --> 00:05:27.945
I'd like to say thanks
to the Management Committee,

00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:29.298
the Medical Staff,

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:31.738
Thiago, Avelino and Rafael,

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:33.832
who stayed with me
during this whole time,

00:05:34.152 --> 00:05:36.627
they were amazing,
they deserve all the credit.

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.818
When I played here
I used to say that...

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.716
everyone can see us playing,
winning titles,

00:05:42.806 --> 00:05:45.789
making saves or scoring goals,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.172
but what matters the most
is the structure behind us,

00:05:50.173 --> 00:05:51.955
without them
none of that would be possible.
