Hi this is Jeff Martinez with El Chile Cafï¿½

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.980
and Cantina in Austin, Texas. Today were going
to do some wild game cooking, we're using

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.410
dove today. It's a lean tender dark meat.
We're making a buffalo dove breast with a

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.660
celery and carrot salad in a blue cheese dressing.
Let's get started we're going to take our

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.570
dove breast, we're going to dredge it in the
flour, make sure you coat it all over this

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.750
flour is going to help the buttermilk stick
to the dove breast. There's the buttermilk

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.050
right here, make sure they're coated all over
with the buttermilk and then right back into

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.230
the flour, the buttermilks going to help the
flour stick to the dove breast. Make sure

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.540
they are evenly coated with the flour, just
like so. And then we're going to go straight

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.850
into the oil.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.850
{Sizzle}

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.130
[Jeff Martinez]
You want your oil to be at three hundred and

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.960
seventy five degrees, that'll give you a nice
brown crusted coating on the outside while

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.860
cooking the dove through. While those are
cooking we're going to go ahead and make our

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.829
salad. So we've got some celery, some shaved
carrots, a little bit of red onion, and I

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.170
like to use all of the vegetables so I've
got some celery leaves here from the top.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.570
And some buttermilk dressing to finish it
off. Toss that around, make sure you coat

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.650
all the vegetables with the dressing. And
that buttermilk dressing will take away some

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.750
of the bite from the buffalo sauce. All right
there we go let's check our dove breasts.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.560
{Sizzle}

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.330
[Jeff Martinez]
We're going to pull these out of the oil.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.080
Take me right to this paper towel to drain.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.560

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.070
[Jeff Martinez]
So this dove recipe reminds me a lot of when

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.380
I was younger, my pop would take me dove hunting
right outside of San Antonio at the family

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.400
ranch. After the hunt we would all sit around
and kinda tell stories and stuff, and I always

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.240
had something to look forward to every year,
and that was dove season.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.460
[Hunter]
Take em!

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.860
{Gunshots}

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.840
[Jeff Martinez]
To get more information on dove hunting check

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.240
out Texas Parks and Wildlife's website.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.490

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.579
So these dove breasts look like they are ready
to go. I've got my homemade buffalo sauce

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.879
here, it's a mix of sriracha, butter, vinegar,
a little Worcestershire sauce. I'm going to

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.799
throw these right in, I'm going to mix them
up, make sure I coat them evenly, and I'm

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.459
going to put them on top of this salad.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.790
{Music}

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.000
[Jeff Martinez]
And then I'm going to finish it all off with

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.700
a little blue cheese. So this is a new twist
on an old favorite and it's also a great way

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.390
to end your dove hunt. Buen Provecha, yall!

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.739
