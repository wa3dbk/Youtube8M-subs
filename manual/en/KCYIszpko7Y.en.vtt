Live healthier, get a blender.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.200
Blendtec vs. Vitamix

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.580
Can it blend grains?

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.260
Blendtec and Vitamix are the top two commercially used and sold blenders in America.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.760
They are used for juicing, grinding, making ice cream, cooking raw or hot vegetable soup.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.940
These are all in one blenders, and are able to replace 8 appliances in your kitchen.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.860
Replace your grain mill, coffee grinder, and meat grinder with one machine.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.380
In this video, we're going to grind popcorn kernels

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.700
and compare the finest and texture

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.980
between the Blendtec Fourside Jar, the Vitamix Wet Jar, and the Vitamix Dry Jar

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.400
Blendtec advertises that you can use the same jar and the same blade for both wet and dry blending.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.640
Vitamix recommends using their dry goods jar when grinding grains

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.800
instead of their standard jars.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.900
We're going to find out if there really is a different in texture between these jars.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.380
With Blendtec you'll use your manual keys for grinding

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.060
For this demonstration we're gonna take it to speed 10.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.120
With Vitamix you'll use variable speed 10 high and let it run for 50 seconds.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.880
As you can see, the Vitamix wet jar is grinding the grain.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.640
But if you look closely at the Vitamix special dry goods jar

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.240
the blade is creating an opposite vortex which is pushing the dry goods against the jar

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.680
and circulating it differently.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.580
We'll see which one produces a finer grain.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.060
It looks like all three jars were able to grind the popcorn kernels!

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.380
The texture and fineness are about equal between all three jars.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.800
The bottom line: if you plan to do a lot of grinding with the Vitamix, you should probably purchase a dry goods jar.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.020
But if you only want to grind occasionally

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.700
then you may not want to spend the extra money,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.500
you can use the wet jar!
