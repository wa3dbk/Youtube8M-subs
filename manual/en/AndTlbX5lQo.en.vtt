00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.570
In the wake of the success of a game like
Angry Birds, there will be two camps of imitators

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.790
when it comes to game releases.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.920
One camp will take the game mechanics and
add their own twist on it, and followers of

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.930
the app store knows that when a game hits
it big, we see plenty of these for years to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.960
come.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.590
The second camp takes the presentation or
general theme of a game and uses the similarity

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.349
to its advantage.

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.880
That's what Puzzle Birds does.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.910
It calls you over and says, “Psst, hey buddy.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.719
You like birds in your games do ya?

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.880
Well we got plenty of birds”.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.449
Luckily Smart Studio have taken the bird concept
and created a relaxing and ingenious game

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.300
out of it, that's as far away from slingshots
and kidnapping pigs as it could be.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.589
The goal of the game is to get a bird across
the stage by dictating its flight path, and

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.400
collecting all the balloons along the way
(my guess is laughing at man's attempts to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.679
fly lighten the birds' spirits and give it
the boost it needs to carry on).

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.989
Strewn among these balloons are the ever-present
three stars most games contain these days,

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.950
and the puzzle element is in using the fixed
points of the flight path to move the bird

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.860
around all the obstacles, and hopefully collect
as much as you can once you hit play and it

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.300
starts flapping.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.340
Some of the aforementioned obstacles include
storm clouds, lightning clouds, and clouds

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.570
you have to tap to make dissipate.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.660
Lightning and rain drops are exercises in
timing rather than navigation so it adds a

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.690
little bit of random unfairness to the proceedings.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.890
As the game continues, the levels contain
more fixed points to drag around which creates

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.380
flight paths of more interesting shapes to
fly on, as well as more thinking on what is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.470
the best way to travel through it all.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.251
The music creates a relaxed atmosphere, and
while sometimes the flight paths can be a

00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:46.220
little fiddly (as in moving it a smidge will
be the difference between collecting a balloon

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.360
or missing it), you'll not only enjoy finding
your way through each new stage, but you may

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.490
just find yourself eager to return to earlier
stages to collect the elusive stars therein.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:04.950
Something simple and unique if you've got
some time 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.390
to spare.
