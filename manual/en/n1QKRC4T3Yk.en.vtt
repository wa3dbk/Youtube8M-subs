00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.310
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.490
This is Jakesteramma with BroCo Gaming.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.640
And it’s time for another First Look Legendary
with the Acidic Ack Ack Oz Kit.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.190
Now it’s possible that there are two movie
references with this Oz Kit.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.240
Ack Ack could have something to do with Mars
Attacks, how they speak.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.420
Eh?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.470
Maybe not?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.419
But definitely “I said across her nose not
up it” is a reference to Space Balls.

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.419
“You idiot!

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.720
I said across her nose, not up it!”

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.330
So the O2 capacity and the max slam damage
are pretty decent with this Oz Kit.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.480
The max slam damage adds corrosion.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.350
That’s pretty cool.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.370
Interesting thing about it though is the fire
rate stacking and reload speed stacking when

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.510
you’re shooting an airborne target.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.460
This can definitely come in handy when you’re
shooting some of those flying machines out

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.600
there or when your enemies are jumping around.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600
Pretty cool.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.490
Now first it wasn’t obvious what this spawn
Flak around airborne targets was.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.790
It took me awhile to figure out.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.960
And you can best see this affect with a constant
stream laser gun.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.109
Now I’m going to un-equip this Oz Kit so
you can see what the laser does normally.

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:15.950
You can see pretty normal damage.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.140
Now I’m going to equip the Ack Ack and you
can see here now that when I’m firing it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.890
at this enemy, there are smaller explosions
all around the enemy doing additional damage.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.329
The explosions look exactly like a Flakker
which I’m sure is where the reference comes

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.329
from.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.049
Another cool thing about this Oz Kit is that
you can still spawn Flak when riding in a

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.030
vehicle and shooting at an airborne target.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.909
This is pretty cool and make shooting at things
with a vehicle a lot more effective because

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.090
of the added explosive damage.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.399
Overall, this seems like a decent Ox Kit and
could be useful in particular situations.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.670
So that’s the Acidic Ack Ack.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.189
Thanks for watching everyone!
