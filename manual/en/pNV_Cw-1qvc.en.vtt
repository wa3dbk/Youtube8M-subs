00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Welcome to another Getting Started Video for
AutoCAD Mechanical.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.510
My name’s Matthias and this time I’ll
show you some AutoCAD Mechanical drawing Commands

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.460
by enhancing this drawing…

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.059
…to make it look like this.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.510
In the end we’ll have a top view and a sectional
view of this gland.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.860
You’ll also get used to work with layers
in AutoCAD Mechanical.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.970
Now let’s begin!

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.970
I’ll start with adding a centerline.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.800
I click the command, select the start and
end point… and we have a centerline.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.350
The Command we just used is special to AutoCAD
Mechanical and comes with a big advantage.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.059
Have you noticed the automatically created
centerline layer?

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.420
That’s where AutoCAD Mechanical places all
centerlines.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.079
You don’t have to create or change layers
yourself anymore.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.379
AutoCAD Mechanical does all the Layer Management
for you.

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.649
Now let’s say you want to change the properties
of all centerlines at once or rename the layer

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.670
they’re on.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.270
Then just click the “Mechanical Layer Management”
Button on the ribbon or type “AMLAYER”

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.210
in the command line.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.659
By the way, the letters “A” and “M”
stand for AutoCAD Mechanical.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.290
Now even if you change the name all centerlines
will still be drawn on this layer.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.510
Next I will show you another handy drawing
feature - construction lines.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.450
Drawing becomes a lot easier when you use
some of them.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.520
And in AutoCAD Mechanical there are quite
a few options to choose from.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.229
That means you’re not restricted to the
Commands you might already know from AutoCAD.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.630
Of course you can still use AutoCAD commands
too, as AutoCAD Mechanical is built on top

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.200
of AutoCAD.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.060
But usually AutoCAD Mechanical commands are
a bit more powerful and offer more options

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.510
when it comes to mechanical drawings.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.240
Look what happens when I choose the Automatic
Option.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.620
I want the construction lines to be horizontal,
pointing to the right.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.690
I select my drawing, press Enter and I’m
done.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.360
All construction lines in AutoCAD Mechanical
are also automatically drawn on the same layer.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.120
Now it only takes one click to hide them.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.590
Or display them.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.989
And if I want to delete them later, I just
have to click here.

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.660
With the help of the construction lines it
didn’t take long to create the basic outlines

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.410
of the top view

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.480
Next I ‘m going to add a centerline cross
to the circle.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.790
I select the “centerline cross in holes”
command from the centerline dropdown menu

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.780
and follow the instructions in the command
line.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.040
In no time we’ve created centerlines with
the correct offshoot length from the circle,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.260
according to the standard we’ve chosen for
our drawing.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.830
You don’t have to calculate them yourself
and there’s no need to draw and trim lines

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.620
by hand anymore.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.909
Now have a look at the layer the construction
lines are on.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.459
I didn’t change layers before I created
the centerlines, but thanks to the layer management

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.209
in AutoCAD Mechanical, they are in the right
place.

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.849
Let’s go on and add two 8 Millimeter through
holes.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.770
Rather than drawing circles, we will insert
the holes from the content library.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:33.080
I select the hole type, the view, the insertion
point and the size.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.060
And this is far more than just a circle.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:48.640
For example I can now simply use the “PowerView”
Command to generate the front view.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.819
Finally let’s mirror the hole to the other
side.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:04:04.239
I 
specify the mirror line and we’re done.

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.470
In the next step I’ll draw the inner wall
of the part.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.380
I work with symmetrical lines to do that.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.580
First I select the centerline which defines
the symmetry axis.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.190
Then I draw one half of the wall while the
other one is automatically created.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.930
Next, let’s project the inner wall on the
top view of the part.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.180
I insert two more construction lines

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.270
…and draw the circle

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.690
But wait, the circle must be drawn as a hidden
line.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.650
In AutoCAD Mechanical you don’t have to
change the line type to indicate that it’s

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.650
hidden.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.240
Instead, you create a “Hide Situation”
and choose which objects lie on top.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.400
This feature is very handy, especially when
it comes to more complex parts.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.600
I only applied the hide situation to the top
view, as I’ll now change the front view

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.340
to a sectional view.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.550
And we don’t need hidden lines for that.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.910
I start with drawing a section line.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.130
I select the end points of the section line.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.190
…and label the section view

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.410
Last, I add a hatch.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:29.850
I choose the hatch type and simply click in
the areas where I want to insert it.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.500
And that’s it, we’re done with our drawing.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.050
If you want to learn more about AutoCAD Mechanical,
you can watch another getting started video

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.330
or just play around with the commands for
a bit.
