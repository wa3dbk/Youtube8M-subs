Mark Wallace: Hi everybody, welcome to this
week's episode of Adorama TV, iPad App Reviews.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.470
Well, this week we're looking at Vintage Scene
HD. It's an application that's really, really

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.329
simple but one that I've had more fun playing
with than almost any other iPad app that I've

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.999
seen for photography. It's so easy to use,
and the results are so stunning that I think

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.050
it's crazy for you not to go out and buy it
right now.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.330
Well, let's take a look at Vintage Scene HD.
Vintage Scene HD is an application that is

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.270
just a blast. So, what I'm going to do here
is I'm going to go into my saved photos. And

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.140
I have some pictures that I took in Paris
a couple years ago.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.510
So, I'm going to go in here and open up this
picture here. This is a picture of the exterior

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.610
of the Louvre. And so, as soon as that comes
in, it renders that into a vintage scene.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.940
So, right off the bat this looks like an old
time picture. If I click this button right

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.800
here, you can see that's the original picture,
and this is what it's done to it.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.100
Now, it doesn't just do one preset and you're
done. You can actually go in here to vintage,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.170
and there are actually 16 presets that you
can choose from. So, I can say, you know what?

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.590
I like this one here. This is 07, and it's
going to go in here and render this and change

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.580
it and make it look like something else. So,
that looks pretty cool, and I can do all kinds

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.310
of stuff.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.889
The adjust feature allows me to go in here,
and I can tweak four different settings, the

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:31.899
image age. I can change the fadeout which
is how the effect fades out, the image strength,

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.600
how much the image...the opacity basically
of that, and then the outline strength. So,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.259
unfortunately, there's no real time preview
of this. You have to do this in the OK, and

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.759
then it'll go in here and adjust your settings.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.920
So, once it's done, you see that my image
has changed a little bit. I can change the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.490
overlay. So, there are a bunch of different
overlays here, so I can go in say, you know

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.899
what? I sort of like this crackly paper look
right here, and it's going to overlay this

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.429
with this crackly paper look. And in a second,
there it is. It pops up.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.799
So, I've got this really, really cool vintage
scene. Then, I can take this. I can save it,

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.180
either as a preset which is really cool. If
there's something that I've done, and if I

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.690
don't remember how to do it every time, you
just save it as a preset and it'll put it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.780
in that vintage folder there. I can email
it to people. I can save it to my camera roll.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.020
Then, of course, there's all kinds of settings
here that you can adjust. And it's basically

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.040
the image size that you're using.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.820
So, let me do one more here just so you can
get a taste of how powerful this thing is

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.190
and how much fun it is to play with. So, here
is a photo of Notre Dame that is, again, in

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.480
Paris. And so, I just load it in, and I can't
wait to see it. There it is. There's the back.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.800
There's the spires. Let's go back in here.
I really want to do vintage 01, and so I can

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.300
see what that looks like. Sure enough, it's
going to pop up and look really, really cool

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.720
and crackly. I really like that.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.660
So, this is an application that I really love
to play with. I love to see what kind of effects

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.760
I can get out of my images. And since you
can save these in really high resolution,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.240
they're really fun to send to friends and
family.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.610
Well, that's Vintage Scene HD. As you can
see, it's a lot of fun. It's really cool to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.680
take some images that you shot and make them
really old. And because there's so many presets,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.180
you just can't go wrong. So, check out Vintage
Scene HD. I highly recommend it.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.850
