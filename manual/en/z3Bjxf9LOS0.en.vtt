00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.260
Hey guys!

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.100
I had so much fun last month doing a themed
favorites video,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.320
that I'm going to do it again this month,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.559
and this month's theme is Pokémon!

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:09.619
[cheers]

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.960
This was my very first Pokémon game.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960
It is Pokémon Blue for Gameboy.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.700
And I played this game like my life depended
on it.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.439
I love Pokémon, and if you also love Pokémon,

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.379
this video is for you!

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.300
April favorites! Let's go!

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.800
Pika Pikachu!

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.680
I'm going to do things a little differently
this month.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.050
Instead of just talking about one shop per
category,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.830
I'm going to show you all of the cool Pokémon
stuff that I have,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.030
and then I'm going to tell you where I got
it.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.730
So that way we can cover way more Pokémon
stuff.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.270
I have talked about some of these shops before,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.300
um, in like earlier favorites videos,

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.649
but I just cannot make a Pokémon favorites
video

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.120
without talking about them again.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.700
So we might have some repeats.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.320
Sorry 'bout it.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.200
I'm going to start off by showing you all
of my Pokémon clothes.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.399
This shirt, for example, is

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.819
from Living Dead Clothing.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.240
It's a Pokémon Badges Crop Top.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.410
I have been wearing it like constantly since
I got it.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.330
I wore it in my New York vlog.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
I love the way it fits. It's awesome. I love
it.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.990
And Living Dead also has these Pokétime-

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.750
which is Pokémon/Adventure Time-

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.870
leggings. I love these. I think they're adorable.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.970
This shirt is a TeeFury shirt,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.190
which if you don't know what that site is,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.600
they basically put out a new shirt design
like

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.670
I think it's every day

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.820
and they're only available for like 24 hours.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.530
And then after that, it's gone.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.240
That was the case with this shirt which is...

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.000
a bummer.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.580
Because it's so cute.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.320
And it's basically a Pokéball shape

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.640
made out of the silhouettes of a bunch of
different Pokémon.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.680
Genius.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.940
I am sure you can find these online still
though,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.560
like you could see if you could find it. I don't
know.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.420
It exists. I have it. It's awesome. I love
it.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.000
Okay, so, I just went to go check and see
how long the TeeFury shirts last for.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.510
It is 24 hours but while I was there, I saw
their shirt for today

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.700
and it's so cute. Um...

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.000
So I just bought another shirt.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.840
This is my Charmander Crop Top that I wore
in my Charmander Makeup Tutorial.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.240
And it is from an Etsy shop called Kel'z Boutique.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.160
It's just a black crop top with Charmander
on it.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.290
What's not to like?

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.420
This shirt is a Kanto Official Gym Leader
t-shirt.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.520
Super cute. It's like in the style of like
a gym shirt.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.780
A gym as in like a school gym, not like a
Pokémon gym.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.300
Although, also a Pokémon gym I guess.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.830
I don't know if this kigu falls into the category
of clothes,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.490
but I do know that it is one of my favorite
things to wear on my body.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.750
This is another thing you can see in my Charmander
Makeup Tutorial.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.880
This is from Kawaii-Kigu.com.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.020
It's seriously the most comfortable thing,
uhhh...

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.880
probably on this planet. I think so. Definitely.
Yeah.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.140
On the planet.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.000
And it's Charmander!

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.820
These are my Pokémon shoes.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.160
These are more for fashion and these are more
for cosplay.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.170
These shoes are probably my favorite pair
of shoes that I own

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.280
and that is saying something because I am
a huge shoe junkie

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.350
and I have like way too many pairs of shoes.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.460
I love these shoes.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.819
They are Charmander evolution shoes

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.699
and you can see on this side, there's Charmander.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.400
And then on the inside of both of them is
Charmeleon.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.200
And then on the outside of this one is Charizard.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.480
And just how cool are these? They are so cool.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.160
They were hand painted by Catherine LaPointe.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.270
She has an Etsy shop. She does custom hand
painted shoes,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.430
so if you have a different Pokémon that you
like better,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.390
or if you want something that's not even related
to Pokémon at all,

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.000
she can paint anything that you want and make
it look freaking amazing.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.560
I wear them all the time and they've held
up really, really well.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.209
Uh, I mean, they're kinda dirty just from
wearing them,

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.540
but the paint has stayed on there throughout
all of my shenanigans so far.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.720
So definitely check out her shop and get yourself
some custom shoes.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.160
These are so cool and so worth it.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.560
These shoes are for my Misty cosplay.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.729
And the quality of them is kind of like-

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.940
you wouldn't want to wear these like out in
life all the time.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.110
Like, they're not like an every day pair of
shoes.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.590
But the reason I got them is because they
are perfect Misty cosplay shoes.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.650
They are exactly like what hers look like.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.180
So if you're looking for a way to stand out
from the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.390
bazillions of other Misty cosplayers, these
are perfect.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.960
These are my favorite Pokémon wigs.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.620
And I guess I should say that these aren't
like technically Pokémon wigs,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.760
but they are my favorite wigs for Pokémon
cosplay and Pokémon themed outfits.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.260
So, this is the Triflect Collection from RockStar
Wigs.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.400
This is Screaming Crimson and this is Purple
Possession.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.840
And Screaming Crimson is perfect for any fire
type

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.000
because it has, um, these layers of like red,
orange, and yellow,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.280
and it looks just like a fire.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.500
So if you wanted to do a themed outfit or
cosplay of...

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.820
any fire type.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.000
Like Charmander, Ponyta, Flareon, um...

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.300
Tepig, DARMANITAN!

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.240
This is the wig you want.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.000
This purple one would be good for like Espeon,
or any um, purple Pokémon--

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.780
oooh, what if you did Gastly. That'd be cool.
Hmm...

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.320
Or like Ditto?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.720
I would love to do an outfit around like one
of the ones that people don't do as often.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.680
That'd be fun. Maybe I will.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.480
Maybe.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.480
And my friend Pixie has the pink one of these
and she did a Sylveon cosplay in that one.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.180
And they also have like a green and blue one
which would be good for any water type.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.640
So I just love the Triflect collection for
Pokémon stuff because

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.460
the colors are bright and awesome and it just
translates

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.210
really well into the Pokémon world.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.340
So these are all of my Pokémon accessories.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.580
I know I have featured Kawaii Blaby like multiple
times,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.860
but when it comes to Pokémon hair bows,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.620
she is the best.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.080
So you can see I have a Pikachu one here,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.360
Uhh.. Charmander.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.100
A Magikarp one with a little crown on it,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.300
and Sylveon.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.960
Oh! And a Pokéball.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.470
And I will link the video where I go into
more detail about Kawaii Blaby

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.110
because seriously, check out that shop if
you haven't.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.670
It's fantastic.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.010
So I also have these little buttons or pins,
whatever you want to call them.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.250
I call them buttons.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.100
And they're so cute. They're like the little
faces of the starter Pokémon

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.300
uh, from whatever generation you want.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.580
They come in packs so you can kinda pick whichever
one.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.199
So I have the first generation ones.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.999
Charmander, of course.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.960
Uh, Squirtle

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.420
and Bulbasaur.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.240
And also, um, there's a Pikachu included in
that one too.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.680
And then I also have Gen 5, which I know from
playing Pokémon Black,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.640
which is Snivy, Oshawott, and Tepig.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.479
Fun fact: I play with Oshawott in Pokémon
Black because he is so cute!

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:40.059
OSHA!

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.700
They're super cheap and they're a great way
to take something plain

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.430
and make it something Pokémon.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.740
So as far as necklaces go,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.080
I have these two Pokéball necklaces

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.900
and I'm actually not sure where I got either
one of them from,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.180
but Pokéball-anything is super easy to find
on the internet.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.580
Um, if you just type it in to eBay or Amazon
or Etsy or Storenvy, or any like, shopping site,

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.080
there will be tons of necklaces that you can
find

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.580
and you can pick out which one you like best.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.260
Same with the Pokéball hair bows.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.259
It's just a really design, so a lot of people
make 'em.

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:17.210
And I have also featured this shop before
too because it's so adorable

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.259
and just great quality.

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.090
This gym badge headband is from Little Kumi
Crafts.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.930
This shop is so cute and creative! I love
it!

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.660
So I will link the video that I talk about
this shop in as well.

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:31.940
Little Kumi Crafts. This is adorable. I love
it!

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.720
And while we're here, this isn't really uh,
an accessory.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.380
Let's call it...

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.340
....favorite....

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.060
home decor...

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.360
yeah. Home decor.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.920
This is my Pikachu piggy bank. I got this
at Target.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.560
It was like $10 or something

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.900
and it's a pretty decent size Pikachu.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.200
I got mine at the store but I'm pretty sure
you can order them online.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.360
I'll put a link in the description if so.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.340
And yeah! That's it!

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.760
So that's it for my April Favorites/Pokémon
Favorites!

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.440
I hope you guys saw something that you liked

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.700
and if you did, give this video a thumbs up.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.940
Subscribe to my channel.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.700
Follow me on social media.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.500
Until next time, I'll see you guys later.
I love you very, very much!

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.060
Bye!

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.800
