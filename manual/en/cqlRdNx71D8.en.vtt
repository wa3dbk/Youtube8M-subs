Hey everybody!  This is Randy Santel, "Atlas" with FoodChallenges.com

00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:34.233
Today I'm going to be eating my favorite food!

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.920
We're going to be talking about how to win a barbecue challenge!

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.560
Barbecue challenges, kind of like steak challenges are usually full of meats.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.680
Typically ribs, porksteak, chicken, brisket - all types of meats!

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.233
and then there are usually sides.  For this one we're taking on their 4 lb porksteak challenge.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.940
We have a whole 4 lb porksteak!  We also have potato salad and onion rings.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.048
For this food challenge the sides aren't an option.

00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:15.420
For this food challenge we're going to do the pork steak first, then the potato salad, and finish 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.298
with the onion rings.  With every food challenge you've to consider the time limit.

00:01:20.298 --> 00:01:22.520
We have 45 minutes for this food challenge.

00:01:34.973 --> 00:01:40.333
Ready to get this going!  I have my timer ready and the restaurant has their timer.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:45.694
We have 45 minutes.  Like a steak challenge, I'm going to start cutting this up into tiny pieces

00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:55.323
to save on my jaw.  With chicken, brisket, ribs, etc. you want small bites to save on your jaw

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:58.267
so you can focus more on swallowing.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.500
One, two, three!  Alright we have our sharp knife too!

00:02:20.246 --> 00:02:26.486
They reassured me this pork steak is very tender and I'm from St. Louis - pork steak is a very St.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.440
Louis food, and I'm very pumped to get this down!

00:03:00.734 --> 00:03:06.094
We're over three pounds in. Now I'm going to switch it up like any food challenge.

00:03:06.094 --> 00:03:10.160
Now I have my non-carbonated drink, which I always choose lemonade.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.879
You can use whatever you want. 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.460
11:45 - we're done with our pork steak.  Mentally that's a good thing!  Now we just have these

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.140
onion rings and potato salad.  We're going to do the onion rings last.

00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:17.553
What we have left is this small pile of onion rings. 

00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:22.046
To help my mind I'm going to spread them out, rather than thinking I have all these left

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.060
in this huge pile, separate them out so you'll be able to eat a few at a time.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.453
As you eat, you'll know that there are only a few left.

00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:36.293
We're only 16 minutes in.  Plenty of time!  Lets get these down!

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.300
We're getting to the end of the food challenge, so get rid of the lemonade and switch

00:04:45.254 --> 00:04:47.094
to the soda.  Lets finish it.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.500
Very good barbecue challenge!  That was delicious!

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:43.574
I'm from St. Louis and pork steak is a very St. Louis

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.420
I've had a lot of pork steaks in my day, but that was very good!

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.414
Thank you to Beerhouse for sponsoring this food challenge in Riverside Casino!
