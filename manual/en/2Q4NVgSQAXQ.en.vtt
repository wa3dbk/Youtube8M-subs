00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.959
the next question will be answered in 20
seconds by our host

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.050
Marko Rubel a self-made millionaire
who bought and sold over 300 properties he

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.009
is one of the foremost experts in
front of the national real estate

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.219
investors Association representing

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.359
forty thousand investors nationwide he's
listed in prestigious who is who

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.060
and well known in the business world
here is the next question from our

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.769
listener

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.250
jay's asking this is really a question

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.450
when going into a new market where a person
hasn't worked

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.879
before what do you suggest is the best way 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.309
to determine what area of the city you would
want to market to

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.850
you know if it's a metro area over a million
people

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.100
you obviously can't work the whole the whole area

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.970
so what's the best way to find the right area

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.070
that you would do your marketing in okay so the
question is basically

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.199
how do you decide on a geographical area

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.500
of interest right we go back to to

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.600
you know to to the beginning

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.509
to first of all 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.539
we have to be a plus minus fifty percent
of the medium

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.830
medium price range so you know in a host

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.130
town and you not talking about the
neighborhoods right you're talking about a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.820
whole

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.039
you know whole town if you enter in the
town where you have

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.270
you know in areas where you have million
million million dollar homes

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.470
and then you have areas most of the
areas around 300,000 right so you determine

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.060
okay so the medium is around 250 300
right

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.560
now you're gonna be in those neighborhoods
where you have medium plus minus fifty

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.420
percent right so that's the geographical
area

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.399
uh now how do you decide maybe maybe you
know maybe million people population

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.950
maybe

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.360
a lot you know a big part of the city
fits that criteria

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.759
then you go further by looking at
what's also most convenient for you

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.149
what's closest to your office so it's
not too far to drive there right

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.659
so I usually like to be 30 minutes in drive
difference from my office

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.100
but obviously I know in some cases
especially I think with Jay

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.000
that's not possible right so so then
you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.440
you find something that's closer to you
then obviously quality of the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.130
housing

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.590
uh you know most people like nice
neighborhoods

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.040
middle-class you know nice-looking

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.450
safe neighborhoods so you drive around and
you'll see and you determine you know what

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.269
where the people want to live right some
good signs are

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.000
when the Starbucks is opening or Home
Depot is opening then you know they

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.150
did the market research

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.050
when a company is opening now
knowledge of the local market

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.790
particulars like for example

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.310
if you know that the boeing is coming and
opening a plant of

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.959
you know hiring couple thousand people
hey you wanna be closer to that

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.930
so helps to get some news because if
some companies coming in town

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.140
and they're building the plant and 
they're going to employ a lot of people

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.409
then you know that those people will wanna
live closer to their employment

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.379
so at that point obviously you're better off
targeting the the neighborhoods closer

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.900
to that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.720
so that would be also now couple other
indicators are

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.430
how high is the foreclosure rate you'll be
able to notice that because when you

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.180
drive around

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.280
if there's a lot of abandoned houses and
there's a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.620
you know it doesn't really looks
overgrown doesn't look nice you know

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.879
that's not really the neighborhood you
wanna be in unless you are in

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.310
fixer-upper business which

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.290
all of you are not because you know
there's a better way of doing this

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.870
in our way so you not fixing up houses
and that case

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.670
you know niche to wealth business you do not
want to be in the in the overgrown vacant

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.629
abandoned houses and all that

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.690
because it's going to be harder to sell so

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.700
you know we don't wanna be in those
neighborhoods because with our strategies 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.730
we don't need a desperate seller so so
you know we need motivated  

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.930
seller but not desperate so

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.549
you know you really don't need to go
into those kind of war zones and

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.530
abandoned houses and all that right 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.849
so that would be I think mike I don't know
if I forgot anything what else you

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.430
think will help Jay 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.209
to mention no I think you pretty much targeted it

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.519
I mean if you're in the area you want to be 
want to be within

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.310
you know thirty-mile area or so of where
you're at

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.769
and you know you want to be

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.239
you also want to be in a white collar area
where the majority of the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.760
buyers are you don't want to be in a higher end

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.760
blue collar you know type neighborhood

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.820
you know we'd like to be where eighty percent of the buyers

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.150
are in that medium price you know range of plus or minus 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.200
fifty percent so you pretty much hit the nail on the head 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.840
you know get a realtor you know

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.349
get some access there find out days on market 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.010
you know how many days on market for different areas you know where properties are moving fast 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.120
or not moving yep that's a good point yeah

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.169
you know but you wanna be I mean you 
know you wanna be where you see people

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.890
want to live you know want to live

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.990
and you know it's if if it's a it's a
middle-class

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.210
the nice neighborhoods then you know
people people have good jobs and they

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.490
can put bigger down payments

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.260
so you can get a better down payment and
all that so and you get nicer houses

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.210
and you get potential of appreciation a lot
better so it all make sense
