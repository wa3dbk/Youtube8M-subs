00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.390
For offsides play, we're going to use Heather
here. She's going to be defending this goal.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.840
For an offside play--say my team is coming
this way and I'm attacking on this goal, if

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.770
I receive the ball here, I'm still in good
position because the defender is still in

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.910
front of me, so she still has a chance to
cut me off and stop the play. But if I were

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.510
over here and I have a teammate passing me
the ball, and she's standing right where she

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.990
is, the play will automatically not count
because I have already beat the defender.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:39.379
That would be an offsides. I would be offsides.
Another play is called the last man play.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.909
The goalie--I'm playing the goalie in this
case--and Heather's going to be attacking

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:53.269
on my goal. So, if she's already beat my defender,
and I come out--move forward--I come out and

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.710
I commit a foul against her--say that I come
out and I knock her down or I kick, the ball's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.801
automatically placed in a penalty position--it
can vary from a yellow card to a red card.

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:07.840
A red card means I'll be thrown out of the
game, and my team will be forced to play with

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.760
ten players and they're going to have to substitute.
One of the players that's on the field will

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.119
play goal. When you have the penalty kick--say
the penalty kick is going to be called against

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.390
your team--the penalty kick is taking eleven
steps away from your goal, so you start off

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:41.270
probably right here, you start out here, one,
and pretty much the ball will be placed here.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.039
I mean it's pretty much an easy shot. All
you've got to do is get it in now. When you're

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.479
taking a penalty kick, it's best to kick it
hard to wherever you're going to kick it.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.079
Just pick a spot, whether it's going to be
low or high, and just kick it there. Chances

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.520
are if you're fast enough the goalie won't
get it. He won't have time to react, so you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.999
can also kick close.
