Hello. Knots are used a lot in jewelry.
You can use them for finishing

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.100
techniques or you can use them as a design
element.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
For our purposes today we're going to be
using satin cord, but you can use knots

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.150
on any thread that you're using. We
have Nymo thread, we have FireLine,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.150
leather cord,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.390
and satin cord,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.230
So the first knot I'm going to
demonstrate today is a simple over hand

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.410
knot

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.960
and that is the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.250
kind most commonly used
pretzel looking knot.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.510
It ends up looking

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.070
like this.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.690
The next knot

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.320
that I'm going to do

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.160
is called the surgeons knot and
it is like an overhand knot,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.280
so we're going to do that again and
that is typically used at the end of

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.610
your thread.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.030
Instead of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.170
coming all the way down,
what I'm going to do is

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.640
go through

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.510
the loop again

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.400
and then I'm going to
move my knot to the end

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.070
of the thread

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.450
to finish it off.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.190
That's a surgeon's knot.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.990
Now I'm going to show you a larks head knot

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.619
and a larks head knot is typically
used to capture a doughnut like this.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.950
What you want to do
is take your thread

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.090
like this,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.580
fold in half

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.560
and we're going to take the
middle point of the thread,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.140
pick up the doughnut and go
through the middle of it.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.060
We're going to bring it on to the
other side where you take your two

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.950
coils of cord

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.180
and move it on through.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.940
Position it so that
it's nice and neat.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.020
Like so.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.159
I'm going to use the same cord

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.670
to show you at half hitch

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.140
and that is the beginning to the
adjustable knot that I will show you next.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.690
so we're going to keep one cord
stationary, then we're going to use

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.450
the other side of the
cord to go around it

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.310
and we're going to do an overhand knot.
The overhand knot is going to

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.429
close

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:16.179
over

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.029
the stationary cord,

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:22.319
so you see what it does in
effect, is slide up and down.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.739
Like so.

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.290
For the last knot, I'll be showing you how
to make a really nice adjustable knot.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.019
You can use this instead
of a clasp on your cord.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.079
You want to start out

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:36.749
by making

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.779
and overhand knot at
the end of your cord

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.139
and this will secure it.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.029
Just like that.

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:49.649
You want to make that knot
on both of your cords,

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:51.319
like this.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.839
Now

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.400
what we're going to be doing is

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.489
we're going to be going around

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.619
the stationary cord
like we did before,

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:01.849
with

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.359
an overhand knot.

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:05.589
now we're going to

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:09.669
give it an extra little twist, like in the
surgeons knot,

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.719
just like that.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.119
Then you bring the cord
all the way to the end

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.139
You see it slides up
and down the cord.

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.269
I'm going to do the same thing on the
other side. This is now my stationary

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.089
cord and this one

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.179
is the one that's going
to be going around.

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:30.219
So again, an overhand knot

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.049
and then

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.079
turn it into a surgeons knot

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:36.999
and

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.209
move it down to the end.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:40.959
Now

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.429
you have an adjustable knot.

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.599
See, this is great because you could
just to pull it like this

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.619
put it over your head and close it to
the desired length.

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:56.519
Here we have a necklace that
incorporates an overhand knot as a great

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.889
design element.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.219
It's used because it looks nice and
also at the same time it captures a

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:08.219
jump ring and a little tassel
and holds them in place.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.089
This blue statin

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.839
necklace

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:13.569
is now using the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.750
the knots as a really fancy kind of
design element and also in the back it

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.409
has an adjustable knot.

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.949
This makes a

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.909
really great closure.

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.649
Thank you for joining us at the Fire
Mountain Gems and Beads studio.

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:30.680
My name is Arbel, and

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.349
happy knotting.
