00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.910
One of the best perennial plants for the late
Summer cutting and display gardens is the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.750
Japanese Anemone.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.399
This lovely plant is blooming now in late
August and will continue blooming well into

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.560
September, for three to four weeks.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.760
It's a member of the ranunculus family, the
buttercup family and it is also closely related

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.750
to windflowers.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.070
This particular species is a hybrid.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.239
The parent plant is Anemone hupehensis, this
white variety.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:56.070
This is Catherine Joubert it is a named variety.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.170
Both native to Japan and eastern China.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.920
They are a perennial plant, they come back
from the roots every year.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.409
In fact, if they are happy and they like their
location, they will begin to colonize the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.870
area by spreading their roots and also by
sending out seed.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.180
They prefer a well-drained but very rich soil.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.670
They love semi-shade.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.830
The shade of the afternoon is very important
to them.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.210
You don't want to expose them to too much
sunlight.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.579
Other than that, they are very, very low care
maintenance perennials.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.170
Their bloom time, again, is from mid-August
well into September, sometimes four weeks

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.170
long.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.469
Japanese anemones make a very, very good cut
flower, but you want to cut them early in

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.950
the morning when it is cool.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.399
You want to cut them in bud.

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.680
This is a good example of the bud of an anemone,
that is the target for when you are cutting

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.370
flowers.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.289
After you cut this and take it into the warmth,
it will open up and last for several days

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.289
in the vase, and what a gorgeous color.
