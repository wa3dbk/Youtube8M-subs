00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.009
The Bluetooth System Preference is where you
configure Bluetooth devices.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.059
If no Bluetooth devices appear in the System
Preference when you launch it, you will see

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:30.230
a Setup New Device button.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.870
Click this and the Bluetooth Setup Assistant
launches.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.000
This is an application that lives in the core
services folder inside the System folder.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.649
Bluetooth Setup Assistant does exactly what
it says.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.100
It walks you through the process of setting
up a Bluetooth device such as a phone, mouse,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.129
printer or keyboard.

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.650
So we click Continue.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.969
You also have the option to pair a headset
or any Bluetooth device.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.039
So, if your Bluetooth device doesn't fall
into one of these categories, choose Any Device

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.200
and Continue from there.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.820
We are going to set up a mobile phone.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.750
We select that option and click Continue.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.250
At this point, my Mac is going to go out and
look for a mobile phone, and look, it just

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.100
found one,
it found my old Sony Ericsson T616 phone and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.330
we are going to pair with it now.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.940
So I simply select it and click Continue.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.560
Now, let's gather some information.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.860
I click Continue again and it's sending a
passcode to the phone so that I can pair with

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.860
it.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.860
So I have the phone in my hand.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.080
I enter that passcode and once again Bluetooth
Setup Assistant will do a little more configuration

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.880
and then I will be good to go.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.240
Now, once you have entered that pairing code
and it's been accepted, other options appear

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.560
including the option
to set up iSync to transfer context and events.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.790
Of course, this happens only with phones and
personal information devices such as a Palm.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.700
The other option is to access the Internet
with your phone's data connection.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.939
If you have this kind of plan, you can certainly
leave this enabled and click Continue and

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.119
then a Window will pop up
and offer you settings for configuring those

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.119
things.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.259
I am not going to do that on this go-around.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.820
Instead, I am going to leave the iSync option
checked so you can see what it looks like

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.360
when iSync pops up.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.360
I click Continue and iSync launches and it
shows my phone.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.950
I can click on that phone and then my synching
options appear below.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.970
We are going to discuss iSync in more detail
elsewhere in the title, so I will close this

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.640
for now.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.070
And congratulations, I am ready to go.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:39.030
All I have to do at this point is choose Quit,
and here is my Bluetooth device.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.440
At this point, I can click Advanced to have
other options.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.120
So for example, if I paired a Bluetooth keyboard
or mouse and it doesn't show up and my Mac

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.989
expects it to be there,
what will happen is the Bluetooth Setup Assistant

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.120
will appear when it doesn't see it.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.690
At that point, I can find out why my device
is not working for example maybe the battery

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.690
ran out.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.690
I can put new batteries in it.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.710
I can set it up again.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.630
It will be ready to go.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.440
If I am using a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse
that is paired, this option will become available

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.870
to me
and that option is Allow Bluetooth Devices

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.310
to Wake This Computer.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.079
So, if my keyboard or mouse is paired with
my computer and the computers goes to sleep,

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.281
all I have to do is press the key on the keyboard
or click a button on the mouse and the computer

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:24.760
will wake up.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.549
You also have the option to prompt for all
incoming audio requests.

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.880
So if you have an audio device that's Bluetooth
compatible and it wants to communicate with

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.650
your Mac,
it will send a little request saying "please,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.560
let me use you," and you say "okay, that's
fine, go ahead."

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.860
And the last one is Share My Internet Connections
with Other Bluetooth Devices.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.220
So, if you have Bluetooth Sharing Setup in
Sharing System Preferences,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.139
other Bluetooth devices can't share your Mac's
Internet connection and connect to the Internet

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.280
that way.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.090
At the very end, you will see these serial
ports that devices use to connect to this

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.090
computer.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.570
Mostly, you are going to use this option if
you are setting up a Palm device.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.560
When you set up that Palm device and go through
the configuration, it will ask you what serial

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.930
port it's using
and this is the information you want to look

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.380
for when you find
that you select that and you are going to

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.810
be good to go.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.310
And we click OK to get out of there, and that
is how we set up a Bluetooth device using

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:31.289
the Bluetooth System Preference.
