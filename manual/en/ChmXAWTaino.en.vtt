Welcome to the Crafty Ninja brought to you by accessorygeeks.com. 

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:09.892
I’m your host Maxine. 

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:16.674
I wanna know did you had a dream job growing up as a child join to be the next astronaut to walk on the moon 

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:17.622
maybe a president.

00:00:17.624 --> 00:00:22.511
How about a lion tamer? Transformers perhaps so pretty sure they have schools for that in Japan now. 

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:27.646
No? how about batman?  getting work? Still don’t? 

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:30.517
ok as a kid I want to be a super hero.  

00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:34.542
But I don’t really how is this go forward to go around kicking bad guys butt

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:39.613
But I’ll figure the next best thing is to go work for mega corporation and sponsor super heros…..

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:45.571
Well Wayne enterprises and stark  industries are taking applications right now

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:51.555
so I figure why not scope around and see what I’m missing out on?.   

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:53.686
That’s why today we’ll be making  this bad boys. 

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:59.523
That’s right.. that’s a Wayne Enterprises  visitor pass, And may be a visitor pass just isn’t gonna do it for you

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:04.336
Maybe you want to do, maybe a press pass from the daily planet

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:09.579
Or how about security, I know you interested getting in to the restricted area like the R&amp;D department. 

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:14.510
That’s why we here at accessorrygeeks contacted to the couple of notorious folks to do our dirty works for us. 

00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:18.511
Thanks to Edward Nigma, and unknown source at Hammer industries 

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:26.512
we’re able to procure passes for the press, visitor and security personal for both Wayne Enterprises and stark industries 

00:01:26.515 --> 00:01:31.485
Pretty cool right..  now kids we don’t recommend hiring villains to do dirty work for you  

00:01:31.488 --> 00:01:33.587
Frankly you shouldn’t support them but, we were desperate. 

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:38.589
Now the documents that our source at  hammer industry and Edward Nigma were able to dig up

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.586
Those were just the buildings block and how to make a clearance badge..

00:01:40.587 --> 00:01:45.879
to walk around undetected your going to need  a few more materials, and this is what you’ll be needing.  

00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:06.079
Now technically you could just print this out on card stock..  

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:11.579
But we don’t to be responsible when you break a collar bone after security tackles you on the restricted area 

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:15.579
Instead we’re gonna show you how you can MacGyver your own  clearance badge.. 

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:16.879
So you can walk around undetected. 

00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:22.079
Hooky dooky it’s time whip out that spray paint we like semi- gloss white spray paint   

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:27.679
Just because it tends to maintain the plastic look and feel that the gift card already has.  

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:32.579
We just need to make it all white and so that your clearance badges looks pretty legit

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:39.579
So go ahead and start spraying your gift card, you can do this outside or in area that well ventilated. 

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:44.079
We don’t want you inhaling too many fumes as you do this. 

00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:50.541
While your card is drying you can go ahead and print out your clearance badges using the decal paper

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:54.592
Make sure that you follow instruction that the decal paper come with

00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:57.392
so you know which side of the decal paper you’ll be printing on. 

00:02:57.398 --> 00:03:03.574
Once it’s printed out you can cut out the badge that you would like to apply to your gift card.   

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:08.522
So if you want channel your inner clark kent and work the press angel you can do that

00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:10.911
Or if you want to do security you can do that to. 

00:03:11.018 --> 00:03:13.346
So go ahead and cut it out.  

00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:15.517
Snippy, snippy, snippy.. 

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:21.517
And your clearance badge its been cut out you’re gonna  go ahead and unpeel the back from the decal. 

00:03:21.518 --> 00:03:28.542
Once it’s been removed we’re going to add here the decal to the white gift card

00:03:28.548 --> 00:03:33.513
we’ll use the decal backing as a means to apply the decal

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:40.571
it prevents smudges and fingerprints so go ahead and squeeze that down just really get it on there 

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:46.574
And this is your stark industries security badge

00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:51.522
So you can start sneaking around and selling off their ideas to hammer industries 

00:03:51.525 --> 00:03:53.511
no kidding don’t do that!. 

00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:55.546
Alright you should be all set to go.. 

00:03:55.548 --> 00:03:57.517
You should have something a little bit like these..

00:03:57.518 --> 00:04:02.517
If you want to top it off with a layer  you’re welcome to do so it makes it look just a little bit more professional 

00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:05.542
And you know that never hurts when you’re sneaking around in a restricted compound.. 

00:04:05.548 --> 00:04:10.513
