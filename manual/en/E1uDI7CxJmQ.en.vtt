00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.470
OLGA RECENTLY HAD THE TIME OF HER LIFE AS
PART OF BROADWAY BALANCES AMERICA.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.880
OUR SERIES THAT TAKES YOU BEHIND THE SCENES
OF SOME OF THE MOST BELOVED MUSICALS AS THEY

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.900
TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTY AND ON TO A BIG STAGE
NEAR YOU.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.070
TIME FOR SOME DIRTY DANCING FOLKS.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.750
I HAD THE CHANCE TO DANCE WITH THE STAR OF
THE UPCOMING TOURING PRODUCTION OF DIRTY DANCING.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.460
(MUSIC)
IT'S A CLASSIC STORY NOW ON STAGE.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.540
(MUSIC)
A MOVIE THAT FIRST CAPTIVATED US IN 1987.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.380
(MUSIC)
NOW THE STAGED MUSICAL OF THE SMASH HIT.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.149
(MUSIC)
DIRTY DANCING IS AN UNPRECEDENTED LIVE EXPERIENCE

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.270
EXPLODING WITH HEART POUNDING MUSIC, PASSIONATE
ROMANCE, AND SENSATIONAL DANCING.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.149
ALL OF THE SONGS THAT WERE IN THE MOVIE ARE
DEFINITELY ON STAGE BUT ALSO ALL THE SONGS

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.450
THAT I COULDN'T FORGET FOR THE MOVIE ARE THERE.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.149
SO THE SONGS THAT I ORIGINALLY WANTED FOR
THE MOVIE AND COULDN'T GET, I HAVE ROOM IN

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.149
TIME TO HERE.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.680
SO, THAT'S A REAL PLEASURE.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.639
YOU GET EVERYTHING THAT YOU KNEW AND LOVED
IN THE MOVIE IS ON THE STAGE ON IT IS PRESENT

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:14.259
AND HAPPENING BEFORE YOU EYES.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.270
(MUSIC)
YES, ALL EYES ARE ON THIS INCREDIBLE PRODUCTION

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.099
FROM THE STORY TO THE BELOVED SONGS AND OF
COURSE ELECTRIFYING CHOREOGRAPHY.

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.710
IT'S BEEN, IT'S AN AMAZING KIND OF JOURNEY.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.649
IT STARTED WAY BACK IN 2001 WHEN THEY DID
THE WORKSHOP PRODUCTION IN NEW YORK.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.130
AND THEN THE FIRST PRODUCTION WAS IN AUSTRALIA
IN 2004.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.169
WHICH I WAS THE DANCE CAPTAIN FOR. AND THEN
SINCE THEN, WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN GERMANY,

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.460
IN HOLLAND, IN TORONTO.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.520
AND NOW, DIRTY DANCING THE MUSICAL.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.279
THE ICONIC LOVE STORY BETWEEN 17 YEAR OLD
FRANCIS "BABY" HOUSEMAN AND JOHNNY CASTLE,

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:58.490
THE SEXY DANCE INSTRUCTOR IS TOURING THE NATION
AND COMING TO A STAGE NEAR YOU.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.329
SAM, YOUR STEPPING INTO A MAJOY ROLE.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.159
I MEAN, THIS IS AN ICONIC ROLE.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.499
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU?

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.499
UH!

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:06.499
I TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT TOO MUCH.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.820
I THINK I JUST HAVE TO ENJOY MY TIME IN THIS
SPACE, IN THIS ROLE.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.319
AND TRY AND BRING EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.239
(MUSIC)
AND OF COURSE THE MOMENT THAT EVERYONE WAITS

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.239
FOR.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:25.880
(MUSIC) (SINGING) I HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE--
THAT ICONIC DANCE BETWEEN BABY AND JOHN.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.740
(MUSIC) AND I NEVER FELT THIS WAY BEFORE,
AND I SWEAR --

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.439
THERE'S THAT MOMENT WHERE YOUR HEART IS POUNDING
AND YOU'RE EXCITED AND THE TINGLING INSIDE.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.569
AND WHEN YOU GET TO WALK UP TO BABY AND LOOK
AT HER IN HER EYES AND WHEN YOU TAKE THAT

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.690
HAND AND YOU RUN IT DOWN AND YOU FEEL THIS
CONNECTION AND THIS LOVE AND THIS BOND THAT

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.690
YOU HAVE.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.079
IT'S QUITE INCREDIBLE.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.420
(MUSIC)
AND I TOO, GOT TO EXPERIENCE THIS MAGIC FOR

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.420
MYSELF.

WITH ASSOCIATE CHOREOGRAPHER DAVID SCOTCHFULL,
WHO TOOK THE TIME TO TEACH ME SOME OF THE

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.819
MOVES AND THEN THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.329
THE DANCE WITH ONE OF THE STARS OF DIRTY DANCING.

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.690
SAMUEL PROGONDY.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:37.760
