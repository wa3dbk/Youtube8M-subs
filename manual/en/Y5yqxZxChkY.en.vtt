Hi my name is Mike Lumley of Expert Village
I'm here to teach you pitching. So what we

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.080
are going to do is start off in first base
and the first thing we want to think about

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.330
is the hold runner. The pick up is really
not the only way to hold the runner here especially

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.840
a right hander getting pick off are really
not the objective picking somebody off at

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.751
first base is really kind of a bonus of the
whole thing. That we have a runner on is to

00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:39.820
really to work on disrupting his timing, disrupting
any kind of keeping them off balance so he

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.540
does not know which way to go whether if his
knees goes back where they feel comfortable

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.440
going to second base. So the first thing we
are going to talk about is variant or times

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.110
to the plate. So what we are going to do is
go up the top of the mount and talk through

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:03.730
it a little bit is when we very time that
what we can do here is every time I come set

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.009
and I know a lot of young pitchers if they
are going to pitch they usually come up and

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.450
down and just pick right away. Okay, so usually
this is a big indicator and every time I hold

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.619
the ball, boom young pitchers really like
to hold it for just the same exact amount

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.680
of time. So I see a lot of kids and we teach
them they would come up and go one one thousand

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.259
and just pitch to the plate. A good right
handed pitcher is going to know when and how

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.429
to hold all that time has to vary. So if that
means a pitcher is going to come up one time

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:42.959
and I'm going to hold my hold for one second
and then I pitch. The next time I come up

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.819
I'm going to count to myself one thousand
one, one thousand two, one thousand three

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:57.119
and I pitch. The next time around I come up
and hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold,

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.959
and then I step off. A move like that and
all three of those are really going to disrupt

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.799
a good base runner timer and if you hold the
ball for any length of time especially a guy

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.790
who really wants to go you are dent notice
his legs okay so you can step off. It is very

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.181
good if you control your balance and your
movement on the mound that you can hold it

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:23.950
until somebody calls times or until there
is a point in that time that nobody is then

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.829
you can step off. But that is usually a great
way to dealt a fast runner dealt his legs.
