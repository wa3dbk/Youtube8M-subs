I want to share with you a staggering
statistic 22 veterans a day take their

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.890
own lives 22 a day. I almost became part of
that statistic thankfully Wounded

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.099
Warrior Project was there and literally
saved my life last November. As Americans

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.700
we have a duty to support the men and
women who selflessly sacrifice so much

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.530
the mission of Wounded Warrior Project
is to honor and empower wounded Warriors

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.660

wounded warriors and 5800 family members
