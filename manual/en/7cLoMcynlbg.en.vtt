00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:20.716
The whole project is called

00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:22.275
â€žEmerging Markets Business Summit".

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.908
The project consists of a visit of three foreign groups

00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:29.316
in Poland for a two weeks long summit.

00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:57.606
I believe that it is really important

00:00:57.606 --> 00:00:59.506
how much we've learned through this project,

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:02.682
how incredible organizational capabilities are needed

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:06.234
to arrange a staying for 60 people in Poland.

00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:09.017
I think that only us, the organizers,

00:01:09.017 --> 00:01:12.452
realize how much work it required.

00:01:20.483 --> 00:01:22.612
Events like this one are incredibly important because of

00:01:22.628 --> 00:01:24.988
the international and intercultural understanding.

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:27.236
We believe that this can help us in the future to

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:30.714
understand people who we are going to do business with,

00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:33.172
who we're going to be in contact with

00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:35.565
not only professionally but also socially.

00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:17.552
Cooperation of academic circles and student organizations

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:20.268
is crucial as this is the moment

00:02:20.268 --> 00:02:22.298
when we, as students, are actually able to

00:02:22.298 --> 00:02:25.159
establish first relationships with the professional world.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.220
We believe that this is critical to understand

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.321
how business works, how we can help each other.

00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:34.164
I don't think this is about what business could do better.

00:02:34.164 --> 00:02:36.340
I think what matters is what the universities could do better.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.647
First of all, the universities need to open up,

00:02:38.647 --> 00:02:42.712
they should start to listen what people have to say.

00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:44.568
Moreover, they need to rejuvenate.

00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:48.610
The personnel and the authorities have to rejuvenate.

00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:16.502
I absolutely love the Brazilians for their  sense of timing

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:19.129
which is totally different than the Polish sense of timing.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.371
These are people who are so incredibly relaxed, conflictless

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.639
and stress-free that sometimes it might be a bit disturbing

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.498
but their sense of timing, their kindness and hospitality

00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:35.227
are probably the best things I've encountered.

00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:37.103
Actually even after two weeks

00:03:37.103 --> 00:03:39.506
spent together in this international company

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:41.585
it is possible to understand

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:43.621
their mentality and attitude much better.

00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:46.641
Some of their actions and behaviours

00:03:46.641 --> 00:03:49.183
which at first seem to be a total abstraction or even

00:03:49.183 --> 00:03:51.864
inappropriate, then turn out to be absolutely normal

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.089
in their culture, not perceived wrong.
