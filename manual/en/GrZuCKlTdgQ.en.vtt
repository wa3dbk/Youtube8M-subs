00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.590
Welcome back. We're this time going to be
in a mid power FR car. This is a three-fifty

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.879
Z. I find that it's very well balanced and
easy to control. And, a good place to learn

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:23.670
how to really drift more horsepower. So, in
a car like this you have to be careful about

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.300
your entry speed. Because, you will be going
a lot faster than you were in the Z four.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.780
So, make sure you just control your speed
into a corner. And, balance it out with throttle

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:48.229
and steering and you should be able to drift
these cars beautifully. Let's go up to this

00:00:48.229 --> 00:01:00.190
fast section and we'll run our shift lock
here. So, in a car like this you really have

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:11.030
to be careful about your throttle inputs because
they make the biggest difference when you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.340
have your horsepower. So, let's go through
and maybe you can see the difference between

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.470
the Z four and this car. You notice we're
going a lot faster brake lock earlier, just

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:32.200
to be safe. Just to control your speed through
a corner. You notice how I'm feathering the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:48.680
throttle a lot more. That's just because this
car has more power to give. And, the more

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.200
power you have the more the back end is going
to be squirming around on you. So, you just

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:13.870
want to be careful and control it.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.900
So, get used to these mid power cars. Like
I said, you want to use weight shift. Same

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.900
thing as you learned in the cappuccino. But,
you're just trying to be concentrating a lot

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.030
more on your throttle input because it does
change the altitude of the car a lot more

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:45.930
than it did in the Z three. In the Z four,
I'm sorry. So, let's get another lap in and

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.320
maybe you can see even more difference. Pay
attention to how I feather the throttle.Whoops!

00:02:50.320 --> 00:03:27.410
I'd say a little too much steering. So, let's
try and get this long corner nice and clean.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:41.540
Like I said, you have to control your entry
speed. So, don't be afraid to slow down. And,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.670
there we go. That was nice and clean. Here
we go up to this fast corner again. This time,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:04:11.910
I'm just going to lift off. And, this corner
is going to be a little thing. All the gas.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:20.519
And, there you go. This is mid power FR car.
It's pretty much the basics in what you need

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.729
to really start drifting big. So, practice
it. Get used to the feeling of getting the

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:35.499
back out with more horsepower. And, you guys
too will be drifting nice and smooth transitions.

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:44.180
And, pretty much this is a do it all drift
car perfectly balanced. So, once you get a

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:53.449
hang of drifting use this car a lot you'll
get a hang of drifting even more. And, let's

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.780
try and do that last corner for you. This
long sweeper. Remember, keep your speed under

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:10.490
control as you enter the corner. And, just
balance it out with throttle and steering

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.251
and you guys will be fine.
