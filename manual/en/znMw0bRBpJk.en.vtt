00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.960
My name's Frances Keenan.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.040
This is my daughter, Lauren.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.240
At the moment we're living in Belfast

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.320
and we're in a place
called Short Strand

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.120
It hasn't been easy
being a single parent,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.920
providing Lauren
with the things that she needs.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.840
Get the paint and put it on one side,
fold it in half and make a card.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.400
Basically call centre work
was not suitable for me,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.640
I wasn't getting anywhere with it.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.560
I was stuck working on phones,
it was boring, mundane

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.840
and I knew I had the potential
to be much more.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.560
I just don't ever want to go back
and do that again.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.960
I want to be able to come home
from my work happy.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.920
I'm Ruth Boyd and I live
in Seymour Hill in Dunmurry.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.480
My two grandchildren
are living with me

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.200
because their mum died
six years ago suddenly.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.680
My husband and I have separated and
I've been looking after them myself

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.400
this past three years.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.360
I thought I was too old,
that's why I laughed

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.320
when my tutor
said to me about doing the course.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.200
I said ' I can't do that at my age'.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.520
She said why not. She was raging.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.720
These are my books.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.040
Some of my books
that I'm studying at the moment.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.760
This is the new one
I've got to start.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.280
My wee granddaughter, she's 15.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.960
She's starting to do her GCSEs
and she lets me read her work

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.960
and I let her read my work.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.040
And we help each other.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.480
To me, doing these courses
is my social life

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.520
because you go for a tutorial
up at Stranmillis College

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
once a month at least.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.200
What percentage of the world's
refugees resettle in Western Europe?

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.000
Apart from going to church
on a Sunday, this is me

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.200
and I really look forward to it
because it's great.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.920
It lets you forget
the problems you have at home.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
And you can just get on with it
and you have a good laugh.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720
That's what it's all about.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.520
When I was younger and seeing the
Open University being advertised,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.320
it was like for fuddy duddies,
it was for older people.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.600
But that's changed now
I'm actually an OU student myself.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.320
My long-term goal
is to complete the course,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.800
to do a full degree
in social sciences,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.600
preferably to go on to teach adults.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.400
And if you have the aptitude for it,
you don't have to be super brainy

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.360
just as long as you can give it
a couple of hours a week.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.520
You don't have to be Einstein.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.320
Just dedication.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.680
I've found since I started the
course, I've got a bit cheeky on it

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.520
because in social sciences they
tell you to question everything.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.360
And I've got it into my head now,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.720
no matter what I'm watching
or whatever I read,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.600
I'm wondering if it's really true.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.240
It's changed my confidence,
my self-esteem,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.960
my belief in myself
in being able to achieve.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.480
I hardly recognise myself
in the person that I've become,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.680
knowing that what I'm doing
is for myself and for my daughter

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.760
and that's pushing me forward.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.960
I do it because I want to do it.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.120
It's something I missed out on.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.960
If I'd have been able to do it,
I could have maybe had a good career.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.400
But you can't have a family
like that at that age and a career

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.440
and problems the way I had.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.560
So something had to go.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.680
So I had to rear my family, I've
reared my grandchildren now.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.120
They're practically grown up now.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.440
So it's my time
and I'm going to make the most of it.
