00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:08.001
(xylophone music)

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.813
- This dish for four that
we're making is an easy

00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:19.485
oven baked chicken breast.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.481
We want to go ahead and
pre-heat our oven to

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.014
350 degrees.

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:27.333
What I'm going to do is go
ahead and spray my 9X13 dish,

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.421
take the chicken breast,
and we're going to remove

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:34.507
the excess fat and skin.

00:00:34.507 --> 00:00:36.736
These are pretty clean so they look good.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.989
Now I'm going to go
ahead and put my chicken

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.241
in a resealable bag, because I'm going to

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.975
pound it out with my rolling pin.

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:47.636
I'm just going to pound
out the thicker parts,

00:00:47.636 --> 00:00:49.656
so that it will cook evenly.

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:51.838
There we go.

00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:54.903
I'm going to go ahead and
place them in here, like so,

00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:57.295
those look nice.

00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:01.195
Throw out that bag and let's
go wash our cutting board.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.680
Now I'm going to go ahead
and soak my cutting board

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.232
and my rolling pin and wash my hands.

00:01:07.232 --> 00:01:08.486
Okay.

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:11.365
Now we're going to go season that chicken.

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:15.653
I have about 1/3C of fat free
Italian dressing right here,

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.487
I'm going to get my spoon
and I'm just going to evenly

00:01:20.487 --> 00:01:25.487
spoon over each one of the
chicken breasts a good amount.

00:01:26.268 --> 00:01:31.268
Let's give that a flip so
we season up the other side.

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.332
And we're going to go ahead
and cook this uncovered.

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:43.350
Here we go, and that's going to take about

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.904
25 to 30 minutes to cook.

00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:47.878
You know what would be a
great addition to this dish?

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:48.853
Summer squash.

00:01:48.853 --> 00:01:51.500
Let's go ahead and cut some squash up.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.797
Cutting the ends, like so.

00:01:54.797 --> 00:01:59.797
(knife hitting cutting board)

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.337
I'm going to go ahead and
add my zucchini and squash

00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:07.511
to my microwave dish right here.

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.968
And I'm going to add
three tablespoons of water

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:16.868
and I'm going to season
it up with one teaspoon.

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.168
of Italian seasoning,

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:20.861
I'm going to go ahead and
add the cut up tomatoes

00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:25.861
that I have right here
to my microwave dish.

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:27.734
Give that a good stir so that everything

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:30.497
is mixed up in there.

00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:32.564
Put this in the microwave
for seven minutes.

00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:37.564
Here is our finished dish, easy
oven baked chicken breasts.
