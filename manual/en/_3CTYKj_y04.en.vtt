00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.385
Wouter is looking for
the entrance to the AutoRAI.

00:00:59.628 --> 00:01:01.057
Wouter.
-Hi Sacha.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.507
You know Amsterdam better than I do...

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:10.011
...and I want to go the AutoRAI.
I want to check out the demo area.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.819
What? Where?

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.250
It's supposed to be at the entrance.

00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:20.237
But I think I've taken a wrong turn,
I'm in some sort of tunnel.

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:24.119
It's a bit strange, there are no signs here.

00:01:24.423 --> 00:01:28.292
Huh?
-You know what my sense of direction is like.

00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:31.670
Maybe you can help me.
-I'm eating right now.

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:39.366
I'll send you my location
with WhatsApp or something.

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:42.157
Just drive over here and pick me up.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.278
We can take a look together, that'd be fun.

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:47.799
I'll come your way after
I've finished my pizza. Bye.

00:02:10.372 --> 00:02:12.910
Entrance Noord/Zuidlijn.

00:02:24.864 --> 00:02:27.550
After half an hour of explaining.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.125
Well, I'm glad I've found it.

00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:28.572
I know I won't take a shortcut anymore,
I just don't know Amsterdam well enough.

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:31.343
This is what I've been looking for,
the demo area.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.933
When the AutoRAI starts
you can do all sorts of things here.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:38.054
You can drive electric cars
but there will also be spectacular demos.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:41.291
That might be even cooler
than what I've just done.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.763
Anyway, you know where to go.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.965
Thanks to
the Government of Amsterdam
