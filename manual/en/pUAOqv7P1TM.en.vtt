Hi! I’m Amelia and I

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.829
just finished putting in the last bit of roses
in this cascading bouquet. I’m just going

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.409
to go through and just add some of this heather
that we started with in little areas where

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.159
I feel it just needs a little touch of something
else. It kind of brings the edges up to the

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:23.009
top. You just want just a few fine little
pieces. Just stick them down between your

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:33.090
main flowers, whatever they may be, into the
foam. At this point, you start battling with

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.610
the foam for room because you’ve got a lot
of flowers crammed in here. You just want

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.689
to move around and put little bits where you
think it needs a little something else. It’s

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.969
always good to stand back and hold it in front
of yourself as if you’re the bride and look

00:01:52.969 --> 00:02:01.000
from all angles because the bride is looked
at from all sides. So you want to make sure

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.659
you’re not overlooking anything and there
you have it. You can add a bow to this which

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:08.860
we’ll do in the next step.
