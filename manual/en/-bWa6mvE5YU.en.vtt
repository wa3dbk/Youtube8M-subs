Hi my name is Jamie Yasko-Mangum and with
Successful Style and Image today on Expert

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.840
Village we are going to talk about hose and
tights. Now when I'm saying that I can already

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.359
cringing because I know a lot of women who
don't like wearing hose and I know they don't

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:27.300
like wearing tights with there business suits.
However, when are wearing shoes, when you

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.310
are wearing you suit the hose are a key item
to making your suit your whole body image

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:42.030
look polish. Now understand that when you
are wearing hose somethings you need to know

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.490
about when you are buying hose. Number one
you don't want a thick hose. You want a sheer

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.320
hose when you go out to the department store
or you go to a discount store and buy hose

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.219
you want to look for sheer on the labeling.
Sheer means that it doesn't look like you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.980
have paint that you painted your legs. It
gives your legs a little of glistening to

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.870
them and it shows your legs looking very thin.
So sheer hose is what you want. You want the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.280
hose to be reinforce toe. Because must of
the time women stag there hose it could be

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.720
from toenails or putting on the hose. So the
reinforce toe really helps with toes. I know

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.030
hose can get warm and I understand that but
you are in a air condition building and if

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.120
you are wearing a suit a business suit. Now
I'm not talking about a regular skirt and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.700
a blazer jacket. I'm talking about a suit
that goes together the hose are extremely

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.110
appropriate and they are professional looking.
As far as the color of the hose. You want

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.190
to blend that color of hose with either the
suit or your skin color. What you don't want

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.430
to do is completely pick a absolutely different
color and blend. Here is a profile many women

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.050
do they would wear a navy blue suit put on
white hose or a very very light cream color

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.940
hose and the wear dark shoes. Now if you do
that I would suggest that you don't. That

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.690
is a no no. you don't want to do that. I'm
not saying not to wear navy you can wear sheer

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.180
navy hose or wear a nude, or wear a suntan
hose. You want that hose to go with your skin.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.000
If you want to wear the navy blue make sure
that there is navy blue also with your blouse.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If there is not and it is a white blouse you
want to make sure that it is a nude or suntan

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.540
color and you want to make sure sheer you
don't want your legs the first thing that

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.730
stand out. Real quickly let me talk about
tights. The only time you should wear tights

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.330
is if they are sheer tight. But otherwise
tight are nice just with regular skirts. So

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.190
remember the hose.
