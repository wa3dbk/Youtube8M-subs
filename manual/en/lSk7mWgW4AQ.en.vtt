00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.120
So I’m here with Tony Dobbs and we’re
looking at the Nike Covert Performance driver.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.280
Now Tony, who first of all is this driver
aimed at?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.450
What type of player is this driver aimed at?

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.580
Well this one has an extremely wide range
of player type.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.360
We’re seeing, actually, a number of our
Tour players in this product.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.980
Rory is playing the Tour but we’ve seen
almost half to sixty percent of our Tour players

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.390
adopt this one.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.239
It’s a 460cc head, it more forgiving and
really it’s open to anybody.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540
This is a very easy golf club to hit.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.200
And you explained to me that 460cck even though
there’s a large chunk of this, it’s very

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.900
visually appealing.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.649
When it’s measured it still counts as 460cc?

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.860
It is yes, that is correct.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.780
Now a lot of people when they buy clubs, this
one is fully adjustable, this is the same

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.060
one loft suits all setting?

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.130
Just explain to the viewer what happens.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.680
Well actually I’ll show you.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.170
Simply said, on the back of this, on the back
of the hosel here we have an adapter.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.810
The adapter shows the loft and it also shows
our face angle.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.200
I’ll pull this apart real quick and show
you how easy this is.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.930
Ok I’ll time you.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.930
No problem.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.570
I’m not the fastest, but I do it right every
time.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.890
Now you can do this before a round, you can’t
do it during a round?

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.599
That’s correct.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:28.360
So what we’ve got here is its simple.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.330
We’ve got two pieces here.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.200
It’s as simple as lining up your loft to
your desired face angle.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.390
So in this case if I want to set it to a 10.5
and a neutral, I’m going to slide these

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.860
two things down and then there’s a little
line right here on the back of the hosel here

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.220
and we’re just going to slide this, line
those two things up, get it started.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.670
So give it a few wrench cranks and what we’re
looking for.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.670
Whoops.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.340
How far do you have to tighten it?

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.610
Do you hear a little click?

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.610
There is yea.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.020
It’s just like a gas cap.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.250
So it’s a torqueing wrench which has got
a little ratchet on it and you’ll hear a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.250
[CLICK].

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.250
A little click.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.450
IT’s something as simple as that and you’re
ready to go and you’ve got something that

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.450
you want.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.100
IF you’ve got a windy day, which I know
you guys get some windy days from time to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.610
time you may take it down to that 8.5.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.530
But you know if you’re out on the range
and you’re hitting it dead right you can

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.990
wipe it back to the left position which closes
up the face and eliminates some of that.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.340
It’s just a fantastic technology.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.610
Well we’re going to go out on the range
in front of us now.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.600
It’s an absolutely beautiful set you’ve
got this year so we’re going to see some

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.820
of these drivers in action but for now Tony
thanks very much for talking to us.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.340
You’re welcome.
