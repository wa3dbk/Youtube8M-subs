Whats up everybody, welcome back to my laboratory, were safety is number one priority.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.360
Today i'm gonna show you five life hacks,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.660
you know how to open a beer bottle without a can opener.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm gonna show you five different methods, lets check it out.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Grab two bottles of beer and open... bottle with the bottle.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.100
Man, just like they just don't want to open like this. Oh my gosh, I don't want to fail.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well I fail the second had to open, you supposed to open THIS cup, not that one. Well, sucks.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Lets start with a coin.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So you can open it with a coin, it was pretty successful, but meant its so hard to open, its greasy. So lets try something else

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:24.800
You can use a key this will suck with bottles, very tight, so my keys will not bend too much. So you stick it like that in your hand and just open it, just like that.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:53.000
So the idea is, hit real hard over here over here, and so it will fly out... Uh like this, like do this kind of motion, uh like this motion you know, and hit it the least you know, and as hard as you can, not the bottle, the cap, you know the cap. That's it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That's how you open beer with CD

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So how can we open it? All were gonna need is a piece of paper bet you dont know how to do it. So this is how you do it, so were gonna fold it a bunch of times.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:28.140
So you got surface, you know. A fold side here, and a normal side here so ill show you how to do it right here You gonna grab it down like that, and.. open it. Pretty cool, huh? With a piece of paper.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.300
And remember safety first, you see I cut myself in the last videos twice.
