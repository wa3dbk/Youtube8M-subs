00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.140
Next we're going to talk about representation
of large numbers. Specifically we're going

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.969
to talk about short word form. But before
we do that, we're going to take this example,

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:29.210
this example is in standard form.
And I'm sure you're familiar with this, this

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.310
is a standard way that we write a large number
like this. Now in word form, okay we 're going

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:46.379
to get to the short word form in a minute.
But the word form is very wordy. Okay. To

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:59.440
express this number you're going to write
two million,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:33.600
three hundred forty-five thousand, six hundred
seventy-eight,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:46.979
and this is called the word form.
So basically we take these numerals and write

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.840
it out in words, and it's pretty worded. Now
we have what's known as the short word form,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:04.119
which contracts this information, and still
give you the value of this number. This is

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:17.730
called a short word form.
And what we're doing is we're basically taking

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:31.560
some short cuts, so we're going to use numerals
again. Two million,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:45.510
three hundred forty-five thousand,
six hundred and seventy-eight. So we have

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:54.060
contracted a lot of these words, but still
give the same information. So we're using

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:05.170
words only to indicate major breaks. For instance
this million is spelled out, this thousand

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.060
is spelled out, but anything in between we
use numerals.
