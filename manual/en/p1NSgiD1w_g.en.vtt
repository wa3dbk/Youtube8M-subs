00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.670
Alright, today on this 2008 Toyota Prius,
we are going to install part number WTH0138W

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.670
from WeatherTech.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.559
And this is their headlight protection kit.

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.469
What this item does is basically protects
the lens of your headlight from bugs flying

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.930
into it, bits of road tar impacting it or
rocks coming off other vehicles.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.170
It just gives you a little bit more protection
on the front end of your vehicle.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.960
Alright, the first thing we are going to do
is we are going to start off by cleaning off

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960
the lens itself.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.430
We are going to use a solution of rubbing
alcohol and water.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.379
It is basically a 4 to 1 ratio.

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.370
We are going to spray it down.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.109
Get any wax, dirt, anything else on there.

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:45.420
0:44
Alright, now that we have our lens dry, what

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.079
we are going to do is go ahead and just do
a quick test fit.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.659
Give ourselves a good idea about how it is
going to fit on the lens.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:02.299
Next thing we are going to do is go ahead
and run our fingers with the solution and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:08.140
then peel off the backing on the protector.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:25.580
And we are going to spray down the adhesive
side with the alcohol mixture.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:43.910
And the alcohol allows you to move it a little
bit.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.410
And as it dries, the adhesive takes over.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:57.730
We will use the little squeegee that comes
with the kit to get all of the excess bubbles.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.360
We have the one side done.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.090
Let us go over to the other side and start
on that one.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.140
Okay and with that that finishes our install
of part number WTH0138W from WeatherTech.
