00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.540
Whether you need to haul your bike to the
trails or the family camper to the camp ground,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.580
you're going to need a trailer hitch.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.860
This video will help you select the correct
hitch by understanding the differences between

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.860
them.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.360
Currently, Curt offers five different classes
of hitches which are determined by their individual

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.950
weight ratings.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.000
Class 1 hitches have a 1 and 1/4 receiver
tube and a maximum gross trailer weight rating

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.949
of 2000 pounds.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.800

on compact to mid-size cars.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.400
Class 2 trailer hitches have a 1 and 1/4 inch
receiver tube and a maximum gross trailer

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.320

These trailer hitches can be found on small
cars all the way to light SUV's.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.210
So, if you're planning on using a hitch mounted
bike rack to haul your bike on your small

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.260
car, be sure to check the shape size of the
bike rack.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.220
Remember: Class one and two trailer hitches
have a 1 and 1/4 inch receiver tube.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.930
Class 3 trailer hitches have a two inch receiver
tube and a maximum gross trailer weight rating

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.559
of 8000 pounds.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.510
These are the most common hitches found on
vehicles on the road today.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.400
You could find them on anything from full
size cars to full size pickups.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.140
These are perfect for handling the family
pop-up camper or boat for that weekend getaway.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.720
Class 4 trailer hitches also have a 2-inch
receiver tube with a maximum gross trailer

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.569
weight rating of 10,000 pounds.

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.630
Class 4 hitches are perfect for those who
need to haul larger trailers, such as heavy

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.020
construction equipment or large campers trailers.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.720
For when a 5 ton gross trailer weight rating
isn't large enough for your full-size pickup,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.060
Curt offers the classified hitch line.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.240
The classified hitch line is broken into two
sub-categories, the extra duty series and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.780
the commercial duty series.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.640
Extra duty trailer hitches have a 2-inch receiver
tube opening with an maximum gross trailer

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.470
weight rating of 17,000 pounds.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.240
Commercial duty trailer hitches have a 2 and
1/2 inch receiver tube with a gross trailer

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.890
weight rating of a whopping 20,000 pounds.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.660
All Curt classified hitches come with a rugged
scratch resistant carbide finish, while class

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.860
1 through 4 trailer hitches are coated in
an attractive high-gloss black finish.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.450
When selecting a trailer hitch, there are
two important factors to consider; how much

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.690
the trailer ways and what vehicle you'll be
towing it with.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.080
To determine how much the trailer weighs,
you can find this information by looking at

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.420
the information by looking at the label stamped
on the trailer, or by taking it to a certified

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.220
scale.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.140
Understanding the weight of your trailer will
also allow you to determine if you need additional

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.760
heavy duty towing components, such as a break
control, sway control, or a weight distribution

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760
system.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.340
The towing capacity of many class 3, 4 and
5 trailer hitches can be increased with the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.600
use of a weight distribution system.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.920
Also, depending on the coupler style of your
trailer, you may need specialty towing equipment

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.700
such as a goose-neck or fifth wheel hitch.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.850
There's a lot more to understanding the tow
vehicle than knowing just your year make and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.850
model.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.810
Before you tow, You should also know your
towing capacity.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.330
This information can be found in the owner's
manual or by contacting your local dealer.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.460
Trailer hitch ratings are determined by the
manufacturer through a number of testing and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.080
validating techniques.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.790
They do not reflect the towing capacity of
your vehicle.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.940
In some cases, they may exceed the towing
capacity of your vehicle.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.130
Your tow load should never exceed the maximum
towing capacity of your vehicle, as specified

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.260
by the vehicle manufacturer.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.700
Thank you for taking the time to learn about
the many differences in trailer hitches.
