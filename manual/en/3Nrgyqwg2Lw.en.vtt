00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.689
oil slick call our way now for the youth
feed

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.649
the eats there's a couple different ways
they use them

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.750
to you we're going to your meeting
there's one method where you string naw

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.840
onto your yarn before you began and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.860
working as you go and second

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.390
way is to use a crochet hook and then

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.439
were into you your stitches ask you

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.039
girl so in this video we're going to you

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.229
go over crochet hook method yeah

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.100
this method you will need very small
crochet hook

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.620
like peas here these are two examples

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.970
a small crochet hook someone is 8.75

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.750
we're the other one is a 1.3

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.319
kilometer shaper now you'll need be.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.170
to go down it's such a small size
because you actually be going through

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.730
you themselves so you need to be able to
fit the crochet her

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.050
Ruby order to grab your yard and colour

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.080
for it now that you're using this

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.250
smaller that H-hour seed beads you want
to use a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.250
points at five-millimeter crochet ok if
you have anything

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.140
larger than that its gonna actually not
fit

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.370
through deceit itself and if you're
working with a larger

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.620
fix I see feeds you want to use

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.709
out what quite three millimeter crochet
up you can go smaller than that so at

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.510
that point 754

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.220
fine on a larger size be but you don't
want to go

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.239
crochet hook any larger band around 1.3

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.970
millimeters cell let's start
incorporating some views into anything

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.760
using the crib sheet her map it see him
see haven't started incorporating

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.959
maybe you into my knitting and and
working among

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.480
every right side crown can staggering
them

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.590
about so you'll need

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.950
your very small crochet hook here

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.840
and again the crochet hook size I'm
using is 1.3 mil meters

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.150
and I'm not just what you're being fat
you're planning on using two

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.670
so the first app is to simply

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.580
work to where the pattern says to
incorporate a B

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.069
or if you're just making a pattern up

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.209
making up your own design it is really
fun to do. with the youth

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.750
let's get this spot for you and I'm the
bean

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.409
see can see here I want added to be done

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.829
this steps the very first act is

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.959
take your smoker she hoc

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.130
and place a bead

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.780
onto it now this is the important part
why you need a crochet hook that so

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.460
small

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.870
cuz you'll need to actually place the
crochet hook

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.870
through the be itself and again I'm
using

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.780
the e larger size seed beads the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.580
SA-six ot seed beads and then

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.800
you're going to hear crochet hook and
fly back stitch

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.950
onto the crochet hook the next step

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.360
is a little bit tricky and you have to
practice sq

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.110
kind of get a feel for what you're doing
you want to century

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.430
cool this yarn this one stitch

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.830
the Ru would be here from now hold on
tight

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.000
and then puss the bead

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.860
ruin over

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.550
C&amp;C if pushed the BU over the arm

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.440
and then what you're gonna do is simply
place

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.400
stocks its back on her left hand me at
all

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.200
from the Friday onto the No removed a
crochet hook

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.400
and man you're going to work that next
stitch

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.780
in this case I'm gonna need it since I'm
just working simple stockinette stitch

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.030
not for you incorporate feeds into
rimming

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.480
so again things going to work a few
stitches

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.840
so I get to that next stage where I want
to place might be you

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.020
we can go on through the steps more time

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.160
so here I want to add another impede
onto this stitch

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.730
so I'm gonna take my crochet hook

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.770
police Aviv onto it

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.660
phenomena take the set of the left-hand
needle

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.520
playset onto the crochet hook and then
again the easiest thing

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.270
for me anyway I found as I just kind of
let me need oath

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.290
dangle behind here Bandai

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.400
pinks my stitch and then simply slide

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.140
be over the crochet hook

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.700
to get the yarn through in place that
sticks back on to your left hand you

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.310
know

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.630
and work as you would just don't forget
you'll still need to work

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.360

crochet hook

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.800
is as simple as that no i see UI then

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.470
really nice details a beating

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.640
you can create all sorts of motifs and
shapes

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.050
giving kind even added to two men tend
to something simple like stockinette

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.460
stitch evening

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.510
you know me shape make arts make star

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.210
out n lined powder name with the beard
so it's

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.720
a really nice way of dressing up a
simple pattern

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.720
just by incorporating a few millionth

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:24.970
