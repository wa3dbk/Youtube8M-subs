Female 1:

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.390
It peels the years back.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.390
Female 2:

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.749
And I had a little bit of puffiness around
my eyes.

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:47.749
Everything is gone.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:48.749
Female 3:

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:49.949
It just takes years off your face.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:50.949
Female 4:

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.390
People stop me on the street and go, your
skin is so beautiful

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.390
Recorded Voice:

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.039
Look better, younger, refreshed and healthy.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.729
No facelift required.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.219
In less than one hour, the Coolaser can turn
back the hands of time.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.219
Dr. Simon Ourian:

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.540
It brings out your healthy skin back to the
way it was supposed to be.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.390
Coolaser is the ideal treatment for removal
of freckles, discolorations, sun damage, fine

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.830
lines, deep lines and it’s great to tighten
the skin.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.679
Dr. Simon Ourian runs one of the busiest medical
practices in Beverly Hills.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.470
His experience and expertise with laser technology,
produce incredible results with minimal risks.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.470
Female 5:

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.930
If you wanna erase sun damage, dark circles,
veins, Coolaser’s the best way to do it

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.030
and Epione is the only place to have it done.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.960
Recorded Voice:

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.980
The process is fast and simple.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.869
First, a numbing cream is applied to the target
area then Dr. Simon Ourian focuses a state

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.609
of the art laser on scars, wrinkles, birthmarks,
dark circles or age spots to minimize their

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:57.609
appearance.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:58.609
Dr. Simon Ourian:

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.210
The advantage of the Coolaser is that it’s
so effective and so precise and I can – we

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.700
can get very close to the areas that we want
to and avoid the healthy skin in the areas

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700
that we want to avid.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.700
Recorded Voice:

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.610
The Coolaser uses a beam of light energy to
work its magic, vaporizing the upper layers

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.690
of damages skin.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.329
Collagen is rejuvenated, bringing back the
smooth soft look of youth.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.329
Dr. Simon Ourian:

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.130
Your body goes into an overproduction of collagen,
so your skin starts to look more firm tighter

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.950
and it starts to give you an appearance of
a facelift by giving you a nice upward lifting

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.950
of your face.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.950
Female 6:

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.989
I have very sensitive skin, but it was done
so quickly and so fast that you really don’t

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:36.989
notice it.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.709
It just kind of peels off the top layer and
it regenerates your skin and it gets the collagen

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.380
building up again, so it’s really nice.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.380
Recorded Voice:

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.019
Most patients say the Coolaser procedure is
not painful.

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.019
Female 3:

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.879
I had no actual pain with the procedure at
all and within a couple of days my skin started

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:06.879
to peel and the skin underneath was younger,
fresher, tighter and people noticed a difference

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:07.879
right away.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:08.879
Female 4:

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.799
It was a little painful for me, but the – ultimately
the results – fabulous.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:14.799
Female 7:

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.680
And it felt a little bit like – I guess
it would be like little rubber bands slapping

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.739
against my skin really quickly.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.599
It was over before I even knew it.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.329
When it was over I thought, oh that was it.

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.329
Recorded Voice:

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.900
After the procedure, patients are sent home
with a special cream to soothe reddened skin.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.530
That’s the most common side effect of Coolaser
and usually occurs on the first day of treatment.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.870
Dr. Simon Ourian says later, some peeling
may occur, but by day four, spectacular, rejuvenated

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.810
skin is ready to face the world.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.810
Female 7:

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.900
I went home.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.000
It felt a little bit like a sunburn for a
few days and applied some ointment to my fact,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.569
applied some cool towels to my face and then
pretty much, I about four or five days it

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.189
was over and my skin was pink and I started
seeing this newer healthier skin come to the

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:05.189
surface.

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.189
Female 8:

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:07.189
I wanted to look how I felt.

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.439
I felt that I was looking in the mirror looking
more tired than I really was.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.190
Within three or four days after the procedure,
I just saw the well-rested me.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.190
Recorded Voice:

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.400
Patients with all skin types swear by the
long lasting results of the Coolaser treatments

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.710
they’ve received at Epione.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.710
Female 7:

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.180
When I came in to consult with them they reassured
me of all the different fears that I had,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.810
of all the different things that I read, that
this particular laser is nothing like any

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.310
other lasers that I’ve seen or read about.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.120
That it’s completely appropriate for Asian
skin and I would definitely recommend it for

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.500
other skin types like my own.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.500
Female 4:

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.450
I know that that is an issue, the darker you
are and I – it just wasn’t a really big

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.450
concern for me.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.450
Dr. Simon Ourian:

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.770
Now, with the Coolaser I can treat people
of all skin types, all skin colors and the

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.330
recovery time is a lot shorter.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.550
You can – most people can go back to work
within a few days.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.550
Recorded Voice:

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.569
In the past, skin rejuvenation options were
more evasive, required anesthesia and weeks

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:07.660
or months of recovery.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.660
Female 9:

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.400
They really made me feel comfortable and really
just give me the confidence that this is the

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.030
place I would like to be to have this done.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.030

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.110
Patients receive the treatments in the small
like atmosphere of Epione in Beverly Hills.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.360
The experienced and talented staff make the
consultation process and the procedure feel

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.110
relaxing and even luxurious.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.110
Female 2:

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.080
The atmosphere, the environment is very relaxing.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.850
And I love the fact that they are concerned
about you and they tell you how to take care

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.100
of your skin step by step.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.100
Female 5:

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.889
Even if you’ve never heard of Coolaser and
you may not know what questions to ask, the

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.990
consultant can actually give you information
so that you can make an educated decision.

Recorded Voice:

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.750
Patients who have benefited from a Coolaser
treatment say it’s changed not only their

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.840
makeup routine and skincare regime, but the
way they feel about themselves.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.840
Female 4:

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.490
I don’t have to wear base every day or powder
every day.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.539
You know, my skin – as long as put sunscreen
on it just looks flawless.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.539
Female 7:

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:19.610
The absolute best part about having the treatment
was, in fact, not necessarily the outward

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.410
change, although those were dramatic beyond
my expectations, the more dramatic result

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.080
was the way I felt about myself afterwards.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.270
It was an enormous change.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.270
Female 10:

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.700
What I really love especially is when I catch
my reflection in something and I just love

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.900
the way I look, that’s a great feeling.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.940
So it makes me feel great, make me feel younger.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.210
When I hit 50 I thought, you know, it’s
time to do something and it was just a great

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.210
idea.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.210
Female 11:

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.740
I wanna age gracefully, sort of [laughter]
with a little help from doctors.
