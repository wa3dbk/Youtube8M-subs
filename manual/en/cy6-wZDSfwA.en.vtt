00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.440
First, I’m going to apply “Cushion foundation”

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.860
This foundation smooth out nicely on your skin and easy to use for makeup beginners. 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.380
Then use powder foundation.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.760
To crate natural looking skin, use only “Cushion foundation” and powder foundation.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.580
Use a pencil to draw eyebrow. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.040
Use your own eyebrow shape and create thick eyebrow line.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.660
Put beige eye shadow on your entire eyelid.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.520
Apply highlight color on the under the eyebrow.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.300
Use highlight and beige eye shadow colors only. 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.920
Use fresh and natural looking eye shadow to get favorable impression.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.040
There are well blending 5 different beige eye shadow colors. You can use them as you feel like for the day.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.820
I’m going to draw eye line next.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.340
 I’m going to apply mascara.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.220
I’m going to brush cheek color.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.020
Brush gentle and widely and create natural ruddy cheek.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.380
I recommend cheek color with natural healthy glow. This cheek color is easy to blend with highlight on the same palette.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.520
In the last, I’m going to put on lipstick.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.960
Choose pink beige color lipstick to look smart.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.820

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.580
It is simple and easy to achieve. Please try it and thank you for watching.
