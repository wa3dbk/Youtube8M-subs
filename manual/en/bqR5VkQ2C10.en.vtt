Hello, this is Mark Bowers, from bowersphotography.com
in Utah, and I'd like to talk about special

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.420
lighting effects. I have some plastic gels.
They're theater gels that I bought, and what

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.210
I did is I wrapped them in a circle around
a flash tube and just used tape and duct tape

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.949
to put them on when I use them on low powered
flash tubes. Now I repeat; low power. This

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.630
is only two hundred watts. They won't melt
the plastic to the tube. More than three or

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.650
four hundred watts the plastic will start
to melt to your flash tubes. Then you'll end

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.420
up with green flash tubes and you don't want
that. But I've made up a bunch of different

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:57.580
colors that I use; greens, yellows, blues,
browns, and different colors, and I, basically

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.740
the way I use them is I turn them around so
that they can flash against the background

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.969
and create colors on my different backgrounds
and give me a lot more variety of backgrounds

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:17.759
for my customers. I would like to show you
a little bit about special lighting techniques

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.670
that I used on on this automobile. It's just
an old car that I found down the street. It

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.609
needed some light to bring the car to life.
The headlights were just totally gone, and

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:38.200
some of the the grillwork and the and the
hood work was just, it was pretty old and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.560
beat up, and so I chose a day in the late
late afternoon when the sunlight was was good

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.100
but the headlights were still bad. And so
what I did is I came in with some halogen

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.149
spots to light up these headlights. This is
a little halogen spot that I bought from the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.679
hardware store, and I basically turned it
on and hit the headlights with the with the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.990
spotlight as I was photographing it, and it
just brought the lights to life and it it

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.180
made the the photograph just come alive.
