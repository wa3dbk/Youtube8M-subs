Hello, I’m Rory from eSpares and in this
video I’m going to show you how to replace

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.020
the plastic door shield and the glass door
bowl on this Hotpoint washing machine. Now

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.970
as you can see the shield on this washing
machine has been smashed, so obviously needs

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.700
replacing, but while I’m at it I’m also
going to replace the glass door bowl as well.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.770
Now, safety first. Always switch off the machine
at the mains before you do any work on it.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.730
The first thing I’m going to need to do
is take the door off the machine, so I need

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:51.790
to unscrew these four screws. You now need
to unclip the two trims from each other. You

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:00.220
just need a flat-head screwdriver to just
‘jimmy’ the two parts away from each other.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:11.550
And now they should just, with a little bit
of a bump, come apart. Now, this is the outer

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.220
door trim, I’m just going to put that to
one side for one minute. I can now get my

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.060
old shield and bowl away. I’m replacing
both so I’ll get rid of them. Here we have

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.409
the new bowl, and the new shield. I’m going
to put the shield inside the bowl. This hook

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.409
matches up with the lip on the bowl. This
hook matches up with the lip on the bowl,

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.500
so it just sits like that. Now I can grab
the two parts and put them back in the inner

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.770
door trim. You need to match the lip and the
hook up to this locating hole there. Once

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.850
you’ve done that, grab the outer door trim
and now we can just put this back on the rest

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:02.659
of the door, and then put everything back
together. And that’s it. Brand new shield,

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.701
brand new bowl, easy as that. Shields and
bowls for all makes and model of washing machine

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:09.409
are available on the eSpares website. Thanks
for watching.
