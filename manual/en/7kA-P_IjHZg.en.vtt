00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.120
Hi YouTube, Darth Here:
This week we had quite a few changes on the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.120
Battlefield 4 Community Test Environment.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.429
Though there was one change that didn't quite
make it that I'll talk about anyways because

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.410
Tigg was gracious enough to give us some preview
screenshots.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.019
But I'll talk about that and more in this
week's CTE Sunday, so let's get started.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.660
In preparation for the upcoming night maps,
DICE has removed the visual recoil from the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.910
IRNV and FLIR optics.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.220
If you're not familiar with visual recoil,
that's the added animation on optics where

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.400
the scope would bounce around independently
of where the barrel was actually pointing.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.490
Now these scopes will operate like any of
the other red dot, 1x, and 2x scope in the

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.160
game, and they no longer have visual recoil.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.280
While I think that people are going to continue
holding onto their red dots, this might just

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.110
push people away from the Holos and medium
range scopes, as the infrared does make it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.930
easier to spot out targets from the surrounding
environment.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.860
DICE has asked for feedback on this change,
so be sure you play with it on the CTE and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.989
respond on the CTE forum and on the new Battlefield
4 CTE sub-Reddit.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.020
Next up, the scoreboard display for the game
saw a small change.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.739
Now players that are dead will show up darkened
in the scoreboard.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.020
So at a glance, you'll be able to pick out
who from your team (and the enemy team) is

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.829
still alive, and who is dead.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.220
If anybody played Defuse, I'd say that this
would probably be a good bit of information

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.670
for that game mode, but it's still nice to
know.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.740
Personally, I still miss the day when I could
see each and every player's class and know

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.170
that I'm on a team full of snipers, like in
earlier Battlefield titles.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.450
Another nice little addition is the added
display for the health of the player you're

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.450
spawning on.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.710
Now in the CCTV in the bottom left corner,
you can see the current health of the player

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.710
you're about to join.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.799
This should let you deal with the situation
a little better once you enter the game, and

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.750
maybe not spawn you on that friendly who is
about to bite it.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.170
Hopefully with the other squadmate spawn changes
from past weeks, this should reduce the number

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.689
of bad spawns that players are subjected to.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.980
One thing that I almost missed from this week
was the tweak to optic sway when a player

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.909
is under the effects of suppression.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.450
Now the low power sights receive 60% less
sway, and the medium power sights receive

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.140
30% less sway as compared to the live servers.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.659
The net effect is that suppression now affects
your aim even less so than before.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.720
Other than being a momentary nuisance, it
seems like suppression has had a lot of its

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.140
teeth removed since the Battlefield 4 launch.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.750
This gradual reduction of all its effects
kind of leaves me wondering why suppression

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.049
is even still in the game.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.100
If you've been waiting for a UCAV and mortar
nerf, this is your week.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.229
DICE has added a mandatory cooldown to these
two weapons whenever a player spawns.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.760
Now you can no longer spawn and immediately
start using either of these weapons.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.310
For the UCAV, it's a sixty second waiting
period before you can deploy the weapon, and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.290
for the mortar it's thirty seconds.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.530
After playing around with this some, I have
to say that this will have the biggest impacts

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.030
at the start of rounds, and for players that
are used to spawning and immediately using

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.540
a weapon in a reprisal role.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.580
I didn't have the opportunity to test this
out, but I suspect this also fixes the commander

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.290
crate exploit for the UCAV.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.340
Ultimately, this change seems like a good
one, even if I was missing my UCAV quite a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.560
bit for that quick Helicopter take-down.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.530
Next up is a small increase to the viewable
area of the SRAW scope.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.920
Now there's even more visability while you're
aiming the SRAW than there was before.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.360
Combined with some of the other ease-ups in
the pretty hefty nerfs, I'm kind of hoping

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.550
this puts the weapon in a state where its
users will feel like at least there's been

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.700
a compromise between what needs to happen
and what's in the game.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.341
It's still definitely plausible to shoot down
helicopters, which I still groan about, but

00:02:59.341 --> 00:03:02.130
it's definitely not as easy as it is on live
servers.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.120
Finally, DICE couldn't quite get night maps
into the game this week, so as a consolation

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.670
prize, Tiggr uploaded some wonderful screenshots
from the Shanghai night map.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.680
As you can see from these screenshots, we're
going to get a version of Shanghai that isn't

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.670
quite pitch black like maybe some folks were
hoping for, but it's still pretty dark in

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.670
a lot of areas.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.670
I think that this is a nice setup and it will
make for an interesting change of pace for

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.670
the map.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.489
Don't forget, we've also been promised some
other "goodies," so there are some intesting

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.890
additions that may yet be coming.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.300
As with every week, there were a few miscellaneous
changes that didn't really feel that big.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.110
This week, jet HUD elements were made more
visible, squad spawning was tweaked, squad

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.750
obliteration saw continued changes, there
are new impact sounds for hits your soldier

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.989
takes, a fix to mantle for AMD video cards,
DICE implemented a "netcode" bug fix for incorrect

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.239
health displays, and there were tweaks to
destructible buildings on Golmud and Propaganda.

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.870
So there are a lot of changes on the CTE,
coming to the CTE, and we've even got a patch

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.819
coming up in the next few weeks.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.950
What's going to be in that patch?

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.160
Well we probably won't be getting some of
the features that are currently on the CTE,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.680
including some of the prototypes.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.760
When we get closer to the actual release date
for the winter patch, I'll make a video all

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.120
about the changes we can expect, and what
that means.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.440
But that's it for this CTE Sunday.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.270
Let me know down below what you think of this
week's changes.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.860
