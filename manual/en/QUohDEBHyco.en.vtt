00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.809
Hey guys! Welcome to Inspire to Cook!

00:00:01.809 --> 00:00:03.292
Feeling Italian today?

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:05.753
But want to avoid all the calories of pasta?

00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:09.593
Well today, I am going to show you how to make pasta out of the vegetables

00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:10.945
Squash pasta

00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:14.023
This vegetable pasta takes just one ingredient, the squash

00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:15.825
You can use any squashes

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:17.703
and it's super simple to make

00:00:17.703 --> 00:00:20.721
You are going to be done in 10 minutes and it doesn't require any skill

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.786
And if you are one of those healthy granolas, you are going to be pleased to know that it is super healthy

00:00:24.823 --> 00:00:28.023
very low calories, and is very rich in vitamin A,

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:30.266
folic acid and all the other good stuff

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.489
There is tons of ways to make the squash pasta

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.238
But the easiest by far is to make it in the microwave

00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:38.179
The first thing you want to do is you want to make small cuts in it

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.977
To make sure, when you cook it in the microwave

00:00:40.977 --> 00:00:43.871
The steam actually escapes and is not exploding

00:00:44.268 --> 00:00:45.068
there you go

00:00:45.258 --> 00:00:50.058
that's it, now I am just going to pop them in the microwave for 2.5 minutes

00:00:50.058 --> 00:00:53.730
Then flip the squash on the different side and cook them for another 2.5 minutes

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.066
My squash is about 180 - 200 grams a piece

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:04.203
But if you have larger squash

00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:06.000
Just add a little extra time in the microwave

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.016
And you want to make sure they are soft on touch

00:01:08.016 --> 00:01:08.767
when they are done

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.453
And be careful, they are going to be super hot when you take them out

00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:13.313
So use towels or some glvoes

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:15.447
2.5 minutes are about to be done

00:01:15.447 --> 00:01:16.843
And we are going to flip the squash over

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.829
They are hot so use your gloves

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:21.632
or kitchen towels

00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:22.371
Paper towels

00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:25.091
And we are going to cook them in the microwave for another 2.5 minutes

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:27.808
And the second set of 2.5 minutes have past

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:30.907
So I am going to take these out. We are have way through with our squash pasta

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:32.942
I am going to cut the squashes in half

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:34.389
I am getting excited

00:01:35.826 --> 00:01:40.626
If you cut from the middle to the ends, it's going to be a little bit easier

00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:42.155
the middle part has seeds

00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:43.877
So we are going to clean that out

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.440
Basically take out all the intestants of the squash

00:01:47.838 --> 00:01:48.798
just like that

00:01:48.798 --> 00:01:51.134
And everything else except for the squash skin is pasta

00:01:51.134 --> 00:01:54.081
And if you are going to put your fork just this way

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:56.990
It's actually going to give you nice strains of pasta

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.507
look at that

00:01:57.537 --> 00:01:59.057
You see how it comes out

00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:03.133
You going to make sure to get all the pasta out

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:07.037
So those two squashes make about a half of plate of pasta

00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:09.597
If you want to make a full plate, obviously use 4

00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:11.680
And you can use Parnassian cheese

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:12.806
Salt or paper

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:13.798
Pasta sauce

00:02:13.798 --> 00:02:15.067
Anything you want on it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.030
I actually love it original

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.474
Because it's so crunchy on the outside

00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:21.726
And it has an amazing flavor already

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:23.966
I don't really salt or season it with anything

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.290
umm

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.625
it's very, very delicious

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.899
I guess there is one thing I can beautify it with

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:31.334
The naked tomato

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:33.489
We peeled this tomato in the previous video

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.793
It's just an original tomato without a skin

00:02:35.793 --> 00:02:37.484
And I am just going to cut a small slice

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:39.906
And eat it with a pasta

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:43.375
umm

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.430
AMAZING!

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.516
Very refreshing

00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:46.961
Amazingly filling

00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:48.126
You would not believe it

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.833
Just like any regular pasta

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:51.440
But without all the calories

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.409
Well I hope you enjoyed this video, let me know in comments below what you think

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.085

00:02:56.966 --> 00:02:58.006
Pasta and Pizza

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.665
Spaghetti pasta

00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:00.969
- and plus, it's very healthy

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.769
That's it

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.255
Now we are just going to pop them in the oven

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.230
Hahah

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.320
It's very rich in vitamin a

00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:08.074
B, C, D...

00:03:09.643 --> 00:03:10.143
hahaha

00:03:12.177 --> 00:03:12.677
- good?
