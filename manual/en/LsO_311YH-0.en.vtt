00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.050
Joe: With this system, you can build a huge
list of rent to own buyers who will snatch

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.509
up your houses often on the first day you
have them.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:13.090
Here are the lead capture pages for building
a powerful list of buyers.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.560
These pages educate, build a relationship
with, and sell the leads you send to it.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.480
Leads fill out a simple form on the page that
tells what criteria they have for buying a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480
home.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.869
These pages even tell you how much money they
have for a down payment.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.880
Joe: Once they're on your list, they receive
a series of educational emails that are sent

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.280
out over time.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.910
This means that even if they aren't ready
to buy today, you'll be in touch with them

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.320
over the upcoming weeks and months and be
there for them at the top of their mind when

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.750
they are ready.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.430
You can also send personalized emails to them
whenever you get a new property to sell.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.890
You can send pictures, videos and complete
listing information for your properties.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.820
If you use the techniques taught in the training
videos, you can build a very large, very responsive

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.230
list of buyers in a matter of weeks or months.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.660
Joe: Let me show you the lead capture pages.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.720
There are lots of pieces to this system so
don't get overwhelmed by the complexity, because

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.230
it's not difficult to use once you get up
and running.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.490
And there are different pieces that you'll
need to use at different times, plus, there

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.190
are very clear video tutorials that show you
how to use these sites, and how and where

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.000
to click and what to fill out.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.650
Joe: What I want to show you here, though,
is the buyers site - this is the main admin

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.550
for the clone sites.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.390
And if you go to the buyers site, you'll see
this page here.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.310
This is created for Indianapolis which is
where I'm at.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.850
There's an audio here that explains how rent
to buy works and if I scroll down this page,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.780
you'll see the text (this is actually the
text of the audio).

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.550
Joe: But it also has a form on here that buyers
can fill out to give us their contact information.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.830
They can tell us how much they've got for
a down payment, they can tell us how much

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.229
they can afford on a monthly payment, and
the size of the property that they want and

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.890
any comments they might have.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.120
Then they can register as a buyer.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.520
When they do that, this form will send you
an email and it will place them into the auto

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520
responder.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.160
Joe: The auto responder looks like this.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.670
You've seen it before, but here's the list
of buyers that we're dealing with.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.990
I want to filter this list of buyers and send
them all an email.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.320
I can do that simply by clicking on 'filter'.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.100
It'll show me all of these people here.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.990
I can click on campaigns, new campaign, broadcast,
and I can either put in a text message or

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.420
I can do an html message.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.870
Html allows me to send them pictures.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.330
It allows me to send them videos and all kinds
of things in en email, so it's a very cool

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.260
thing to have in your control.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.920
Joe: Also, I can look at the messages that
are going out to these folks when they subscribe.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.870
As you can see, each one of these is a separate
email that's going out that explains how rent

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.420
to buy works and builds relationships with
these folks.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.770
It sells them on the idea of rent to buy and
it builds your credibility.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.590
And of course, you can change, edit, delete,
and move the order around any way you like.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.349
I would use it the way I've written it; I've
done this before - I know what I'm doing,

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:21.000
so use these processes to build a relationship
with your people.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.230
Joe: There's one other landing page which
I want to show you (which I already showed

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.970
you) but I didn't point out the fact that
this page also has a place for them to opt

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.290
in simply by clicking on this rent to buy
homes tab and then they can put the same information

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.520
in here.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.400
Joe: And while I'm in this site, I might as
well show you that this is also a landing

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.980
page for investors, and here's another landing
page for investors as well.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.730
Plus, there's a lot of features within this
listing site which I don't have time to show

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.560
you right now, but also come with this system.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.599
Joe: I can't emphasize enough how important
it is to build lists of buyers and sellers

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.390
like this.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.910
And how, when you do that, it makes your job
a lot easier, and you're able to work with

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.069
these people over and over and over again.

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.639
So use these systems.
