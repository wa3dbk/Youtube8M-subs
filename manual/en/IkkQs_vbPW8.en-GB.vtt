00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.860
The story started in 2003 when I was at art school.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.580
The work that I was nominated for

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.760
is called 'Postscript II (Berlin)'. 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.360
This particular work was about a journey in Berlin

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.280
which somehow would relate to some personal trajectories, some fictive perhaps.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.800
I never really knew the difference in the end. 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.020
Berlin was this, kind of, strange enigmatic place.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.680
When I was born, the Russians were invading

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.660
and we were all living in the basement of the house. 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.859
The work is also a contemplation, a reflection on another work that I’ve been performing

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.080
or trying to work with since 2003.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.100
So basically I’ve been performing this piece called 'Hahn/Huhn' for ten years. 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.100
There was a certain point after ten years of performing the same piece

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.640
I lost that sense of enquiry.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.100
The 'Postscript' was really an attempt to think about how long can you re-perform this piece for 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.480
and I think it has come to the point where the only way

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.740
I could answer that or question that, properly was through speech again in a totally different register. 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.160
The picture of the smoke rising

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.060
it just reminds me of a certain moment of confrontation. 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.560
I’m lost. 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.560
All these images now are only for me full stops.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.620
It was much more like a conversational piece.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.640
It was in one take. There was no script.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.380
There was not much editing afterwards either.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.400
It was more or less a piece without an audience, without that live aspect. 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.980
I felt very much that I needed to disembody myself in terms of that sense of the voice 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.680
and the body being there live performing

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.640
and by making this work 'Postscript'

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.540
it was also a sense of saying the voice belongs but the body has gone

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.920
I can’t perform in that way live to an audience to hold all the elements together.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.540
I think presence is something that I’m only coming to terms with now

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.340
now that I’m performing a lot less

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.680
and there are elements, components, that I have, that come together during the install phase

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.340
so that sense of presence, of performative presence before a show opens

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.300
is important for me in order to, kind of, maintain a logic, an inner logic to bring it all together. 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.960
There is, like, a source or a bank of images that I always work around or work with

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.060
but usually I’m recycling lots of old images from the past.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.300
Often I’m taking images that are 10-15 years pre dating the work’s existence

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.160
or trying of, like, discovering them.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.640
I think it’s also about discovering the images that I have in my archive.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.920
Working with this fragile technology, that freedom of continuously shifting and changing the work

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.500
it’s a massive advantage 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.740
and it’s also how I work with speech and performing.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.540
There is this, kind of, sense of immediacy and improvisation

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.200
that I’ve become so accustomed to now

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.000
and used to that method of working. 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.560
it's important that I don't really, that it's not too controlling, that the images

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.540
they come and go along the way.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.220
Every time it’s shown new slides come and go

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.560
it changes all the time.
