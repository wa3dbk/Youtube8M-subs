00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.980
Hello, in this segment we're going to cover
laying out the chains. We're doing this in

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.580
the garage, but you'd be doing this out in
whatever the environment or the situation

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.840
calls for. Whether you're putting the chains
on because you've become stuck or you're putting

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.220
the chains on because you had to pull over
and highway conditions warrant it, and they're

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.199
needed or else it's a mandatory requirement
to travel over one of the mountain passes.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.569
You've got a couple different options of how
you put the chains on. If you're stuck, you're

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.780
going to be stuck dealing with putting the
chains on pretty much where the car is at

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.710
and one of the things you'll want to pay attention
to while you're attempting to get unstuck

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.050
initially. If you're starting to dig down
and not moving anywhere, the digger, or excuse

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.440
me, the deeper you dig that hole. The harder
it's going to make applying the chains. If

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.600
you dig the hole down deep enough to where
the body of the car comes down and contacts

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.990
the snow, then you'll find it extremely difficult
to get a jack underneath it to jack it up

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.900
to give you any assistance. A shovel is a
good idea to have along with you in winter

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.920
driving situations. If you're putting the
chain on as the vehicle sits, you drape the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.439
chain up over the top of the vehicle or the
top of the tire and curl around down the bottom

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.210
and fasten it down below. In order to do so,
you'd have to remove all the snow from right

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.439
around the surface of the tire so you get
the chain pulled very tight. The problem with

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.030
that being is you have to reach around the
back to make that connection back there as

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.570
well. If you pulled over to have the chains
put on as a preventive situation, then you

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.619
could just take the chains and lay them out.
Now remember when you're laying them out,

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.649
there marked on there, this side to the tire,
so you have to flip it upside down so that

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.630
would be to the tire. Lay both the chains
right underneath the front tires. If it's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.009
a front wheel drive. Then just take the vehicle
and put it in neutral or in reverse and just

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.100
slowly back up about a foot and a half and
that will locate the car right on the center

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.679
of the chain. Then you could pull the connections
on the chain on the top half of the tire.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.140
Where you're out of the snow and you don't
have the cold conditions where you have to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.280
put your hands down there and dig the snow
out and various situations of that nature.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.450
So I thought I'd point that out to you, that
you have a couple different options, depending

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.480
on the situation. I'll go ahead at this time
and I'll continue to show you how to put the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.540
chains on the front wheel as you would be
sitting in this condition. Please watch our

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.590
next segment and we'll cover installing the
chains.
