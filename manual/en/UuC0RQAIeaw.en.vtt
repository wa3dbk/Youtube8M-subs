Hello, and welcome to the first edition of
Yum!

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.090
I'm your host Valerie Quirk.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.700
Each week we're going to introduce you to
the best eateries around the NYU area.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.890
Today we're bring students Lizzie and Emily
to Pommes Frites,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.260
an eatery that serves one dish many different
ways.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.820
Pommes Frites, located on 2nd Avenue between
7th Street and St. Marks,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.540
is New York City's twist on a European tradition.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.589
They serve thick cut, freshly made belgian
fries,

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.149
that customers can choose to top with over
25 different sauces,

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.180
cheese, chicken gravy, or onions.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.129
They're open Sunday-Thursday: 11:30 - 1:00
am

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:53.840
and 11:30 - 3:30 am Fridays and Saturdays.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:04.180
It looks busy right now...

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.360
Hi, what are your two most popular sauces?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.330
roasted garlic and sweet mango chutney.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.710
Okay, we'll have two regulars, please, with
a side of roasted garlic,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.020
and a side of the sweet mango chutney.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.900
Alright, lets get started!

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.320
Wait, so what did we actually order?

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.200
Ok, so we ordered the two most popular sauces,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.980
the sweet mango chutney and the roasted garlic,
mayonnaise.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.009
These fries look amazing!

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.370
Ok, I'm gonna try the sweet mango chutney
first.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.370
I'll try the roasted garlic.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.370
The sweet mango chutney isn't too sweet, it's
subtle.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.670
So, it kinda just tastes mayonnaise-y, which
I think is a good thing.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.900
I know right?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.030
If you're gonna eat something fried,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.130
you might as well eat it with a lot of mayonnaise.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.539
But, if you love garlic, the garlic one is
a little strong,

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.060
but it's not overpowering.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.820
I feel confident going out with this breath
after.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.430
So, how was it?

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.430
So good!

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.430
Really phenomenal!

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.480
Good place for college students?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.480
Definitely!

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.860
I noticed on the door that they have late
night hours,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.980
and they're open til 3:30 on weekends, so
I'll definitely be coming back here.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.400
It's so affordable and it's so close to NYU,
right off of St. Marks.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.640
It's such an easy place to just stop by and
have a quick bite.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.520
Well thank you guys so much for coming!

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.960
Oh, thank you!

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.770
And, thank YOU for watching our first episode
of Yum!
