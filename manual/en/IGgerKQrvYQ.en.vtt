00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.500
So, next thing we're going to do is a double
jump and a double turn. So, both of these

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.280
we went over earlier in one of the series,
but we're going to go over it again within

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.030
Baar Mbaye. So what you want to remember when
you're doing the double jump, it's just the

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.520
five-step jump. You put your feet together,
and then you do the jump right after that.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.850
So you want to make sure that you're kind
of landing on both feet, instead of left to

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.640
right, right, left, right, left, it wants
to be more like, left to right, right, left,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.710
right, together. And then you go back into
the jump. So if we just do a few jumps over

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.850
and over again to get the feel of that. Everything's
really light on your feet. You don't want

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.460
to be stomping too much. So that's the double
jump, or triple jump. You can do as many jumps

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.960
as you want. And then we're going to do the
double turn. And the double turn is the same

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.210
rhythm as the double jump. Left to right,
right, left, right, left. The double turn

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.829
is going to be the same way. You're going
to pick up your foot. Turn. Right, left, right,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.820
left. So you pick up your left foot, and right,
right, left, right, left. It's the same exact

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.560
foot rhythm as the jump that we just did.
So put those together, and then we'll do them

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:24.770
with the drum rhythm. So, double jump, and
again. Pick up your foot, right, left, right,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:46.570
left. So there we go. Let's try that with
the drums now...if he's ready. Let's try it

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:58.491
again with the drum. Turn. Very good. Okay.
So, you can do as many turns as you want,

00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:01.759
too, but just remember you want to kind of
...you shimmy your hips a little when you

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.710
pick up your foot, pick up your left foot.
Right, right, left, right, left. Let's just

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.269
try the double turn once by itself with the
drum. Just a little side to side. And we'll

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:27.689
do the double turn. One more time, and....very
good! And we're good.
