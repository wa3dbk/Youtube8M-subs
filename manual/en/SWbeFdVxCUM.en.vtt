 [Music] 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hi YouTube! It’s Angelica, and today I’m gonna 
 do a super fast video for you.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It’s gonna be my hair regimen, so it’s what 
 I do to my hair, when. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And in subsequent videos I’m going to show you step-by-step how 
 I moisturize, how I seal, how I clarify  

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:52.000
um, and a lot of these products I make myself and I’ll tell you the ones I buy, which 
 ones I like. So that’ll all be in another video so this video will be super fast!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Once a month, I clarify my hair and 
 I do a regular protein treatment.  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:01:19.000
As needed I do a light protein treatment.  

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Ideally I do it every week or every other week, um, 
 but I just do it, you know, as needed.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I also moisturize my hair and I seal my ends, um, which 
 is really important. I’m gonna do a video about that.   

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I also detangle my hair as needed, 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
usually when I’m switching in between hair styles or 
 if I notice that it’s really tangled.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So every week is when I do my wash or my co-wash,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which just means that you wash your hair with conditioner,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and then I do my main detangling

00:01:15.000 --> 00:02:33.000
About every other day, I have to do something different to my hair 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:02:40.000
so usually it’ll be refreshing my curls or changing the style up   

00:01:24.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Every day, at least once a day, I use a leave-in conditioner.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Sometimes I do it twice, 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:03:01.000
sometimes I do it three times.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I just do what my hair needs,  

00:01:34.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and that’s kind of the tip. Just do what your 
 hair needs and you should be fine. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Also every night before I go to bed, I do wrap my hair.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:03:27.000
If my hair’s curly, I’ll use a satin bonnet, 
 and if it’s straight, I will wrap it.   

00:01:46.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So that’s pretty much my hair regimen.  

00:01:48.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Like I said, I’ll take you through it step-by-step 
 so you really don’t have to worry.  

00:01:52.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The only thing that you need to keep in mind is 
 that you should use this as a guide. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Everybody’s hair is different,   

00:01:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
so your regimen will be different and also keep in mind that as your 
 hair improves, or just changes naturally you’ll have to adjust your regimen.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So just keep those things in mind.  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Thank you so much for watching. I hope you liked my intro. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:04:24.000

00:02:15.000 --> 00:04:32.000
