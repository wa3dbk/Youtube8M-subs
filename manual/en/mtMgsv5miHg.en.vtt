00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.020
From its oldest city to the origin of
its own name, the state of Florida can

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.510
trace its roots back to the era of
Spanish exploration. But while that

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.800
heritage is quite evident, few people
realize that the greatest legacy of the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:34.170
Spanish explorers is the state's vast
agriculture industry. While it might be

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.460
best known for citrus and other fruits
and vegetables, Florida agriculture

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.250
actually started with Spanish cattle.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.070
Beginning with Ponce de LeÃ³n's
expedition in 1521 and continuing well

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.719
into the 1600s, herds of Andalusian
cattle were introduced into what is now

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.340
the United States as a source of beef
for Spanish explorers, missionaries and

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.900
colonists. The first ranches in North
America began to appear during this

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.510
period. Founded by Jesuit and Franciscan
friars, they were used to manage the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.120
cattle owned by missions established
across northern Florida. By 1700, there

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.610
were more than 30 privately owned
ranches--or ranchos--in Florida. As their

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.900
herds increased, these ranchos began to
ship cattle to the large trading center

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.010
of Cuba. Florida's agriculture industry
had begun. Over time, however, Spanish

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.580
settlements were abandoned in the face
of British expansion, and their livestock

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.260
was left to roam wild in the harsh
Florida wilderness. Hardy and well

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.220
adapted to the state's climate and
environment, the cattle flourished on the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.170
extensive prairies and rangeland of
Florida. By the early 1800s, Florida's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.700
pioneer farm families established
ranches across the newly acquired U.S.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.770
territory. Florida cowboys, who many
believe were nicknamed "crackers" for the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.940
sound made by their whips cracking in
the air, would hunt stray cows moving

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.959
through the Palmetto covered landscape.
This breed of cattle became so

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.769
identified with Florida's rough
conditions, that it too was given the

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.490
name "cracker". Following the Civil War, Florida

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.450
was one of the first states to establish
a viable economy in the South

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.850
based on the trade of cracker cattle.
During the Reconstruction Era, many

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.720
pioneer families were left with
worthless Confederate dollars. But

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.860
families like the Carltons, the Likes,
the Summerlins, and the Henrys begin

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.060
exporting cattle to Cuba on the
condition that they be paid in gold coin.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.890
The trade of cracker cattle was very
lucrative, and millions of Spanish gold

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.470
doubloons poured into Florida's post-war
economy. In one 10 year period, beginning

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.560
in 1868, 1.6 million head of cattle were
shipped from the docks of Tampa, Manatee

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.420
and Punta Rassa, making Florida America's leading exporter. A number of Florida's

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.010
oldest and largest businesses began as
cattle ranching operations during this

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.570
era and this cattle trade became the
foundation of Florida's vast

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.900
agricultural economy. But the reign of
the cracker cattle would soon come to an

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.100
end. In the late 1800s, ranchers began to
import larger purebred beef and dairy

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.530
breeds into Florida. To help these new
lines acclimate to the harsh Florida

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.970
conditions, they were crossbred with the
hardy disease and parasite resistant

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.640
Florida cracker cattle. But by the 1930s
another new breed was introduced to

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.829
Florida's cattle industry. Brahman cattle,
also resistant to parasites and disease,

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.390
and able to withstand Florida's heat,
were cross bred with cracker cattle and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.760
produced a better beef animal. Crossbreeding with Brahman cattle became

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.280
very popular and significantly changed
the genetic makeup of herds. Almost

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.049
without notice, the pure cracker breed--
descendants of 16th century Spanish

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.750
cattle--was being bred out of existence.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.660
By the late 1960s, only a handful of pure
cracker cattle were left, scattered

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.670
across the state on the ranches of
Florida's oldest farming families. In

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.800
June of 1965, Florida Agriculture
Commissioner Doyle Connor, in his keynote

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.730
address to the Florida Cattlemen's
Convention, encouraged Florida's cattle

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.020
industry leaders to do something to
preserve the historically significant

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.850
cattle which had been the foundation of
the state's cattle industry. Many agreed

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.180
that the historic cracker breed was
about to be lost forever

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.590
and members of the Florida Cattlemen's
Association decided to take action.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.940
In 1970, Mrs. Zona Bass and Mrs. Zeta Hunt, daughters of pioneer cattleman James

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.740
Durant, donated five heifers and a bull,
descendants of their father's original

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.960
herd, to the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services. While

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.890
a few small privately owned herds were
being maintained throughout the state,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.360
the Durant's line was regarded by many
in the industry as having the purest

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.250
cracker cattle bloodline. Entrusted with
the preservation of the breed, the

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.040
department used these donated cattle to
begin building a herd. The cattle were

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.300
kept at the department's agricultural
complex in Tallahassee, and during the

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.710
1970s, as their numbers increased, a new
herd was established at the

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.660
Withlacoochee State Forest. Animals were transferred between these herds to keep

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.630
the genetic base broad while maintaining
the pure Durant's bloodlines. Other

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.140
cracker cattle herds were established
during the same time period by the

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.040
Division of Parks and Recreation at Lake
Kissimmee State Park and the Paynes

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:06.310
Prairie State Preserve. To ensure the
purity of the herds, a selection and

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.810
screening program was implemented in
1985. Cattle that did not meet strict

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.580
breed criteria were culled from the
herds. Breeding stock from these nucleus

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.800
herds is made available to interested
parties through annual sales. The

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.360
department continues to maintain the
Durant's line of cracker cattle,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.180
occasionally bringing in Durant's line
cattle from other cracker herds to

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.500
broaden the genetic base.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.759
To ensure the preservation of the breed,
the Florida Cracker Cattle Association

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.039
was formed in 1988. Through adopted breed standards and an evaluation committee,

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:48.310
the Association selected cattle to be
registered as foundation stock. In 1989,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.930
the historic first annual Florida
Cracker Cattle Association gathering was

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.360
held at the Withlacoochee State Forest.
Since 1990, the annual gatherings have

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.740
included a public sale of cracker cattle
from private and state herds, giving

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.270
folks the opportunity to be a part of
this preservation effort. The annual

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.050
gathering and sales are hosted by the
Department of Agriculture and Consumer

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:18.909
Services in conjunction with the Florida
Cracker Cattle Association. Today Florida

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:23.889
cracker cattle are prized as living
tangible links to Florida's agricultural

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:30.120
heritage and they're making a place for
themselves in Florida's future.
