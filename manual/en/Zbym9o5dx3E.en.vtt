hey whats up guys, here is another video by
Ratchets and Wrenches and today I am going

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.140
to do a quick video on.. basically how to
get your radio code, well radio serial number

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:18.050
and than your radio code for your Honda as
you remember we did a timing belt job on this

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.050
Honda Civic, it's a 2005 Honda Civic and ahh
for we had to disconnect the battery for that

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.110
and as a result we need to re enter our radio
code but since I got this car used and at

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.289
an Auction it didn't come with an owners manual
and no radio code, just going to quickly show

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:43.999
you how to retrieve your radio serial number
and than your radio code and enter it so you

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:50.640
won't have to be bored to death while driving
more than 5 minutes.. ok there is two ways

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.210
you can get your radio's serial number, the
first way is that you pull your radio and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.269
than look up the serial number on the side
or the rear, its probably on a sticker somewhere

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.969
on it but the second much easier way is that
you put your key in the ignition and than

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.670
you turn it on to the accessory position next
you hold down key number 1 and key number

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.670
6 and than you press your power button once,
and a second time and there is your serial

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.420
number, our is two eight zero nine three five
nine five, and again it should come on a second

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.030
time there we go 2 8 0 9 3 5 9 5 so you want
to write that down it's an eight digit code

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.259
for this 2005 Honda Civic and next what you
want to do is basically just call your local

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.609
dealership and explain the situation try to
sound as legitimate as you can so they don't

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.119
think you stole the radio or something but
you know on this Honda Civic it only took

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.670
one try at the local dealership they gave
me the I gave them the serial number and they

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.520
gave me the code but if you dont succeed at
first try different dealerships, try different

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.410
dealerships in different city's different
states whatever until it works dont let them

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.080
bring you the car in and than charge you a
100 dollars for one hour labor fee or whatever

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.080
to give you the code ok. And our radio code
for this one is 3 1 4 2 5 actually I haven't

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.250
entered this yet but I am gona try to figure
this out so we got 3 1 4 2 5 that was not

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.200
how it works I guess Ok this is actually taking
me a couple of time to enter my radio code

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.430
and I don't know why but anyway so I got the
key in the accessory position turn the radio

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:02.159
on and got the word CODE appearing and than
just gona put in the code 3 1 4 2 5 there

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:10.709
we go.. finally but yea for some reason I
was doing exactly this and after we got the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.860
radio code I did exactly this and put in 3
1 4 2 5 and on 2 I would hear a beep it would

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.159
been and than it would say error so keep trying
that a couple of times still didn't work I

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:30.159
ended up actually just right now I reset disconnected
the battery again and since I had the code

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.989
I just came here and did it directly just
put it in so if you run into this trouble

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.780
or this problem you know you can try that
and hopefully it'll work for you ok so yea

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.030
hope this video helps people out there I am
sure if it did please give it a thumbs up
