00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.370
Hi, let's say you want to make quick and easy Bisquick recipes 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.200
but you are out of Bisquick. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.810
Today's recipe is for that case.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.700
To make Bisquick substitute, you will need:

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.210
1 cup all-purpose flour

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.610
1½ teaspoons baking powder

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.010
½ teaspoon salt

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.410
and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.510
First, sift flour, 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.910
baking powder, 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.330
salt. 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.960
And whisk until combined.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:05.330
And add in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.080
And stir until combined.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.580
Instead of vegetable oil, 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.080
you can also use shortening or melted unsalted butter.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.010
And transfer to an air-tight container.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.900
And it can be stored for 2 months.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.920
Today it was baking basic and tomorrow it's baked cheesecake. 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.240
