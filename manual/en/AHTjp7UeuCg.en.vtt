Hello! My name is Lindsay on behalf of expertvillage.com.
In this clip I’m going to be showing you

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.020
how to sew the tabs together. First you’re
going to take your tab and you’re going

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.119
to fold it length wise and you’re going
to sew the edge of it right here and you can

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:38.680
put the straight pins so that it holds it
together…and since the width was 3 inches

00:00:38.680 --> 00:01:07.289
this should be 1 ½ since it’s in half.
So we’re going to sew this down and now

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:13.270
that we’ve done that we’re going to turn
it inside out, oh this was inside out we’re

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.300
going to turn it right side out and just open
where the hole is and just push it through

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.450
with your fingers
and with the thing like this, this way you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.930
won’t see the seam we’ve just made. And
now we’re going to fold it in half length

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:42.470
wise so you’ll have a skinny panel and make
sure that you make these two ends meet also

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:57.110
and you’re going to sew those down.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.290
Now we have one tab top.
