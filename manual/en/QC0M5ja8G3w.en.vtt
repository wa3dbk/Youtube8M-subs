00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:12.418
My daughter asked for an American Girl doll
for her birthday.

00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:14.828
Are American Girl dolls worth the money?

00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:18.517
Skip the iPhone, go for the expensive gift!

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:23.108
Or ask for the American Girl doll and hope
Mom settles on a new phone.

00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:25.808
The doll is only about $100.

00:00:25.808 --> 00:00:31.588
And, like Barbie dolls, you'll be asked to
get the play set, the book, the accessories,

00:00:31.588 --> 00:00:34.838
the clothing, the furniture and more.

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:38.938
So the doll is just a lead in to a $500 purchase.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:43.778
Yes, and that's assuming your daughter doesn't
want to get her doll her own doll.

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:45.078
Say what?

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:49.857
You can buy American Girl dolls for the American
Girl dolls, so the doll can pretend it has

00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:50.857
a doll.

00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:53.098
Now that's getting silly.

00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:57.828
The accessories are like paying for a haircut
at a fancy salon and walking away with beauty

00:00:57.828 --> 00:01:04.398
treatments, cosmetics, expensive herbal conditioner
and spending as much on the extras as you

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:06.128
did the original.

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:07.378
Or more.

00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:10.528
They've got expensive stuff in those stores.

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:13.978
That's how they can afford to have so many
mall stores.

00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:17.848
They have a doll hospital to repair a doll
my daughter might damage.

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:23.878
If you daughter damages that many of her toys,
don't spend $100 or more on a doll.

00:01:23.878 --> 00:01:27.568
She wants to have a best friend to her best
friend's doll.

00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:30.988
As a set, they're almost $300.

00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:33.687
Just tell her their dolls have to be friends
when they play.

00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:38.588
You don't have to spend $150 for a play date.

00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:41.478
The girls want to have the outfits from the
books, too.

00:01:41.478 --> 00:01:44.458
Those are $30 an outfit.

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:48.268
For $30, you can buy your daughter an outfit.

00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:53.348
These dolls are so high quality and rich in
history, I'd like to get her one.

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:58.867
Can you get a grandparent to buy her one,
so you don't feel so guilty about the cost?

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:01.878
Spoiling grandkids, I guess that's what grandparents
are for.
