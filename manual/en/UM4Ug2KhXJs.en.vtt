00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.100
Hi I'm Sophie and welcome to my world.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.460
Today we are going to be making coin purses out of duct tape.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.290
Isn't this cute? You can keep your lunch money in there, your hair clips,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.600
rubber bands whatever you want. Now to do that we're gonna need a piece at our fabulous

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.640
duct tape fabric that we've already made ahead of time and we're gonna need a template.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.800
Now you can go to Sophie dash world dot com and download anyone of our

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.140
fabulous templates or you can make one yourself and I'm gonna show you how to do that right now.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.320
Just gonna need a deli lid one of these salad containers

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.829
that you can get anyone of those fabulous delicatessens.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.140
You're gonna need a sharpie pen and you are going to trace

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.910
up and around the circle just like

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.870
that for one half of the circle. Then you gonna take your

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.140
ruler and just from one side

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.780
draw a straight line down and on the other side

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.140
draw a straight line down and that's gonna give you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.570
a lovely little template. I've already
got one

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.850
cut out here so I'm gonna use this one and
I'm gonna place it on my fabric just like this.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.730
Now some people like to trace around
with a Sharpie pen that's great if you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.190
happen to have really good uh

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.840
scissor skills but for me I always have
a tendency to cut

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.270
inside the line and end up with Sharpie
pen on my

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.410
fabulous duct tape wallet so what I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to put a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.700
little loop of tape on the back of here and I'm gonna cut around my template

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880
just like this.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.500
Don't get too concerned if you have a little bit of a jagged edge or whatever.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.160
Don't worry because you can always trim later if you need to you.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.060
So we're gonna come up and around and trim that.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.140
Get rid of the excess and get rid of my template

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.110
and now I'm ready to make my little purse. 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.660
So I'm gonna fold my purse up so that I
have enough

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.680
of a flap that flaps over and I'm happy with

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.770
how that looks and now I'm gonna need

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.990
five pieces to secure my side.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.860
What I'm gonna do is actually take piece
of duct tape and I'm going to rip it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.030
in half long ways just like this. I'm
gonna fold

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.770
up my wallet and I'm going to place

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.200
piece just like this halfway

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.470
so that there's still half of the tape folded

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.840
over there and now I'm gonna take it do it on the other side as well

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.840
just like that. Now I'm gonna pick it up, turn
it over,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.680
and for the sticky side over the side.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.090
This is going to secure my duct tape

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.130
pocket just like that. I'm gonna cut off the extract

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.670
with my scissors.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.400
Now I have a duct tape purse.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.000
I want to make sure that it stays shut

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and so to do that I'm actually going to be using uh

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.180
magnets. Now you can use any various assortment of things you could use

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.480
buttons you can use um velcro

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.210
you can use a lot of different things but I'm gonna show you how to use a magnet.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.550
Because magnets for me

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.920
are the easiest way to go. I'm gonna take a little tiny square

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.740
of duct tape, place it right over top

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.510
of my magnet wherever I want to place my magnet on the top just like that.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.520
And I'm gonna rub that down so it's nice and secure just

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.740
like that. Now here's the easiest way to make sure

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.000
that your magnet is in the correct position

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.620
and also polarized the right way because you know magnets were either force each other apart

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.300
or they'll attract and you want yours to attract and not push itself away.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.720
So I'm gonna teach you an easy way to make sure that you do that and do that

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.560
gonna take a little piece of tape and you're gonna place it with the sticky side

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.760
up right on top of your magnet and then

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.700
you're gonna take a magnet this is fun watch this and you're just gonna drop it you gonna let it go

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.180
and it's gonna find the exact place that it needs to be on top of that other magnet.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.989
Now I'm gonna fold over my flap and I'm just gonna push it down

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.549
all around and what's gonna happen is when I lifted up at magnet's is gonna be in the

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.270
perfect place and the perfect position and
the perfect polarization so watch this

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.430
there you go. It's as easy

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.270
you can imagine. Well that's it for today

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.580
on uh sophie's world. I can't wait to see
what you're gonna create.
