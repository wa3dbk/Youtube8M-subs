Hey guys it's Jen! and today i'm here with Jeff.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.960
JEFF: Hey guys.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.340
JEN: And we're going to be doing something a little bit different today.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.640
JEN: Basically, I've got an idea from..

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.400
JEN: Grace Helbig

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.120
JEN: But I'm putting my own twist onto it.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.380
JEN: We're going to be doing something called

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.300
JEN: "The Mystery Drink Challenge."

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.760
JEN: So basically here's how it works...

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.720
JEN: We have 10 mystery drinks in front of us-

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.840
JEN: in these red cups.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.980
JEN: And we both have our own clear glass here.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.980
JEN: Our good friend, Drew, behind the camera

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.520
JEN: is going to be asking us

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.480
JEN: Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader questions

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.760
JEN: So once our questions are asked

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.520
JEN: we're going to write down our answers

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.220
JEN: on the piece of paper in front of us

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.020
JEN: and try to hide it from the other person

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.140
JEN: whoever gets the question right

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.980
JEN: gets to pick any one of these drinks and

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.160
JEN: pour in into the opponent's...
JEFF: Into the other person's cup

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.320
