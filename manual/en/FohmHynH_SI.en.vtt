00:00:00.551 --> 00:00:03.497
A car is driving at 90
kilometers per hour.

00:00:03.497 --> 00:00:07.134
How far, in meters, does
it travel in three seconds?

00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:09.607
So to answer this question
we'll first convert

00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:14.111
90 kilometers per hour
into meters per second,

00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:18.169
then determine the distance
traveled in three seconds.

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.506
To do this conversion
we'll use unit fractions,

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:25.344
so begin by writing 90 kilometers
per hour as a fraction,

00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:28.844
which would be 90 kilometers per one hour.

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:36.218
And our goal here is to
convert this rate into a rate

00:00:36.218 --> 00:00:38.885
where we have meters per second.

00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:45.604
Let's begin by converting
the kilometers to meters.

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:47.162
We'll do this using the conversion

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:50.773
that one kilometer equals 1,000 meters.

00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:52.896
So we're going to multiply
it by a unit fraction,

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:56.461
and because we want
kilometers to simplify out,

00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:58.807
we'll put kilometers in the denominator,

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:00.659
and meters in the numerator.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.393
And again, the conversion
is that 1,000 meters

00:01:04.393 --> 00:01:06.558
equals one kilometer.

00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:08.324
Because these units are equal,

00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:10.332
this fraction is equal to one,

00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:14.005
but notice how the units of
kilometers now simplifies out,

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:15.922
leaving us with meters.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.589
Now we still have to
convert hours to seconds,

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:22.635
so we'll first convert hours to minutes

00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:25.299
by multiplying by another unit fraction.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.961
We don't want hours in our
answer, so we'll have to have

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:33.360
hours in the numerator and
minutes in the denominator.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.801
And the conversion is that
one hour equals 60 minutes,

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:40.143
so we'll have one hour over 60 minutes.

00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:44.169
Notice now the units of
hours simplifies out,

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:48.723
and now we're left to
convert minutes to seconds.

00:01:48.723 --> 00:01:52.244
So we multiply it by
another unit fraction.

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.454
We want minutes to
simplify out, so we'll have

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:58.224
minutes in the numerator and
seconds in the denominator,

00:01:58.224 --> 00:02:01.832
and our conversion is that
one minute equals 60 seconds.

00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:04.085
Minutes simplifies out.

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:06.388
Notice how now we have the correct units,

00:02:06.388 --> 00:02:08.810
so now I'll multiply across the numerator,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.771
multiply across the denominator,

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:14.293
and then divide to get the unit rate.

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.959
So in the numerator we have 90 times 1,000

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.459
times one times one, that's 90,000 meters.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.236
And in our denominator
we have one times one

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:26.903
times 60 times 60
seconds, or 3,600 seconds.

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:31.525
Again, we'll now convert
this to a unit rate

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:33.779
by performing this division.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.529
So 90,000

00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:40.268
divided by 3,600

00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:44.176
is equal to 25

00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:46.822
which means that unit rate is

00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:48.905
25 meters per one second,

00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:55.955
which can also be written
as 25 meters per second.

00:02:57.327 --> 00:02:59.042
But our goal here is to
find the distance traveled

00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:03.209
in three seconds, where
distance equals rate times time.

00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:08.933
So the distance traveled is
equal to 25 meters per second

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.956
times the time of 3 seconds,
which gives us 75 meters.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.115
A lot of times when working
with a distance formula

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:24.650
we leave the units off like we did here,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.871
and then just put the units in our answer.

00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:29.826
But I do want to show this
again leaving the units in.

00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:32.288
We could have written this
as the distance equals

00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:35.288
the rate of 25 meters per one second

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:40.362
times a time of three seconds,
which can be written as

00:03:40.362 --> 00:03:42.279
three seconds over one.

00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:47.617
Notice how in this form the
units of seconds simplifies out

00:03:47.617 --> 00:03:51.367
leaving us with the same
result of 75 meters.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.530
So one thing nice about
leaving the units in

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.495
is that we never have to
second-guess ourselves

00:03:56.495 --> 00:03:58.912
about what the unit should
be because the units

00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:01.076
work themselves out.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:04.576
I hope you found this explanation helpful.
