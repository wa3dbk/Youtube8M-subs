00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.200
I set four different flashes, running on different systems.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.580
Cactus RF60

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.240
Nikon SB-700

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.100
Canon 420EX

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.920
Pentax AF-360FGZ

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.780
Here, I placed V6 set to TX mode on my Canon 50D

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.220
I set it to Relative Power Mode, all groups power at 1/128

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.480
This shot is by the RF60.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.080
I then did the same for all four groups of flashes

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.054
Now I going to set the V6 to Absolute Power Mode.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.780
I forgot to activate the other flash groups so not all of them were detected

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.560
All the groups are on and has the same power output. 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.360
So now I am going to repeat the test shots, now in Absolute Power.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.900
Notice the power is in EV now and all are set to 10.9 EV.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.800
I am going to scroll through the four images

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.300
And you'll notice the power is almost identical on Snoopy's head. 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.840
Some are a bit off, probably due to the angle of the flash head.
