Hi this is Laura Turner and today I'm going
to tell you about how to cite sources in a

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.180
research paper. Depending on how long your
paper is and depending on what your professor's

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.529
wants, this will very much differ between
classes. But if you are doing footnotes or

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.960
you are doing in line citations this is good
stuff for you to know. So first we are going

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.230
to start off with your more in depth paper
which will require footnotes. Footnotes are

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.070
usually used if you have a paper that has
lots and lots of research in it. So therefore

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.690
you sort of have to make special, a special
place for your notes. And more in depth notes

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.110
on these citations. So footnotes are actually
going to have little numbers out to the side

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.809
that will connect with the endnote or the
footnote at the bottom of the page or the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:01.540
end of the page. At the end of the page corresponding
with the number, will be the actual book that

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.370
you have taken or article that you have taken
the quotation from, preceded by the name of

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:16.070
the author, just written out see like this,
Emily C. Bartels, so not if you were doing

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.250
a citation's page where you would say Bartels,
Emily C. in a footnote you will actually write

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:31.030
it all out just as it is. Followed by the
name of the book or the article, and then

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.631
of course the publishing information and the
date of publication in parenthesis followed

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:44.640
by what page you took the quotation from.
Footnotes and of course endnotes, endnotes

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.320
are actually something different. Endnotes
come at the end of the entire essay, so you'll

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.970
have lots of footnotes but you won't have
any footnotes at the bottom of the page which

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.350
have lots of numbers and you'll connect the
numbers to the end of the essay where all

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.420
the numbers will be listed out with the citations
so endnotes are something even bigger. In

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.069
line citation is the most common way of formatting
a research paper or any scholarly paper and

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.940
all you do for that is you actually go, when
you take down your quotations you will put

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.650
at the end of your sentence, the name of the
author of the book from which you took the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.249
citation and the page number. And the reason
why you don't write down the entire book and

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.439
everything about the publishing information
and stuff like that is because you'll have

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.969
a work cited page at the end of your paper.
So therefore, there's no, there's no footnote

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:46.269
to connect that information on the paper but
there will be something at the end. So hopefully

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.890
this will get you started but definitely find
out exactly what your professor wants and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.459
what the requirements of your paper are.
