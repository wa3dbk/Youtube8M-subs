00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.710
Take a look at that 5x 
optical zoom!

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.000
5x digital. 
Very nice looking.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.610
What's up everybody, I'm 
Sam from ComputerTV.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.170
And today I'm going to tell you 
about this Kodak EasyShare.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.950
This is the Z1485 IS. That stands
for image stabilization.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.320
And this is a nice looking,
very powerful

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.470
digital camera.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.740
First of all it's a 
14 megapixel.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.840
How often do you see 14 megapixel 
on a point and shoot camera?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.090
Not very often.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.390
Again, you have a 5x optical zoom.
5x digital.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.820
Just take a look 
at that thing.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.800
You are going to be able to 
get in super, super close.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.880
You have a 35mm lens.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.430
And I'm going to turn 
it over to the back

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.370
and you'll see you have a 2.5 
inch LCD screen right there.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.530
Now you have 32 MB 
of internal storage.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.970
Definitely not 
that much.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.970
But just get an SD or an SDHC 
card and you can have

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.800
all the storage your 
little heart desires.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.040
ISO 6400.  So if you're shooting in low
light, it won't be a problem at all.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.000
Now the coolest thing about 
this Kodak EasyShare is

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.360
that you can shoot 720p 
high def movies on here.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.530
It's so awesome.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.520
Load them up to 
your computer.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.930
Share them with friends 
on Facebook, YouTube.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.700
Whatever you got to do to 
get your movies out there.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.110
Don't just leave them 
on your digital camera.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.130
That's no fun.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.020
You also have panorama on here 
as well as face detection.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.280
Sixteen scene modes.
Five different color modes.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.050
In camera editing. 
So you can resize,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.430
you can crop, you can rotate.
You can create a slide show.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.520
All those things 
without a PC.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.840
And last, but not 
least, this thing

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.510
takes rechargeable 
batteries.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.970
So you don't have to 
worry about going out

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.290
and getting a pair 
of double A's.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.570
OK, so let's take a look
around this thing.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.290
I'm going to 
power back on.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.430
We are in stand-by 
mode right now.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.940
So let's power on.
This is the power button up here.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.540
And you also have your flash 
button right next to it.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.050
As well as your timer and 
your shooting mode.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.720
If you want to go into burst mode you
can do that with just one touch.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.760
OK, so we're powered.
We're powered on.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.920
Right here you have your 
mode selection wheel

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.350
to switch from different 
shooting modes.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.760
Turning over to 
the back, again,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.500
your 2.5 inch 
LCD screen.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.000
You have your wide and 
your tight right here.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.320
And let me show you 
guys this zoom.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.290
It really is killer.
OK, so...

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.720
Look how close 
I can get.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.260
Oh! Very nice. 
Perfect for concerts.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.990
OK, turning 
back over.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.800
Right here you have 
your delete button.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.070
Here, this is 
your display.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.460
Now you have your 
OK button right here.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.180
You have your menu, your 
review, which is also playback.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.570
And your share button here. 
So you can tag photos as favorites

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.360
and share them once you 
are connected to your PC.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.460
Now, let's it over to the side. 
And open this door right here.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.830
There we go.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.570
And this is where 
your card goes.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.370
Your SD or your 
SDHC card.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:11.480
And here is your mini USB 
plug to hook up to a PC.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.760
Alright so, underneath
right here,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.290
rechargeable battery right here.
And you have your base connector

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.410
right next to it.
And your tri-pod mount.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.850
OK, so, I'm going to go into 
all the different modes

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.910
and show you how to work 
this Kodak EasyShare.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.420
Right now we are 
in Smart mode.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.030
And when you're in Smart 
mode and you hit menu

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.900
you'll see that the only thing you 
can control is the picture size.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.510
So the camera is going to 
do all the work for you.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.430
It's going to pick the best, most optimal
settings to get quality photos on here.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.970
And you don't have to
worry about a thing.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.650
Alright, so let's get 
out of here.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.570
And we're going to go into 
a different mode now.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.480
We are going to go 
into P mode.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.760
Which stands for 
Program mode.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.370
Now, as you can see 
you have no control

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.890
over the aperture or
the shutter speed.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.290
But you can control 
the exposure.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.270
And you can control the
ISO and the focus.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.270
But that's it when you're
in Program mode. OK?

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.630
Let's go into Manuea mode.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.820
Now when you're 
in Manual mode

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.610
you'll see that you do 
have control over

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.020
the aperture and the 
shutter speed. OK?

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.220
But you don't have control 
over the exposure.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.950
But you do on the ISO 
and the focus, alright?

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.130
Next mode up.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.040
Panorama mode.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.480
Now Panorama mode 
is pretty cool.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.480
Basically you take three 
shots from left to right

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.090
and the camera will 
paste them together.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.980
You find it more and more often 
on point and shoot cameras.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.780
Not all of them have it, it is a 
nice little feature to have.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.960
Now, a couple of other modes. 
Let's get to.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.770
Right here, this is ISO mode.
This is ISO 6400.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.170
So if you're shooting somewhere
that has low light

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.280
definitely put it on the
ISO...high ISO mode.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.600
Scene mode. OK, we're 
in scene mode now.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.990
Scene mode is fantastic.
You have 16 scenes to choose from.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.810
Everything from portrait, 
to outdoors, fireworks.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.640
Sixteen in total.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.610
So definitely be adventurous. 
Get out of the Auto mode.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.180
And try something new. 
OK. Last, but not least,

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.140
we are going to go 
into Movie mode.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.290
Now, like I said, you can shoot 
HD 720p movies on here.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.040
You need a memory card. OK?
You can't shoot themm without

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.030
the memory card.
But it's really easy.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.900
Just get an SD, SDHC card.
And you can shoot

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.170
high def movies.  
In 720p. Nice.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.440
Right? And the overall design
of this Kodak is really nice.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.030
It's compact. It'll 
fit in your purse.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.920
And it has a nice, firm, grip. 
So you won't drop it.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.250
And the image stabilization makes sure 
that even if your hands shake

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.890
the camera will compensate 
for the tiniest shake.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.990
And make sure that your images 
don' come out blurry at all.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.370
So, again, this is the 
Kodak EasyShare.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.520
This is the 71485 IS.
Definitely check this out.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.960
It comes in a couple 
of different colors.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.020
You got this pretty emerald,
sapphire blue right here.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.260
And you also have thins, 
black, sleek, camera look.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.610
And, don't forget, it comes 
with the docking station

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.630
to charge up. 
And load all your pictures

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.030
and your video 
onto your PC.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.880
Share them 
with friends.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.250
OK, that's all we have for you today. 
I'm Sam.
