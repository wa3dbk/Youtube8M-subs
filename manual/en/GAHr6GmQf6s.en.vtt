00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.670
Hi everyone. Welcome to another Tiny Subversions
video review. Right now you're looking at

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.950
Flotilla, which is a turn-based strategy game
for Windows and Xbox Live Indie Games.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.749
Flotilla's metagame is a heavily simplified
version of Star Control, or Masters of Orion.

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.199
You're the captain of a fleet, flying planet
to planet. Each planet you visit generates

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.961
a random encounter. The events are randomly
generated but the choices you make have a

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:29.019
significant influence on the encounters that
follow.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:37.110
The encounters are typically humorous. In
this one I get drunk and gamble away my entire

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.180
fleet. Rather than fight my way out, I choose
to get my fleet back by agreeing to work for

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.280
the casino owner.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.690
Pretty often you'll find yourself in a situation
where you need to engage in combat. Combat

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.640
is the core of Flotilla's gameplay.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.990
The battlefield is three dimensional and can
be confusing to navigate at first, but the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.190
inclusion of smartly designed place markers
makes spacial comprehension a bit easier.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.851
Combat takes place in simultaneous 30-second
turns. You give orders to each of the ships

00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:16.840
in your fleet. First you choose one of three
maneuvers to perform: either a standard move

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.330
and attack, an evasive maneuver that sacrifices
firing rate for speed, or a focus fire mode

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.360
that does the opposite.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.610
Once you've chosen your maneuver, you give
your ship orders to move. First you tell it

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.460
where to go along the horizontal plane, on
the vertical plane, and then give it a rotation

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.530
order. After selecting your target and giving
orders to your other ships, it's time to advance

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.580
the next 30 seconds of combat.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.100
[pause]

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.520
The combat plays out to serene classical music
in a nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey. This part

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.640
of the game is both enjoyable and tense, as
you wait on edge to see if you've managed

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.140
to correctly anticipate your opponent's next
move.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.210
Something that makes Flotilla stand out among
other games is its attention to detail. Sometimes

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.260
I'll zoom in on a missile just as it's about
to hit a ship only to watch it bounce off

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.760
the armor with a satisfying "thud."

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.130
Combat itself is largely a matter of flanking
enemies to hit their weak spots while simultaneously

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.489
hiding your own. It's simple but interesting.
When you combine the flanking-based combat

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.010
with classical music, battles start to feel
more like ballet with space ships.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.731
You know what? "Ballet with space ships" pretty
much summarizes why I like Flotilla, and why

00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:47.090
you need to play it. See you next time.
