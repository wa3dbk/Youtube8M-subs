00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.280
Ohhh.... these damn blackheads!

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.520
Of the several elements that can mar the beauty of your face, 
blackheads, also known as comedones, top the list.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.360
A comedo is caused by a combination of excess 
sebum and build-up of dirt and dead skin cells.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.120
These bumps are yellow or black, with a mass of skin debris covering the opening.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.700
If left untreated, they spur acne breakouts.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.780
Blackheads can be attributed to various reasons,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.180
including hormonal changes which is more common in teenagers

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.140
excessive use of cosmetics and environmental factors.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.840
Blackheads generally appear on the nose, forehead, chin, cheeks, or neck.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.860
Interestingly, these bumps appear dark not because of dirt but because of oxidization

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.480
which happens when the clogged pores are exposed to air.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.320
Now you can get rid of your blackheads by using 
some simple home remedies. So, let's get started.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.540
Add 2 teaspoons of baking soda.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.740
Mix them to make a paste.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.120

Apply this on your face and 
 wash it off after 15 minutes.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.680

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.040

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.460
To soften and open the pores, take facial steam

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.120
