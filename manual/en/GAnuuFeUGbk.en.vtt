00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:28.866
I'm wearing a sweater from Ralph Lauren today.

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:32.232
The flag on this top is cute so I like it.

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:39.423
I'm wearing a pair of Doctor Martens 8 hole boots.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:11.736
OK now we will start dressing up Sacchon-san, using clothes at PIN NAP.

00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:16.446
Wow~! I think you will look really different!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.469
Wow, awesome!

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:39.565
It's cute though.

00:01:39.803 --> 00:01:41.200
It's got a clown on it.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:44.810
Wow, he looks so bad, doesn't he?

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.270
What's on the front?

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.980
Yeah he still looks like a bad guy.

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:11.050
It's cute and beautiful!

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:13.070
It's sparkling!

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:23.600
It's all done!

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.740
Can I take a peek?

00:02:26.504 --> 00:02:27.300
Here it is.

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:30.080
Wow, you look great in the outfit!

00:02:30.704 --> 00:02:31.950
She looks so pretty!

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:33.420
Are we ready?

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:38.460
Wow~!

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.630
It's awesome to try something new!

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:43.860
You look gorgeous!

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:45.570
I'm very glad!

00:02:45.716 --> 00:02:47.550
Yeah it went really well!

00:03:01.608 --> 00:03:03.310
How are you feeling in your new outfit!

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:07.050
I love it! These clothes are great! I feel like I've become someone new!

00:03:07.305 --> 00:03:09.110
Yeah these clothes look great on you!

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:11.480
She looks great, right?

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:15.060
It's my first time to wear this kind of jacket with many patterns.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.590
Is that right?

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:20.900
Please wear more of these. This might be easy to try on.

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:22.670
You are showing your belly button.

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:26.240
This is something that you would do, right?

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.640
Yeah this is how I dress up normally.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.450
So cute! Do you like it?

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:34.790
Yep I'm happy!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.070
I'm happy too!

00:03:36.317 --> 00:03:38.250
Thank you so much!

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:46.590

Talking Torso!

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.320
We are the SP.

00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:28.060
Una has asked us to look after this PIN NAP store.

00:04:29.427 --> 00:04:33.600
This store has violated the regulations since they've got so many cute clothes.

00:04:34.104 --> 00:04:38.310
They are not guilty so we have to make sure that they are ok.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.780
This store is just selling cute clothes.

00:04:42.128 --> 00:04:44.480
On behalf on our friend Una.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.550
Yes on behalf of Una

00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:50.900
We will keep guarding this store.

00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:53.950
There are many people around here.

00:04:54.783 --> 00:04:56.590
The enemy must have sent them over here.

00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:03.870
We have to be very careful. We don't 
 know when they will attack PIN NAP.

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.770
We have to be focused on every movement that they make.

00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:10.210
Oh someone is walking toward us!

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:12.210
Stand on guard, everyone!

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:15.770
Are you all set? Wow, that's a human!

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.220
Yes I'm all set to go! I'm ready to fire my gun!

00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:24.130
Wow they are coming to us. Quickly prepare for a bomb! Hurry up!

00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.360
Prepare for a bomb! 

00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:26.210
Fire it! Hurry up!

00:05:26.386 --> 00:05:27.420
Not quick enough!

00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:29.290
Oh no PIN NAP.. PIN NAP..!

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:30.460
All the lives on the earth.

00:05:30.632 --> 00:05:32.700
They will be destroyed..
