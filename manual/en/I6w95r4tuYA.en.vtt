00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.780
Hello everyone!

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.930
The most exciting and busy time of the year has come:

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.508
the pre-New Year hustle and buying presents for relatives and friends.

00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:11.028
However, those who still believe in Santa Claus have nothing to do with it.

00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:14.548
These people can wait for Santa who’ll bring them

00:00:14.857 --> 00:00:16.651
a holder for a camera, for example.

00:00:17.097 --> 00:00:18.994
Or… What else have we got?

00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:22.925
We’ve got excellent radio-controlled tanks.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.497
They can roll and rotate their turret.

00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:26.914
They roll!

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:28.891
Everything’s OK, everything’s good.

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:30.000
They can shoot!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
By the way, this bag is full of exclusive goods made by our partners under the Wargaming licence.

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.662
And here’s another holiday wonder—a gift-edition.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.451
Inside, you will find a bonus code

00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:49.165
as well as collectable tank and many other pleasant things.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.508
Since we talk about pleasant little things,

00:00:51.508 --> 00:00:54.194
I have this nice thermal mug with the achievement on it.

00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:57.531
There are also ceramic ones. Not only for tankers, but also for pilots.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.325
Another excellent gift is these key fobs in the shape of tanks that can easily transform into a 8 GM USB flash drive.

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:09.965
that can easily transform into a 8 GM USB flash drive.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:13.268
There’s another super key fob with erm…

00:01:15.828 --> 00:01:21.428
There’re also these nice key fobs with awards from the game and cool tankers.

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:28.377
Nice backpack! Do you have this in a smaller size?

00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:29.988
Here are a couple of them.

00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:31.062
What’ve you got there?

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.160
There?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.857
This is a dream of every schoolboy, take a look.

00:01:35.257 --> 00:01:36.091
What is this?

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:39.108
Is this a PEN CASE WITH PLANES?

00:01:39.108 --> 00:01:40.148
What else do you have?

00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:43.200
Colored pencils!!!

00:01:43.497 --> 00:01:45.805
Pen cases with tanks and planes!

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.645
Colored pencils and notepads!

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:54.845
And if you or your friends want something new in the game

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:56.480
 but still want to play tanks,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.171
we recommend a card game—World of Tanks: Rush—and an addition to it.

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:06.434
160-, 300-, and 1000-piece puzzles will help you relieve your stress.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.960
Here are some excellent gifts for those

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.588
whose moms always ask to wear headwear.

00:02:15.588 --> 00:02:19.988
If someone want to renew their tank wardrobe, we’ve got sweatshirts, T-shirts,

00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:21.611
 and many more T-shirts!

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.342
Look what I have! Awesome! Strasses, stresses!

00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:27.245
Wow, cool! This is just cool! A flavor of the season!

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:29.462
Look, even for little kids!

00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:31.634
Here are sweatshirts with clans.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.588
In such cases, I usually take everything.

00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:35.794
Take it.

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:38.685
Just take and leave.

00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:40.514
Good. Now go.

00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:43.828
Took everything.

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:49.417
Does your gadget need someone to wear?

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:50.868
У нас есть чехлы.

00:02:51.268 --> 00:02:54.502
If you want a gift of a bigger size—no problem!

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:57.634
We have…

00:02:59.565 --> 00:03:00.800
Computer cases, for example.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.217
Every festive table, even a computer desk, a desk of every tanker, should have…

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.062
Should have a mouse mat.

00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:13.074
Headphones.

00:03:13.074 --> 00:03:14.320
And a mouse.

00:03:14.857 --> 00:03:16.434
Yes, it should be there.

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:22.000
And if you buy a mouse or headphones, you’ll receive the exclusive tank.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.062
The 16 and 32 GB KV-1 key fobs are still among player favorite gifts.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.428
There are more smash hits! They are German and Soviet gift collections.

00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:38.902
There are a book, a mouse mat, a bonus-code, and more.

00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:40.960
This will also be a hit.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:46.640
Hahaha. What will be a hit? We’ll know after this commercial break.

00:03:47.657 --> 00:03:49.497
Here are the latest products from our partners.

00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:54.228
The IS-7 and Löwe metal tank models in 1:72 scale.

00:03:54.422 --> 00:03:56.697
These ones for true fans of combat vehicles.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.811
If you don’t know what gift your tanker wants,

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.537
remember that a book is the best gift for all times.

00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:11.988
He will be surely glad with this nice latest gift edition containing books

00:04:11.988 --> 00:04:15.417
 and a bonus-code for the Type 62.

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:17.302
Yes, he’ll be pleased. Or what?

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.485
And don’t forget to enjoy yourself and your near and dear with little pleasant things.

00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:23.668
Provided you’ve behaved yourself well this year.

00:04:23.668 --> 00:04:24.617
And you have.

00:04:24.617 --> 00:04:28.548

Happy New Year!

00:04:34.937 --> 00:04:35.828
Bye-bye!

00:04:39.222 --> 00:04:41.565
Awesome!

00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:45.668
Yeaaah!

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.411
A book!

00:04:52.662 --> 00:04:54.297
Am I saying it right here?

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:57.714
I'm starting!
