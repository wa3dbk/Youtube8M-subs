Hello everyone! Welcome back to my channel! My name is A-Ri!

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.840
Shall we make a fun cookie today?

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.620
What goes best with cookies? MILK!

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:18.620
Today I’m going to make a cookie and a cup filled with milk that can be enjoyed altogether! It’s called a Cookie Shot!

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.620
There’s a famous patissiere named Dominique Ansel who invented this delicious creation.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.320
It’s huge in New York right now.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.680
So let’s begin making this awesome Cookie Shot!

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.920
Room temp butter

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.060
Sugar

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.940
Soft flour

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.320
Vanilla extract

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.640
Salt

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.160
Egg yolk

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.600
Chocolate chips.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.100
If you want to make the cookie sweeter, add 10 – 20 grams more of chocolate chips.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.980
Whip the butter lightly to losen it up.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.540
Add sugar in two portions as you continue to whip the butter.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.040
Sugar again!

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.360
When the sugar is nicely mixed and you can’t hear it mix anymore, then you add the egg yolk.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.180
Add one table spoonful of vanilla extract.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.540
Also add in a pinch of salt.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.780
Now add in sifted soft flour.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.000
After adding in the sifted soft flour, use a spatula to mix it softly as if you were cutting it.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.860
Once you can’t see the plain flour anymore, add in the chocolate chips.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.480
Prepare a plastic bag and add the cookie dough to it.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.340
Fold the dough so it sticks well together.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.460
It would be nice if it was easy to get a mold with a tall cylindrical shape, but unfortunately it’s not easy to find in Korea.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.340
It’s OK though, we shall still try to make it!

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.560
I used a paper cup instead. The directions are here!

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.040
If you roll it up it becomes a cup like such.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.420
Once you form the cup, you can stick the dough to it to form the cup shape.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.180
Staple the others just like this one.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:46.840
This is completed but since we used staples, it could be unsanitary. So that’s why it’s probably a good idea to add parchment paper on the inside.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.720
After washing your hands, the dough might stick to your hands, so sprinkle some dusting flour on to your board.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.000
Then break off a small piece of the dough and roll to a thickness of about 0.5 cm.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.640
There’s no bottom! It’s OK! We’ll do the same for the bottom.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.640
Done!

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.520
We have completed the shape of the cup.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.420
We’re going to coat the insides of the cup, so don’t worry if it’s uneven.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.540
Mine is a mess too :(

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.320
Now the most important part.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:23.180
If you bake it just as it is, the shape will melt in the oven and you won’t have a cup when you’re done. The solution!? Ah ha! A-Ri’s tip! Add some foil into the center of the cup to retain its shape!

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:38.640
If you use only foil to fill in the center, it’s quite a waste of foil, so just one of the left over cups and just wrap that in foil! (another one of A-Ri’s super-duper tips!)

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:59.020
Once you’re completed all that, as we all know, it’s best to let the dough chill in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes to ensure it tastes awesome!

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.360
After chilling it in the fridge for a half hour, it’s time to bake it!

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.000
Once you let it cool down after baking, it’s time to remove the paper cup.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.600
Use a knife. It’ll make your life so much easier :)

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.900
Now it’s time to coat the center of the cup with chocolate.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.060
Let it sit until the chocolate has hardened.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.760
Now that the chocolate has hardened, it’s time to pour in some milk!

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.560
Cheers!!

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.700
I’ve never had a cookie like this!

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.700
This is awesome!

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.560
I highly recommend this!
