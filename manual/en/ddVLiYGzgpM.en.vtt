[DANCE MUSIC]

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:14.450
NAPOLEON DUMO: So we're here at
the Fly Girl auditions for

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.060
In Living Color.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.270
It's coming back, and
we're super excited.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.270
ALLISON HOLKER: Fly Girls
were the best of.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.250
They were the best dancers, the
most technical, the most

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.970
fun to watch, the
best looking.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.510
They took care of themselves.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.880
They were the whole package.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.110
BRI TARLETON: A Fly Girl
is for sure an icon.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.760
It's like something that little
girls can look up to,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.700
like, I want to be them.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.520
ANGELICA GINN: Yeah,
a role model.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.720
BRI TARLETON: I used to look
up to the Fly Girls

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.580
like, oh, one day.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.990
ANGELICA GINN: Yes.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.420
BRI TARLETON: So even
to be here is like--

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.320
ANGELICA GINN: A big deal.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.220
BRI TARLETON: Thank you!

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.520
COMFORT FEDOKE: I always wanted
to be a Fly Girl.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.130
So seeing the girls just
get down, it was '90s.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.870
I'm a big '90s head.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.140
So it was such an amazing thing
to see dancers actually

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.330
come up and be the upfront
of something.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.660
NAPOLEON DUMO: There's like
600 girls here, and it's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.980
just-- we didn't expect 600
girls to show up, and 600

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.890
really amazing dancers.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.950
ALLISON HOLKER: All of
them are incredible.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.360
All of them are so unique in
every way-- their styles,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.110
their looks, their
dancing ability.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.620
NAPOLEON DUMO: We're going
to try to cut those 600

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.720
down to about 100.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.100
From there, cut it down to
about 20, and figure from

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.530
there the last 5.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.170
BRI TARLETON: Tabitha and
Napoleon are the best people

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.010
to do this.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.240
I mean, it's exciting even to
be in the room with them and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.455
all these amazing dancers.

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:16.890
ANGELICA GINN: Sweatin'
and stuff.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.530
BRI TARLETON: They're not just
fun entertainers with their

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.330
choreography, but
they're smart.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.940
So they know how to take each
individual dancer and showcase

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.795
them very well.

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:27.530
So I think they're going to add
a whole new brand to In

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.230
Living Color with
the Fly Girls.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.000
NAPOLEON DUMO: We're trying to
give a routine that can show

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.790
the person off.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.830
So I didn't want all the hip hop
dancers to look the best,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.250
or all the jazz dancers to
look the best, or all the

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.150
tricksters to look the best.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.320
So we tried to gear it so that
everyone can look good doing

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.800
it if they do the movement
correctly.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.260
CINDY MINOWA: Their
routine is--

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.780
I think it's amazing.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.010
I have a lot of fun doing.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.195
And a lot of girls are having
fun outside doing it.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:52.790
So at first they're like,
oh, it's really simple.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.020
It's easy stuff.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.860
And it's actually pretty
intricate.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.730
And I love it.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.990
KENNA WRIGHT: I just finished
auditioning for Napoleon and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.200
Tabitha's Fly Girl audition.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.050
It was amazing.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.390
Amazing choreography, amazing
energy, and just to be

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.539
surrounded by such wonderful and
talented dancers is just

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.419
an honor for me.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.160
NAPOLEON DUMO: We're not
looking to recreate the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.500
original Fly Girls.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.890
We're looking for
new Fly Girls.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.060
We're looking for characters
and personalities.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.070
We want all different
ethnic backgrounds.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.200
Whoever comes out as the best
personality and the best

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.210
character, that's really what
we're trying to accomplish and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.230
trying to hire.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.980
COMFORT FEDOKE: To know that
from In Living Color there

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.820
became the JLo, and there became
the Laurieann Gibson,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.320
like there was just so many
people that came from that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.320
show and look where they
are now today.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.190
There have been so many legends
that have gone on to

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.990
really make their mark
on the world and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.120
started with this show.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.830
So to be walking in their
footsteps would be a dream and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.800
just completely out
of this world.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.810
NAPOLEON DUMO: Napoleon Dumo.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.550
Keep your eyes out for
In Living Color and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.800
the amazing Fly Girls.
