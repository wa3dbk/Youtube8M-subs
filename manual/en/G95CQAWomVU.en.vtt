00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.720
-Hi, Jeremy. How are you?
-Fine, and you?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.360
-Hi, Cédric.
-How are you?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.000
-You seem to know each other well…
-Quite so!

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.960
The big difference is I've got a poster of him
in my bedroom, at my parents'.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.640
I see!

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.600
I'm not sure the opposite is true!

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.640
Where to?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.800
-To Roland Garros, I have to practice.
-Fine!

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.600
-We played together, remember?
-Yes.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.360
I even remember doing the ballboy
for Mister Cédric Pioline !

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.240
-No!
-Sure!

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.760
Davis Cup in Pau!

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.320
I remember a training session
where none of the balls were inside the court,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.160
so he smashed his racket.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.480
We had stress picking up the balls
because we could feel he was nervous!

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.400
What about playing a game of mini-Roland together?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.800
Of mini-Roland?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.400
-I'm wearing shoes for clay…
-And I'm wearing ones for grass!

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.880
Wow!

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.600
No warm-up, let's go!

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.800
1-0.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.600
-One all.
-Last point.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.800
Ready?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
Come on, Jérémy, you can do it!

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.320
-I won!
-Congratulations!

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.400
Talking about victory, where would you put

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.320
the trophy if you won the tournament?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.400
I'd play mini-Roland with Cédric again!

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.000
We have arrived.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.200
What about doing a little selfie
together before you leave? Here we are…

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.640
-Come on!
-Yes!
