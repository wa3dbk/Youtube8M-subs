00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.839
My name is Francisco Gomes. I'm the
Global Aquaculture Manager here at Novus and

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.839
I've been working in aquaculture all my
professional life.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:20.550
[Farm-to-table Nutrition in Aquaculture]

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.839
We have to remember that most of this
planet is water,

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.179
and that we know less about our oceans than
we know about the surface of the

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.069
moon.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.899
It is a natural consequence that we
move into the oceans, that we move into

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.910
these immense spaces of resources,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.280
but in the way that we can actually farm
them, we have to realize that fisheries is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.440
the last, collecting activity

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.410
from, industrially from mankind. People no
longer hunt for food

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.050
except for small pockets. We take 
around 100 million metric tons

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.890
of fish every year from the ocean.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.120
This is an unsustainable amount. The
question is how can we help the oceans

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.630
give us better, but not from a predatory 
perspective, but from a farming

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.960
perspective.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.180
Conversely, many of the bodies of water
that we previously thought were unusable

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.810
for mankind are now becoming a source of
of food for, for people. We're talking

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.180
about the lakes, reservoirs that, that have
very little fish production could not

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.850
sustain local populations and now are being
actively used for producing fish.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.490
There is a lot of bad examples about the
mangrove shrimp, and now we're good, very

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.810
productive ecosystem generated so little
output it was so ill exploited

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.260
by aquaculture.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.950
We recognize that example as being
negative. We think that

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.889
we have to be optimistic about the
future and look at the technologies like

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:51.890
biofloc culture and

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.030
intensification of closed recirculation,
recirculated closed systems for shrimp

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.330
culture.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.550
I personally worked in mangrove shrimp
culture. I can attest that not everything

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.350
that is out there is bad,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.010
but, uh, uh

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.500
we are certainly going to -- as a whole -- 
aquaculture is going to solve those issues

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.280
for the future.
